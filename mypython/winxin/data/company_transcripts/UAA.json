(NYSE:UA) Q3 2016 Earnings Call October 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Carrie Gillard - Under Armour, Inc.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Analysts", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Erinn E.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Carrie Gillard, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am please go ahead.", "Carrie Gillard - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's third quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the risk factor section of our filings with the SEC.

We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information in our earnings release and in the electronic version of portions of the script from today's call, both of which are available our website at uabiz.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Chip Molloy, our CFO, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter and provide an update for our 2016 and longer-term outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Chip, along with our Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Dave Bergman, will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m.", "Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. We are a growth company. And with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter-after-quarter.", "Our financial results are an incredible accomplishment for any brand and something that we believe separates us from others in our business. Today, I'd like to start by giving some perspective on our industry and articulate what that means for Under Armour in this moment in time.", "I believe we operate in a truly resilient industry. The athletic apparel and footwear business and in broader-context sports has been one of the most dynamic and strongest growing industries in our lifetime. As we continue to immerse ourselves in strategic and long-term growth, we ensure that we will continue to drive in an industry with barriers of entry today that are much higher than 1996 when I drove my old Ford Explorer door-to-door to teams selling T-shirts out of the bag.", "Our industry's collective ability to continue to evolve and make better products that improves an athlete's performance, bring the passion of the sports experience to consumers through our brand storytelling, and to do so with increasing profitability on a global basis is a reflection of what has been an ever-growing demand from consumers that our industry has met with outstanding financial results.", "Those measures of success are not as commonplace in other industries that are sometimes viewed as more stable or secure investments. Today, brands that five years ago were viewed as leaders in our field are in danger of being commoditized, disrupted, or worse, becoming extinct as technology and the way we live changes the way consumers need and value them.", "Our industry of sport is different. Our industry's growth opportunities are global with consumers around the world embracing athletic apparel and footwear at its historic levels. It's not about what people are conveniently referring to as athleisure is the simple truth that consumers all over the world are raising expectations about what to expect from their apparel and footwear and it's a shift that is not going to be reversed. The macro trends favorite not just us but all the premium brands in our business, which is part of the reason I believe our industry will continue to gain new and loyal consumers across the globe.", "In the sports industry, we represent something truly attainable, measurable and sought after by most consumers: to live a better, healthier life. Under Armour's mission is to make all athletes better and we are fortunate enough to be in an industry that will withstand and maintain its relevancy over time because our value proposition enriches consumers' lives and helps them reach their personal health and fitness goals. But our track record of growth and the power of the UA brand provides us with the confidence that we can do more. That track record is one of which we are extremely proud.", "Over the past three years, Under Armour is the only consumer brand in the top 10 fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500, with total revenue increasing 116% through 2015. We have the capacity to lead our industry over the next 10 years by continuing to take our consumer someplace new with our constant flow of product and innovation, while at the same time improving their lives through our Connected Fitness platform, which will pass our 2016 goal of reaching over 190 million registered users by the end of this week.", "For UA, we have punched above our weight for a long time and that has been a central theme of our success. That's not going to change. We compete in an industry that is measured by a few very high standards. We're measured by the innovative product we bring to consumers, by the strength and relevancy of our brand, by the talent of our team, and of course, by the financial results we deliver. While our business is in constant evolution, we know those standards won't change. We also know that we can't look to old models of success that have helped establish some of our competitors in their existing positions.", "So, I want to spend some time this morning talking about how we will operate as the world evolves around us and ensure we are investing to continue to drive forward industry leadership on every front. As I've stated numerous times on these calls, footwear and international will be key drivers of our revenue growth.", "Our footwear business went from $239 million in 2012 to approaching $1 billion in revenue this year. And our international revenues grew from $108 million in 2012 to more than $700 million this year. That's clear evidence that our investments in footwear and international have driven strong revenue growth to date and fuels our confidence that we are just getting started in each of these areas.", "I'll talk about our focus there in just a minute, but first I want to talk about the core of our business, North America. We built our brand and our business with the best wholesale partners in the industry and we're incredibly proud of both our growth and our partnerships across the market. There's no doubt that the landscape globally, and certainly in our North American backyard, is shifting.", "As we navigate this dynamic environment, our intention is to continue to evolve and grow in the places that have built our brand, while we simultaneously reach a broader set of consumers through new avenues of distribution. We believe consumers expect excellence at every touchpoint with our brand and you will see us invest to ensure that we drive growth with our long-term partners at the same time that we invest in new distribution through our own direct-to-consumer experiences.", "As we think about the many dimensions of growth for our company, we're incredibly confident in the opportunity we see for our North America business. Consider this, our two largest competitors generated approximately $18 billion in revenue in North America over just the past 12 months. So, while we recognize that our trailing 12 month North American revenues of $3.95 billion is 85% of our business, it is just a fraction of the opportunity that we believe exists for our brand. Whether it's through share gains, market growth, new distribution or sheer brand heat, we know we have tremendous runway in our home market.", "We'll drive growth by the measures you'd expect: innovative product, brand strength and relevance and the best team in the industry to drive market-leading results. A large part of that growth in North America will come from footwear as we firmly believe that we are at a tipping point in terms of opportunities to gain market share. In the back-to-school window of July through September, our overall footwear market share nearly doubled according to industry data.", "So, while we've always understood that the size of the prize in footwear was massive, we knew coming into this year that there were a lot of consumers in the U.S. who didn't know us as a footwear brand. So this summer, we launched our, It Came From Below, Footwear campaign which focused on the importance of footwork as athletes trained. We started with Bryce Harper in baseball and for running we hosted a UA run camp, where we took experienced men and women from urban run crews and put them and their Under Armour footwear to the ultimate test in the world's toughest conditions.", "With the start of the NFL season in early September, we incorporated NFL MVP, Cam Newton with the prince of a thousand enemies spot and the launch of a game on Snapchat with Cam that drove incredible engagement.", "The final piece of our footwear campaign debuts today with the launch of the Curry 3 the TV spot debuts tonight on TNT during opening night of the NBA season combined with our second tour of Asia where we took Stephen to four cities in early September we are continuing to build our relationship with the basketball consumer and driving awareness and UA as a footwear brand by partnering with the two-time NBA MVP.", "So, while Stephen has been a big part of building our footwear story, we're also having success in other areas that are contributing to the growth. The highlight is the number one Football cleat in the market four years running now and continues to showcase our ability to elevate and drive premium footwear in every category we choose to be in. We made our first football cleat in 2006 and since then have changed the look of the entire category while elevating the price. This type of market evolution and positioning in cleated underscores our opportunity in other footwear categories as we gain awareness, credibility, capabilities and scale.", "We are focused on the exploding running market in China and we saw greater success there with the Bandit 2 running shoe. An example of how we are building key footwear platforms that will continue to scale and extend. We are improving our ability to leverage our global assets and help drive business in local markets. And we continue to focus on being a premium brand in footwear with a goal of having more than 50% of our volume in running footwear over $100 by just spring of next year.", "We saw incredible demand for our Slingride product offering during the third quarter. Slingride is our second running shoe utilizing a full knit upper to deliver comfort and fit where you need it. Priced at $100, it did extremely well in the market and we believe there is great opportunity in what knit can mean for Under Armour running.", "So, we'll continue to invest meaningfully in our footwear business with a focus on talent as well as infrastructure that will help improve the profitability in our business as we scale. We believe we are at a moment in time where we can gain share in footwear and we are prepared to make investments that will drive long-term profitable growth.", "That same focus on the long-term opportunity holds true for our investments as we build out our international business. We continue to post strong growth across all our geographies. While our business in EMEA continues to be strong, it's our Greater China market that remains the biggest growth story for our international business.", "Posting revenue in the third quarter equal to the entire first half of the year and firmly on a path to more than double their business from $80 million just a year ago. We are making incredible inroads in China that we believe will drive our position in this critical market.", "With sports and fitness being promoted strongly by the government, we continue to be viewed by the Chinese consumer as the Performance Brand or referred to often as the Professional Brand. Some of the things we're doing in China include focusing on building premium Brand Houses with a controlled retail environment and a sustainable full-priced business model where we have already opened over 100 doors this year. Driving a strong e-commerce channel presence and utilizing an Asia for China and local-for-local model to reduce costs and improve fill-rate and on-time delivery.", "But we are just getting started in China. Much like we are in new markets around the world. We've rolled out e-commerce platforms in four new markets this year including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. And that's after doing the same in 14 new markets in 2015. Bringing our total global e-commerce sites to 30. We're building a global organization for the long-haul, as I said earlier funding these growing international markets may require additional investment in the short-term. However, we believe they are essential to our long-term goal of market leadership.", "In addition to footwear and international, we're making investments in other key growth areas that will contribute and drive our ability to become a bigger and better company. Including; retail, where we're ensuring that we deliver a great presentation of brand wherever our consumer decides to transact. With SAP, we're creating efficiencies in our systems as we continue to grow in scale. In category management, where we are organizing around nine sport categories and executive leadership to create focus and alignment across our business. And finally, merchandising, which enables us to differentiate our product to create unique experiences for our consumers across our points of distribution and now gives us the ability to reach more athletes than ever before.", "The third key where we will continue to overinvest in the near-term is Connected Fitness. We're doing so because we believe strongly that it will prove an important differentiator in our relationship with the consumer. With nearly 190 million registered users in our community, we continue to gather critical information to help us change the way athletes live.", "We firmly believe that going forward, brands without substantive communities will be at a deficit when it comes to building a relationship with our consumer. We are investing in our single view of the consumer through our partnership with SAP as we look to continuously drive a better business as we scale, knowing that much of the benefit will not be seen immediately.", "That said, we expect to see return on these investments starting in the near-term with tools like self-service consumer comparison reporting where we can quickly compare the demographic profiles, workout habits and purchase behavior of any group of consumers. We are growing our analytics capabilities and moving from backward-looking reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics which allow us to establish and drive growth in a more meaningful way.", "We will be able to personalize our e-commerce homepage driving off your geographic profiles, which sport categories are important to you, your exercise, how frequently you exercise, sleep, weight, diet, and the make-up of your household. Going forward, we will continue to dive into the data and leverage the insights to deepen and expand our relationship with athletes as their needs change.", "Our brand continues to evolve and shift with the changing demands and needs of the consumer. And as I said earlier, we are an incredible industry where sports and health and fitness are driving forces in our success.", "Our investments, the ones we have made in the past and we'll continue to make in the years to come, are critical for us to realize the true potential of the UA brand. We are confident we are making the right investments and our track record of investing for growth is exceptional. Our investments are all about expansion of brand, about opening the aperture of what we are capable of and never being satisfied with our past successes.", "So recently I pulled together the top leaders in the company and discussed the strategic growth and direction of Under Armour. We came away with three key areas of focus that I want to share with you today. First, getting big fast. Second, making retail a core competency. And third, getting more shoes on feet. To be clear; get big fast does not mean at all costs, it means prioritizing our growth and making the right decisions for the brand. It means growing the right way.", "As I said earlier, we have succeeded over the past 20 years by consistently punching above our weight and that will not change. But our growth now gives us opportunities to move up in weight class and we find ourselves well-positioned at this moment in time to compete for long-term relationships with athletes, teams and league affiliations that we previously could not justify.", "Now with the flexibility to lock in 10-year to 15-year deals, we can make investments on a global scale that will help drive authenticity, awareness and revenues for our brand. It is not going to be easy. The mix of our business is evolving and so must we, which is why making retail a core competency is critical to our future success. We'll do that by answering the call to consumer who is asking us to give them more in the place that they expect to find our product. We are no longer just a North American apparel company. We are a retail company across multiple consumer touch points and we'll look to be best-in-class and when we know how to be a great retailer, we can leverage that expertise to help us be a better wholesale partner and therefore continue to elevate and meet our consumer where and how they want to engage with us.", "So to summarize where this nets out, both international and footwear are growing faster in the near-term than we had originally planned; and as a result, we remain confident in reaching our 2018 revenue target of $7.5 billion.", "While this mix shift will create margin pressure, we have a significant opportunity to offset the sales mix impact by continuing to improve our footwear product margins over time and we will. But the market share opportunity cannot wait. We will remain focused on getting more shoes on feet, because we see footwear being as big, if not bigger than apparel one day. And as we drive footwear revenue, the dynamics of the business do change, but that's a good thing because we are truly just getting started in footwear.", "So before I pass to Chip, I just want to reiterate my confidence in the future of our industry and more specifically how Under Armour with the right investment and incredible brand momentum will continue to lead and outpace the competition.", "As I said during my opening, I believe we operate in a resilient industry with strong competitors who have built global businesses over the course of many years. And while their sheer size poses consistent challenges for us, and challenges we have consistently met and beaten, we believe that the monumental shift that is taking place in both the manufacturing of shoes and apparel and the way consumers buy our products is leveling the playing field and will enable us to build a bigger and better global brand.", "We've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time. 26 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. During that stretch, we've established a culture of growth that equips us for this next chapter in our story. And today, we are reiterating our target of $7.5 billion in revenue for 2018. Our challenge is that we need to continue investing on multiple fronts, in categories, geographies, and the talent and infrastructure required to capture those growth opportunities and that's why the dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy.", "In the short-term, these investments will impact our operating income growth, which Chip will walk you through in a moment. We understand that the path to industry leadership grows more complex as we expand in categories, channels and geographies. And I am confident we will remain the market leader in growth by delivering innovation at every touchpoint a consumer has with our brand.", "Thank you. And now, I'll pass it over to Chip.", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time on reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year.", "Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 22% to $1.47 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 23% compared with the prior-year's period. Our ability to deliver another quarter of consistent growth is a direct result of continued investments we have made in the business to meet consumer expectations through categories, channels, and geographies.", "As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the North American retail landscape, we remain focused on solving problems for athletes all over the world and meeting the consumer with premium compelling product wherever they are interacting with our brand.", "During the third quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 19% to $1.01 billion. Our direct-to-consumer revenues grew 29% to $408 million, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the quarter. During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 21% to $29 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 40% to $20 million.", "On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 18% to $1.02 billion compared to $866 million in the prior year's quarter, led by consistent growth in our sport categories, including men's training, women's training, golf and team sports.", "Third quarter footwear revenues increased 42% to $279 million from $196 million in the prior year's quarter. Within running, we saw strong global demand for the brand, led by two of our new $100 price-point product offerings, the Bandit 2 and Slingride, showcasing our continued focus and investment in this key category of long-term growth. In basketball, the Curry signature line continues to drive strong growth for the Under Armour brand.", "Our accessories revenues during the third quarter increased 18% to $122 million from $104 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by bags and headwear. On a regional basis, North American revenues in the third quarter increased 16% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.06 billion during the same period last year.", "Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 162 company-owned stores, comprised of 145 factory stores and 17 Brand House stores. With the opening of three new Brand Houses in the quarter, including Philadelphia, New York City World Trade Center and Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to invest in building and creating the best premium retail expression of our brand.", "International revenues increased 74% to $226 million in the third quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenues increased 80%. Within our international wholesale channel, the store count at the end of the quarter included 282 partner stores. Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our company-owned international store count at the end of the quarter included 63 stores, comprised of 32 Factory Houses and 31 Brand House stores.", "Looking at our international regions, starting with EMEA, we continue to post strong growth in the region as we expand our presence with key wholesale partners and distributors while building out our direct-to-consumer business. In the Asia-Pacific region, our premium performance brand strategy continues to resonate with the consumer driving strong growth in the quarter.", "As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in basketball led by the Stephen Curry signature line and believe we are well positioned to capitalize and scale the business in our fastest-growing region. And in Latin America, we drove incredible brand awareness in the region and around the globe with the strong performances of our Olympic athletes. We remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity of this region as we continue to build and expand our distribution.", "Moving on to margins, third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 47.5% compared to 48.8% in the prior year's period. The following items contributed the majority of the margin contraction this quarter: first, liquidations negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year; second, product margins negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product mix, higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement in product input cost; and finally, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.", "In the quarter, gross margin declined more than planned, driven predominantly by higher-than-expected promotions both the volume and rate of liquidations and foreign exchange rates. Despite liquidations having been a headwind on margin rates for most of this year, we now believe that our inventory position is healthier and that liquidation should not have the same negative impact moving forward.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20% to $499 million, compared to $416 million during the third quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses both retail and e-commerce along with the infrastructure and people necessary to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport-category management.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were less than planned in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation and the timing of marketing activations. A portion of the expected marketing spend shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to better align with key initiatives including the launch of Curry 3 that Kevin mentioned earlier.", "Operating income for the third quarter increased 16% to $199 million compared with $171 million in the prior year period. Interest expense for the third quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $1 million in the current year versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. In addition, the tax rate in the third quarter was 32.6% compared to 38.8% in the prior year, largely due to improved international profitability in the current-year period and a tax benefit related to our prior-year acquisitions.", "Our third quarter net income increased 28% to $128 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period. On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $180 million compared with $159 million at September 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 12% to $971 million compared to $867 million, while total debt increased to $1.07 billion as compared to $902 million.", "Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was $73 million for the third quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year's period. We now expect to spend approximately $450 million for the full-year, including investments in our global offices around the world including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global direct-to-consumer.", "Now, moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect full-year 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%. And operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%.", "Gross margins for the full-year are expected to decline approximately 80 basis points compared to last year driven by the same factors that we have experienced through the year. Based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is now expected to grow approximately 26%, as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success.", "Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million in 2016. In addition, we now expect a full-year tax rate of approximately 35.5% and fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million.", "I would also like to provide additional color on the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20%. We believe the strength of our brand and increased breadth of head-to-toe product offerings position us for another quarter of strong growth in what has been a challenging North American retail environment. With strong momentum in footwear and international, we remain focused on delivering key products and assortments for the holiday season.", "Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat versus prior year. Within SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of certain marketing activations along with continued investment in long-term growth opportunities like Connected Fitness, international and direct-to-consumer will drive the growth in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $186 million to $191 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% over the prior year.", "Before we turn it over to Q&A, we'd like to briefly discuss our long-term outlook and associated guidance for next year. At our 2015 Investor Day, we announced our goals of achieving $7.5 billion of revenues and $800 million of operating income by 2018. We are on track to achieve our 2018 revenue goal of $7.5 billion and expect to grow full-year revenues consistently in the low 20%s in both 2017 and 2018. At the same time, we expect annual operating income growth in the mid-teens each of the next two years as we focus on investing to get big fast.", "As Kevin highlighted earlier, the landscape for our business and our industry continues to evolve and in a fast-paced world we must be willing to adapt make game-time decisions and drive our brand forward. North America apparel growth is slowing across the industry. While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected from our Investor Day in 2015. This is a moment in time. We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits, but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates, while gaining both share and scale. Growth, share and scale are the priorities for our brand.", "That said, we will invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster such as footwear, direct-to-consumer and international as well as more aggressively enter sport fashion like UAS and the much-broader sports lifestyle category.", "In footwear, that means doubling down on creating great product through innovation and design, scaling and extending our pinnacle footwear franchises and investing in the complete market strategy from merchandising to in-store marketing.", "In direct-to-consumer, we are driving investment in mobile, the optimization of the Factory House store footprint and building our premium Brand House expressions to help us drive market share.", "International growth includes being more aggressive in key markets where we are gaining significant awareness such as Asia. In the sports lifestyle category, we are accelerating investment in the people necessary to design relevant and brand-right product. And finally, we will continue to make key investments in assets that promote the brand.", "Beyond 2018, we believe we have opportunities across categories, channels and geographies to consistently deliver superior revenue growth relative to our industry. We also believe that as we approach $10 billion in revenues, the scale it provides along with the investments we have made in people, infrastructure and systems will begin to pay off in the form of increasing operating margin rates.", "As Kevin stated earlier, we've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time. The dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy that will enable us to build a company as big as our brand.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions.", "We ask that you limit your questions to two per person, so we can get to as many of you as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. You line is now open.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Hey, Michael.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Kevin, let me \u2013 I'm going to start with a question for you Kevin. Can you just help us better understand within the context of the longer-term guidance, why you don't think you'll be able to hit the $800 million in operating profit income, and maybe what has changed that gives you confidence in hitting the $7.5 billion in revenues, wow, but not the $800 million in operating income?", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you, Michael, and this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to craft this for you.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Sure.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "So, as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as our brand. We've had our eye on $10 billion, that's the way that we see our company, I think it's the way that people view and judge us with $7.5 billion being our next milestone to be hit by 2018. And again, we want to reiterate that we're on track to hitting that goal. But there are a few factors that led to the decision to modify the operating income for us, since Investor Day September 2015. So what's happening and what's different?", "First of all, in North America, it's a place that provided incredible air cover for our brand for a very long time and I think like we're seeing in a lot of places that, that is modifying, it's changing. In the investments that we've made over the past 11 years as a public company, we've seen that our business, thankfully, has evolved from being strictly a North American wholesale apparel brand into a global sports brand that also has the ability to claim international and footwear as probably two of our largest and greatest opportunities for growth.", "And all the while, I want to be clear, with apparel remaining incredibly profitable and still growing at the tune of 18% in just the third quarter for us. So, there's not an end to the North American apparel story. That continues to march on for us as well. We just have other opportunities that are outpacing some of that growth.", "So some of those opportunities, like footwear and international, they are exceeding what we're putting up, in 24-plus percent topline growth as a company and that change in mix is modifying our gross margin story in the short-term. That means while we're doing better in footwear and international than we thought we were capable of doing, that we're fortunate to have these levers to pull and, frankly, attack as we maintain our industry-leading growth on the top line as well as continue to drive what we can in making the right investments in the right parts of our business.", "So it also changes our distribution. The fact that we've had three bankruptcies that have occurred in just the last 12 months in sporting goods that account for more than $4 billion in lost revenue for the sporting goods industry in North America, and compare that relatively speaking that going all the way back to 2008/2009 there was just $170 million of bankruptcies, of lost revenue in our industry. So we saw something pretty big happen that we'd thought about, but it definitely has been eye-opening for us, especially recently.", "We want to be clear, like our demand is still there, like this doesn't mean that the demand for the Under Armour brand has disappeared, but it certainly hasn't reappeared dollar-for-dollar in our immediate distribution. We believe that the opportunity is also still there. We just have to be more thoughtful about how to capture the consumers and their dollars including replacing with our own direct-to-consumer controlled retail as well as expanded distribution by doing things like Kohl's, which will carry the Under Armour product beginning in 2017.", "We also plan to make additional investments in the places where we know that we can win. So right now, that moment in time is a very important message I think for, obviously, our shareholders but, frankly, for our team and our consumer.", "Footwear and international are going to continue to be staples of our investment strategy, because we think the opportunity for us now is to strike and strike hard. And we take the momentum of things like Curry, with what is launching tonight, and I think you'll be pretty excited by what you see and, most importantly, the consumer is going to be pretty excited about what they see.", "We also have opportunities like lifestyle that, as we've talked about before on these calls, represents roughly a third of the revenues of our two largest competitors and today less than 5% of the business for Under Armour. Thirdly, Connected Fitness is continue going to be an area that we'll invest in, where we believe that redefining the expectation the consumer has of a sports brand with our data will give us perspective on our consumer that will be truly unmatched in our industry.", "Another factor that we've seen recently has been the escalation in the price and, frankly, the duration of sports marketing assets. The length of these deals has gone from standard 5-year deals arrangements to now 10 to 15-year deals.", "UCLA, one that we just wrapped up recently this past spring, was the largest collegiate deal in history, but it's a 15-year partnership. And at the same time, we also locked up Cal Berkeley and giving us a true position in California which, frankly, prior to that, we really didn't have.", "If we deem them strategic, the ability that what's happening in the sports marketing as these assets are being wrapped up, it's either act now, or lose them for frankly the mid to long-term. This, of course, does not mean every deal and I want to be clear, is that the shift in operating income for us is not about creating a bigger marketing budget so we can go buy more stuff. It is about truly investing in our brand, our systems, our infrastructure and especially our team.", "I'll give you another example of that in just a minute. So all those things are just some of the tactical but not to be ignored long-term strategic issues, new issues that we're facing since September of 2015. And when you grow a business 20-plus percent a quarter for 6.5 years, it builds a unique profile that we find ourselves today, which means adding $1 billion and growing a year in revenue and it requires significant resources and investment. But I want to be clear, is that the growth remains intact, it just costs more short-term investment dollars to achieve and the belief is that greater efficiency can come later and that the growth that we have over the short-term EPS is a priority for our long-term goal of becoming the number one sports brand in the world.", "And I want to reiterate that, like we are in this for the long haul and the opportunity that we see is to be the best in the world. And that does require investment and we know that people aren't going to like the way it sounds, but this is \u2013 I don't know if there's ever been another model like ours at 6.5 years with the growth that we've seen, particularly in consumer. And so the book isn't written anywhere and if it were, we'd have read it. But this is what we're telling you is that from our purview of 11 years public and what I've seen in our business, that now is the time for us to strike because I think the upside is so much greater on the other side.", "So on a relative basis, we believe the short-term dollars are better spent building our infrastructure, ensuring that we capture that 2018 goal of $7.5 billion, especially once we achieve the scale of a $10 billion growth company, which will be when we can truly begin to leverage our model to optimize expanding gross margins, our SG&A investment and ultimately shareholder value.", "So one of the issues that I just \u2013 I know people notice but I think it's worthy of us to say, that you face as a superior growth company, which Under Armour has always demonstrated its ability to be, is that operating growth of 15% for virtually any S&P or Fortune 500 business would be outstanding. But because our business is growing in the 20%s, a profile that only a very few rare companies in either the S&P or Fortune 500 and frankly not from our industry from either pharma or tech share and where we still expect to deliver more than $0.5 billion of operating income profit in 2017 alone.", "So we're not saying we're losing money. We are moving and marching forward or in growth terms that more than $0.5 billion is more than nearly two times the total revenue we delivered in our IPO year of 2005 proving that our investments in things like footwear, women's, and international have all paid off.", "But at the end of day, look, we believe that by making these investments, the ability for us is to mature into a business as big as our brand. And we want to drive best-in-class profitability as our business hits scale, our growth rates become more measured and we've got the people, distribution, systems and infrastructure to optimize. Today, we have pieces of it, but frankly it's just incomplete and that's why we must continue to invest.", "I want to give some perspective here for a second just on where we are. I mean, Under Armour's \u2013 we got dropped into the sporting brand pond about 20 years ago. And we jumped in and there were a lot of players, 20 players, 30 players or brands as many as you want.", "Today, we're the third-largest brand in the world. We're the second largest brand in North America. And our two largest competitors have more than 20,000 points of distribution each in North America alone compared to just our 11,000, which speaks to just some of the runway that we still have in front of us right here in our own backyard. They are also six times and four times our size respectively.", "So, let me give you a real-time example of what that means. It means in an area like women's footwear where we currently have just six teammates on our women's footwear team based in Portland, who are doing an amazing job for us and is building best-in-class product, our competitors who we get compared to on a one-to-one basis have dozens or even hundreds of people covering the same category. It's our responsibility for our long-term growth objective of being number one in youth, in men's, and of course, women's across all categories to continue to invest to meet that long-term goal.", "So, I want to be clear is that, you know, we have a saying around here, it's called, no loser talk. And it's the last thing we would ever do. And I want our shareholders to know how hard this company fights for every single dollar at the bottom line, but how we're looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it's time for us to invest. We have the best team and we've got the best brands and we expect to continue to grow.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks for all the detail, Kevin. I'll re-queue with my other questions. I appreciate it.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for taking my question.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thank you.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "It seems like product flows into the retail channel and your wholesale channel are changing pretty dramatically, and we've heard from some of your competitors. And it just seems like there's a need for speed out of the supply chain and the sourcing from all the brands. Can you just talk about the change in product flows and how it's going to affect your business going forward?", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "I mean, product flows for us, there's a lot of ways for us to think about it. So first of all, we're seeing a tough story that as we look or think about North America, you've heard a couple of people talk about it.", "And again, it's nothing's going away, but it's definitely been reflective in just some of the bankruptcies and the other things that we've seen recently. The people we're doing business with, I believe are doing very well. They're getting very smart about the way they're managing and running their business. But it's definitely, you know, you're not finding our accounts that are taking big inventory positions and betting on the cold weather. So, those are the things that are leading for us that's requiring us to run and to drive a better business.", "Today, I would define Under Armour as a great brand and as a great brand with a \u2013 but probably a good company. The opportunity we have is things like what we see with some of the speed to manufacturing. Things like recently when we announced our partnership at City Garage here in Baltimore and when we talk about a local-for-local strategy, which means bringing manufacturing back to the United States and again that's not a made in the USA initiative as much as it's an initiative for us about making great product anywhere. It's that the people of America want product made in America, the people of Europe want the same, the people of S\u00e3o Paulo want products from Brazil, so we're going to continue to answer that and look to drive on that answer. But there's a lot of investment on the front end. And the good news is that the sad thing about our industry is that a shirt and a shoe are still made the exact same way they were 100 years ago and we see a massive opportunity for that to improve.", "So some of the things I talked about in my script and my comments was how that we have the ability, I think, to accelerate the speed at which innovation can happen there. Right now to make a single shoe, for instance, it takes upwards of 300 pairs of hands to make a single shoe. So we think there's a lot of room for innovation, we're finding a lot about ourselves and I think that's continuing to move for us as well.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And if I can just sneak one more in. I think longer term, what people see as they see one of your big competitors out in Portland with a mid-teens operating margin, they see one of your other competitors in Germany with a mid-single-digit operating margin, where does Under Armour fit in long-term? What's the true driver of margin expansion long-term? Is it really just following more through by better SG&A leverage, or gross margins and product margins can move higher? What pushes the operating margin longer-term when we think beyond just 2018?", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Hey, John. This is Chip. A couple of things.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey. How are you?", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "As we start to get to $10 billion, there's a couple things that will happen. One, the gross margins, we should start to get expansion on the gross margins and we'll start to get that because we won't be faced with as much of a mix shift that we're faced with today and the improvements we're seeing on the cost side of the house, we are seeing those today and they'll continue; but over time, as we start to gain more and more scale, we'll see that gross margin improvement. And on top of that as we get more into lifestyle, we'll see more gross margin as well. So, once we start to get towards $10 billion we'll see gross margin.", "At the same time, that's when we should really start to be able to leverage our expense structure. We're investing across the world. We're investing in offices, we're investing in IT systems, we're investing in distribution capacity. All of those things are happening today and will continue to happen over the next couple years, but we will start to see that leverage. So, it becomes sort of a perfect storm, once we get to $10 billion and we'll start to see operating income margin expansion. And I think we'll head towards more the premium level versus the other person or the other competitor that you're speaking with.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Best of luck.", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess just on that last point Chip, for you, on the gross margin, the analyst that you talked about, 49% gross margin and now it sounds like you're saying that you need to get kind of bigger scale towards that $10 billion mark to really see that gross margin pick up. I mean, can you just help us think about at least over the next couple of years from a planning horizon perspective how should that gross margin line metric look?", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Yeah, Erinn. Well, first off, in any given quarter there will be noise around liquidations or FX. So that can happen in any given quarter, but over the course of the next couple years, we as a company will probably see flat gross margins. We're going to have mix as a headwind as we continue to grow our footwear at two times to 2.5 times our apparel and accessories business and the disparity between those gross margins creates a mix shift for us.", "At the same time, we're already seeing improvements in our footwear margins and we'll continue to see those improvements. And so net-net, we think we can overcome that mix shift through the improvements we're seeing on the costing side for the next couple of years; but net-net, it will be flat. Then as we start to approach $10 billion as I mentioned earlier, that's when we believe that we will have the scale and we will have a much more significant mix at that time of footwear that you'll start to see an expanding gross margin come $10 billion.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. That helps.", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Erinn, we're also \u2013 I mean, I think it's just good to drive home the point about footwear and the opportunity we see there. So, Under Armour today, we're in the low to mid-30%s when it comes to our footwear gross margin that nets out compared to our competitors which are 10% or roughly 1,000 bps in front of us. And so, we've made great strides in the last couple of years actually taking hundreds of points of gross margin and calling that back and we see great opportunity as well.", "And so there's no secret sauce that someone else has that we don't. It's been time, it's been energy and experience and frankly having just gotten back from a trip from Asia about four weeks or five weeks ago and seeing the investment that our manufacturing partners are making us throughout China but also through Vietnam and the Philippines where you're seeing a lot of these new facilities going up, there is a great belief in a company and a brand like Under Armour that just a couple years ago, I think footwear is important to lay out. Last year, we made 30 million pairs of shoes. 2016, we'll make 40 million pairs of shoes. Obviously, you hear how bullish we are in footwear, so that number is increasing.", "And again, that's impressive, but it still compares to the hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes that are made by our competitors. So as we build scale, this will massively come on board as well it will help with people like Colin Browne, who is our new President of Sourcing, in some of the things that we'll do driving some of these initiatives. So, we see there's great opportunity in gross margin and this is nothing that we're laying back in \u2013 there's no excuse for what we're doing with operating income as it relates to \u2013 or the way that we're attacking gross margin across the board.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just on inventory up 12%, so fairly lean. I mean, do you feel like you have enough inventory if you go into the holiday season? And I think you're still planning for 20% growth in that Q4 and early part of 2017. How should we just think about that at the end of the quarter as well?", "Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.", "Hey, Erinn. It's Chip. We feel like we're in really good shape from an inventory perspective. We did have very large growth rates over the course of late last year and then the early part of this year. So that growth rates come down, but the inventory is in great shape, and the inventory we have, we do have availability in the event that we all hope that it gets cold and it'll be nice and we do have the inventory to supply for that.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. And then just last, Kevin, for you on women's. I didn't hear you talk much on this call on the women's opportunity. Can you just flush out where we're at now and kind of where you see that as you think about your 2018, $7.5 billion goal? Is that still unchanged in terms of the opportunity?", "Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.", "Yeah, completely. So, I want to be clear is that women's remains one of our brightest opportunities for growth in our business. Women's is still growing in the quarter, up 17%, I think 18%. And again that the heart of this is category management. I spoke about it in my prepared remarks and we've done that with women's to specifically call it out and make sure that it gets the emphasis it needs.", "Pam Catlett is leading that. She's an industry vet and has been a complete pro in bringing the pieces together, but there's a lot of pieces to bring together. Probably the best thing I could say is, when you talk about our women's business, we have $1 billion women's brand. It's taken us one heck of a long time to get here, but we're incredibly proud of what that means.", "And but, you know what, I think probably looking at women's through the lens of \u2013 I gave the example about footwear in one of my earlier answers, and we have six people in our women's footwear team. We just built our first Women's Last, last year for the first time and those are the things from an operating income standpoint. I want to say is that when people say you don't have enough \u2013 people dress toe to head. It's the way they start with their shoe, but if the shoe isn't right, if the fit isn't right, if the color isn't right, if we don't have the right team, you know, the reason we didn't build the Women's Last before is because we were focused on the ability that we couldn't afford it.", "And so we're making a lot of those small decisions right now that we truly believe that looking at 2017, 2018, making the investment as unfortunately and fortunately because our growth rate is so great, it creates that drag. But making this right investment in footwear is important.", "So we go back with women is that one thing we think is incredibly important is that the football cleated opportunity and what we're doing being the number one cleat there isn't doing much for the women's category. But the confidence that we're demonstrating in running from our knit products, this is the \u2013 again, this will be the first year in the market that we'll have that Women's Last on people's feet, on women's feet and we also think that as we continue to drive a better product for driving both performance, style, strength and beauty, the focus is we'll have. And so I think we've got a terrific team in place. We are investing in our women's team as well. We think footwear will be one of the catalysts for it, but achieving $1 billion business in women's is a pretty big feat and it's something we're certainly not stopping or satisfied with.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thank you. And best of luck.", "Carrie Gillard - Under Armour, Inc.", "All right. Operator, that's all the time we're going to have today for questions.", "Operator", "Okay. I'd like to turn the call back to Ms. Gillard for closing remarks.", "Carrie Gillard - Under Armour, Inc.", "Thank you all for joining us today on our call.

Please go ahead.", "Alex Pettit", "Thank you, and good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words estimates, intends, expects, plans, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

After the prepared remarks, Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. The Under Armour brand is about leadership. That means leading on the field by working with the world's best athletes to improve performance. It means leading our industry in sell-through, which is evident in our results, not just in this past quarter but over the past year. And it means leading in communicating with our consumer, whether it's a familiar one who plays football or a new one who's getting her exercise on a ski run.", "So we look at our results this past quarter and we see continued steady progress. We have broad-based strength in Apparel. And I want to talk about what was behind that strong growth. But I also want to talk about the opportunities that exist for the Under Armour brand to continue to lead, because I believe those are areas where we are focused in investing and are making progress.", "These opportunities in Footwear, in new geographies and in distribution are critical to our growth over the next several years. These are the opportunities that will enable Under Armour to continue to lead. It will be up to us to execute against those opportunities, whether they are new categories, new sports, new geographies or new ways of reaching our consumer. And it is the criteria by which we will judge our progress.", "But first, I want to discuss our main engine, the growth story that is powering the brand for us in 2010, U.S. Apparel. More important than the fact that we grew our Apparel business 31% this past quarter is the fact the strength was so broad-based. There was strong growth in all of our categories; Men's, Women's and Youth. There was strong growth with our wholesale partners, with each of those three categories, showing 20-plus percent growth. And there is strong growth across all categories in our Direct-to-Consumer business, with Men's, Women's and Youth all growing more than 50% in our own channels. The growth story for Under Armour Apparel is more than just intact; in fact, it's dynamic. In Q1, we continue to drive business at retail, with our core products such as compression, base layer and underwear.", "Our equity with our core consumer continues to grow, and we are benefiting as new, young athletes, the younger brothers and sisters of our core consumer, enter the world of organized sports. They are growing up in homes where Under Armour has been the brand of choice for the athletes in the family, and we are building loyalty because our product performs on the field. And we remain laser-focused on accelerating the Under Armour innovation agenda. It's what we\u2019ve built our brand on and what drives our product teams. That innovation is recently evident in the course short. Our new $45 compression short that was featured at the NFL Combine and will help us extend our leadership position in compression. Our core consumers continue to show their loyalty to Under Armour, and our core apparel is vibrant. We benefit from the fact that with each new season there is a new sport to be played.", "When the baseball and lacrosse fields open up in spring, our consumer reaches for our brand. And when it's time for football, soccer or field hockey, our consumer is reaching for our brand. Those team sports will always be at the center of where our brand lives.", "So with abundant growth opportunities still in front of us, our decision criteria on investments are simple. We will invest to protect what we have and we will invest with a view toward succeeding on a global platform. We will protect our core strength on the American sports field with innovation, great athletes and great stories.", "On a global platform, I think we will look back on 2010 as the year where we made significant strides in bringing our innovation story to new sports and new athletes. The best evidence we saw of that was in this past quarter as Under Armour was introduced to new consumers around the globe with our strong sports marketing presence at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Without question, our work with Lindsey Vonn, U.S. bobsled and freestyle Ski Teams provided a great platform to tell the Under Armour innovation story to a wide range of new consumers on a global basis. Our presence in Vancouver, as well as the Winter X games in Aspen, helped establish our authenticity on the Mountain, and we will continue to build on that equity this year and beyond.", "Creating that foothold for Under Armour as an authentic brand on the Mountain is a great example of how we can focus our resources to effectively grow outside our core. And while our Mountain business is still in its early stages, we are equally excited about the opportunities we see in larger, more diverse categories and geographies. ", "Our Footwear business continues to gain traction among our core consumers. We've had great success establishing ourselves as an authentic and innovative footwear brand on both the football and baseball fields. With new baseball athletes in the Under Armour footwear camp, such as Jonathan Papelbon, Mark Reynolds and Kendry Morales; collegiate assets like Boston College; and new football assets, like first-rounder Dez Bryant, who will be suiting up for the Dallas Cowboys this fall, we continue to invest in both the assets and innovation that the market has come to expect from Under Armour.", "Equally important, we understand the challenges in bringing that same level of leadership and innovation outside of the Cleated business. We continue to invest in our Footwear team to ensure that our strength in on-field footwear will translate into an equal degree of success in categories such as running, training and basketball. Our point of view on footwear for the football and baseball field is solid, and we are 100% focused on bringing that same level of attention to the broader commercial opportunities I just mentioned as well as Women's, Youth and Youth Footwear. ", "Lastly, I want to talk about the Under Armour opportunity in new geographies because I firmly believe that remains our biggest single untapped growth driver. As we saw from our Apparel results this past quarter, we are still in the early stage of growth in the U.S. market. David will provide more color on that in a minute.", "But as we continue to lay pavement and reach new consumers here in the States, we are investing in a meaningful way to clear that first unpaved path for growth outside of our primary market. The way forward for Under Armour to grow outside the U.S. will mirror the growth strategy we have used to make us a near billion-dollar brand here domestically. We will build equity through outstanding performance on-field and do so in the sports that are most relevant for that local consumer. ", "In Europe, we are establishing ourselves as the young athlete\u2019s brand under his or her uniform, with our biggest commercial success in ColdGear. In Japan, where we've been on the ground for more than 10 years now and have wholesale sales approaching USD $100 million, our product strength is more broad-based. The success we have found in Japan is what drives our confidence that the Under Armour brand will translate and that we can win globally when we find the right balance of product, story and, most importantly, team, like we have with our partners at Dome Corp. in Tokyo.", "We're also taking initial steps into China, currently working to understand the consumer and how we need to organize to ensure success. These types of investments, global investments about geography as we develop into a global brand or our product investments, like footwear technology and new categories here in the States, are the ones we are making now so that we will continue to lead.", "We are also especially investing in human capital, in our team, and last week announced that our new Head of Apparel, Henry Stafford, will be joining Under Armour from American Eagle in June. Henry is a strong merchant with broad experience, and he\u2019s also a great example of our ability to attract great young talent that wants to be a part of what is being built here at Under Armour. We are about leadership, leadership with athletes, leadership in sell-through, leadership in communications. We believe our success in a drawing talent to Under Armour is another key metric where we will lead our industry. With our U.S. Apparel business in strong growth mode, we are building the team that will take Under Armour to its place as a multibillion-dollar global brand. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to David.", "David McCreight", "Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to provide some additional detail on our Q1 performance that focuses well on the evidence that we are still in the early stage of our brand's growth here in the U.S.  The first piece of evidence is in our results. In addition to the 31% growth we saw on Apparel this past quarter, we believe it\u2019s even more illustrative to note that on a trailing 12-month basis, our Apparel business was up 19%. And we think the reason for much of that growth can really be summed up in one word: accessibility.", "From a product perspective, we continue to expand accessibility of our brand as our non-compression apparel grows as a percentage of revenues. While compression remains the focus for our brand, and it's still responsible for a large piece of our profitability, we understand that not every athlete needs or wants compression product. What they do want is the level of performance and protection that is built into every Under Armour product. Our significant growth in both loose and fitted apparel is helping to make the Under Armour brand accessible to an even wider audience of athletes. We have successfully shifted our business away from being focused primarily on compression to one that is now doing 2/3 of our business in loose and fitted products. In fact, in Q1 the percentage of business we did in non-compression apparel was the highest in company history. And that was true this quarter for the Men's and Women's categories individually as well.", "So when we look at the runway provided by expanding beyond compression, we believe our ability to grow Apparel business in the U.S. becomes increasingly evident. Loose and fitted product clearly puts us in reach of a much broader base of athletes, and we believe that we have enormous opportunity for long-term market share gain as we enter these new categories of business.", "The second piece of accessibility story lies in the growing power of the Under Armour brand and our ability to enter new sports categories. As Kevin mentioned earlier, there's probably no better example of this working for us than at the Winter Olympics. Given the strong perception of our brand as a great cold-weather product, from the Mountain was a logical place for Under Armour to go. So we went to Vancouver with a complete story; product, communication and athletes. And we were able to break through and further dimensionalize our brand for more athletes. ", "Beyond Mountain, there a number of sport categories where we are still in a nascent stage with big opportunities to gain market share. As we fill out our apparel product offerings in categories such as soccer, basketball and others, we believe we can gain space at retail and drive business for our wholesale partners.", "Again, we are not figuring out which categories we could be in, but more about how we use our brand equity to help put together that total Under Armour story of product, communication and athlete. One area where we feel that complete story has been coming together is our Women's business. Our primary focus for Women's is our teen girl consumer, age 13 to 22, who's playing in organized team sport. We will take our protect-this-house-I-will campaign to this consumer with the lead female athletes, such as Lauren Cheney of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, 200- and 400-meter runner Monica Hargrove and Under Armour's gold medalist and training fanatic, Lindsey Vonn. We will push our Women's messaging towards the web, where we know our core consumer is spending a great deal of time. ", "As Kevin discussed earlier, we are balancing our priorities, driving revenue growth through new products in categories, while remaining intently focused on our core performance business. While we continue to grow in new businesses, we've been also able to devote resources to maintaining our leadership and innovation agenda in performance apparel. The core short in the U.S. bobsled and freestyle skiing uniforms are great examples of us staying true to our mission of making all athletes better. And we continue to bring innovation to our core athletes with our catalyst green performance tops.", "While they are made from recycled plastic bottles, as you would expect from our brand, there is no sacrifice in performance. So the Under Armour athlete doesn't have to settle if they want to be an ecologically-sensitive consumer. This isn't about top-of-the-pyramid product that appeals to a niche customer. It's more about bringing performance to a growing consumer segment that we've not been focused on previously. ", "With our evolving product innovation story, we are able to focus on gaining market share within our existing channels of wholesale distribution. Our core HeatGear, ColdGear and Base Layer products are relevant in almost every account channel where we do business. Beyond that, we are being more sport- and category-specific based on the account in target consumer, with some accounts having a greater mix of soccer and lacrosse and others focused more in golf and running. ", "Also, we're fine-tuning our Women's assortments, where we are growing rapidly with our key and important wholesale partners. And our new fit story gives us opportunity to further tell specific stories around compression, fitted and loose within distinct channels to broaden our appeal to more athletes. Our ability to gain market share within our existing distribution is one strong and important element of our growth story for U.S. apparel. The most immediate opportunity and third piece of the accessibility story is efficiently broadening distribution through web, Factory House and selected geographic expansion here in the U.S. ", "When we look at our 19% growth in Apparel over the past 12 months, we can see how broadening our access to athletes with our discrete Factory House and enhanced web efforts helped us meet consumer demand while continuing to grow with our valuable wholesale business partners. Reaching new Under Armour consumers where they shop is the driving force behind our strategy, and we're very encouraged by our efforts over the past 12 months. We know there is much more opportunity out there to meet growing consumer demand.", "While our primary focus is on growing share within our existing accounts, we are pleased with the activity we've seen in our new limited distribution points. We're also seeing continued strength in our Factory House stores and our Web, and our Factory House plan is to open 16 to 18 doors in 2010, bringing us to a total of approximately 51 to 53 doors at year-end. ", "The last piece of the equation for continued growth in our business is leadership, and we are bringing aboard new leadership for our team. Next week, we will be announcing a new Head of Under Armour's e-commerce business to drive our efforts in that critical area. And as Kevin mentioned, Henry Stafford is joining us to lead our Apparel team. He comes to us from American Eagle, with prior experience at Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. His strong merchandising background and years of experience with our target consumer will help direct our Apparel growth as we move our brand beyond our core strength on the football and baseball fields. He has a great understanding of how performance and innovation has built the Under Armour brand.", "This segment edited by Jenn", "Henry's addition will help to accelerate our strong trajectory of growth as we increase our accessibility to our consumer for further expansion of our offerings. ", "With that, I'd like to now introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Brad Dickerson.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, David. With Kevin and David having taken you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time on our first quarter financial results. ", "Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 15% to $229 million. This strong growth is largely driven by Apparel, which was up 31% to $173 million with growth across the Men's, Women's and Youth Apparel businesses. Direct-to-Consumer, representing approximately 18% of net revenues for the quarter, was up 73%, driven by our Factory House stores and Web business.", "International net revenues increased approximately $6 million to $14 million in the first quarter and represented approximately 6% of revenues. Accessories and Licensing revenues also experienced strong growth in the first quarter and increased 30% and 25%, respectively. Footwear net revenues were down approximately $14 million to $43 million in the first quarter. We've previously indicated Running and Training Footwear revenues were expected to decline in 2010 compared with 2009.", "First quarter gross margins were 46.9% compared with 44.6% in the prior year's quarter. There were several puts and takes impacting gross margin. ", "First, Apparel gross margins were up during the quarter due to a favorable product mix as well as improved costing, accounting for an approximate 130 basis point increase. ", "Second, gross margins benefited from the strong rate of growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer  business, accounting for an approximate 90 basis point increase. ", "Third, decreased returns and reserves accounted for an approximate 85 basis points increase. These items were partially offset by lower gross margins in our Footwear business year-over-year, which accounted for an approximate 75 basis point decrease.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 41% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 40.6% in the prior year's period. Let me take you through the components of SG&A. ", "As a percentage of net revenues, marketing declined to approximately 13.6% of net revenues in the first quarter compared with 16.8% in the prior year as we anniversaried the brand campaign that supported the introduction of our running footwear in the first quarter of 2009. ", "Second, selling costs increased to 8.6% of net revenues from 7.4% in the prior year, primarily associated with the continued expansion of our Factory House stores. ", "Third, product innovation and supply chain costs represented 9.6% of net revenues in the first quarter compared with 8% in the prior year as we made increased investments in personnel associated with the design and sourcing of our expanding Apparel, Accessory and Footwear lines.", "Finally, Corporate Services increased to 9.2% of net revenues compared to 8.4% in the same period of the prior year as we invested in additional corporate personnel and facility expenses to support our growth. ", "Operating income during the first quarter increased 72% to $14 million compared with $8 million in the prior year. Operating margin was 6% compared with 4% in the prior-year quarter. ", "Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 42% compared with 43.8% in the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to decreased losses in our foreign subsidiaries. Based on continued tax-planning strategies, we continue to expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to improve approximately 50 basis points from the 2009 rate of 43.2%.", "Our results in net income in the first quarter rose 81% to $7 million compared with $4 million in the prior-year period. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 75% to $0.14 compared with $0.08 in the prior year. It's important to note that certain costs have been reclassified within our income statement. We believe these reclassifications more closely align with the way we manage our business and will allow us to gain better visibility as we move forward. Please refer to the tables in our first quarter 2010 earnings release for further details.", "Now let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 153% to $166 million compared with $66 million at March 31, 2009. Cash, net of debt, increased $101 million at quarter end to $148 million compared with $47 million at March 31, 2009. We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility.", "Inventory at quarter end decreased 10% year-over-year to $148 million compared to $164 million at March 31, 2009. This improvement in inventory efficiency year-over-year was driven by increased demand for our product and an improved focus on the management of excess inventory through liquidation sales to third parties. We are pleased with our inventory improvements to date. However, as we look ahead we will concentrate on improving our service levels within the wholesale channel in order to better meet consumer demand while also increasing our safety stock in key core programs. We expect this will result in a year-over-year increase in our inventory balance beginning with the second quarter.", "Our investment in capital expenditures in the first quarter was approximately $9 million. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures in 2010 to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million. ", "Now moving on to our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Previously, we provided an outlook of 2010 net revenue growth in the range of $945 million to $960 million, an increase of 10% at 12% over 2009, and 2010 diluted earnings per share to grow in line with net revenue growth. Kevin and Dave have highlighted our first quarter Apparel strength in both the wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer  channels, which we believe will continue to drive our business throughout 2010.", "Based on these results and our improved visibility of the full year, we are raising our outlook. We now expect 2010 annual net revenues in the range of $965 million to $985 million, an increase of 13% to 15% over 2009. We also expect 2010 diluted earnings per share for the full year in the range of $1.05 to $1.07, an increase of 14% to 16% over 2009. ", "Driven by a product mix shift towards Apparel, combined with continued anticipated growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer sales, we continue to believe that gross margins will improve year-over-year in each of the remaining three quarters of 2010.", "We are building a growth platform with large scalable businesses to drive accelerated profitable growth in future years. This requires a balance between investments that will benefit us in the near term and investments that will generate a payoff in a longer-term horizon. The investments we have made and continue to make in our Direct-to-Consumer and Apparel businesses are driving the strong results you see today. In addition, we continue to invest in strategic longer-term initiatives to help drive significant incremental revenues in new geographies and categories, such as Footwear and Accessories. ", "As a result, we continue to believe our SG&A growth rate will exceed our top line growth in 2010, with the largest impact on a percentage basis occurring in the second and third quarters. More specifically, in the selling cost area, we will continue to invest in Direct-to-Consumer, specifically around the continued expansion of our Factory House stores and Web business, as we aim to reach more consumers.", "As David stated earlier, we now anticipate opening a total of 16 to 18 new Factory House stores in 2010. It is important to note the retail business model is different from our traditional wholesale model. Retail delivers higher gross margins but also requires higher SG&A investments. ", "The second area of our investment focus will be on five innovation and supply chain. We will continue to invest in the talent that will bring to market our growing Apparel, Footwear and Accessory lines in 2010, 2011 and beyond.", "Increasing the depth of our design and development talent is critical as we expand our offering of non-compression apparel to drive market share gains in the active Apparel category. Footwear remains an enormous opportunity, and we have achieved early success in football and baseball cleats. We will continue to invest in building the team that can achieve that same success in non-cleated categories, such as running, training and basketball. ", "Beginning in 2011, we will be developing, designing and selling headwear and bags in house. Currently, this is a licensed business. We've been building the Accessories team in anticipation of this transition. This strategy will allow us to integrate stories [ph] across Apparel, Footwear and Accessories, continue to drive innovation in the Accessories line and leverage our operational capabilities and infrastructure to service this business.", "Beyond these strategic investments in the selling and product innovation and supply chain areas, investment in Corporate Services will increase as we support the needs of a growing business. This includes personnel, IT, infrastructure and facilities to support our growth. ", "Finally in 2010, marketing investment is expected to remain in the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues. Based on the timing of certain key initiatives, we expect marketing as a percentage of net revenues to be the highest in the second and third quarters.", "Moving on to the potential impact of foreign currency on our results. During the first quarter of 2010, we recognized a foreign currency loss of $690,000. Our hedging strategy allows us to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. With that said, there is no perfect hedge and risk remains that with future foreign currency fluctuations we could have positive or negative foreign currency impact during the remainder of the year. ", "We are pleased with our results during the first quarter of 2010. However, we have many opportunities to improve operating efficiency, and this will be the focal point for our business as we strive to achieve our long-term targets in 2010 and beyond. ", "At this time, we'd now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one per person so we can get to as many of you as much as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michelle Tan of Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "I was wondering if you could actually give us a little more color on the tailoring that you're doing to your apparel assortments across the different retailers. What level of differentiation are you up to now? How much further do you want to go? And how much of a benefit are you seeing or do you expect to see to sell through in the Apparel product and margins?", "David McCreight", "This is David. As we discussed earlier, we believe that's one of our opportunities to broaden our accessibility, and we think this year we\u2019ve just started to do that. You're starting to see us do this pretty successfully across fit offerings within accounts. And we work very closely with our key wholesale accounts and partners and believe we've made some nice progress on that. You're going to see it across Youth, Men's and Women's. But we still think we\u2019re at the very early stage of the tailoring and see lots of upside.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "So just to clarify, you're doing for fit now. Are you also doing it for sizing and compression versus non-compression? Things like that?", "David McCreight", "Absolutely. The brand was built and continues to be leading compression brand in our space. And we're focused around the athletes and the equity we've captured, and thinking about how we can service more of their athletic occasions, game day, practice and then other events throughout the week.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "Okay. And is there any specific technology that you\u2019ve added to do this? Or is it just more focusing on it for the first time?", "David McCreight", "We look at our technologies in ways that we can improve performance for every product and every under product within the Under Armour brand. This has being primarily through size and through styling, and also fine-tuning the assortments for each account based on the athletes that they serve.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "If you look at the acceleration that you're seeing in Apparel, do you think -- how much of it, if it's possible to think about it this way, could be attributable to the idea of these more appropriate assortments versus restocking or whatever on the part of retailers?", "Kevin Plank", "It's Kevin. What we're seeing the need for Under Armour to take our business to make it more specific to consumers that are shopping in particular accounts. I think you're seeing a much more sophisticated distribution model that we\u2019re bringing in. But in every way, that means continue to highlight our center, which is our key big big-box sporting goods\u2019 guys. And so making sure that we have differentiated product that exist and lives in the stores and highlighting some of our best partners and then differentiating us from some of the channels that we're starting to enter, and where frankly Footwear and some of our new categories is taking us to. But the addition of Harry Stafford is a real reason as to, I think, Under Armour the need for a more sophisticated merchandising plan. Because when you look at between big box and differentiation there, let alone the mall channels and some of our additional distribution, our own stores, our own outlet stores, there's a model that we !", " need people that are thinking and competing on a level, which is much more different than basics versus other basics. And so of course innovation plays a large there, and then just great merchandising. So we're extremely excited to bring Henry on board, and what he\u2019s going to be able to bring from somebody who\u2019s been living that world in the mall for a long time in very competitive set, we're looking to up the game in ways sporting goods has. So we think this is a net-net big win for our retail partners, especially so. We're looking to bring some really exciting product to all them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just expanding upon Michelle's question, what inning are you in as you think about becoming more sophisticated in the distribution on how you're stratifying the assortment? And maybe if you could more specifically talk about the tests you're doing in Bloomingdale's and any further opportunities with Foot Locker?", "Kevin Plank", "It's Kevin. And I believe that we\u2019d probably tell you we're rounding the first inning right now. And there's the opportunity, I think that's what\u2019s evident in our results this quarter from not only 31% in just Apparel growth in the quarter, but really, and David highlighted the 19% over the trailing 12 months. Our business is very strong. There's a consumer demand for our product, and we have -- I think a really obligation is to find the right point at where we can get our product distributed to our consumers. We're not currently hitting all the access our consumer wants our products. So we're still finding an enormous amount of consumer demand. And even in some of the places where we've opened and tested some of these categories, for instance, you mentioned the tests we're doing with Bloomingdale's. Number one, that makes us is a lot better in all of our remaining distribution. Now that's a pretty limited test. It's only in five stores today, and it's Women's only. But it's!", "  something again that's pushing us to places where you haven't seen our brand before. And I think some of the experience we've had, particularly on the Women\u2019s side, which we've identified as one of our largest opportunities for Women's Apparel to some day be larger than our Men's Apparel business, which is our goal and frankly what we're tracking to. And I challenge all of you, if you get a chance, go into sporting goods and take a look at the way that our Women\u2019s product looks. And if you\u2019re remembering the Under Armour brands from Women's perspective in terms of what you saw 12 or 18 months ago, I think you\u2019ll see a much different, much more fresher look. And what we've always found, and what insights continues to tell us today is that she likes us, she wants to shop us, she's just been waiting for Under Armour to give her reason. And so from a fit, from a style, from a color standpoint I think we're really meeting a lot of those expectations. And that's where Henry, whi!", " ch something comes right from his wheelhouse from American Eag!", " le, I th", "ink is going to pick up and hit the ground running, and frankly give a little bit of a different perspective for us on the Apparel side too. And of course that will translate across channels beyond just what potentially Bloomingdale's could be, but of course into Foot Locker and some of their statements about being more commitment to apparel. That's something which is a statement that plays right to the Under Armour brand and our strength as well as the commitment we have to becoming great in Footwear. I think we're meeting one another right at the right time where they can help us and of course we can very much help them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Kevin, you probably won't comment on it, but there's a lot of speculation about the timing of basketball shoe being seeded into the market, and I was hoping you could maybe just speak broadly to when you could be entering that category. And then maybe related to Footwear, Brad, can you maybe just remind us how much clearance in Footwear was going on in the first quarter and why there was so much pressure on Footwear margins in the first quarter? And then maybe remind us how we should think about the quarterly revenue pattern impact from Footwear being down this year for the rest of the year. And then if there's any other things we should consider on a quarterly basis, pressures related to Footwear gross margins.", "Kevin Plank", "So, Robby, as it relates to basketball, number one, we are very committed to getting into this category. And for us it's not a question of if as much as it's a question of when. And I think one of the things we're probably most proud of is what we've learned of being in the Footwear business heading into our fifth year. And I think we relaying some of those learnings into our approach to the basketball category a whole. From an authenticity standpoint and from, frankly, just getting our product out there, and more importantly to the demand and demand creation that we\u2019ve been able to build as a company, we're very proud on what the internal team here has been able to do. With more than 10 Division 1 teams that are playing in our shoes this year for this entire season, all of the athletes and players; more than 20 high schools, five of which are from the USA Today top 25; with Brandon Jennings and Rookie of the Year-type performance that he\u2019s put on, and a win for the Milwauke!", " e Bucks last night, again led by Brandon Jennings and 26 points, I think we are very, very pleased, I think, with the progress we've made to date. And I think we're frankly sitting in the cat bird [ph] as to the timing and when we choose to enter this category. And I think we'll be opportunistic with that approach, but it doesn't have to be something we can force, and frankly, as you can see, with a strong Apparel business we can use timing to our advantage, are not forced from a revenue standpoint. So the answer to that is we're not making any declarations as to when we're going to enter the market, but when we do we\u2019ll walk in with a point of view and we\u2019ll enter with strength.", "Brad Dickerson", "And, Robby, on the Footwear question on margins, couple of things there. The mix of Footwear year-over-year, as you can imagine, in Q1 we had more of a mix towards cleated footwear, which we\u2019ve talked about being lower margins than non-cleated footwear. So we had that mix kind of working against us from a gross margin perspective in Q1. Also, we talked about a lot last year the price value relationship of our non-cleated footwear and the fact that we brought some of that price-side relationship more in line in the back half of 2009. And obviously we're carrying forward similar product here into 2010, and that price-value relationship strategy that we had at the end of '09 is carrying into 2010 also. So year-over-year you do have that difference in Q1. You'll start to be able to comp some of those price value '09 relationships more towards the back half of 2010. And from a clearance perspective, we did have some clearance in both Apparel and Footwear in Q1. It's kind of embed!", " ded in my comment around decreased returns and reserves, but we did have some clearance, incremental clearance, Q1 this year versus last year. And I think total Apparel and Footwear was probably around a 60- to 65-basis point impact in liquidation. As far as your question, Robby, on the quarterly revenue impact, we talked about at the end of the last earnings call, and it\u2019s consistent right now, that the biggest impact year-over-year relative comparing Footwear, with the Running and Training Footwear numbers, is in the first quarter and the third quarter of this year compared to last year. So going forward, the third quarter will be impacted with Running and Training being down.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chi Lee of Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Just a follow-up question on margins. When we look at the 130-basis point gross margin contribution from Apparel, can you talk about how much of that is really sustainable for the balance of the year versus maybe what might have been just a beneficial mix impact for the quarter? And then just in terms of the costing environment, what are you guys seeing in terms of both Footwear and Apparel price inflation, if any, as you go into the back half of the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Chi, this is Brad Dickerson. As far as the Apparel mix margin, the biggest impact to our Apparel mix is from sourcing benefits. As far as sustainability of that, we\u2019re obviously always looking for ways to improve costs, and there\u2019s a lot of different ways we can do that relative to obviously the factory costs but also logistics, freight and so forth. So in general that was the biggest benefit. We'll always look for benefits there. And also remember that we lock our pricing in well in advance too. So a lot of the benefits we saw in the first quarter were locked in obviously last year. We\u2019ll continue to see some improvements year-over-year in margins, maybe not to the magnitude that we saw in Q1 but we'll always continue to look for those.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "And then just in terms of just the inflationary outlook, are you guys seeing any pricing pressure for factories at this point in time?", "Wayne Marino", "Chi, hi. This is Wayne. Right now our visibility is probably out about eight to nine months, and we're not seeing anything there that would concern us other than just normal business conditions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate Mcshane of Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Can you just -- I just wanted to be clear on a comment that you made during the call that marketing as a percentage of your sales will be a little bit higher in Q2 and Q3. Is that because of a specific investment you're going to be making? Or it's just the timing as a percentage of sales?", "Brad Dickerson", "Kate, this is Brad. Right now it's really just the timing. Obviously every year we have some key initiatives around marketing, especially Q3 and Q4, but for the most part it's just the timing of our initiatives this year compared to last year. Remember, last year we did spend a little bit more in Q1 to support the run launch last year. So there's a little bit more of a shift this year towards the back half of the year because of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad of Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "You talked about China, you talked about Europe and Japan, opening 16 to 18 new outlets, investing in the Internet business, investing in supply chain, the new Footwear team, Q&A on basketball. Kevin and David, if you could comment, how do you get comfortable? Like what makes you more comfortable that you're able to juggle all these balls at once. I mean it's a lot in the air compared to maybe two or three years ago. What's different now where you confident you can execute on so many different initiatives simultaneously?", "Kevin Plank", "So I mean so much of what we have to do, and I think a large part of how we get judged is not what to do as much as what not to do. And believe me, we are a company that typically live with 15 items in our top 10 list. And probably one of the things I think we've demonstrated our ability to become better and better at, particularly over the last couple of years, has been our ability to focus. And I think we've been able to focus from an operating standpoint, I think we\u2019ve been able to focus from an initiative standpoint. And a lot of the ways that you handle and that you treat growth is finding the right categories in the right places to invest. And for us that's what leadership, it means defining how we deploy our resources. And that of course is people, it's time and it's money. And the commitments that we\u2019ve made, I think, are into what Brad referred to as large scalable businesses. And I think we've done a pretty good job in our investments, but we are clearly making inv!", " estments. And that's why we continue to come back with our commitment to being a global brand and telling you that we're investing in Europe and we're letting you know that we are investing in Asia. We've already been doing so in Japan for a while, and the result of that is a $100 million business that we have with a great partner. We\u2019ve begun that process in China, and we've been doing it for the last couple of years as well. Again, expending [ph] ahead of where the revenues flow. Footwear is another great example where we've done this. And probably at the same time, our Direct-to-Consumer channel is another place where we've done this, and we've obviously seen a much more immediate payoff. I got to tell you, Omar, that we feel good about the investments we're making. We feel good about, frankly, a top 10 list that's more like probably a top seven list, which for us is pretty miraculous. We are a better company. We're a better operating company, and we feel good about, I t!", " hink, the juggling as you refer to it. It\u2019s much more measured!", "  and it'", "s much more in line. So there are things that we do, and we used to call them putting water bottles along the trail and then you\u2019re going for 100-mile run and you go out the night before and you plan it, mile 10 to mile 20, mile 30. So a lot of these are potential growth engines that can be in place for us in the future as well as I think balancing that with things like a Direct-to-Consumer  channel and Apparel wholesale business that continues to grow for us and frankly can fund some of that ability. Our belief is that we're going to be a multibillion-dollar global brand, that we are the next great athletic brand. And as we think about that, it's much more of a 2020 approach than it is a 2010 approach. And so us putting some of these pieces in place are as much about this year or, frankly, as much about the future as they are about immediate return this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz of Robert Baird.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the Apparel business that was up so nicely in the quarter, up 31%, when I look at the sales guidance for the year, it looks like you're not assuming that level of run rate for the balance of the year, and I\u2019m just wondering why that might be? I mean, are you guys just being conservative on your outlook? I know you have tougher compares in the second and fourth quarters when you look at what you did last year, or I don't know if there were any shifts in the quarter that may be pulled some sales out of Q2 into Q1. But could you just maybe talk a little bit about your sales expectations on Apparel for the balance of the year?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, let Brad and I tag team that question for you. As you mentioned, we were up 31% in the quarter. So when you look and say sales and potentially slowing, 30% would effectively be slowing, which of course would be a pretty strong number and I think we'd take that. As you look back at just sort of historically, our distribution took a pretty conservative approach to inventory in 2009. So we\u2019re obviously feeling a little bit of the benefit with a little more offense this year from a merchandising perspective, the way that they\u2019re approaching it and I think the product assortment that we have as well. Our Women's line really coming together. Our Youth line really coming together. And I think, of course, Men's business, that continues to be sort of the backbone of our business as well. We're not ready to declare victory on 2010. It's very early. I know there\u2019s a lot of positive sentiment out there, but we're still watching 2010 and really taking, I think, a balanced approach t!", " o the rest of the year right now.", "Brad Dickerson", "Mitch, yes, as far as the timing goes we did see some benefit in Q1 to timing. The Easter holiday obviously came earlier this year than last year so we did see some benefit from that. Obviously we had some good cold weather in February, also that benefited the first quarter. As far as the rest of the year goes, based on our visibility right now we\u2019re providing our outlook; we did talk about  my prepared remarks, and  some of our cash right now in some key core items and inventories. So if we do see some demand upside in the back of the year we hope to position ourselves to be able to meet that.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On then on your Direct business, which was up huge in the quarter, could you say what that was as a percentage of sales? I know last year for the year Direct was about 18%. I mean, I'm kind of backing into a number that was probably around 20% for the first quarter. Is that pretty fair?", "Brad Dickerson", "This is Brad. As stated, 18%. Broad-based growth in Q1. We saw a growth with our wholesale accounts and very strong growth clearly on the Direct side. But it was 18%.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On your Direct business, huge in the quarter, what that was as a percentage of sales. I know Last year, for the year, Direct was about 18%. I mean, I'm kind of backing into a number, partly around 20% for the first quarter. Is that pretty fair?", "David McCreight", "Mitch, Brad had stated it was 18%. We saw broad-based growth in Q1. We saw a growth with our wholesale accounts and very strong growth clearly on the Direct side. But it was 18%.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I think, Brad, you said international, if I heard it right, $14 million I think you said in the quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, correct.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "What was that between Canada and Other?", "Brad Dickerson", "International does not include Canada.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "What was Canada, then? Do you guys have that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, we don't split Canada out separately.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I thought you did in the Ks.", "Brad Dickerson", "No, we don't.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy of Thomas Weisel.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "So when we look at the first quarter numbers, do they reflect a restocking effect? Or is that a benefit that would likely be delayed to future quarters?", "David McCreight", "No. Actually, in terms of the comparables we saw a restocking occur somewhat last year in Q1 of 2009. But broadly throughout, we're seeing, as Kevin had mentioned earlier, some of our wholesale accounts regaining confidence and seeing Under Armour's positioning and the strengthened opportunity we have ahead.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "So those wholesale accounts aren't taking up weeks\u2019 inventory on hand? That's what we're hearing from other vendors?", "David McCreight", "No, we have no indication of that.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "And then, David, can you comment on your current mix of pre-booked revenue versus replenishment and maybe how much special makeup you're currently doing?", "David McCreight", "There has not been a significant move or shift in that. Clearly, our partners are watching their balance sheets as well and work very closely with our team, our sales team and supply chain team, to make sure that we can fulfill demand. And as Brad said, we're also investing in some additional core inventories, some perennial style, in the event that demand comes towards the back half of the year. But the mix remains relatively consistent.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay. We\u2019ve seen some strong forward orders from companies with cold-weather merchandise. Can you guys comment on any benefit you\u2019ve seen to your pre-booked orders for fall?", "David McCreight", "No. We've included those in our guidance already.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Taposh Bari of Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I was hoping you could tell us how many outlet stores you guys opened in the quarter. And also I\u2019m hoping you can address your long-term view of the channel mix of wholesale versus direct. I noticed that you slightly increased your guidance for outlet stores for the year?", "David McCreight", "Taposh, this is David. We opened four during the quarter, have opened two additional since then and we're going to plan to open 16 to 18 total for the full year. And as we discussed earlier, our primary growth engine will continue to be our wholesale partners. It is the focus. We continue to focus the vast majority of our resources around growing our business with our key partners. And we think we\u2019ve got a lot of runway there as we continue to innovate and tell the Under Armour story, and with their strong support. We do believe our Direct-to-Consumer business plays a natural sort of logical, strategic extension to where we can add facets to the brand that aren\u2019t being served through locations or product offerings, whether it's online or in our stores. So we\u2019re going to see it continue to grow, but we still see for the near future the wholesale business is vital to our growth and we're very optimistic about our potential there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Shaw of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Thomas Shaw - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Let me ask kind of three questions on the Footwear side. First, I didn't hear a whole lot about soccer and how you might position that product around World Cup. Second, there's a lot of interesting trends going on at Footwear, whether it's lightweight, running or toning. Just curious of how maybe how Gene or Gavin is looking at that and thinking about that when addressing the running, training re-launch for next year. And last, but not least, Kevin, you talked about being opportunistic on the basketball side. I guess I was just assuming with the guidance that there are no expectations for a major push on the basketball side late this year.", "Kevin Plank", "So soccer, first of all. We've been in the soccer business and we're really exceeding product as much as anything. Our price points were $150 and up and really trying to get and maintain that high-end player and athlete. And we've done that with the way we launched in Europe. And it was really more of a player or product launch than it was at the highest levels than it was at the retail level. You'll see us begin to commercialize that in the near future. We expect to be an important player. In soccer, we've really led the way there from an apparel standpoint. And that consumer, especially here domestically, has a great relationship with our brand and is waiting for us to outfit them. At the same time, you've seen a lot of people adopt our shoes and frankly you've seen, from not even soccer, but if you ever went over to some of the football fields, including the kicker for the New Orleans Saints is wearing our boots in the Super Bowl as well. We feel great momentum with what !", " we're doing and especially the authenticity that we've been building in Europe. On Premiership fields wearing our boots and building great momentum there. So I think soccer again, it is the ticket to the global stage and of course the place where you'll see us playing on a much bigger level and product will lead the way there, of course. From a training and running standpoint and as it relates to toning, I think hats off to our industry for creating something that's created as much buzz as it has. I don't anticipate Under Armour doing specifically there, but I think, of course, we continue to listen to the consumer. And the fact that you could just walk around in a pair of shoes and hopefully get in shape has inspired a lot of people. We're not looking to create a product with a battery in it that'll help you lose weight right away. But we do think the opportunity is listening to the consumer is that if you can be relevant to them and you can find ways where the consumer ca!", " res about fitness and cares about athletics, I think that they!", " 'll be a", "n impression of that, that you'll see related into our product. And frankly, that's a message that speaks to this whole positioning that we take around training and combine training, in particular also. So I think there's a lot of synergy there. And I think what you'll see is an Under Armour take on it not where maybe the market is exactly today, but what we see taking the market to in the future. Lastly, around basketball. We have a great opportunity there. I think we have a great opportunity to differentiate. The fact of the matter is that we are going to enter the category. And we are going to enter the market. And with one player or two brands taking more than, or earning more than 90% of the market share in that business, we anticipate when we enter to take significant market share. And you can define significant in any way, but the fact is, is that we are gaining mind share with the consumer today. There is a demand. There's a pent-up demand. People are talking about o!", " ur basketball footwear. There anxious for it. And when we enter that market officially, our product is not for sale today, but when we do, we expect it to be meaningful. And that's the approach we'll take. So we're very fortunate to be in the position with five terrific growth levers for our business that we can lean on when we need. Again, there's no pressure for us to enter this market as much as being able to have the luxury of saying when market timing is appropriate. That really means when the consumer and the athlete and the product, especially is in the right position, we have everything ready to go. That, and only then is when we\u2019ll enter that market.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Sam Poser of Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "I just want to follow up on the basketball launch, if I can. By saying that you're going to do a significant -- a launch that\u2019s going to create significant market share, does that -- I mean by definition, does that mean that you\u2019re not going to do -- you're not going to seed the product into select markets this year?", "Kevin Plank", "Sam, I think one thing that we've learned is that we launched training shoes. And we did a big Super Bowl commercial and we had a lot of \u201cfeedback\u201d. We launched running shoes. And again, I think the way that smart people do it is that you're going to see us show up in the market at a point in time. And I think that, I don't know how loud that story will be. We expect that frankly the majority of the noise to be made from the consumers that are wearing it and when it\u2019s on their feet, and I think that\u2019s some of what you're hearing now is that the consumers who are wearing it, Brandon Jennings, our Division 1 teams that are out there: Auburn, Maryland, Texas Tech, South Florida, who are all in the shoes this year, competing at a NCAA level. And then of course, the high school kids. And things, highlighting like the Elite 24, which is a top 24 high school players regardless of class, that'll be playing in Los Angeles this summer in our footwear. I think there's a great pent-up d!", " emand. I think that the message that we're hearing is there's not only room, but frankly there's a want and desire for a new brand. But it's not just us showing up and putting a logo on a shoe. It's us showing up with new technology on a differentiated way and that's why we\u2019re entering the market because we can deliver that Under Armour edge and that Under Armour advantage. So again, the word launch isn't something that I don't think you'll hear from us in the short term. But, yes, we expect to, again, enter the market in a meaningful way, but when we say we meaningful we\u2019re going to use product to define that.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then can you tell us what the comp store sales were with your retail outlets?", "Kevin Plank", "Sam, we won\u2019t get into -- there were strong results. And we believe that's a primary indicator of the success and growth and the change in the strategy. We had strong comps but we're not going to get into any specifics.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Can you give us an idea of the margin contribution difference between the Direct business and the Wholesale business?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, Sam. I think we've talked in the past about -- obviously, Direct-to-Consumer has different margins within them itself between the Web business, our specialty stores and factory outlet stores. So all we can tell you is -- guide you is that the mix of that Direct-to-Consumer margin base is higher than our wholesale apparel margins are. That's all we can tell you, really.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

", "Now, I'd like to introduce thespeakers and topics for this morning's call. Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO,will address the drivers of our third-quarter results and our strategy forcontinued growth in 2007 and beyond. Brad Dickerson, Vice President ofAccounting and Finance, will then discuss the Company's financial performancefor the third quarter and provide an updated outlook for the balance of 2007.Wayne Marino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, willconclude the prepared remarks with the preliminary outlook for 2008. Afterthat, we will have a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. And with that, Iwill turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Alex. Good morning,everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm proud to announce results fromour third quarter, which proved to be our largest to date in both top andbottom line. ", "Let's start with a quick recap ofthe scoreboard. Under Armour net revenues increased 46.3% to $187 million inthe third quarter of 2007. Operating income for the quarter increased to $33.8million compared to $22 million just a year ago, an increase of 54%. Forperspective, Under Armour's net income for just the third quarter of 2007, at$20 million, exceeds the Company's total net income for the entire year of2005. ", "Wayne and Brad will provide moredetail to the scoreboard in a few minutes, but it's the color behind thenumbers that we believe further solidifies our position as \u201cthe athletic brand\u201dof this generation. And considering what we have planned on the horizon, thisis by far the most exciting time in our brand's history. With that, let's lookat our key growth drivers and let me start with women's. ", "With the launch of ourBoomBoom-TAP campaign in July, we staked our ground by authenticallyrepresenting the female team athlete, something no other brand has done todate. The Team Girl athlete has been at the core of our brands since ourbeginning when female teams were buying smaller sized men's Compressionbase-layers. We believe it's our duty and our privilege to continually innovateour design, style offering and color palette to the Team Girl, while continuingto speak to her as we did with the BoomBoom-TAP, our largest campaign of 2007. ", "The results speak for themselves.Women's apparel growth checked in at 49% for the quarter, driven by Compressionand Training, respectively. Our year-to-date growth in women's now stands at39%. This is proof that the female team athlete can be a driver at retail forthe women's category. ", "Another highlight is the youthcategory. Our youth business is not only a representation of our present brandstrength, but a positive sign for the future. Youth apparel growth was up 51%over the same period last year. This is further evidence that we are thisgeneration's athletic brand of choice, and we're making a pretty good case forthe next generation as well. Our men's apparel business continues to grow andshow strength, posting an increase of 43% over the third quarter last year. I'mproud to say that we continue to grow the core and find new, broader offeringsthat drive scalable growth for our men's business. ", "Fueling that men's business is Compression.It's the men's largest category, and it continues to grow at double-digitrates. Bolstered by our Good/Better/Best story, we've not yet found the ceilingfor Compression and continue to see growth in this category. Meanwhile, men'straining is growing faster than the overall Compression category at nearly 60%year-to-date. This can be attributed to our ability to expand our core businessas we broaden our performance platform across categories and across sports. ", "One of these new categoriesshowing fast growth is golf. Nonexistent two years ago for our brand, our golfbusiness has grown more than 140% year-to-date on roughly ten styles. We alsoexpanded our presence in Q3 in the outdoor mountain categories, with the launchof Under Armour outerwear. This program has just hit the floor and augments thecore offering that this channel has already accepted from our brand. ", "The success we've seen across ourmen's, women's and youth businesses, allow us to invest in large, scalablebusinesses to support long-term, sustainable growth. So for example, at retail,our concept shops continue to elevate our presentation and tell a richer storyabout our product and fabric technology. With partners like Dick's SportingGoods, The Sports Authority, Hibbett Sports and outsell outdoor retailer Cabela's,we're building new branded shops ranging in size from 500 to 1500 square feetacross the men and women's footprints. ", "These shops serve as a home baseof performance and anchor our many outposts throughout the sport andcategory-specific zones in the rest of their stores. ", "Before the kickoff of the holidayseason, we will have more than 260 new concept shops installed in North America alone, adding to and reshaping almost aquarter million square feet across these marquis positions within our topretailers' top performing doors. ", "This storytelling of the UnderArmour brand on the retail floor is naturally a global initiative for Under Armour.In Europe, for instances, we are mirroring this plan with shops in major citieslike Stuttgart and Berlin,Paris, Dublin andMadrid. Ourbusiness in Europe remains on track and ispoised to deliver as a long-term growth driver for our brand. ", "Peter Mahrer, President of UnderArmour Europe, who joined us in July, is on the ground and driving ourthree-part strategy from Amsterdam,our headquarters; building the team, authenticating the brand on field, andfinding the right distribution partners for Under Armour. ", "The goal in the United States and abroad is to tella better branded story while educating the consumer on the benefits ofperformance. Our job as the originator of performance and the thought leadersof the category is to continue to lead the ship from cotton into performance.Cotton remains the enemy as well as our largest opportunity. We will continueto dedicate space on the retail floor precisely for this education. ", "Logistically, we're alwayslooking to expand our footprint while continuing to improve our already strongproductivity per square foot. ", "So, part of telling a betterbranded story comes to life this week with the opening of the very first UnderArmour full-line retail store. We plan to cut the ribbon at the Annapolis Mallin Marylandthis Thursday with a store that will be unlike anything you have seen before ina mall. We set out to create a branded shopping experience that will be thephysical manifestation of the Under Armour brand and provide the feeling andemotion of being in an Under Armour commercial. ", "Our goal is to showcase the UnderArmour brand by telling comprehensive product and brand stories. ", "At the same time this week, wewill launch the latest version of www.underarmour.com. This new version willease the navigation of the site for quick and easy purchases while providingour web visitors with the newly added visual content they have been asking for,including enhanced branded content, product education, and high-resolutionproduct images with point-and-click zoom capability. I invite you all to comeand visit and explore this branded visual experience. ", "Next, we will answer the latesttop request from our brand fans; non-cleated footwear. As I statedlast quarter, the big news for Under Armour in 2008 will be the launch of ourfirst line of performance trainers. This first-ever version of Under Armournon-cleated footwear will be the cornerstone of Under Armour performancetraining, and it will complete the outfitting package for our athletes whospend nearly 95% of their time training for that very important 5% ofcompetition on the field, court, ice or track. ", "You'll see this launch in thesecond quarter of 2008, but as with any Under Armour launch, you'll hear thebuzz building much, much earlier. ", "With these launches on thehorizon, both near and long-term, we will continue to bolster our future byremaining disciplined with our marketing investments. We will invest wherenecessary to give our brand and our retail partners the proper support for ourmajor launches. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic with ourmarketing spends, allowing us to stay fast and nimble with our growing brand. ", "We are proud of the quarter weposted and the achievements we've had on both the top and bottom lines. We'reconfident of how we are committing resources today as we continue to invest inlarge, scalable businesses. ", "And lastly, we are excited aboutthe growth opportunities that lie ahead in growing our men's core appareloffering, expanding our women's business, building our international business,and launching Under Armour performance trainers. ", "With that, I will hand it over toBrad to take you through more detail on the numbers.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I am going to takea few minutes to provide information around our third-quarter income statementand balance sheet, and I will provide an updated outlook for the full year of2007. ", "First, our income statement forthe quarter; our consolidated net revenue growth in the third quarter, comparedto the same period in the prior year, was 46%. This was driven by a 45%combined growth in our men's, women's and youth apparel sales. We arecontinuing to see benefits of an expanded product assortment in ourGood/Better/Best strategy with average selling prices and apparel upapproximately 11% compared to the third quarter in 2006. ", "Year-to-date, our consolidatednet revenue grew 46% with our apparel sales growing 41%.We continue to seestrong demand for our most mature business, our men's apparel. Growth in men'sapparel for the quarter was 43%, compared to 2006, and was driven by our Compression,Training, Mountain and Golf products. Year-to-date, men's apparel growth was40%. ", "Women's apparel growth for thequarter was 49%, compared to the prior year, and was primarily driven by our Compression,Training, and our new Mountain product offerings. This strong third-quartershowing helped boost our year-to-date women's apparel growth to 39%, anacceleration over the 31% growth we achieved for the first half of the year. ", "Our youth apparel growth for thequarter was 51%, compared to the prior year, driven by our Compression,Training and football products. Year-to-date, youth apparel growth was 58%. ", "Now, moving to our gross margins;for the quarter, gross margin was unchanged from the prior-year quarter at50.6%. There are a few puts and takes impacting the margin for the quarter.First, as planned, beginning in 2007, we began to shift dollars previouslygiven as customer discounts to in-store marketing and SG&A. Second, growthin our licensing and Direct-to-Consumer business, which includes our website,catalog and retail outlet stores, provided improvement in gross margin for thequarter. ", "These gains were offset byincreased sales returns, allowance and inventory reserves in the third quarteron certain cleated footwear styles that will not carry forward to the nextseason. SG&A as a percentage of net revenues for the quarter was 32.5%compared to 33.4% in the prior year. On a dollar basis, SG&A for the third quartertotaled $60.7 million, an increase of $18 million compared to the same periodin 2006. ", "Within SG&A, we continue toinvest in our brands by increasing investments in marketing. Marketing costsrepresented 11.5% of net revenues in the quarter, compared to 10.3% during thesame period last year, primarily driven by higher in-store marketinginvestments. We had previously indicated that marketing costs in the quarterwould exceed the 10% to 12% range of net revenues. However, it is important tonote approximately $2 million of marketing spend previously anticipated in thethird quarter will shift to the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "This is mostly due to the timingof the installation of new concept shops and will not affect our total plannedmarketing spend for the year. The increase in marketing costs, combined withadditional investments in our growth areas, represented approximatelytwo-thirds of the year-over-year dollar growth in SG&A.

First, our year-over-year increase in core inventory wasapproximately $37 million or almost half the increase in total. Our coreinventory represents inventory that we plan to have available for sale on a12-month basis at full price. In the prior year, we did not meet all of theconsumer demand for our products in the back half of the year. As a result, in2007, we strategically increased our safety stock levels for core items toimprove our service levels to meet the anticipated consumer demand, andincreased productivity from our investment in fixtures and concept shops. ", "We believe our investment in coreinventory is paying off, as we are seeing significantly higher percentage ofdemand for core items being filled today than one year ago. ", "Another portion of theyear-over-year increase was in-transit inventory. Our in-transit inventoryincreased by $13.1 million or 110% from one year ago; this was primarily aresult of our strategy to increase sourcing from Asia,resulting in more favorable product pricing. ", "Finally, the balance of theincrease was driven by additional inventory needed to support our growththroughout all businesses and an 8% higher average cost per unit due to productmix. ", "As we move to capitalexpenditures, I need to continue to point out that we are building the foundationfor large, scalable businesses. We continue to plan 2007 capital expendituresat $34 million to $36 million. Year-to-date, we've spent approximately $26.2million. These expenses were consistent with what we have discussed in previousquarters and mostly related to infrastructure needs in our distributionfacilities, in-store fixtures and concept shops, and other needs to support ourcontinued growth. ", "Now, moving to our updatedoutlook for the full year 2007; we are raising our annual net revenue outlookto a range of $590 million to $600 million, an increase of 37% to 39% comparedto last year and up from our previous outlook of $580 million to $590 million.This updated revenue outlook takes into affect our strong third-quarterresults, current visibility that exists into our fourth quarter, and ourinventory strategy which we believe positions us to fill seasonal demand forour core products at significantly higher levels than during the prior year.

", "Now, let me take you through someof the details of our outlook. First, our gross margin; we continue to believeour gross margin will improve 20 to 30 basis points for the full year comparedto 2006. The puts and takes are consistent with what we have said in the past.First, we anticipate that our higher margin, Direct-to-Consumer business willgrow at a faster rate than our overall business. Second, we will have apositive benefit to our gross margins from the shift in spending from discountsto in-store marketing, and finally, a portion of these improvements will beoffset by our cleated footwear business, which carries margins lower than ourexisting apparel margins. ", "Related to SG&A, we believeour marketing has a direct impact on our top-line growth. As previously stated,for the full year, we're planning to invest at the high-end of the 10% to 12%range, and if top-line volumes exceed our outlook, we will be opportunisticwith our marketing spend and invest more in planned campaigns to launch large,scalable businesses. ", "Given the increase in ourexpectations for our top-line, balances our continued investment in marketing,we now expect SG&A leverage of 20 to 30 basis points for the full year.

", "Taking into account our strategicinvestments, including our expected investment in working capital, specificallyinventory, and capital expenditures, we are expecting cash and cash equivalentsto be approximately $25 million at the end of 2007. The $25 million takes intoaccount our recent pay-down of the $10 million in borrowings we had at the endof the third quarter.

I will nowprovide you with the preliminary outlook on several key elements of ourbusiness for 2008. First, I'd like to remind you that our long-term targetsremain at 20% to 25% for both our top and bottom lines. However, due to thestrength of the brand, the capacity to expand across categories, and ourability to leverage our existing businesses, we believe our 2008 revenues andincome from operations will exceed our 20% to 25% long-term growth targets. ", "For 2008, our long-term strategicgrowth initiatives remain the same; first, continue to grow our men's andwomen's apparel business; second, enter new categories of footwear whilecontinuing to maintain a disciplined approach to gaining market share inexisting categories; and third, build the Under Armour brand internationally. ", "Complementing these growthinitiatives is the appropriate distribution for the Under Armour brand,including the opportunity we have in our Direct-to-Consumer business. ", "Now, let me provide you with somecolor around 2008. Apparel will continue to be a significant part of ourbusiness with strong growth in both men's and women's. This growth is plannedto be driven by continued expansion of product offerings in the training, golf,football, and outdoor categories. Strong fulfillments within our core products,which represent approximately 50% of our business; increased consumer appetiteto move into better performance products; increasing our ASPs; and higherproductivity within in-store concept shops that are being installed within ourlarger strategic accounts. ", "In the second quarter of 2008,we're planning to launch our performance trainer. Similar to our first cleatedfootwear launch, this will be an allocated program in the first season. Withthe launch of performance trainers, we expect the year-over-year growth rate inour footwear category to outpace the Company's overall growth and position usto launch into other footwear categories in 2009 and beyond. ", "Internationally, we will continueto focus on Western Europe with particular emphasis on the UK, Franceand Germany.We continue to believe that the long-term opportunity for the Under Armourbrands internationally is as large as the opportunity in the U.S., and we will make theappropriate investments in people, brands and infrastructure in 2008 and beyondto reach that goal.

", "For 2008, we believe that ourDirect-to-Consumer business, which currently includes our website, catalog,outlet stores and full-priced test store, will be an important contributor toour year-over-year top-line dollar growth and an even greater contributor toour year-over-year operating income growth. ", "Our first full-priced retailstore, located in the Annapolis Mall, will open in two days. We are excitedabout this opportunity to present our brand at retail as we explore how full-pricedstores fit into our strategy going forward. ", "Our gross margin; based on thevisibility that we have today, we believe that our gross margin for 2008 willcontinue to show improvement as a result of growth in our higher-marginDirect-to-Consumer business outpacing growth in our overall business, offset inpart by our anticipated growth in footwear, specifically with the launch of ourperformance trainer, which will carry higher margins than our cleated footwearbusiness but lower margins than our existing apparel margins. ", "Our SG&A -- we believe thatour marketing has a direct impact on our top line. For 2008, we're planning toinvest additional dollars in key growth initiatives to tell our story andsupport our major launches, specifically in training. Historically, we haveinvested between 10% and 12% of our net revenues in marketing, and as Brad saidearlier, we're planning to be at the high end of that range for 2007.", "From a financial perspective, ourmarketing philosophy remains the same; continue to make $1 spend like $3. Froma strategic perspective, we will continue to create our marketing messageinternally, and cluster our initiatives in key parts of the year. Rather thantrying to outspend the competition, we will continue to place our producton-field and in assorted media. ", "For 2008, we believe thatinvesting between 12% and 13% of our net revenues will not only support ourlarge scale of businesses like footwear and our international business, butwill further strengthen our brand's position as the athletic brand of choice ofthis generation. In 2008, we believe our strong growth in revenues will allowus to leverage our fixed costs and partially fund this investment in marketing.", "Now, I will walk you through ourinventory strategy for 2008. As Brad said earlier, our inventory strategy issimple; first, be in stock on core offerings to meet consumer demand whileimproving our inventory efficiency over the long-term; second, ship seasonalproduct at the start of the shipping window; and third, earmark any seasonalaccess for our outlet stores, and operate those stores at a profit. ", "In 2007, we accomplished thefirst part of our strategy by doubling our level of safety stock in corereplenishment items that we sell year-round, which resulted in improving ourfill-rate percentages from the low 80\u2019s to the mid 90\u2019s on increased demand.This strategy significantly impacted our top-line growth. ", "For 2008, we will continue tohold our fill rates on core inventory at these levels while we reduce oursafety stock levels and drive more aggressive inventory management initiatives.We believe that by the end of 2008; will see an improvement in our inventoryefficiency whereby top-line growth should outpace inventory growth.

(OperatorInstructions) ", "We will take our first questionfrom Robby Ohmes with Banc of America Securities. ", "Robby Ohmes - Banc of AmericaSecurities ", "Can you guys hear me okay?", "Kevin Plank", "Yeah, fine Robby. ", "Brad Dickerson", "We hear you good. ", "Robby Ohmes - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Good morning. Hey, two questions,one, you've given a lot of detail on the inventory, but can you help usunderstand if weather has played an impact in the buildup of your inventory?Then also, can you help us understand the sort of way we should think aboutquarterly revenue growth, because your implied guidance is obviously a slowdownin the fourth quarter versus what have you put up for the third quarter. ", "Then your '08 guidance ofexceeding that 20% to 25% implies a reacceleration. Can you just kind of walkus through how we should think about patterns of revenue growth for you guys? ", "Then the second question is, aswe're looking at all of the things you are doing in Europe,new stores and sneakers. Is sneakers the big focus of '08 and we should thinkthat Europe probably comes on the stronger,maybe more '09-'10? How meaningful could stores be? If you could help us rankwhere you see the opportunities as we are thinking about '08? ", "Wayne Marino", "Sure, Robbie. This is Wayne. I'm going to takeyour inventory question first. ", "I think there's a couple ofpoints I want to make on the inventory. First, we made a strategic decision in2007 to bring our core inventory levels at a pace that would meet our demand.In 2006, specifically in November and December, one of the shortfalls we hadwas we could not keep pace with the demand for our product. So, we essentiallywent out and took core inventory, which is available for sale 12 months of theyear, and this is the benefit of our business model. We increased those levelsof safety stock. As a result, we filled demand at a much higher rate, and thatwas a big benefit to our top-line. ", "There's always an opportunity,and there will be as we go forward, to hold those fill rates constant as westart to improve our inventory efficiency. That's what we will be working on in2008. So, I think the inventory itself that we have on hand represents a planmostly around the core inventory. As far as the weather was concerned, ColdGearis a factor to us in the back half of the year as we all know. One of thethings we did this year was we received our ColdGear, and the entire season ofColdGear, in by the end of October. The reason we did this is, once again lastyear specifically in November, we were very short on ColdGear. In fact, wemissed some opportunities to fill that demand. So we wanted to be in a positionby the end of October to have our entire ColdGear season in-house, knowing thatthe season itself would have to be a longer season, which it is; it typicallyend for us in February or March. ", "In addition to that, we didn't haveto chase any inventory like we did last year. Now, the benefit of that, Robby,is that we are sitting here with ColdGear and we have been able to get somegood duty rates on ColdGear, which we should start to see as an opportunity inour gross margins. So, a lot of plusses on that as well.", "As far as '08 is concerned, youknow, the inventory itself will start to get in line in '08; that's some of theinitiatives that we talked about. As far as our top-line growth, one of thethings we factored in for '07, we factored in the visibility we have currentlytoday with October. So, our full-year outlook factors in an unseasonably warmOctober. Also, I look into November and December of last year. November wasactually, as I said, not a month that we filled very highly and December wasunseasonably warm. The good news is that we are in a great position with ourinventory to fill demand in the back half of the year. We are also going to bein a great position to fill demand in the early part of the first quarter ofnext year. ", "Brad Dickerson", "Robbie, this is Brad. I justwanted to add to that too, what Wayneis saying. Also, we tend to build our business on a seasonal basis versus aquarterly basis too. So we tend to look at the fall-winter season versus thefourth quarter in particular. Also, not really any significant new productlaunches in Q4 of '07, so from a year-over-year competitively basis, thatfactors in too. But obviously, our full-your outlook, our revenues are up 37%to 39% for '07, and as Wayne stated for '08, we are exceeding to 20% to 25% topand bottom line growth. ", "Kevin Plank", "Robbie, this is Kevin. Let mejump on your second question there, which is how do we really rank I think thepriorities for our business and what are the growth drivers that are going toreally be impactful in 2008. I think, frankly, coming off a quarter where men'sgrew 43% and women's grew 49%, we still feel, first and foremost, great aboutthose two core growth drivers. I mean, men's and women's apparel alone just continueto I think show that we have yet to find the ceiling. I gave a couple ofcall-outs in my script to things like Compression and how we are continuing tosee the volume driving there, but even above that, the Good/Better/Beststrategy, ASPs were up 11% in the quarter and were up nearly 9% year-to-date. ", "We still want to continue todrive that. We think that, with our brand, we have the ability to placeconsumers into better products, and we need to continue to take advantage ofthat, so building better product is something you'll see come out of us in2008. ", "So, without question, the largestgrowth driver for us is our core existing U.S. business. Not far behind, froman excitement and a buzz factor though, is our opinion on footwear. ", "We've spent really the last twoyears and frankly the last three or four or five years planning for thatfootwear launch with getting into in starting with cleated footwear. We'vetaken our lumps with margin; we've taken our lumps with really building abusiness, building an infrastructure, and most importantly building the team ofpeople. We are poised and we are ready to start harvesting some of investmentthat we've input into athletic footwear. ", "You're going to see that in thesecond quarter of this year when we reintroduce the category of training to theworld. We believe that our athlete is training in a different way and that thestory we're going to be telling them is something which is consistent with whatathletes are doing today. ", "So, footwear, without question,is something that is going to be a big buzz and a big driver for us in 2008. ", "Europe,as we've stated all along, I think it's a long-term growth initiative for us.Peter Mahrer just got in there in July, and he's on the ground, and thatstrategy that we have is still the same. Peter's job is really localizing thatstrategy; number one, building the right team of people so he is over there,he's evaluating the team and he's building the out, he is making hires. It'sauthenticating ourselves on-field, of course and its finding and saying whatare the right properties for us to attack? Thirdly, it's also finding andsaying who are the right partners for us to be in Europe?", "So, we've got some great doorsopening and Europe, we continue to seetraction. Again, we are on plan and it will grow, and as Waynesaid, it will outpace our U.S.growth. But still it's a long-term investment for us. ", "Robby Ohmes - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Terrific.

You mentioned some expenses in the fixturing program being pushedfrom the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Where are you with thefixturing program? How many store-in-stores do you have in place? Then relatedto that, do you have any further insights on the productivity enhancements thatyou're seeing from those fixtures? ", "", "Kevin Plank", "Let me jump on it first then,Jim. Again, we are targeting about 260 of these soft/hard shops to be in by theend of the year. We are just over 200 right now that we have. Again, the impactof that will be roughly about quarter million total square feet that we willhave out at retail. That will be in this new concept, this new look, which wethink, something again, which is the manifestation of the Under Armour brand,when you walk into them. Not unlike what we're trying to do as we become betterretailers and better wholesalers. ", "The goal that we have and whatwe've seen to date, again, it's early. But I think what we've seenconsistently, when you put in concept shops, you're looking for about a 20%lift with product. And as that's been pretty consistent to the new fixtures andnew concept shops that we have versus the stores that don't have shops. Rightnow, we are looking at about three per week, is what we're going to beinstalling. Again, this is just not a Q3 or Q4 initiatives for us, as much asthis is something where, again, you're showing $20, $30, $40 T-shirts. You wantto be able to tell great stories at retail. It's part of our three-partstrategy which is the way that we are approaching the Web, the way that we areapproaching concept shops, the way that we are approaching I think our ownexperience, our own direct touch points with the consumer. We want to make surethat we are explaining to them what is performance, what is technology, and whatdoes the Under Armour brand stand for. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Okay, great. And then Wayne, I want to drilldown a little bit on some of the things to improve inventory efficiency. As youlook into next year, what are some of the areas you'll be targeting to try toimprove the turns? ", "", "Wayne Marino", "Yes, the easiest one for us,again, maintaining that fill rate at that high mid 90s is important to us forthe top-line. What we did, Jim, was we increased our safety stock probably twoand half times to be able to meet that demand. What we see, going forward, wewill be able to bring those safety stock levels down while holding our fillrate high. That's going to have a significant impact because approximately 50%of our inventory is in this core inventory. So, I don't see any risk at all inbeing able to do that; I believe that's a timing part, still maintaining thefill rate and bringing safety stock levels down. In addition to that, our ChiefSupply Officer Jim Calo already begun to look at programs that we run 12 monthsout of the year where we can shorten our lead-time. ", "Right now, our lead-time isanywhere from 90 to 120 days. The opportunity here is to work with oursuppliers and have them hold fabrications that will continue to run in ourbusiness going forward. Now, we've seen some benefits with cutting lead-timedown almost on half on just certain key programs. ", "So, early indications from me arethat we are in the right direction and we've accomplished that first goal ofholding our fill rate. ", "The last piece I think is asimportant for me sitting in the CFO position, is that our obsolete inventory isrelatively the same as a percentage of inventory as it was last year. Andanything that we have that we would consider prior season, we've earmarked forour outlet stores. Our outlet stores operate at a very good profit. It's a goodmargin model and a good operating margin model. ", "So, we've got a pretty goodcontainment on anything that is excess inventory. Again, that excess isminimal, mainly because we focused on that core inventory. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Great, and the final question andI will let somebody else jump in; have you seen any resistance to higheraverage selling prices for your products? ", "", "Brad Dickerson", "No. Jim, I think that the newcategories that we have gone into, they really have a tendency of creatingthese halo effects. So, the consumer is looking at our brand and they aresaying, we've got basic, it is sort of dumb-dumbs out there. What the UnderArmour brand stands for is that we are about innovation. We are about bringingand building technical product for the marketplace, and we've found that ourbrand actually gives us license to go to places where other brands in the pasthave not. And that's the excitement that we've had from important partners likeDick's Sporting Goods or people who say \u201cWe can try higher price points, we cantake this company and the brand to places where other brands have not been ableto go to\u201d. So, we need to be thoughtful about that; we need to make sure thatwe are careful about the products that we do decide to get into, the categorieswe decide to get into. Again, that's what gives us continuing confidence inwhat we can do in apparel, as well as what we believe gives us the ability togo after something like footwear, and particularly in the performance trainingcategory.

We remain confident, I think,in what we're seeing in our business; we remain confident in the way that weare positioned.

How areyou thinking about those going forward? ", "", "Kevin Plank", "Look, for any great growth brand,I don't think you are ever happy with where you are, and that's part of what mynumber one job is. It's hiring and retaining great talent. So, you know, we arein a market today as we always are. Again, I spend about 25% of my time lookingfor great marquis talent, particularly around our growth initiatives. I thinkPeter was a great win for us in 2007. And we continue to look to bolster it,not only just the senior leadership but, a company like Under Armour that ispositioned for not the next 2 or 3 years but the next 5, 10, 15 years is theway we think about our business, the way we think about the infrastructure thatwe've invested in. We're looking for those great managers, those greatdirectors as well. ", "So, it's not just the premiumtalent that we get to send out the press releases about, but I think who ourcompany, our brand is, we are in this fortunate position that we really canattract some great young talent that's going to be there for us going forward.But without question, we're still learning in some of these things. Thequestion you just asked Brad about footwear, these are lessons that you gothrough it. It's hard to say and even when people have experience, until youhave a group or a team of people that are working together, things don't run assmoothly until you just have time. ", "Our footwear team is now headinginto its third year of fully operating and shipping product. Our forecasting,our sales team, the way that we interact, the expectation that we can have fromthe market, you just get better. The one thing that's always certain about ayear or two from any product company is that it will be better than year one,right? It's not to say there is anything wrong with year one; it just meansthat it is constant improvement. And frankly, that's the way that we approachour business each and every day. ", "", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Excellent, thank you. ", "", "Operator", "We will go next to JeffKlinefelter with Piper Jaffray. ", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, just a couple of quickquestions for you, one is on sourcing. Wayne,you mentioned that, or I think you mentioned that on the prepared comments,that part of your inventory increase was in-transit due to Asiasourcing. ", "We also know that recently you'vediscussed transitioning some of your sourcing back closer to home for aresponse time. Could you just give us an update on, like, for example, at theend of Q3, how much of your inventory was Asia-sourced versus last year, Q3, toget a sense for how the in-transit increased to that degree, and then also anupdate on that new sourcing strategy? ", "", "Brad Dickerson", "Jeff, actually this is Brad. Onthe sourcing piece, right now sourcing through Asiais about 50%. That's compared to about 40% last year. So we are up 10% in oursourcing from Asia. Also, on the temporaryshift, that was really more of a late Q4 '06, first half of '07 event, andwe've pretty much worked our way through that right now. So as we speak rightnow, that temporary shift -- we are not seeing that. ", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, so that was a temporary;now you'll go back to seeing Asia become a bigger and bigger part of yoursourcing going forward? Do you think it will go above the 50% going forward? ", "", "Brad Dickerson", "Correct. We should be rightaround 50%. We should see that. We will take opportunities to improve ourmargins through looking at sourcing it through Asiaas we see fit. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. Then just a coupleof other quick questions; one would be on international. You clearly identifiedthat as a long-term growth strategy. We know, in the U.K., you've had some early successin distribution. Maybe, Kevin, could you give us an update there on, generallyspeaking, where your door count is situated today? We know the U.K.has been probably your strongest and earliest market with JJB. But in terms of France and Germany, you are using somedistributors in those markets. What's the margin implication of that versus thedirect distribution in the U.S.?", "", "Kevin Plank", "Well, today, Jeff, we've gotabout, we are over 1,200 doors of distribution that we have in Europe right now. Again, I will go back to thatthree-part strategy that Peter is driving for us right now; find the right teamof people, get us authentic on field, and find the right distribution partners.", "So, speaking specifically todistribution, JJB has been an important partner to us, but not to be outdone Ithink by people like Innersport, which are the 4,000-store buying groups of thesmaller mom-and-pop independents which really got us going in Europe.So, it's not a one-trick pony in Europe or frankly in any of the markets -- notunlike what we did here in the States, we've got a strong, independentfoundation of dealers that are selling that authentic football shop, thatauthentic rugby shop, etc. They are talking directly to the athlete. Then wealso have the relationships teed up right now for the more, larger chainstores, like the JJB. ", "The good news in Europe is that they are not having any of the weatherissues that we've seen here in the U.S. Europe is actually very cold and that ofcourse always looks favorably for our business. So, I think business is aboutwhere we expected it to be in Europe rightnow. I think, going forward, that's some of things that Peter, as he gets inthere, he comes back after listening for three months and then starting toevaluate the team for three months, that is six-months plan of how are we goingto reengage and attack Europe, country by country, focusing on really France,Germany and of course the UK. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Then how does the 1200doors split between the U.K.,France and Germany today, Kevin? ", "", "Kevin Plank", "I think you can call it roughlyhalf in the U.K.,and then the balance over the other two countries. And then also spread in afew other places, Italy and Greece and a little bit in Spain as well. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Then the margin structure;we've heard from other brands that you can get favorable margin and pricing inthose markets. Are you seeing the same trend? ", "", "Wayne Marino", "This is Wayne. One of the things we did, we had theopportunity to learn. When we went to Europe, we set our pricing up, similar tothe U.S. but also takinginto account what it would take to do business in Europe.So, we've presented a fair margin. Our gross margins are good, but it wasn't byjust the pricing. I think what we did with the power of the brand, we went toour retail partners there and were able to negotiate with them, what I wouldconsider fair arrangements as our business grows. ", "So right now, we have a goodgross margin structure and I think fair pricing at retail. In addition to that,we've built it so that we have strong operating margins as well, as thatbusiness continues to leverage. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. So just to clarify, Wayne, are you looking forcomparable op-margins out of the two businesses or; you are-- ", "", "Wayne Marino", "We've built the model right nowto have comparable margins over the long-term as the business continues togrow, yes. That's how we modeled it. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Great, thank you. The lastquestion; Kevin, you made it pretty clear in your point of differentiation isthat the power of the brand, your opportunities to take pricing up and ASP mixup in the U.S., So, clearly your priority is not figuring out how to godownstream in pricing. But we've heard a lot over the last couple of quartersfrom the moderate channel of distribution about how important this performancecategory is, probably due largely to success in Dick's and other higher-endretailers. ", "What are your thoughts on that?Let the competitors come in and take that moderate price, or consider itdiffusion or sub-brand for UA as some point? ", "", "Kevin Plank", "Well, I think one of the themesthat we've heard from the line of questions that have been coming from you guysthis morning is how do you keep all of this stuff straight? You've got theretail component; you've got footwear; you've got your core business. But we dohave a lot of balls in the air; there's no question about it. It sounds like alot, but I think we've done a pretty good job of focusing and knowing what'simportant. It's like when I said, look, our core men's and women's business isgoing to be the most important thing for us. Footwear is number two; Europe is long-term. ", "We need to keep in perspective Ithink the areas that we're going to attack, and we see, frankly, so muchopportunity with just providing better product out to the market that we arealready serving. We still see the opportunity at Dick's Sporting Goods, at TheSports Authority, at Hibbett Sports, at the outdoor market in Cabela's and BassPro and these other just whole other channel that I don't think we're reallyspeaking to. So, it would be easy for us to look and have conversations aboutother distribution. It would probably be detrimental to our brand, I believe. ", "Our focus, lives, needs should beon where we're doing business today, and I think driving that, and taking theconsumer that we already speak to into higher and to better price points, andnot just higher price points, but it's better product. We don't just chargemore because it's Under Armour; we are introducing them something new. We arelifting their expectation of what should I expect when I wear a T-shirt? Right?So that is something that gives usour brand DNA. ", "", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Alex Miyamoto", "We have time for one morequestion. ", "", "Operator", "We will take our final questionfrom Jeffrey Edelman with UBS. ", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Thank you, good morning. Just twoquestions; one, Wayne, as we think about next year, you mentioned leveragingyour fixed overhead, but when we think about the increased marketing spend, Isuspect that will put some pressure on the SG&A, and maybe we start thinkingabout relatively flat operating margin for the new year. ", "Wayne Marino", "Jeff, it is Wayne. What I wanted to do is, first, look atnext year. One of the important factors for us is that we are a growth company,and we are going to continue to invest in areas that could become large,scalable businesses. One of the investments that we're going to make goingforward is in people, in brands. Brand is very important for us.", "As we launch into the trainingcategory, which we're currently in right now in apparel, and we will be in withperformance trainers in Q2, it's important to send that message out, both infootwear and international and we believe that our marketing is that message.So, the ability to pay for that marketing is coming from our growth. Our growthis there because we have made the investments in the last couple of years. Partof that growth will help leverage our fixed costs. ", "So, one of the points I want tomake is that our fixed costs will leverage. We will take those dollars and itwill help offset some of the marketing.", "In terms of doing the math, Ithink next year, when you look at it, we said first we will have growth in ourtop line and our bottom line. We're going to have additional investment inmarketing and leverage to pay for some of that marketing. I haven't given outthe exact financial projections for next year, but I think there are somenatural offsets.", "In addition to that, anotherfactor that helps us pay for some of that marketing is increase in our grossmargin, and that's the other factor that will happen next year as we continueto look at our direct businesses, as we continue to improve our footwearmargins, as we continue to have strong apparel margins from our sourcing basein Asia.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Great, thank you. And then, couldyou talk about your own retail? What kind of comp-store sales did those have inthe quarter and roughly what are they now as a percentage of total?", "Wayne Marino", "Jeff, it is Wayne again. Yes, we typically do not talkabout our comp stores and our outlet stores. What I can tell you, though, is,first, the gross margins in the outlet stores are as strong if not strongerthan our wholesale margins. Secondly, we have about 15 stores, hopefullyplanning to have 17 outlet stores. They essentially take all of our excessinventory and turn it into profits; they are all operating at a profit.", "Now, one of the key metrics thatI use is looking at that direct business. Now, our direct business is acombination of our Web business and our outlet stores and our full-pricedretail store that we're about to open in two days. Collectively, the directbusiness will contribute approximately 15% of our year-over-year top-linedollar growth and an even greater percentage of our operating income. So, it's astrong model. It's a material model to our dollar growth, and accretive to bothour gross margins and operating margins.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Great, thank you.", "Wayne Marino", "Okay.", "Kevin Plank", "Okay, operator.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Alex Miyamoto, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Alex Miyamoto - Investor Relations", "Thank you and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming you to Under Armour's fourth quarter 2007 earnings call.", "During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words; estimates, intend, expect, plan, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "Important factors relating to our business, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Before we continue, I'd like to direct you to our website, investor.underarmour.com. There, you'll find this morning's press release.", "Now, I'd like to introduce the speakers and topics for this morning's call. Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; will address the drivers of our fourth quarter results and our strategy for continued growth in 2008 and beyond. Brad Dickerson, Vice President of Accounting and Finance, will then discuss the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and provide an outlook on key balance sheet items. Wayne Marino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will conclude the prepared remarks with an updated outlook for 2008 financial projection. After that we will have a Q&A session that will end by 9:30.", "With that, I will turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thank you, Alex and good morning everyone. I would like to talk this morning about two topics I have some strong opinions about; the strength of the Under Armour brand and the future of Under Armour.", "The strength of our brand was evident throughout 2007, as we saw a great revenue growth 41% to top the $600 million mark. We saw a great balance to that revenue growth for the apparel growing 37% for the year and footwear growing 52%. We also saw great balance in 2007 within our apparel top line growth as men's grew 36%, women's grew 35% and youth grew 53%. But the biggest call out for me is that we are able to achieve that level of growth primarily by growing within our existing categories and our existing distribution. That tells us that the opportunity for the Under Armour brand remains enormous and we are focused on building out our business while staying true to our performance position.", "One area in which we believe we are well positioned to grow is women's. We have a great brand position, particularly with the young team athlete. We now have in place what we believe is the right focus on that opportunity, with the hiring of Suzanne Karkus, who joined us earlier this month as Senior Vice President of Apparel. Suzanne comes to Under Armour from Izod Womenswear, where she was President; before that she was President in the women's division of Calvin Klein Jeans.", "The strength of our brand was most evident during the fourth quarter as we grew revenues 29% and would have been described as the most challenging retail environment in many years. We say strong sell-through for our core apparel styles in the Q4 selling season and as is our norm, virtually all of it at full price. Our strong sell-through at retail despite increased efforts from some of our competitors in performance apparel category is great evidence that we are clearly the performance brand of choice for this generation.", "We believe in our current distribution and made our in-store presentation a priority in 2007. One of the ways we helped our retail partners drive sales in the fourth quarter was by improving the way Under Armour is presented within our best partners. That processes had a positive effect on sales as we out the concept shops covering more than 250,000 square feet in the back half of 2007 alone. This is most visible in our largest partners like Dick's, The Sports Authority, Hibbett and Cabela's, but is also evident across our distribution channels in accounts like Sport Chalet. Telling our story at retail is an asset for our brand and we will continue to invest in our in-store presence with our best partners.", "Another great indicator of the strength of our brand, was our fourth quarter results in our online store in our first branded retail store which opened in Annapolis, Maryland in early November. We invested in both of these areas in 2007 to better understand how we can deepen our relationship with our consumer and the result exceeded our expectations in both cases.", "In the case of our online store, we are very pleased with our average selling price, which increased more than 13% compared to Q4 2006. Based on these encouraging results, we'll continue to invest our online store book by marketing and technology perspective. Our performance in our Annapolis store was equally strong as we are now able to sell comprehensive product stories in a brand focused retail environment. While we're still in the testing phase at the Annapolis store, we are encouraged about our results there and believe it's a right time to test 3 to 4 additional Under Armour branded stores in 2008.", "In the fourth quarter, our online and branded retail store accounted for 8% of revenues and helped drive our consolidated gross margins to the 52% level. There is more great evidence of the strength of the Under Armour brand. The effectiveness of our good, better, best strategy, which helped drive in improvement in our apparel ASPs of 8% for the full year, and helped us to maintain our position as the performance leader in the category. Our ability to enter new categories like golf and outerwear would provide great opportunities for us to gain share, in large existing categories. We bring UA technology to these categories and provide consumers and retailers with a new point of view on the business. And our 53% increase in youth for the full year, which was driven in part by strong growth in the core categories of baseball and football, and core products like Armour Fleece and ColdGear.", "To sum up, I'm confident saying that the Under Armour brand has never been stronger. We grew our top line more than 40% in a year where our new product introductions are relatively limited and most of our growth came from core categories. We had a very strong fourth quarter, selling through at full price and generating strong traffic for our retail partners. We had great consumer response for both our first branded store and our improved online site. We continue to make inroads in Europe as Peter Mahrer, who joined our team in July of '07, looks to build our authenticity as well as our retail presence that now includes more than 1500 doors.", "And most importantly, we expanded our position as the authentic performance leader and deepened our connection with the athlete of this generation. This brand strength is my primary source of confidence in the future of Under Armour. It's what empowers us to bring our consumer somewhere new, to take the Under Armour brand to businesses where authenticity and performance matters. And it's the reason we are so excited about the launch of our first line of performance trainers. This launch marked Under Armour's entry into the non-cleated footwear market and will be the cornerstone of Under Armour performance training.", "Maybe the best way to describe what these performance trainers are all about is to tell what they are not. They are not cross trainers, which in our businesses has come to stand for a nice comfortable shoe you might where while grilling up some burgers or mowing the lawn. This is footwear for today's athletes. The new prototype, who spends nearly 95% of there time training for that very important 5% of competition on the field, court, ice or track. And we build the technology into our footwear for that new prototype athlete. To start, all our performance trainers are lightweight for speed and they align with our heat gear fabric featuring our signature moisture transport system to pull sweat away from the athlete. The mid sole features directional cushioning engineering, which provides specific grip to support propulsion, depending on the type of athlete you are, they are meant to perform.", "To bring our story to this new prototype athlete, we've begun the most compressive brand campaign in our history. We selected May as the launch date to coincide around the training season where football begins. Football is a great asset for Under Armour and we see the new prototype campaign as a way to solidify our dominance in the sport. We began our strategy around acquiring football assets several years ago that plays out this spring leading up to our launch, let me take you through it.", "It began earlier this month with the first Under Armour high school all American football game that was broadcast on ABC where we brought the best high school players from around the country to play it in All Star game and declare their college of choice on national television. Next with the Under Armour senior ball, which aired last weekend, and features the best collegiate players in the country preparing for the NFL. We gave you our new prototype campaign this Sunday for the Super Bowl and what may be the largest television audience in American history. We then go back to grassroots with the Under Armour football combine, which takes the 15 city tour inviting the top 2 to 300 high school underclassmen in any city to participate at NFL locations. And we will of course blitz the media around the NFL draft in April, and all that happens even before the shoes are launched in May.", "Our strategy is to not just protect our position in football but the growth and learn as we bring you Under Armour story to new categories. We have been told that this launch is critical for the long-term growth of Under Armour and we agree. In fact, we vigorously agree. It's our authenticity with today's athlete that empowers us to lead them some place in new footwear. But it's important to understand that our Super Bowl effort is really just a start of a year long campaign focused on this new prototype athlete. We will tell the story through the launch of the footwear in early May and continue to communicate that performance message throughout the full year online, in-store, through grassroots and of course through product.", "We believe communicating that authentic performance story both on our grassroots and national level, around where we are going to take this generation of athlete is a critical element to our success. This is the next leg of the Under Amour growth story, the future of Under Amour. We have the right combination of a great campaign, great retail partners who have heavily invested in the launch, the right product positioning and most importantly, great product that will deliver against the demand of today's athlete. This launch will further authenticate the Under Amour performance story with athletes and position us in a new footwear category in 2009 and beyond.", "We feel confident about the investments we are making in this company; investments that will help generate large scalable business in new categories and geographies. We are not looking to take the express line of easy revenue growth that's unsustainable; we are building an infrastructure to support a multi-billion dollar company set on a broad-based foundation. The future of Under Amour is footwear, apparel and international. The future of Under Amour is sound, the future is ours and it begins Sunday night in the first quarter of the Super Bowl and we encourage you to tune in. Brad?", "Bradley J. Dickerson - Vice President of Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Kevin. I'd now like to provide some information around our fourth quarter and full year income statement. In addition, I will also discuss our 2007 year-end and 2008 outlook for some key balance sheet items.", "First, our income statement. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter grew 29% over the prior year quarter. This is largely driven by nearly 30% growth in our apparel sales. For the full year, our net revenues grew 41% to $606.6 million, driven primarily by 37% increase in our apparel sales combined with a 52% increase in our footwear sales. For both the quarter and the full year, we also had strong growth in our accessory sales and our licensing revenues.", "For the quarter, gross margin improved by 140 basis points to 52% from 50.6% in the prior year quarter. Primary drivers impacting the margin improvement for the quarter include the following. First, growth in our licensing and direct-to-consumer sales, which includes our website, catalog and retail stores, provided improvement in gross margins for the quarter. More specifically, our direct-to-consumer sales generally yield higher margin percentages through 80% quarter-over-quarter.", "Second, as planned since the beginning of 2007, we have been shifting dollars previously given as customer discounts to in-store marketing and SG&A.", "For the full year, gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 50.3% from 50.1% in the prior year, in line with our most recent guidance for 2007. Selling, general, administrative cost as a percentage of net revenues for the quarter was 35.8% compared to 37.5% in the prior year quarter. This 170 basis point decrease in SG&A quarter-over-quarter was driven primarily from a reduction in marketing from 12.6% of net revenues in 2006 to 11.2% in 2007. Similar to prior quarters increased investments in our growth initiatives, which include international, footwear and direct-to-consumer accounted for more than 40% of our quarter-over-quarter dollar increase in SG&A. For the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 80 basis points from 36.9% in 2006 to 36.1% in 2007.", "Marketing costs remained within our 2007 target range of 10% to 12% of net revenues, representing 11.7% of net revenues compared to 11.2% in the prior year. By leveraging some of our fixed overhead components, we were able to more than offset with 50 basis point increase in marketing for the year.", "Our operating income for the quarter increased to $28.3 million compared to $17.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 59%. For the full year, our operating income increased to $86.3 million compared to $56.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 52%, exceeding our previously provided outlook.", "Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 16.2% compared to 13.1% in 2006. For the full year, our operating margin increased 100 basis points to 14.2% from 13.2%. The growth in our operating income and improvement to our operating margin were driven by the strength in our top line and the leveraging of our SG&A spending.", "Our resulting net income for the quarter increased to $16.9 million from $11.9 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.34 compared to $0.24 in the prior year. Full year net income increased to $52.6 million from $39 million in the prior year, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.05, exceeding the preliminary estimate provided on January 17th.", "Now I would like to move on to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $40.6 million and cash net of debt was $26.3 million, ahead of our most recent outlook. For the year, cash net of debt decreased by $38.1 million. This year-over-year decrease was primarily a result of investments in inventory and capital expenditures, which I'll speak about shortly. For the full year 2008, we expect cash net of debt to remain relatively flat from our 2007 year-end balance.", "Net accounts receivable increased 30.1% or $21.6 million on a year-over-year, which was inline with our net revenue growth for the quarter. In 2008, we expect net accounts receivable to continue to grow inline with top line growth.", "Now I would like to discuss our inventory. Inline with our most recent outlook, inventory increased 9% from September 30th, 2007 to $166.1 million. For 2008, our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand, while improving our inventory efficiency. We expect to achieve this by first, being in stock on core offerings. Second, shipping seasonal product at the start of the shipping window in order to maximize the productivity of our floor sets; and third, earmarking any seasonal assets for outlet stores and operating those stores at a profit.", "Our inventory consists of three buckets: core, seasonal and prior. Core inventory, which represents approximately 60% of our total inventory, is available for sale over the next 12 months and beyond. In 2007, our strategy was to increase core fulfillment rates in the low 80s to the mid 90s on increased demand. This strategy led us to double our level of safety stock in core auto replenishment items. This strategy significantly impacted our top line growth. Additionally, we also took receipt of our entire season's ColdGear product by the end of October 2007 and take advantage of significantly favorable duty rates. This strategy has positioned us to receive a similar benefit for ColdGear and Fleet programs in 2008.", "For 2008, our strategy around core auto replenishment program is to continue to fill our demand at 90% to 95% while reducing the number of weeks of supply in safety stock. Through improved supply chain efficiencies which we tested in 2007, we are already beginning to make adjustments to safety stock level, and expect to see an improvement in core inventory productivity during the back half of 2008.", "Seasonal inventory, which represents approximately 30% of our total inventory, pertains to styles that will drop from our product line within the next 12 months. We generally purchase seasonal inventory based on visibility of future bookings. Our strategy for seasonal inventory is to set the retail floor at the start of the sell-through window. Our early receipt of spring 2008 products has put us in a good position to service that seasonal business.", "Prior inventory represent 10% of our inventory and pertains to drop styles which are earmarked for our retail outlet stores. For 2008, we plan to add 5 new outlet stores, bringing the total to 22 by year-end. It is worth noting that we currently do not cut product for our outlets.", "As we move to capital expenditures, we need to continue to point out that we are building the foundation for large scalable businesses. Our investment in capital expenditures for the fourth quarter was approximately $9 million, which brought the total to approximately $35 million for the full year, in line with our previous outlook. Our 2008 capital investments are planned at level similar to 2007, and will include approximately $15 million in our branded concept shop and in-store fixtures, $5 million in upgrades and improvements to our existing distribution facility, $7 million in upgrades and improvements to our information technology infrastructure including additional investments for our website, and the remaining balance in general corporate improvements to support our growth.", "In addition, as Kevin discussed, in 2008 we will expand our full price retail test. We anticipate adding 3 to 4 additional full price retail stores in 2008. The investment in these stores will represent an additional $5 million to $7 million for the year and brings our total 2008 capital expenditures to the $40 million to $42 million range.", "Now, Wayne will take you through the remaining outlook for 2008.", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Brad. First, I'd like to remind you that our long-term growth targets remain at 20% to 25% for both our top and bottom lines. Due to the strength of the brand in existing channels, the increased productivity of our new concept shops, the continued expansion of key customers and the ability of the brand to expand into new categories, we believe 2008 revenues and income from operations will increase between 26% to 28%. While we remain confident in our business and our long-term strategy, we believe it is prudent to consider the current macro economic environment in providing our outlook for the year.", "Our strategic growth initiatives remain the same. First, grow our men's and women's U.S. apparel business. Second, expand our footwear business by launching new categories while maintaining a disciplined approach to gaining market share in existing cleated footwear categories; and third, continue to build the Under Amour brand internationally. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned, based on the success we've had to-date with our web business and our first branded store in Annapolis, we plan to continue to grow our direct-to-consumer sales.", "Now, little more detail around these growth initiatives. Our apparel business will continue to be a significant part of our business for 2008. Men's full year growth is planned in the range of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%, while all other apparel businesses are projected to grow at an even faster pace.", "We had strong growth in apparel in 2007 and we believe additional opportunity can be captured in 2008 through strong order fulfillment within our core product offering, expansion of our lines in the training, golf, football and outdoor categories, continued innovation resulting in consumers moving into better performance products driving higher ASPs, and continued expansion of our larger strategic accounts into new geographic markets. The growth of our footwear business will be driven by the expansion of our Under Armour brand into new categories of footwear. The next phase of this plan begins with the launch of our performance trainer on May 3rd. We believe that success with this launch will position us to introduce additional performance footwear categories in 2009 and beyond.", "Internationally, we will continue to focus on Western Europe, with particular emphasis on the UK, France and Germany. We continue to believe that the long-term opportunity for the Under Armour brand internationally is as large as the opportunity in the U.S. and we will make the appropriate investments in people, brand and infrastructure in 2008 and beyond to reach that goal. We expect our rate of top line growth internationally for 2008 to outpace the company's overall year-over-year top line growth rate.", "For 2008, we believe that our direct-to-consumer sales which currently include our website, catalog, outlet stores and one full price test store will be an important contributor to our top line dollar growth and that even greater contributor to our operating income growth. Our first branded store located in Annapolis mall, which opened in November of 2007 has thus far exceeded our internal projections. We believe that there is more to learn about our full price retail opportunity and as Brad mentioned earlier, we are planning to open 3 to 4 new test stores in new geographic markets over the next year. Based on these growth drivers, we believe 2008 net revenues will increase 26% to 28%, resulting in a top line between $765 million and $775 million.", "I'd like to comment on the timing of our business. Historically, a greater percentage of our revenues have been recognized in the back half of the year, and we expect 2008 revenues to reflect a similar pattern to that which occurred in 2007. For the first half of 2008, we continue to plan top line growth in line with our full year growth targets. However, based on factors that I will explain to you shortly, we expect our 2008 earnings to be more heavily weighted towards the back half.", "Gross margin; based on the visibility that we have today, we believe that our gross margin for 2008 will show a 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement as a result of growth in our higher margin direct-to-consumer sales outpacing growth in our overall business, offset in part by our anticipated growth in footwear, which carries lower margins than our existing apparel markets. The margin impact of footwear will be most evident in the second quarter. We are planning gross margins to be lower than the prior year. However, we believe our performance trainer will carry higher margins than our cleated footwear business.", "SG&A; we will continue to make investments to drive the growth of the brand in 2008, while also investing in initiatives that will drive our longer term growth. First, let me begin with marketing. We believe that our marketing has a direct impact on our top line. In 2008, we plan to invest between 12% and 13% of our full year net revenues to tell our story and support major launches, specifically the performance training shoe in Q1 of 2008. It is important to note that our marketing line includes people, print and media, sports marketing, the amortization of fixtures and all our in-store marketing efforts. Additionally, we do all of our creative in-house.", "If you recall, in 2007, we shifted certain discounts towards improving the presentation of the Under Armour brand at retail, essentially representing a shift from margin dollars to marketing dollars. For 2008, we plan to continue the strategy and expect to open or reshape over 300 in-store shops with our best retail partners. We've said in the past that as our business becomes more diverse in terms of product assortment, gender, sport category, we would adjust the timing of our marketing spend to reflect a more balanced mix. Historically, we have spent approximately 40% of our marketing dollars in the first half of the year. As we have stated for 2008, we are planning to spend more than half of our marketing dollars in the first half to support our new prototype brand campaign. We will use this new prototype campaign as a platform to launch our performance trainer in Q2. As always, we will be opportunistic with the timing of our marketing spend and provide appropriate updates on marketing spend as we manage our business during the year.", "Below the marketing line, we plan to continue to invest each and every quarter in our strategic growth initiatives such as footwear, international and direct-to-consumer, putting the infrastructure in place to build large scalable businesses and to market the Under Armour brand globally. We have already seen these investments begin to pay off, with approximately 30% of our top line growth in 2007 coming from these new businesses. For 2008, we anticipate over 40% of our top line growth will be generated from these investments.", "As a result of our top line growth, we expect our fixed components of our SG&A to leverage and partially offset the increased spend in marketing, resulting in a 40 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues for 2008. Based on these projections, we believe income from operations will grow 26% to 28% in 2008, resulting in a full year range of $108.5 million to $110.5 million. However, based on the seasonality of our top line, the timing of investments, the impact of performance training footwear on the second quarter margins, our earnings in 2008 will be more back half weighted, we are currently anticipating the first half EPS to be in the range of $0.03 to $0.05.", "For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to 41.6%, up from 41% in 2007 and the weighted average diluted share count in the range of 50.5 million to 51 million. We are excited about the upcoming year, we believe our ability to continually invest in large scaleable businesses and the marketing to support these initiatives is paramount to our long-term success.", "Now Kevin, Brad and I will take your questions. Before we do, I'd ask that each of you try to limit your questions to one to two per person, so we can hear from as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Omar Saad with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. Couple of quick questions; first, can you kind of talk about why you decided to do a Super Bowl ad, it seems like a little bit of a departure from your previous approach to marketing the brand. Can you comment on that?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Hey Omar, it's Kevin. We talked on how much we should put even in the script, but let me just take a minute and walk you through what's going on with Super Bowl. First of all, the answer is it absolutely has no change to the strategy that we had before. The fact we see Super Bowl as the perfect venue to unveil the most highly anticipated product launch in our company's history. All of our launches that we've done in the past has centered around major media, but we've done it on things like ESPN where you can pick up 1.5 million to 2 million viewers at a time. It's the opportunity to unveil, it's the coming out party for more than a 100 million people, to introduce them to the Under Armor brand and again, this is not just a shoe commercial for this company, it's a brand campaign.", "And I think that's one of things that makes us so excited about what's coming up this Sunday. It's important for us to reiterate the fact that the spend we have falls within our 12% to 13% campaign for the full year. The new prototype is something again; it's much bigger than just a shoe campaign. So let me lay out for you the way and the idea we have, to really think about it in three phases.", "Phase one is the teaser [ph] which has been going on for about the last frankly several months, kicking off with both online as well as 15-second teasers that we have been doing across media. Phase two is what we call, the blitz and that's introducing the mothership. The mothership is what starts with the Super Bowl ad and again, this is not a... our marketing for the year should not be defined as a Super Bowl ad as much as that simply the launching pad for a year long campaign. Again, it's the unveiling of maybe one of the largest growth engine that we'll introduce as a brand.", "And Phase three is going to be what happens after Super Bowl. There is five components that we thought about to that. And its everything from major media with building around not only how do you translate the new prototype into just football and I took you through that in my script, as the way that we really took an approach of owning to score a football, but also how it translates into baseball, how it translates into field hockey, into lacrosse, every thing will take on the positioning of the new prototype.", "Grassroots campaign and again, we talked about our all American games that we have beyond just the sport of football, but all American lacrosse game, so all American baseball and softball games. Under Armour camps and clinics throughout the year in combines, the Under Armour senior ball, which just took place as well as the ESPY awards that we have coming up. In-store, which you're going to see out of retail as you will find all of our major partners we'll be engaging, all of the graphics will switch over to the new prototype. You have 90-day count down clocks that will be found at all the retailers beginning on Monday.", "Online, it's going to be our home base where we will continue to drive people and tell them the story about what the footwear is, you'll get the first look at it Sunday and people will be able to drive from there. And then also just the way that we are hitting kids, we are chasing just traditional media like a television commercial as much as things like the recent partnership we just did with Xbox, hooking up with things like Tom Clancy's new Ghost Recon, for instance, where you have somebody walking down the street, there will be Under Armour billboard inside the video game. So again, this isn't just one platform of a campaign, as much as it's multi platforms that will take place throughout the year. And frankly, for something as big and major, as Under Armour entering non-cleated footwear, we think it is completely appropriate.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Thank you, that's helpful. One more question if I could, on the full price store in Annapolis, I know it's just a test location, could you share with us if you could, any details around how that star store performed in the holiday and something you are talking about three to four new locations this year, how you are thinking about that channel?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Well let me start with the fact that we like our distribution today. And our distribution likes us very much. We want to continue to reiterate the fact that this is a test. When we talk about the test, there's a line of things we get out of stores. Number one, to capture [indiscernible] the lot of things we get on the stores. Number one, we placed the store in a place where Annapolis mall, for instance, it didn't have Under Armour distribution prior to us putting a store in there. And you think about whatever revenue we put up and we did exceed our plan and exceeded our expectations. We would have locked, I don't know 80%, 85%, 90% of those sales had we not had a store there.", "And you look at that, it's not exclusive to just the Annapolis mall, there is other locations out there where we believe we can be strategic with placing stores in the right locations. We believe that we are under penetrated at retail. And I think the mall channels are great examples of the fact that there are additional places for us to go where I believe with the breath of the product line that we have today, we can relevant to many more consumers. And again that also speaks to why open up at a venue like Super Bowl this week end.", "You know two or three years ago, I am not sure that an event like would make sense as much as today, we have the breadth of product to be relevant to more consumers and we believe it will pay dividends for ourselves and for our shareholders in the long-term.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Did the store have an impact on your wholesale partners in the area?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "We... frankly, the one of the reason we selected that was because of... again, because of the fact that we didn't have wholesale or some of our wholesale partners in close proximity. And the ones that we did, actually cuts your comp plus or positively for the year. So you know, it's that same... I think you heard two sides of that argument, but obviously from our side, we are pretty pleased with the fact that we can go and create a bigger brand presence and still drive sales not only in our own store but also for our surrounding partners as well, which you know something that hopefully will continue as we find more depth this year.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Thanks.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Okay thanks very much Omar.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Edelman with UBS.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Thank you. Good morning. Two marking questions; Kevin, has the timing... did the timing of the marketing spend change materially from the third quarter conference call?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jeff, this is Wayne. There is two things with that. First of all, for competitive reasons, we really wanted to control the release of any information around the brand. And Kevin kind of really explain on that, but the campaign around the performance trainer, we want to keep very tight. And secondly, our marketing consists of many components. It includes the retail, graphics, it includes the media and some of those decisions as related to the timing of our campaign, we made much later in the game, and that impacted our visibility.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay thank you. And then let me --", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Let me jump on the end of that well. I think it's a good example of what came out in brand week earlier this week as well. You had one of our competitors saying that they declared, they are now in the performance training, they calling it performance training, a) that they are going to announce or come out with their shoe a month before the Under Armour launch. If they are going to put the full weight of their brand behind the launch, they don't have a name yet, they haven't showed you shoe, they are giving you price points, but they haven't told anyone anything else. And you look and you think, because of those types of competitive environment that we are in and these people are good at what they do as well, if we had given them more notice, will they have had a name, will they have had a campaign, will they be going head-to-head versus one of the largest spend that we are going to invest in Super Bowl for instance, so we feel good about the competitive advantage that we put ourselves, we put our market to by coming out the way that we have.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "I understand. And then secondly, realizing how important is marketing is to driving volume, are you at risk with your marketing cut backs in the back half of the year in terms of driving volume or might we start to see a pickup there?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jeff, this is Wayne. First of all, marketing for the full year, we are going to be very disciplined with our top of 13%. I think it's important to know that I think I said in the script that over 50% is in the first half and there's certainly a significant amount in the back half. So in the past we have spend 40 in the first half and now we will spend little over 50. So still very positive marketing throughout the entire year and the brand campaign that we are about to launch in the first half will be a brand campaign that will resonate through the entire year.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay, great thank you.", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thanks Jeff.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robbie Ohmes with Banc of America Securities.", "Robert Ohmes - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Hey guys, couple of quick questions. Kevin, can you... I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Europe and Peter Mahrer and how different his approach is going to be versus the previous approach and then just my second quick question is in the core men's U.S. business, can you just walk us through the product extensions or how you get to may be 20%ish or better growth in just the core men's U.S. wholesale business in 2008? Thanks.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Yes thanks Robbie. So first of all, Peter joined us in July and has really hit the ground running. The strategy that we had in Europe, it hasn't frankly changed. First and foremost, there was three parts to that strategy. At number one, building the right team of people and obviously, Peter is a critical component to making that happen. And he is in the process of building his team and there's a good team in place in Europe to begin with. But I think expanding that and looking and saying, one of the things that we are engaging in over there now is a response team which basically put people in boots on ground in France, in Germany and the U.K. in 2008. So you are going to have these crack teams, they go to events and will be telling you Under Armour story, really taking a grassroots approach to it.", "Now the second component was building of intensity on field. And I think again, if you continue to open up the papers in Europe, you'll find more and more credibility, more and more authenticity happening and occurring on field. And one thing we are excited about is that we do project that we'll have some exciting new announcements about sports partnerships that would be loud and will be heard in Europe in the coming months.", "And then thirdly is establishing the appropriate distribution with good partners. We've expended now to roughly 1500 doors in and throughout Europe. Peter has engaged those relationships. And we are just coming off of or in the middle of a really strong ColdGear season. So I think there is good confidence in the brand, there's belief in the long-term our prospects and most importantly, probably most telling thing about our brand positioning in Europe is a) I give you that compression versus loose ratio. And it still it's about 4:1 in favor of compression. So we are still developing there, but more importantly, probably our fastest growing segment over there and one of our largest segments is our youth business. We believe that youth obviously is something that is a pretty good indicator of what are our long-term brand positioning in Europe is going to be.", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Robbie, it's Wayne. The second part was the increasing core programs and what I want to point out is first of all, our top line 26 to 28 for the full year as well as for the first half, and in the back half, we would be introducing some new programs. For example, have a fitted ColdGear, some additional Fleece programs and additional space with those programs at retail. And that's certainly for us drives our plan in the back half to be fairly substantial increase year-over-year. So in apparel, that's a big driver for us, the extension of fitted ColdGear, Fleece and more space.", "Robert Ohmes - Banc of America Securities", "And does that skew... the extended ColdGear and the Fleece, is that across men's, women's and youth or is it skewed towards women's and youth?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's mostly men's but it definitely crosses over.", "Robert Ohmes - Banc of America Securities", "Right, terrific. Hey thanks a lot, guys.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thanks Robbie.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jim Duffy with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Good morning Jim.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "FY '07 footwear revenue is $41 million in round numbers. How much are you expecting from footwear in '08? How much do you expect the prototype to contribute, just so that we have something to benchmark you again?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jim, it's Wayne. For us, in 2008, we're expecting approximately 1 million units which is, to remind everyone, 1 million units is an allocated program. So we've kept it fairly tight. It's allocated to our current customer base. It's about 1 million units and you look at the prices and our average retail price 89 to 100, so I think you could probably take it from there.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, very good. And then I think I may know the answer to this, but are you prepared to talk about this footwear concept that will fall on the success of the trainers in '09? What are some of the things you have in the works?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Yes. Hey Jim, I think that as we sit here today two days prior to the launch of the campaign and few months from actually having the product in the market, we are focused on delivering a great, great footwear campaign. I think the best measure of success for Under Armour in footwear at the end of the 2008 we sit there on New Year's eve of this year is going to be the progress that we made in building the foundation for a large scale of footwear business. We are going to be judge by how the brand is positioned at year end, the ability to enter additional footwear categories. So that question I think that too much of the shift has taken people into just focusing on running and basketball and training has been forgotten about.", "We mentioned the barbeque shoes. But we see the opportunity to reinvent that category, which is something call performance training. In addition, from that platform we'll give us I think the credibility to go into additional footwear categories. But our consumer continues to ask for it, we hear that more and more. And just one more anecdotal piece; coming off of the Under Armour all American high school game, the Under Armour all American or senior ball and you've got the best of the best of collegiate and high school athletes and when you have kids that are in one of the events we are able to give kids a pair of shoe and they are only taking the shoes off their feet and walking barefoot back to the room because they don't want to get there shoes dirty. They are taking photos of the shoes that they can't get and e-mailing them to a friend.", "So I mean the excitement or buzz we have around this campaign is where we are really focused right now, making this a success. And I think that we have learnt some things surround footwear that shows that being prudent about the projection we have. And is it a million unit? It's not a million unit launch, right? We are looking to sell much, much more than that, but its starts with one small step", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "So is it fair to say that you think there is enough work to be done in the training category, that's a multiple year program for you and things like basketball and running could be delayed even beyond '09?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Again, I think that there is opportunity and as I said it, in 2009, we'll re-evaluate that again. But look, I think we've got one more conference call before we even launch the footwear. So we will keep you abreast I think as that information comes in. But again, we spend the last year really building infrastructure. We spend the last year... apparel and footwear do not leverage. You know its one thing learns. The back office leverages and as you'll see on Sunday we believe the marketing leverages between apparel and footwear, but everything else to completely new supply chain, right. It's completely new... we've opened an office in... a quality office in China. We brought development in-house, we brought design in-house.", "We have fully flushed out and built a footwear team in the last 12 months and because of that, we are positioned and we are testing, we building product for additional categories. But I think we're going to wait and we are going to use market timing and positioning as appropriate time ahead into any of those additional categories.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Understood thank you very much.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thanks very much Jim.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brian McGough with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, hi thanks. Brian McGough. So I hate to nitpick on the '08 guidance because it really does sound like you guys are making the right overall investments longer term in order to boost the MPV as the brand. But if I look at first half, so earnings are down about 80%, it implies that the back half numbers need to be a better than say, 60%, which is just a big number. And that's a rate that you guys haven't grown since at least three years ago, when the company was about a third of size it is now. So with no margin improvement plan for the year, I am just wondering, I mean one part of the equation is within your control, which is marketing and OpEx, but the sales and gross margin aren't as much within your immediate control especially with days inventory where they are, so what kind of leverage do you have in back half of the year in order to pull to still hit your full year goals to the extent that sales are coming down a little weaker or margins are coming a little weaker on the gross margin line, just still get to that 1.30ish number to the full year?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Brian, this is Wayne. Let me give you first of all, some color. First of all, the first half top line growth of 26% to 28%, full year 26% to 28%. Secondly, I would expect our gross margin in each and every quarter to be improved with the exception of Q2, which I mentioned which would pretty much be lower as a result of footwear.", "The other thing I want to point out that our marketing. We've always said this, our marketing will be opportunistic with our marketing, but our marketing is a variable. It's 12% to 13% of our top line revenues, it has many components. So as we look at our entire year we have been very disciplined in staying within our 12% to 13%. Our ongoing investments, currently as Kevin mentioned, Brad mentioned, we have been investing in long-term large scaleable businesses. We have to continue to do that. We cant just slow down in the first half of 2008 because the top line revenue is more weighted toward the back, it is very prudent. But I also want to point out to everyone that within our SG&A there is a component in there, which is fixed and there's a component which is variable. And we will have the ability in our SG&A, if we see things with the visibility not to go where we plan; we could make the appropriate adjustments. So there is flexibility within the component of our SG&A.", "So I think the whole story is a) we are very, very confident with what we have today in our top line. We've looked at the macro economic environment, we looked at trends that we've seen in holiday or we see it so far, look at the current visibility we have with our retail partners and our own direct-to-consumers business and we take all of those together and I think we're providing a balanced outlook. So taken as a whole, I would say the flexibility to adjust if we need, is there. We're very confident in what we put out today.", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "So the adjustment if there were to be one in the back half wouldn't come out of marketing is what you're saying. It would come out of some other area that you have identified internally that you think you can tap into if need be?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Marketing is a variable and our top line is 12% to 13%, we allocate for marketing. So there is a component of our top line that we will stay disciplined. And there is also a component in our SG&A which are very valuable. It's variable and will be able to adjust both.", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "All right guys, thanks for taking my question.", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, Brian.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, just a couple of quick questions. And Wayne, first off, on inventory, I apologize I missed this right at the beginning. But in terms of your inventory fast going into '08, it sounds like you're going to maintain very high service levels in your core, you're also going to be taking down weeks of supply? Can you give us some sense as we move through the year for what level of the inventory will be... not specifically by quarter, but how we'll see this coming down and narrowing the gap between top line growth and year-over-year inventory growth based on the dynamics within core and seasonal as we move through the year?", "Bradley J. Dickerson - Vice President of Accounting and Finance", "Yes Jeff. This is Brad, I'll take that one. Just again, let's look at the three categories or buckets of inventory I spoke about in the script. First; core, which we said was about 60% of our inventory, sells through a full price only 12 months out of the year. As we talked about on our previous calls in '07, our order fulfillment rates in the prior year, late '06, early '07, we're in the mid 80s. So we really had a strategy to increase that safety stock level on core, so we can get our order fulfillment rates up to the mid 90s which we were successful in doing in the back half of '07 and even in some instances, above the 95% level of our fulfillment rates.", "Also we talked about bringing ColdGear in early, in October of '07 to take advantage of some of the favorable duty, rates we had for Singapore. So those were some of things we did in '07. As we look into '08 on the core inventory bucket, I think we need to be really smart about how we reduce those safety stock levels because you want to maintain those order fulfillment rates in the 90% to 95% range, which we think is an acceptable range. So we're working with reducing lead times and other strategies to do that, but we want to be smart about that. We really see right now that's really more of the back half of the all year improvement. And when we say improvement, we are looking at probably our inventory growing at a level less than our top line and that will happen during the back half of the year.", "When we talk about seasonal, we mentioned that was up 30% of our inventory, you purchase that inventory based on our visibility of our customer bookings. However, again based on certain products and lead times, sometimes we are ordering some product ahead of those bookings. So we can get better of that as we go into '08 here and improve lead times and purchase the inventory more along the lines of bookings. So again we think there is an opportunity in '08 to be more efficient in our seasonal side too, and obviously any excess seasonal inventory that we have, obviously go through our outlet stores which are accretive to our gross margin", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. So the inventory growth will be... very likely will be ahead and may be well ahead of the sales growth in the first two quarters, but we will see it moderating down close to that growth may be even dipping below in the second half?", "Bradley J. Dickerson - Vice President of Accounting and Finance", "That's correct Jeff, again we want to be smart about reducing our safety stock. Obviously, we don't want to do that too quick, we want to maintain those order fulfillment rates.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. My other question is on SG&A. There is some concerns near term that would likely be mitigated longer term with your strategy to go into these other businesses that it's going to require a stepped up level of SG&A for potentially the next two to three years as you really build out a footwear competency, meaning everything from R&D, their distribution house, expansion, people, marketing, because of more competitive environment et cetera. And then also international, I guess as that ramps up... takes a little bit longer and potentially could be more competitive. Kevin, how would you position that for investors? Is that likely to happen? Are you thinking that way that this SG&A build just may be required ahead of some of the revenue growth in these new businesses?", "Wayne A. Marino - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes Jeff, this is Wayne. What I want to first set out is we're going to continue to invest in large scaleable businesses and we've done so in 2007. And one of the points that I made was that if you look at our top line dollar growth for 2007, approximately 30% of our year-over-year dollar growth relates to the new investments. And in 2008 that will be close to 40%. So we are starting to see a return for our investors on the investment we're making in these new businesses.", "The other point to make is that for 2008, we are planning to leverage our fixed cost, so one of the benefits if you look at it in our SG&A is that, we are able to invest more money in marketing to launch a large campaign, largest ever and being able to take fixed cost and leverage those fixed cost so that we are able to take some of that marketing investments and pare it down.", "Second part to note in terms of the timing, the seasonality of our top line certainly impacts the leverage of SG&A. So it's important to know that one of the reasons... one of the things that is driving leverage in our fixed cost is our growth. So that's why it's paramount to continue to invest in that growth.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Hey Jeff, let me jump on the backend of that as well. And first of all, the first question regarding inventory, we are hyper aware of the inventory situation and more importantly, the way that it's viewed. And we obviously feel better about that with comprehensive look at what makes up that inventory, but you will see inventory improving from this company over the next 12 months. And I say that almost same time where we are investing in new businesses; we are getting into something as large and as footwear.", "So there is going to be times where it won't really look on overall basis, but where you'll see improvement, you'll see improvement from our core apparel businesses. And with respect to SG&A, we are a company who had 100 basis points to our marketing this year and it is something we're still looking for on a net basis improving that. As Wayne said, the businesses that we're investing in though, there is a reason that we're not in china today, right. There is a reason why we are focused where we are; men's, women's footwear, international. What we're doing with our e-commerce, our direct business. We're investing in large scaleable businesses right, and what that means for us is that we believe that will pay dividend for us in time and we believe that we will and have the ability to leverage in the near term as well.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Just one clarification on that and that was very helpful. In terms of the footwear specifically, over the next couple of year, there is not a substantial amount of fixed expense that you have to invest in order to say, take that footwear business and scale it up to $200 million to $300 million business over the next couple of years. I guess that's the fear that there is a big investment coming as you truly become more of a balanced footwear and apparel company?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "I think you've seen the investment takes place. You've seen the investment in frankly where... we've talked about footwear as being lower margins, for instance. If this is getting relationships with factories, this is doing business in Asia. We will be shipping our third year of football cleats this fall. We look to continue to grow market share there. We're entering... we are fully flushed in baseball. We're fully flushed in more of the niche sports like lacrosse and we see the opportunity with trainers to finally, we want to pay some of the dividends. Again, we didn't get into the footwear business to build football cleats. We build football cleats so we have the ability to expand into multiple additional categories and now that's how we see ourself and we are teed up to do and at this point, it's a function of design, the function of development, the function of really all of the qualities we already have. And at the same time, we will continue to build out the world class organization by attracting the best talent in the world, now for the sleekest best designs and the lightest and best performing footwear.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay thanks guys, good luck.", "Alex Miyamoto - Investor Relations", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. We will take our last question from Brad Cragin with Goldman Sachs.", "Brad Cragin - Goldman Sachs", "Yes good morning, thank you. As a follow-up to some of the infrastructure questions on footwear, can you just talk about how your management of that business is evolving and perhaps just to review with us how the cleated business is performing and how that experience is preparing you for the non-cleated launch now?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Sure. Hey Brad, this is Kevin. So let me start with one of the best successes I think we had in 2007 was finally splitting apparel and footwear and giving footwear its due. We took Rafael Peck, who had been our Head of Product Creation, and will now focus Rafael against our footwear initiative. We brought in Suzanne Karkus to head up our apparel side. So within footwear alone, it's been building out not only the existing categories of business that we have within cleated footwear, but it's maximizing in football, maximizing in baseball, and lacrosse and some of the other sports. And again the opportunity of getting into the non-cleated side, we do see leverage from both those business.", "But as I said before, apparel and footwear don't necessarily leverage. A lot of the investment that you felt from the company I think have been us getting into business. One of the best things I think that we've done, we've taken some of the lessons that we have learned. There hasn't been perfect for us in footwear, but at the same time at the end of two years, we've got the number two market position in football. We got the number two market position in baseball, and we are positioned now to enter the trainer market where some of you back we heard as why are you doing this, just to sell a million pair of shoes. And as I said earlier, it's much bigger than selling a million pair of shoes. What we want to do is, we want to get the first million, roughly million pairs of shoes in the market, sell them through, learn and then develop and we come back with generation two as well as put ourselves in position to expand beyond just the training category.", "Brad Cragin - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and then in terms of pricing trends across your categories, I should think about your good, better, best pricing strategy. Have you seen many changes in demand at any particularly pricing tiers and do you see any need to make adjustments for the current environment?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "One of the things I think that we have heard is from our retailers I think, we've all have heard it, is that performance apparel in general continues to be a driver out in the marketplace, and we of course, continue to be leading that drive. So with that, we continue to see the consumer, this is all part of the shift from cotton to performance, right; consumers continue to take that step and choose our brand.", "At the same time, we believe that what we put out there will continue to exceed our long-term growth rate of 25% and putting 26% to 28% growth out, is something that we believe is prudent for the current market environment and something that I think we'll learn more information as the year progresses. But we feel good about what we said to the market. We feel good about our growth prospects, we feel great about the way we position ourselves with additional large scaleable businesses, not only continue to grow our core men's and women's businesses but then looking at things like enter the new categories of footwear, it just going to be exciting.", "Brad Cragin - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great, thank you and good luck with ad campaign on Sunday.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Thanks very munch Brad. But it just starts Sunday.", "Brad Cragin - Goldman Sachs", "Well, good luck for the ad campaign all year.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman", "Okay, operator?", "Operator", ": Thank you. And that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate your participation.

Welcome to the Under Armour First Quarter 2008 Earnings Results Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Alex Miyamoto. Please go ahead.", "Alex Miyamoto - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming you to Under Armour's first quarter 2008 earnings call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.", "The words estimate, intent, expect, plan, outlook, or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

There you'll find this morning's press release and on our webcast page images of a number of the products and initiatives we will address on the call.", "Now I'd like to introduce the speakers and topics for this morning's call. Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO will address the drivers of our first quarter results and our strategy for continued growth in 2008 and beyond; Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer will then discuss the company's financial performance for the first quarter and provide an outlook on key balance sheet items; Wayne Marino, Chief Operating Officer will conclude the prepared remarks with an updated outlook for 2008 financial projections. After that we'll have a Q&A session that will end by 9:30.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Today I'd like to talk about industry leadership and how we are using our position as the athletic brand of this generation to ensure that we are building large skillful businesses that will help drive growth in our industry for years to come. Industry leadership for Under Armour means several things. First, it means being a leader in driving sales both for Under Armour and for our retail partners.", "This past quarter we continue to outpace the market in revenue growth and retail sell through. I'll give you the meaningful numbers on that in a moment, but know that our business is strong. Second, industry leadership means understanding where market opportunities exist and driving growth in those categories both here in the U.S. and across the globe. And third, industry leadership means taking the athletic consumers someplace new and recreating categories as we are doing with Performance Training Footwear. We believe the long awaited footwear debut were about to make this Saturday, May 3rd, will not only bring light into the long dormant category of cross training but also deliver excitement to the athletic shoe category and sporting goods as a whole, the lights of which has not been seen in nearly a decade. For Under Armour, this leadership requires the appropriate level of investments, to drive industry growth and excitement and equally important to deliver long-term benefits to our shareholders.", "I'd like to briefly address the first topic of driving sales growth. Wayne and Brad will provide more detail later, but the key take-away is that we continue to outperform the market in athletic apparel growth and continue to lead the ship from cotton to performance.", "Our apparel category grew 25% in the first quarter. Men's was up 20%, Youth, up 29%, and Women's, the Under Armour Women's business was up 36%. We also reiterate that full-year 2008 revenue growth will be in the 26% to 28% range. Most importantly, we believe our proven ability to drive growth within existing categories and the power that our brand gives us in our new categories such as Performance Training Footwear gives us confidence to continue to invest in the growth opportunities we see for this year and beyond.", "Two existing areas that we have identified as key growth drivers are Women's and Direct-to-Consumer, which includes our outlet stores, our website, and our branded store in Annapolis. From a short-term perspective, I'm pleased to report that both of these two businesses showed large increases year-over-year in Q1. In Women's, we proved once again that we are moving beyond being just the compression brand for female athletes. We believe our connection with the female team athlete and our focus on innovation has provided the opportunity for Under Armour to lead the industry.", "In Q1, we saw enthusiastic consumer response to our stronger color palettes and a strong retail sell through in Women's, including some of our key fitness items retailing in the $60 plus range. Our Women's Training revenues were over 30%, we saw strong sell through on our Sport Bras. It's important to note that our strength in Women's from a distribution perspective span across-the-board from our national sporting goods retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods and the Sports Authority to regional partners like Modell, the Cavany, and Hibbett to our business at [inaudible]. Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues were exceptionally strong in Q1, which we believe is the direct reflection of two key measures, the strength of our brand and the positive impact from our new prototype campaign.", "From a brand perspective, we believe the 57% growth in our online revenues is tied in part to the growing loyalty of the Under Armour consumer. Our core consumer has grown up shopping online, and we've recognized early last year that upgrading both our product assortments and our Web capabilities was essential if we are going to continue to grow with our consumer.", "Our online presence from the content for athletes for the shopping experience is a key measure for today's consumer. We have built brand loyalty on field and we have begun to build it online as well.", "The third area where we believe it's our responsibility to show industry leadership, and probably the most critical for our long-term growth is in new categories. Whether it's creating the categories we deal with compression or reinventing the category as we are doing with Performance Training, our proven ability to bring consumer some place new and create excitement for both our retail partners and our consumer is at the core of what we do. And I think there is no better evidence for this ability than the launch this Saturday of our Performance Training Footwear.", "While media has been playing a major role in priming the pomp for the past few months, the Groundswell has been growing in true Under Armour fashion in the field. It started with the Under Armour High School All-American Football Game on ABC in early January, and it continued with the Under Armour Senior Bowl, the true showcase of the top NFL bowl seniors, and shortly after unveiling Under Armour footwear to more than 100 million viewers who tuned in the highest rated super bowl in history, we saw our Web traffic more than triple any of our holiday peak periods.", "The interim results for the initial phase of the launch came through as our apparel sales increased online and in-store as thousands preordered their pairs to make sure they wouldn't miss outcome May 3rd. And for all you folks in the call of preorder, thank you for your business and you'll see here in just a few days delivered right at your doorstep. All along we have been on the road, testing the shoes of high school players of the Under Armour football combine. These combines held in 15 cities across the country at NFL facilities host the same type of best athletes and team leaders who told us 18 months ago that there was a lack of true training footwear out there.", "Now we have several hundred of these athletes in every city we're stopping, trying out the shoes and providing invaluable feedback before heading back to school to spread the word about the new Under Armour Training shoes. Meanwhile, members of Senior Management, myself included are hitting the road in checking up sales staffs in the shops we\u2019ve built within our biggest retail partners. Sales teams as large as 100 associates or more are now armed with digital downloads of the commercial interactive technology displays, stickers, pampers and posters based on one simple method to sell our very complex footwear technology.", "Stop Training in Running Shoes. You could probably tell how excited I am about this launch. We\u2019ve in-built the buzz around our Performance Training Footwear for five months now. The commercials have been running, the message is being told on every media platform, and we're connected with the kids on the field, in the gym, and throughout the campus. We reinvented the cross training category just because we saw the opportunity. We did so because it's that the heart of what we do well and it\u2019s the right step for us in building a large scalable business. We have invested much to get us to this point of launching our footwear this Saturday and we need to continue to invest if we are to realize the opportunities for growth that we see in new categories and new geographies.", "You heard me say it before and I'll say it again, Under Armour is a growth company, and the most exciting growth is still in front of us. We believe substantial opportunities exist in our key growth drivers of apparel, footwear, retail, and international. In apparel, you just need to look at our Women's business, which finished the quarter up 36% and still today only represents 26% of our total apparel business. From a channel perspective, we believe that there is significant wide space in the mall channel. We're currently in tough finish line doors and we'll be placing limited apparel assortments in a few stores within the Foot Locker group throughout 2008. This obviously positions us for what we believe could be a differentiated apparel approach and provides us with appropriate distribution for our largest future growth engine, footwear.", "We have launched our first retail store and we will continue to test this direct distribution in multiple venues, allowing us to be strategic with where we place the brand in the future to complement our existing distribution. The best indication of our future strength is that with all of this continued growth we have only just begun to extend it to other world markets. For growing our European business authentically with the recent signings of the Welsh Rugby Union and the Hannover 96 Football Club in Germany and our Japanese business which is presently run by a licensee seems to have just crossed the tipping point with a revenue model that we expect will grow nearly 75% this year.", "Meanwhile we have been able to move people from cotton T-shirts to performance apparel, from Regular Fleece to Click Clack and soon from Running Shoes in to Performance Trainers. And the good news, the greatest opportunity I'll mention this morning is that we have done all this without having sold a single T-shirt in China or India or South America, yes.", "I'll finish by saying this. We're cognizant of the present challenges in the U.S. retail environment, that's a reality, but with more than 95% of our current revenues coming from the U.S. we are proud to be able to post a growth rate in excess of 25% while simultaneously building a platform businesses for our future, both domestically and abroad. As we make the transition to become a truly global brand, we're excited about the white space that lies ahead, yet remained focus on investing in our growth drivers. That means, in addition to the framework for building outside of this country, we're counting on growth from all of our engines, and of course, the successful launch this weekend of Performance Training Footwear.", "Our big bucks sporting goods partners like Dick's and the Sports Authority are positioned with the shoes, and based on the early feedback, we believe that the launch looks promising. As we have stated in the past, the way that we would find success with our training launch is how we are positioned at year-end to enter additional footwear categories. This is more than a campaign, more than a new product line. We believe this launch will change the athletic shoe industry for ever. On a larger scale, we believe we have redefined once again how athletes prepare and dress for training and competition. And it's Under Armour's duty and privilege as the industry thought leaders to deliver this performance product to all athletes at all levels.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to provide some information around our first quarter income statement, as well as some key balance sheet items. First, our income statement, our net revenues for the first quarter grew 27% over the prior-year quarter. This was largely driven by 25% growth in our apparel sales highlighted by 36% growth specific to our Women's apparel.", "In April, we successfully implemented a new warehouse management system in our distribution center. As a result of the system switch, some of our customers elected to take shipments in March that were originally scheduled for the first weeks of April. As part of the shift and in preparation for our upcoming launch, a small portion of our new Performance Training footwear also shipped in March.", "In the first quarter, gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 47.6% from 48.7% in the prior year. The gross margin decline was a result of inventory reserves primarily on excess glove inventories identified this quarter. In addition, the margin impact of Performance Trainers in the first quarter was more than offset by the strong growth in Direct-to-Consumer revenues, which had a growth rate of 77%, continues to grow a faster rate, and achieve higher growth margins than our overall business.", "SG&A as a percentage of net revenues for the quarter was 44.9% compared to 35.8% in the prior-year quarter. On television, in print and in-store, our new prototype campaign has been ramping up in anticipation of our Performance Training Footwear launch this Saturday. In line with our previously announced plans, we're shifting a greater portion of our marketing dollars to the first half of the year to support the campaign and this was a major driver of the year-over-year increase in SG&A. Marketing increased from 11.1% of net revenues in the first quarter of last year to 17.8% this year. Also contributing to the increase in SG&A growth are increased investments and product innovation, employee equity compensation cost.", "Our operating income for the quarter was $4.3 million compared to $16 million in the prior year. Operating margin for the first quarter was 2.7% compared to 12.9% in the prior-year quarter. This decrease in operating margin was driven by our lower gross margins and the planned increases in SG&A as previously discussed.", "Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 40.3% compared to 40.6% in the same period last year. We benefited from a one-time true-up in the first quarter and expect our full-year 2008 effective income tax rate to be approximately 42.3%.", "Our resulting net income for the quarter was $2.9 million compared to $9.9 million in the same period last year. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.20 in the prior year. Our previous guidance was $0.03 to $0.05 in total for the first half of the year.", "Now I'd like to move onto the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $17.6 million compared to $40.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $57.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2007. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of investments in inventory and capital expenditures, which I will speak about shortly. For the full-year 2008, we continue to expect cash remain relatively flat from our 2007 year-end balance. Currently, we continue to have full availability on our $100 million line of credit facility.", "Net accounts receivable increased 21% or $17.4 million on a year-over-year basis, which was below our net revenue growth for the quarter. In 2008, we continue to expect net accounts receivable to grow in line with top line growth. At the end of the first quarter, inventory increased to $167.9 million compared to $166.1 million at December 31, 2007 and $80.1 million at March 31, 2007. It is worth noting that the inventory balance at the end of the first quarter included nearly $14 million of Performance Training Footwear in preparation for our launch this coming Saturday.", "We expect our year-over-year inventory growth rate to decelerate as we move through the year beginning with the second quarter. By the end of the third quarter, we expect inventory growth to be in line with sales growth, and by the end of the fourth quarter we are projecting inventory to grow at a rate below our annual sales growth for 2008. One item to note is that although we expect our year-over-year inventory growth rate to decelerate, in the second quarter, we expect our highest absolute dollar inventory balance of the year as we prepare for the start of our fall season in the third quarter. Wayne will discuss some of our inventory initiatives in more detail shortly.", "As we move to capital expenditures, we always like to point out that we are building the foundation for large scalable businesses. Our investment in capital expenditures for the first quarter was approximately $9 million. Our full-year 2008 capital investments are still planned at approximately $40 million to $42 million and will include approximately $14 million in our branded concept shops and in-store fixtures, $10 million in upgrades and improvements to our information technology infrastructure, which is an increase over our previous estimate, and includes additional SAP module specific to inventory and financial planning, as well as additional investments to our website. $5 million in our upgrades and improvements to our existing distribution facilities, $10 million for the build-out of new outlets and additional full price test stores, and the remaining balance in general corporate improvements to support our growth.", "Now Wayne will take you through our remaining outlook for 2008.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our outlook for 2008, I would like to spend a few minutes on our inventory strategy. Kevin spoke earlier about the strength of the Under Armour brand. The brand connects with the consumer even in the face of a difficult economic environment and all of us in the organization are focused on protecting and growing this brand.", "One component of this is controlling the presentation of our branded retail. In order to more quickly address current and future seasonal excess inventory, we have put a plan in place to sell more of the seasonal excess product through our own outlet channel. As a result of this strategy, we have lowered our target gross margin for the outlets. Doing so allows us to move units through our existing outlet base at a faster rate, but having a negative impact on our full-year gross margin outlook in 2008.", "I should point out that our outlet gross margins are still well above our overall company gross margins. In addition to this tactical decision to more efficiently sell our excess seasonal products we are now planning to open nine retail outlet stores in 2008 as compared to our original plan of five stores.", "The combination of this outlet strategy along with the initiatives we already have in place to reduce the safety stock levels on core auto replenishment items is expected to result in a slowdown in the rate of inventory growth as we move throughout the year. In addition to these tactical initiatives I just outlined, we are at the same time putting measures in place to improve our operational efficiency. Specifically we are putting systems and processes in place to improve our production planning process. We have recently implemented an S&OP or sales and operations planning process that gives us added visibility and control to better manage our inventory. This process allows us to better link the forecasting and sales sides of our organization with the production planning functions. To complement this process, we are also investing from an IT infrastructure perspective.", "Coming off the heels of a successful warehouse management system implementation, we have also invested in SAP\u2019s inventory and financial planning modules. The combination of new internal processes and new technology will help us operate faster, smarter, and more efficiently as we continue to strive to be a great growth company coupled with strong operational efficiencies. We have confidence in the skills and talent of our team, and we believe the approach we are taking will not only allow us to achieve the inventory targets, Brad, outlined earlier, but also lead to greater inventory efficiency in 2009 and beyond.", "Now I'd like to move onto our outlook for 2008. First, I would like to remind you that our long-term growth targets remain at 20% to 25% for both our top and bottom lines. As you can tell from our first quarter results, the Under Armour brand continues to resonate. Even with over 96% of our 2008 revenues coming from a challenging retail environment in North America, we continue to be a growth leader in our industry. We are able to do this because consumers are still trading up the performance products and so liking our brand. As a result, we are reiterating our 2008 full-year net revenue guidance of $765 million to $775 million, which represents 26% to 28% growth over 2007.", "The outlook for our strategic growth initiatives remains the same. We continue to expect our Men's apparel business to grow in the range of our long-term growth targets of 20% to 25%. Additionally, our Women's and Youth businesses are expected to grow at an even faster rate, much as they did in the first quarter.", "As Kevin mentioned, we are preparing for the launch of Performance Training Footwear this Saturday. We continue to project this to being a 1 million-unit program in its first year. But what is most exciting is the opportunity we see to grow this category of positioning us to introduce additional performance footwear categories in 2009 and beyond.", "We remain excited about the opportunity in Europe and the progress we're making in diversifying our account base, which has grown to over 1,700 doors. From a distribution perspective, we continue to focus on authentic, sport-specific distribution, and our goal with big bucks specifically is to further develop our share of shelf space with existing partners. Additionally, we recently announced signings with the World's Rugby Union and Hannover 96, a German soccer league club. These sports marketing deals are our first official kit supplier deals in Europe and they give us an authentic presence on field in two of our key markets, the UK and Germany.", "Given the retail component of these deals, we believe these signings are sound investments. However, some of the best reactions we've gotten is from our customers who have shared their excitement about the impact that this kit have on our brand presence in Europe. While our international revenue in the first quarter was impacted by one of our major accounts in the UK, we continue to expect our rate of top line growth internationally for 2008 to outpace the company's overall year-over-year growth rate. I want to point out that international is in an investment mode and we are willing to be patient to grow this business for the long term and be authentic.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer channel continues to be a strong performer across the board. Whether you are talking about the web, outlet or the single full price tester we have in Annapolis. We continue to believe in the opportunity this brand has to communicate and connect directly to the consumer. For 2008, we are planning to test at least two additional full price retail stores.", "For the first half, we continue to project top line growth in line with our full-year growth targets of 26% to 28%. Based on the updated outlet strategy I laid out earlier along with the gross margin detail, Brad provided regarding the first quarter, we now anticipate our 2008 full-year gross margins to be approximately 50% or 30 basis points lower than 2007. We expect any gross margin impact from the increase in footwear to be largely offset by the growth in Direct-to-Consumer business.", "We will continue to make investments to drive the growth of the brand in 2008 while also investing in initiatives that will drive our long-term growth. Part of what has made this company great is our belief in the opportunity of this brand and our willingness to invest to capitalize on that opportunity. And for 2008, our plans have not changed. Consistent with what we have stated the last two quarters, we're still planning to invest at the high end of the 12% to 13% of net revenues for marketing in 2008.", "This investment will support the launch of our Performance Training Footwear, the installation of additional concept shops and also encompasses our most recent college signings in the U.S. and our professional team deals in Europe. This 12% to 13% of net revenue range although in line with our previous outlook is higher than 11.7% of net revenues we invested in marketing for the full-year of 2007. However, we still expect to offset much of the increased year-over year investment in marketing by leveraging certain fixed components of our SG&A.", "Therefore consistent with our previous outlook, we're anticipating a 40 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues for 2008. Although our top line and SG&A investment outlook remains the same, the impact of gross margins I mentioned earlier results in a revised outlook for the income from operations. We now believe 2008 income from operations will grow 20% to 21% for a full-year range of $103.5 million to $104.5 million. For the full year, we now estimate our effective tax rate to increase to 42.3%, up from the previously projected 41.6%. Our weighted average diluted share count is still estimated at 50.5 million to 51 million shares.", "We are excited about the future of this brand and the opportunities as available to us in apparel, footwear, international, and Direct-to-Consumer. For 2008, we will remain focused on executing our plans to drive growth while laying the foundation for growth in 2009 and beyond. While our business environment may change, our belief in our brand opportunity does not. This belief drives our conviction to make an investment in our business each and every quarter, each and every year.", "At this time, Kevin, Brad, and I would like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Melissa?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go for Jim Duffy with Thomas Weisel.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Thanks. Hello, everyone.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Good morning, Jim.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jim", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Can you guys help me out and kind of itemize the factors that are resulting in change of the gross margin guidance? As I hear you're talking about your outlet revenue being higher margin and increasingly, the number of outlets that you are having kind of countering into the gross margins are going in the opposite way?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I think... Jim, this is Brad. As what you've said, two things really are causing that. One was the first quarter results. And two on the outlet side it was more or less what we anticipated the outlet margins to be in our original outlook compared to our change in strategy a little bit to push more units through the outlet at a lower margin. So it's not more or less the year-over-year outlook on the outlet business as much it is a change what we expected.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And Brad, can you detail what the write-down on the gloves was, and where do you see the inventory reserves at the end of the first quarter?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, on the excess glove issue, Wayne talked about some of the initiatives that we are working through to fix our processes going forward, to improve our processes going forward. And a lot of these improvements are going to have positive effects on some of these issues, like the excess gloves. But in this issue is really around the fact that there was some capacity issues at our factories that manufactured these gloves, and what that did is it caused us to have to order these gloves to a sales forecast. It really didn\u2019t have bookings behind at that time because in the capacity issues, we are ordering low demand. As we have more visibility into the sales number and bookings, that sales forecasts came down after a lot of the items were built already. That really caused us to have some excess gloves over and above what our sales forecast was a better visibility. Typically, we would use our outlet strategy to liquidate some of this excess inventory, but this is a kind of item. It doesn\u2019t move very well through outlet. So we'll continue to attempt to work the balance of these items down through a normal channel going forward.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "What was the impact in the first quarter?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "On the inventory?", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Yes.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "While, if you think about just three things...", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "On gross margin actually, Brad. And then question on where you see the inventory reserves?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. As far as the effects on gross margin in the first quarter, pretty much the whole difference in the quarter year-over-year was due to this inventory reserve, because the Training Footwear and the positive impact of the Direct-to-Consumer pretty much offset each other. That's first of all. Second of all, as far as inventory reserves go, our inventory reserves, if you remember, with our outlet channel and the apparel side of our business, there is a lot less in a need for inventory reserves on our apparel business, because we have a good avenue to liquidate that product. So most of our inventory reserves that we have right now would be for specific things that we would think would be difficult to move through outlet channel, like the gloves.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Jim, this is Wayne. Our outlet strategy has not changed. The strategy is in place to move through seasonal excess inventory. So in the past I talked to you about our core strategy, and our strategy around core has not changed. Our core product right now sell-through it full price and we have been on a plan to reduce the number of weeks of safety stock in our core product. And we're continuing to do that successfully. I think one of the drivers toward reducing our inventory to a lower level that Brad mentioned by year-end is achieving that initiative. In terms of seasonal excess and this is one of the reasons why we don't have an inventory reserve that we would increase is because the outlets channels, that's the sole purpose of their existence. But there was the glove issue and this glove issue was something that didn't come up in the quarter, we addressed it immediately. So, we feel like right now we've looked out for the year and wouldn\u2019t need to make any further adjustments to inventory reserve.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. Very good, thanks.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Yes. Thank you. My question is on sourcing. If you could just update us on your current sourcing structure, I know a few quarters ago, we were looking at shifting some of that here back over to Central South America and just wanted to know, where we stand today, how much of it is actually coming in China. Any sort of trends you are seeing out there in the inflation of your product, either the petroleum based nature, or more importantly just inflation coming out of the country, the FOB destinations?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Jeff, hi, it's Wayne. Yes, first of all, good news is that for 2008 our sourcing group has locked in the prices. So I feel very comfortable that for 2008 what we have planned, what we have forecasted is real and it\u2019s good. 2009 at this point is a little bit too early to tell, but there is... as far as our apparel is concerned, we probably have at this point less than about 6% of our apparel comes from China. So, we are fairly diversified throughout the world and the group will continue to look for other areas outside of the main hub of China to be able to source. So we think we're pretty well positioned in terms of our sourcing. Central and South America has been a large sourcing base for us. I think about 20% Central and South America, Mexico has been about 15%. So, that's how we see it at least 2008 would be too early to call right now.", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. So, at this point your product itself and your labor contracts or manufacturing contracts are all locked in for the balance of '08?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "That's correct.", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just one other question on your Women's product, I understand you're having great success this year with that in terms of the growth rates, and is there anything in particular you can point to, I know you pointed out a couple of key categories, but anything else in terms of feedback from retail, changes you've made in the styling of the product, the color of the product, or any sort of flow initiatives that they're pointing to by saying, this is really helping us, helped you grow that category, that would point to that accelerating or continuing to the balance of the year?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Hi, Jeff, this is Kevin. Yes, I think, probably more than anything, it's just the fact that we've been doing it for a period of time now. The [inaudible] that we probably began in the Women's business with four or five years ago of shrink it and pink it, it's something that we significantly evolved into being a legitimate Women's brand. I think that's coming to light with the, I think, the pallet that you see on the floor. In fact, the... that consumer, she's always been there for us, she's just been walking over to our pat and say, give me a reason to buy. And I think, when you look at the assortments that we have out on the floor right now, and in our Q1, which I'll see really throughout 2008, and especially with the addition of Suzanne Karkus, who is now on board heading up our apparel group as a whole, I think you are only going to see that get better. So, we were out I think from account business in the past week, and the excitement on the floor is something that they'll certainly give us that ahead that says looks like you guys are falling short to figure it out. So, I think we're pretty proud and this isn't a one-quarter wonder.", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Good morning, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Can I ask two quick housekeeping questions? One, how much of the Performance Trainer shoe shipments got pulled forward from 2Q to 1Q and then, could you give the inventory breakout, the core versus seasonal that you usually give?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Omar, it's Brad. As far as the Performance Trainer that we shipped in Q1, if you recall, we said we do about a million pairs in 2008, the Performance Trainers, and the amount that shipped in Q1 was a little bit less than 10% of that.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "And secondly, sorry, what was the second question, again?", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "The inventory breakout, kind of core versus seasonal, is a kind of a metric you guys have been giving the last couple of quarters.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, pretty much... it's pretty consistent with previous quarters.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay. On the marketing spend, you guys actually spend a little bit less than I had expected in the first quarter. But you're still looking for that high end of 12% to 13% for the full year. Can you talk about... there is still kind of a 60-40 first half, second half and what's the strategy there behind the Performance Trainer launch? Should we expect more coming in the coming week [inaudible] stores? And how do you think about, if you have any launches planned for early next year, how do you ensure you got enough investment to support those launches later on this year?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I\u2019ll start off. This is Wayne. Just some clarity around the timing of the marketing spend, if you look in more out of 50-50 first-half, second-half and how we spend those dollars. In terms of how we'll apply those dollars in the launch, I mean, I\u2019ll let Kevin take you through the Performance Trainer and how we're going to talk that story through from early in the year until now.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Omar, so, which you saw was a fairly kick-off a yearlong campaign that began with super bowling, right? And that wasn't something that\u2019s not to be, this is the campaign summed up in 60 seconds as much as, you are starting to see that penetrate through. I mentioned in my script how we started with the Under Armour High School All-American Game, then with the Under Armour Senior Bowl. Now I mean, probably one of the needless things we are doing with this in 15 cities Under Armour combine tour, which is basically we go to... and we're done about five of them so far. But we pull our presence two weeks ago, I was down in done in Dallas at our Dallas combine. We're at the Dallas Cowboys Training Facility in Irvine, Texas. We had a little more than 200 athletes that were at this facility. Two out of the\u2026 invite only the top 2 to 300 high school kids in the area. And we [inaudible] pair of socks and what we bring is really the theater to this event. And we are timing at the same way that the college gets through and the pros due to this combine, and we can pull up, we got a 40-foot Buck's wrapping graphics, we got 18 wheelers at our wrapping graphics and really the only thing that since inside of these 18 wheelers they are basically empty. But it's a bump creating the theater that happens in and around these events. So what we do is, I think that's been something really exciting, more importantly we\u2019re getting our products on these kids for getting the shoes on Kids Ski. The next thing we're doing is that probably is obviously until launch this weekend. Like I mentioned, we are actually were out at stores and all these things happening throughout really the first half of the year. Our positioning ourselves think to tell a great story, which is at Stop Training in Running Shoes. Another thing I've seen that we're doing is not only, in addition to our own money, as we're also partnering with some of our accounts. One of the things we have it on TV right now is a co-branded spot with sporting goods, promoting against the launch, see that through... not only what we're doing in the front half of the year but you also see more of that type of co-branded marketing that will take place in the back half of the year. So really in addition to the dollars we spend which... it's Wayne and the Brad's point, we see, stay consistent with that 12% to 13% and it will be much more balance to that 50-50 type of balance front half, back half. We find ways I think that we will be able to bolster not only the training launch, and again we've got a launch factory, we got a next iteration coming out in July and then we got Generation II product that will be launched in November this year. So all of those we feel good about having the right amount of dollars reserved in and ready to launch and tell great stories around that product.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay. In terms of kind of moving from a 60-40 target to more a 50-50 target, is there... is that... what drove that kind of slight shift in the allocation there? Are there launches we should be thinking about for the beginning of next year or is it just looking at a more even way to lay out the communications with consumers?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Let me drive home the point is that again the way that we are going to define success in Training Footwear is our position at year-end to enter additional categories. So I think that the opportunity is there for us to enter additional categories, but we're going to do a lot more after Saturday. And in order to be clear, as we think about sort of success and to find that, I'd say that, Click Clack was probably one of the most successful campaigns in the last five or ten years. And it wasn't something that surprise for me, the opening Saturday that we launched the product. It\u2019s up four, six, and eight weeks for us really to get a handle, and for the consumer to buy into the program. Yes, I just want to make sure that sort of sets people's expectations of what... how we're defining success is that it's really going to be into June, and really the first part of July before we say, hey, how did we do? And as we're come back with the next generations of products, again that will position us in... yes, I think there are some other big categories that are out there. And if we do things right, and as we say are focus right now, is making sure trainings successful. But without question, those larger categories are running in basketball, they are out there, and it's a matter of our brand being ready, and most importantly the product being ready.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Thanks a lot, Omar.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Good morning. A question on footwear, to start off on the Cleats, if during the first quarter, you shipped a little bit less than 100,000 units of Performance Trainers, would that imply that Cleat sales were essentially flat year-over-year?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, this is Wayne. One of the things that we start off with is in the Cleat business out at retail, we are very, very happy with how we are performing. Football Cleats, 24%, 25% market share, baseball Cleats, 14% to 15% market share. One of the things we did after the initial launch is that as a wholesaler we ship or we believe is a little too many, too much product into the market. And as a result, we had to let the market wind down with that product to our customers. Hasn't changed our position in the market as number two, and we're very happy where our position is. However, to be prudent and not put too much products in the marketplace, we've certainly have been tampering down those shipments and that's what you're seeing in Q1 as far as our Cleated footwear. But, I want to really remind you that the success we've had at retail specifically in the Youth shoes have been very good, and our market share is consistent year-over-year.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "And Wayne, I believe that this year, you are due for new model and football cleats. Is that correct?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, what we typically would do was we'd run our Cleats for two years, we\u2019d have two year styles, and so we'll introduce new models and that's the way we will keep fresh, and then the good news with that is if you have a two-year style and you put it out as an opportunity to have those sales run more than just one season.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "But the molds for those shoes for the most part... and then that's what the cost is, and you can still spin new offers. So, for instance, one of our most profitable shoes on the kids side is a product we call the Hammer. And reason the same outsource or the same malls we'd continue to amortize those malls, as well as the spinning new offers that have given us a fresh look for kids and they come back at retail.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Okay, Kevin, I guess, just one of the questions I had regarding the Performance Trainer and thinking about the performance of the football Cleats and the baseball Cleats is that when we think that Under Armour would have stronger competitive advantages with on the field Cleats than off the field Cleats. So what do you do differently and how you allocate Performance Trainers so that we don't see this drop-off in unit growth like we had Cleats in the last couple of periods?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Well, I think it starts with us beginning with a fixed and an allocated number of units. We've been pretty disciplined about that. I think, our answers have been pretty consistent, as well as to the approach we have to take the amount of product we're going to put in the market. More importantly, though, you can sell a football Cleat to a football player. You can't sell it to somebody, the new supplier or one supplier, it's... and most of you will have one pair, it's just in the classic.  We believe that not only is AR athlete training in a different way, but more importantly, the reason that this campaign has moved to this concept of stop training in running shoes, we believe that there is a lot of people out there that are looking for frankly a brand like Under Armour could tell them how to train. Again the scenario we use is walk into a gym, you know if there is ten people and then count the number of people that are training in running shoes. And I, then I challenge them and say if it's 16-year old kid, and how many of them are doing in just linear motion like an elliptical machine or a treadmill. These kids are training today, so I decided lateral mobility. And that idea calls for a different type of shoe and so, the fact that nobody knows what a training shoes is, today six-year old has no idea of what cross training even was or was it a category. Again it has been relegated to that, 45-year old who spend a $50 at Kohl\u2019s on a basic training shoe. So I think our ability to redefine that space and redefine that category for today's athlete is some that, again, this is only a launching point for us that we think, A, it provides credibility to the marketplace and shows that we can sell products and non-Cleated product to the consumer. But like I said it also positions us to head into additional categories as we move forward.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Okay. Kevin just the last question I had for you. You had noted that you're visiting with a lot of your customers in the last few weeks. What are you learning about the retailer\u2019s response to the weakening economy as what they're doing with purchase orders and request for return privileges?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Well, first of all, it\u2019s, let me reiterate that there is no question, there is, we are in a different economic environment, particularly for the Under Armour brand where 96% of what we are doing is here in the U.S. Yet even with that the type of headwind we are able to click 27% growth on the board. We are very proud of that because if you look at 2008, our approach is we want to make sure that we are dealing with all of our operational issues. And that's why I think you've seen some of the adjustments that have been made around inventory and are being more aggressive in 2008 as well. So 2008 will be a long year, but more importantly we think that we're going to get through a jiff fine and being able to reiterate that fact that we are a growth company. Under Armour is little unique. We've got a lot of different levers for growth. And you're going to see that a) what we put up in Q1, and you're going to see that again, what we put up in Q2. As we reiterate that 26% to 28% growth and that the value and the importance that Performance Training is going to play to our growth story. And that means us pretty unique. Our retailers, they have made adjustments throughout the first quarter, but frankly we think that we\u2019ve seen all the adjustments throughout the full year. The environment out there is not getting easier, but we're not necessarily seeing it getting any more difficult either so, the thing that probably gives us greatest strength is, A, when you\u2019re out in the stores, and you're talking about consumers, you're watching shop and buy, when we're hearing that the excitement that's building up there for our training program, and frankly I think that that will be a real asset to the sporting goods channel as well as that remember we've got, this launch is excluded to the sporting goods channel. And it's going to give a real point of differentiation of hopefully helping to drive additional foot traffic in their stores as well. And then you know again, the one thing, I think we sort of glaze over was our own Direct-to-Consumer business, which as a total was up nearly 77% for us, our web business alone up 57%, our consumers looking and shopping for our brands. It's not to say that we are excluded from these times, but we're doing a heck of a lot, I think we are leading the charge when you look sort of the performance of Under Armour, again, and what's defined as pretty difficult market out there.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Thanks very much, Dan.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Hi, Kate.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm just trying to better understand why you're products through your outlet store, lower prices, did retailer shift back products to you during the quarter or have you seen a cancellation in orders or was it\u2026 is it just a matter of having [inaudible] on the books this year?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Kate, this is Wayne. First, retailers definitely as Kevin said they are being cautious with how they manage their inventory. And they should. For us, what we've always had is our outlet store strategy has always been to move through our seasonal excess. And that hasn't changed. But the one thing in this environment today that we think is prudent is looking at our current and future seasonal excess is not to let that get backed up. We think it's smart to be able to move that seasonal excess through our outlets, and so what we've done this year is nothing different than the past except we've accelerated that through our outlet stores. Again, we are taking into account the current environment, the fact that our retailers manage their inventories a little bit tighter this year and we're looking at a channel that protects our brand, operates at a profit, and has a higher overall margin than our business. So it is the strategy for us not to hold that seasonal excess for a long amount of time and that's the driver behind it. I think the other point is that in last call and I've talked about our strategy around core. That strategy has not changed. Our core inventory, which we sell through at full price in our retail stores, that strategy has been to reduce safety stock, and we've been successful at reducing that safety stock for our HeatGear and in a few months we\u2019ll be successful in reducing that safety stock around our Cold Weather Gear and the result of that core inventory strategy is really going to be impacted in the third and fourth quarter as Brad elaborated on in our inventory levels.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "But again, Kate, this is Kevin. You're not going to find sort of a\u2026 we've build these franchise businesses, we\u2019ll have real house businesses here like our $25 HeatGear T-shirt or $50 Cold Gear mark. But now you are not going to find those basic products in white, black and navy blue, markdown either in our own retail stores or frankly anywhere. These are consistent really staples to our product line there. Frankly, we just... we have a lot of it, and so we don't... we're doing in the outlets since we are moving through more of that seasonal product and you're not finding additional of those core basics. We're just... we're not making as much frankly, which is, it\u2019s a little bit tighter on some of our manufacturers, but that's what partnership is all about. So we see again, using 2008 to put ourselves back in line and heading into 2009 as we come out of this thing, we think we're going to be really positioned well and for strength.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Okay. Going to some of your comments about Europe, you said in the past that Europe is going to contribute more significantly true business in 2009. Are you still expecting that and how does the macro environment change this perspective and then finally, can you give us a little bit more detail behind what happens to one of your accounts in the UK that you had mentioned in your comments?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Yes, Kate, let me just start off, and then again when we reiterate what our strategy in Europe is and it's in three parts. Number one, still the right team of people, we've got Peter Mahrer in place, and again, Peter just joined our company in July. So, as he sits here, eight, nine, ten months into his tenure, we feel really good about the future for the brand. The second thing is building our [inaudible] on field, the signings in Germany of Hannover 96 and the World's Rugby Union, I mean these are big deals, I don't think we're giving enough really credit to of just the fact that our brand is accepted. These more deals that we are done because we wrote the biggest check. These were deals that were built on relationship and really what we can bring, our brand can bring to these sports assets. And then the third piece is the appropriate distribution. Now 2008 for us in Europe, I don't know if there is much headwind that we are feeling we got a macroeconomic standpoint coming from UK although... or Europe in general, although it's been just primarily a pretty difficult retail environment on any front. At the same time, we've got to this thing as we said, we've expanded our door count stores to nearly 1,700 doors now. So, we're in the places that we want to be, and I think what you'll see is that as we continue to evolve our merchandising mix as it continues to continue to evolve our European sizing. The most challenging thing for me and I was in... I went and did some market visits with Peter, and we're actually in St. Louis [ph], France and we went to a golf sport. We went about 20 of their doors, I think they got about a 130 or 140 stores total. And we are testing in about 20 of their stores, and just talking of the store manager there, there is four or five brands that are showing performance of technical products, and frankly, we don't spend a lot of money in France, we don't have the assets there. But with the second selling performance brand in that market, and literally is one and two and then there is nobody else, and we just, we haven't really gotten it right yet. And what I can tell you, and I guess that's why a sort of the message that I brought and as we think about our growth is the places that we haven't been as much as the places that we are and then what we're doing now. And then as we apply focus and really get our arms around Europe and particularly those markets of France, Germany, and the UK, I think we feel really good about the acceptance of the Under Armour brand, and really what that can mean for us going forward.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Kate, this is Wayne. Just jump in, we're not going to talk about a specific customer, but the one thing in\u2026 with Europe is we have to be patient and it's in the early stages and we're going to have quarterly fluctuations, but some of the good news for us is even having that quarterly fluctuation relating to one customer in the UK. When we signed the two teams that we did this year, we noticed a substantial pickup in revenue that makes up for that change in the UK in Q1. So, there is going to be movement either way, but I think the one thing I want get it to take away is that Europe is an investment for us, we have to be patient with it. It'll be an investment for 2009, but the foundation is right where we wanted to be, and each and every year, we should start to see good strong growth coming from Europe.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "You're welcome.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Thanks, Kate.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Edelman with UBS.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Thank you. Good morning. Getting back to the gloves, just one question. If we think about the markdown or the reserves you\u2019ve took in the first quarter and then if we look at the volume of accessories done, first quarter, second quarter, it seems like an unusually large reserve for the amount of volume. Am I correct or am I missing something here?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "Jeff, this is Brad. No, you're right. What we did is, we took a look at the whole year basically and not just the first quarter or second quarter. So, we are looking out over the whole year and the excess of inventory that we have over what we projected is for sales for the year.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay. So, it was all and above gloves then?", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "There were some other smaller ones, most of the gloves are the primary driver. But again, when we look at our excess inventory, we look out 365 days, not just the current quarter or the next quarter.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay.", "Brad Dickerson - Chief Financial Officer", "When we look at gloves, there is excess inventory and excess of what we project for sales would be for 365 days.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay, fine. Secondly, did it... are you maintaining your first half guidance of $0.03 to $0.05?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Jeff, this is Wayne. We feel good about $0.06 in the first half of the year, and we're certainly maintaining that top line 26% to 28%.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "So, this is the first half?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Based on our visibility today.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay. And then finally, of the 1 million shoes you expect to ship this year, how much of that will be in the second quarter, and what do we look at for the back half?", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Jeff, it's Wayne. The way we have it set right now, we have a delivery in May, and another delivery toward the end of June. So, it'd be about 60% of the full-year would chip in Q2.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Wayne A. Marino - Chief Operating Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Shanley with Susquehanna.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna", "Thank you and good morning.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Good morning, John.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna", "Kevin, I wondered if you could talk the all investments that you made in the team deals in Europe, can you securely grow your European business without being in the actual footwear... football, footwear business in that market?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "I think first of all it\u2019s really regionally driven and that's the way that you will see it sign our assets. For instance, we are not in a certainly back loading our teams in one particular area and that's why ideally we are looking for an asset that we could have in Germany and ideally an asset that we could have in the UK in the greater region there. So we thought those two teams were appropriate. There is also, there is a revenue economic model that plays on the other side. We've been in Europe now for four, nearly five years of selling sports marketing people over there. We set up our office little more than two and half years ago, we just put a new president on the ground there in the last... I guess, say, seven, eight, nine months. And we feel that the traction is there, it's just a matter of timing. Now as much as we've been doing basically the grass roots the same way that we did here in the United States, not giving as a team, but selling as a team, selling it to athletes and building up this credibility. That's taken place, but with a different environment that we\u2019ve walked in to than we did in the U.S. where we, it was our idea, we were the originators and other people have gotten into the concepts of performance. Now the idea of authenticity that leads through so and so when people are given a choice, we win, but we need to tell them that story. And so the easiest way for us to do that is that in Germany we're able to say, who's on there, I have never heard of before and you say, if you heard of the Hannover 96 football club, we make their uniforms. And the same thing with World's Rugby union, that sort of exposure, and so I think it's... what we're looking for is, it's not only assets that can be relevant on a local basis in Europe, but also like well, it\u2019s not, that's really a global deal for us, that will give us great exposure through things like the six nations in rugby and really position us. But yes, I do put a lot of weight on what the value of football or soccer and rugby and cricket, we mean to these different regions that will attack over the next several years.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna", "So, you eventually have a football footwear in lining in Europe. Is that your game plan?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Like I said, we're going to judge training successfully by how we are positioned to enter the categories. So the thing is... the most three most important words in life or business training or anything else, I believe our point of view. I tied it back to every... our brand of story with beginnings, middles, and ends and every product that we build like a chapter in the book. And these chapter needs to make sense the one before and the one after. The way that we are approaching are our product entry strategy whether here in the US or frankly any international country. It's making sure that we are relevant, making sure that have a point of view. Yes, to answer your question, I do believe that we have an opportunity to build a better football boot for the European consumer, frankly for the American soccer consumer as well. But again our timing for that is dictated at the point in which we are ready with unbelievable product that has a unique point of view in differentiation towards currently out there in the marketplace. So that will all come, I believe in good time, John, but the right we're testing in product and brand will allow us to be [inaudible].", "John Shanley - Susquehanna", "Okay. Fair enough. Turning to the US market, the same basic question, what additional performance footwear products that you envision in launching in 2009. I think Wayne mentioned that the worsened products coming into the marketplace, can you give us any insight of the same that what they may be?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "I don't know what Wayne was talking about, but I think again we are pretty focused on 2008 making sure that training is successful. When you think about this launch, we've got 5371, so May 3rd, July 1st, and November 1st are the three iterations sort of Gen I product, Gen I color up, and then Generation II Under Armour training shoes that will be in the market. And we will be coming back in 2009 again. Look, we really believe that we don't like just pushing water uphill, we believe there is a real opportunity with training. And we believe there is a way to get people to stop training in running shoes. And technique for today's athlete, so there is a need for this product out there. But as we do that, we believe there is also other legs of sort of a training component. Our athlete does more than just lateral stability in a gym. They do run the linear motion, so we think that in time and again given the fact that our brand is ready and most importantly that the product is ready, we'll be able to enter additional categories, specifically we think that running could potentially be a profitability, and that basketball potentially be a possibility, but we haven't made any claims or set any definitive data to when exactly that would happen, John.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna", "Fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Yes, Thanks very much.", "Alex Miyamoto - Director of Investor Relations", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And we will take our last question from Paul Swinand with Stephens Inc.", "Paul Swinand - Stephens Inc.", "Good morning. I had question on your direct business. You said it was up 77%, a way above 50%. Can you give us a little more color on the drivers there and breaking out the retail dollars? And could you also in that comment say how much of the footwear you're selling direct of the total buy?", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Yes. Hi Paul, this is Kevin. So, first of all, let me start with not a great percentage of it is... is actually what things sold directly just a) we're not offering the footwear in our outlook channel, which again we have 18 outlets today. We only have the one full price store in Annapolis. So let me come back to the first question. There is three ways to think about our Direct-to-Consumer business. There is three parts to it. The first is our full price retail, second is our Web, and third is our outlet channel. Our full price retail, again the strategy there is that we believe that we are under penetrated at retail. We believe there is consumer out there who is looking and shopping for Under Armour, in fact they don't have an opportunity to do that in some of the A malls and other properties. Our strategy as to where we want to attack and where we want to play stores, first and foremost, it's not to cannibalize our existing businesses. It's not to cannibalize our existing retail partners, and that's why we continue to reiterate the fact that this is a test. And it will be so for the next two to three years for us to understand. Wayne mentioned in his script as well how we've committed the two additional locations this year. And hopefully we're going to learn from that. Right, again the places that frankly the Under Armour brand cannot be bought in specifically, Tysons Mall is an example I use. You can't buy Under Armour in Tyson's... Tyson's corner, Tyson's I or Tyson's II, now there is one or two retailers that may be carrying a few things, I think like a lid that may be carrying some hats of Under Armours. But for the most part, you can\u2019t find, you can\u2019t buy our brand. We believe there are competition on the other hand. There is multiple distribution points, ten, twelve places you can buy their brand. And you can think about all that opportunity that we are walking. So, a) most importantly, the ability for us to be strategic is what we want to learn. The second component is our web. Our consumer, we find more and more is young, in fact the information that we gather online really backs this fact up is that our consumer is young, they're growing up technical, and they shop online. And they want it... more importantly they don't shop online, a lot of time they're just exploring online. They're finding out what do they want to buy. And so being, I think, really a thought leader on the Web business is very much important to us. The third component is that outlook strategy as I mentioned, we have 17 outlet doors at the end of 2007. We've opened our 18th one and again we're going to open more in the back half of this year, adding a total of nine for 2008. So, we feel good about what that business is going to mean. Again, the idea there is we do not cut for that outlet business, right? There is something we simply consume our own seasonal product. Again you're not going to see any of our core basics or core business products in that channel distribution either.", "Paul Swinand - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session today. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Plank for any additional or closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Plank - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board", "I just want to remind all of you to hopefully go out this Saturday and many of our retailers are opening up at 8 AM this Saturday as well, and be sure to pick up your $80, $90, or $100 of incredibly valued priced Under Armor performance training shoes. So, I look forward to see all you great athletes training in a new way. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And, once again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate your participation.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Miss [Alice Pettit].", "[Alice Pettit]", "I'd like to start by welcoming you to Under Armour's third quarter 2008 earnings call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company. The words estimates, intent, expect, plans, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.", "We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results or events to differ materially. Important factors relating to our business including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are described in our press release and in the risk factor section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Before we continue, I'd like to direct you to our website underarmour.com. There you will find this morning's press release and on our webcast page, images of a number of products and initiatives we will address on the call. ", "Now I'd like to introduce the speakers and topics for this morning's call. Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO will address the drivers of our third quarter results and our strategy for continued growth in 2008 and beyond. Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer will then discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter and provide an updated outlook for 2008. After their prepared remarks, Kevin, Brad, Wayne Marino our Chief Operating Officer and David McCreight our new President will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Good morning everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming Dave McCreight our new President to his first quarterly conference call. This morning, we'd like to talk about our brand, our product and our team; the three core strengths of Under Armour and the three things that position us to dictate the tempo of our growth.", "While we acknowledge the current macro economic environment, the fact of the matter is that we still control our own destiny. We've built our business of scale on our own time frame and that cadence is based on authenticity, passion and innovation. We can continue to grow because our core consumers, the ones playing football, baseball, hockey, softball, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey and so many other sports believe in our brand and the advantage we bring to athletes every single day.", "These core consumers will continue to be there for Under Armour because these sports will be played every fall and every spring. As long as we continue to deliver on that promise of constant innovation, Under Armour will continue to thrive and continue to grow.", "Regardless of what goes on in the world, sports are played around the world every day and we believe in the tremendous opportunity that's in front of us to extend our brand beyond its core. From a brand perspective, we affirm the trust of today's athletes. From a revenue opportunity, a distribution opportunity, and a geographic opportunity, we're still in the very early stages of becoming one of the great athletic brands.", "As you look at the key businesses that will drive our revenue growth, we think it's important to understand the reasons behind our confidence. Within the footwear business we have taken very measured steps to build credibility with the athlete. We started in 2006 in the most authentic place possible with football cleats on the field of play. We came back in 2007 with baseball cleats and then this year, we took the next logical step, to training while our consumer was spending most of his or her time preparing so they could be the best when out on that field.", "We've had a tremendous impact on the categories we've entered as well, bringing lots of attention to both cleats and training. Most importantly, we've raised average selling prices in both categories and have traded consumers up to better products while gaining significant market share.", "And now, we're poised to take that next logical step with our move into the running footwear category, and we're communicating the Under Armour point of view to our core consumer, that team sport athlete, with a very simple message, \"Athletes Run\".", "When you look at the development of our footwear business, it has been measured and purposeful with each step making sense of the one behind it and the one in front of it. We have proven both to ourselves and more importantly to our core consumer that we are authentic players in footwear. So we look at our acceptance of the running brand in early '09 as very achievable, a belief shared among our recent retail partners and ultimately our core consumers. ", "We believe it's important to look out at the short term horizon to understand where the best opportunities for growth exist to Under Armour, but we should also look to what we have accomplished in the past quarter as evidence that not only does our brand remain very strong, but our growth prospects remain strong as well.", "The third quarter was the largest in company history with every category showing strong double digit growth, with men's apparel up 17%, women's apparel 27% and kids up 13%. We continue to outperform in terms of retail sell through and our consistent ability to sell through at full price. In addition to these strong revenue numbers, our ASP's also grew in both footwear and apparel.", "We're confident in our ability to grow because we've been making the investments in our growth drivers and we're starting to see the payoffs from these investments, with running footwear being the most obvious example.", "We will continue to invest in these five growth drivers, men's, women's, footwear, international and direct consumer business, and as our product mix grows, we have a much bigger revenue opportunity as we enter new markets and new distribution.", "The final piece of the growth puzzle is our ability to manage it; to build an organization that is nimble enough to enter new categories with the speed we have over the past few years, but is constantly improving our ability to pull the operational levers that come with the growth. So I think it's informative to look at how we've managed our inventory situation over the past 12 months and how we've been able to deliver what we've promised our investors.", "Our inventory grew this past quarter at a rate significantly lower than our 24% top line growth and better than we had forecast. Inventory grew only 8% year over year and was down more than $20 million from the end of the second quarter. We believe it will continue to grow at a rate slower than revenue growth through the fourth quarter as well.", "This significant reduction came as we focused as a team on inventory and drove to a number that is both appropriate for our business and in line with how we want to run our business with our retail partners.", "Our infrastructure is catching up to our accelerated revenue growth of the past few years and I believe that David has come aboard at a very important time for our company. David will focus on the front end, prioritizing and aligning our key drivers for long term growth while working in tandem with Wayne Marino on the back end, who will continue to ensure the support programs for these engines.", "The way we see it, our future is in our own hands. Much of it was in our selling college teams to the idea a new type of T-shirt. We like where we stand right now. Our brand has never been stronger. Our product line has never been broader and despite of any outside elements, we are the ones in control of our brand. We will dictate the tempo.", "With that, I'd like to turn things over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO.", "Brad Dickerson", "I will now review key financial highlights for the third quarter and year to date and discuss our outlook for the full year. As noted earlier, the third quarter marked another period of impressive growth for Under Armour. ", "Our net revenues for the third quarter grew 24% over the prior year quarter. 70% of the dollar growth in the quarter came as a result in our apparel business which increased 19% and has continued on a path of strong performance and was up 27% during the third quarter.", "Footwear revenues increased from $2.2 million in the third quarter over prior year to $13.1 million and was mainly fueled by the performance trainers which were launched in the second quarter of 2008. Third quarter gross margins were 51%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2007 which was impacted by reserves and allowances related to discontinued footwear. ", "In the third quarter of 2008, SG&A expenses represented 31% of net revenues, a 150 basis point decrease from the 32.5% reported for the same period of the prior year. Marketing expense decreased from 11.5% of net revenues in the third quarter of last year to 10.7% this year and was the main driver of our SG&A leverage.", "Product innovation and supply chain costs as well as corporate service costs also leveraged in the quarter. A meaningful portion of this improvement was driven by lower personnel costs associated with these areas. Operating income increased 37% during the third quarter to $46.5 million compared with $33.8 million the prior year. Operating margin was up 190 basis points to 20% compared with 18.1% in the prior year quarter. Again, this was driven by improvement in both growth margins and SG&A leverage.", "Net other expense was $1.7 million during the third quarter versus net other income of $700,000 in the same period the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency impact in the current quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 42.6% compared with 41.9% in the same period last year.", "Our resulting net income increased 28% in the quarter to $25.7 million compared with $20 million last year. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.51 compared with $0.40 in the prior year.", "The top line results this quarter are indicative of the strong results we achieved year to date. For the first nine months, our net revenues increased 26% to $546 million from $431.7 million in the prior year's period. Year to date, our diluted earnings per share totaled $0.60 compared with $0.71 in the prior year. As we previously indicated, based on the seasonality of net revenues and the timing of marketing and other investments, we expected earnings to be more heavily weighted to the back half of 2008 relative to 2007.", "Now a few moments on the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $40.2 million compared with $14.5 million at September 30, 2007. Cash, net of debt at the end of the current quarter was $2.6 million compared with net debt of $0.1 million at September 30, 2007.", "At the end of the third quarter we have $15 million drawn on our revolving credit facility as compared with $10 million drawn at September 30, 2007. Currently, we have $25 million outstanding on our $100 million credit facility. At year end, we continue to expect cash net of debt to remain relatively flat from our 2007 year end balance.", "Net accounts receivable increased 18% on a year over year basis which was below our net revenue growth for the quarter. In 2008 we continue to expect net accounts receivable to grow in line with top line growth.", "Inventory has been a major focus for the organization and we are pleased to report the third quarter marked another quarter of delivering on our inventory improvement goals. Inventory increased 8% on a year over year basis which was well below our top line growth during the quarter. ", "Inventory of $163.6 million at the end of the third quarter represented a decrease from the $183.9 million inventory balance reported at the end of June. With the efforts of our team and continued discipline around new established processes, we continue to project inventory growth at a rate below our sales growth at year end.", "We feel that our progress made with inventory improvements this year will plan for improved inventory turns in 2009 are key components to managing our business effectively during these economic times. In addition, greater inventory efficiency in 2009 will help our management of working capital.", "Our investment in capital expenditures for the third quarter was approximately $10 million. Our full year 2008's capital investments are now planned at approximately $44 million versus our previous range of $40 million to $42 million. The increase in our guidance for CapEx is mainly being driven by a non-cash growth on our balance sheet for footwork, tooling and molding we own at third party manufacturers. This is a growth on the balance sheet not a change to our cash flow or how we pay for these drivers.", "Finally, I would like to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year. As a result of prior investment in our business and successful execution of our growth strategy, we've reported strong financial results to date. Our connection with the consumer continues to be a major strength for the organization and we remain committed to making the investments in our team, brand and infrastructure to support identified opportunities for meaningful growth.", "However, based on the visibility we have into our business today, as well as current economic conditions, we are revising our 2008 outlook for net revenues and income from operations. We now anticipate 2008 full year net revenues of $750 million to $765 million which represents 24% to 26% growth over 2007 compared with our previous range of $765 million to $775 million. ", "This is primarily driven by slower growth assumptions for our apparel business. Men's apparel is now expected to grow in the mid teens for the full year, while women's and youth are expected to grow in the low 20's. ", "Moving on to growth margins, we now anticipate full year growth margins to be approximately 49.5% versus our previous outlook f 50% based on the growth margins recorded this quarter. For the third quarter of 2008, our direct to consumer business was a smaller percentage of net revenues than originally planned. This occurred as a result of order processing issues, mostly impacting our web business. Those issues have since been resolved and we resumed high service levels for our web customers.", "We believe we can offset some of this growth margin impact on our operating income line as we implement tighter cost management for the remainder of 2008. Our revised 2008 full year income from operations outlook is now $97.5 million to $104.5 million, an increase of 13% to 21% over 2007 versus our previous range of $104.5 million to $105.5 million.", "Based on our updated projected interest expense for the full year as well as year to date foreign currency impact at the end of the third quarter, we now estimate net other income expense to be approximately $3 million for the year. We had previously anticipated $1.4 million based on our original interest expense estimate as well as foreign currency exchange impact for the first half of 2008.", "Although we have hedged a portion of our foreign currency exchange risk, we are exposed to some levels of currency risk going forward and as such, the volatility of foreign exchange rates will continue to impact our financial results.", "For the full year we are now estimating an after tax rate of approximately 42.7% up from 41% in 2007. This increase in the full year tax rate is mainly attributable to an increase in the state's income tax rate for Maryland, our home based state from 7% to 8.25% beginning in January, 2008. Our weighted average diluted share count is estimated to be approximately 50 million shares versus our previous estimate of 50.5 million shares. ", "Delivering more than 20% top line growth in current times is an achievement and testament to the critical investments we were willing to make in the past. We understand the challenges in the environment and we will answer those challenges with greater discipline around the management of the business. ", "Through the current climate and resulting impact to our visibility, we plan to discuss specifics around 2009 outlook at our year end call. Our growth this year and next will be driven by our diversified business strategy which positions our company for solid growth. Our planning for 2009 will reflect the reality of the world today and opportunities for our brand with prioritization of investments in the areas that will generate the greatest long term value for our company and shareholders.", "At this time, we would now like to open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you give a little bit more insight into how you were able to bring down inventories that surprised a lot of people, and keep margins at the level that they were; you tied it to your outlook strategy and what's been happening with inventory at retail, and how retailers are thinking about inventories in this environment.", "Wayne Marino", "I think first of all, the biggest thing that impacts inventory is our growth. We had really strong growth for the quarter and that plays right into helping reduce our inventory. The second thing is, we've made some very, very good progress operationally. ", "We talked about this at investor day. We're going to take some steps with what we would consider a sales and operation planning process and the team has done an excellent job at getting visibility into our forecast and reacting accordingly. So have to really give a shout out to the team for the great job on that, and it's one of the factors as well.", "In addition to that, we set out a plan this year, and that plan was to control our destiny and put our inventory through our outlet channel. That's been very successful. Our business is very strong and we've been able to keep our profits in the outlets very well as well as making sure that that is the place when we started the outlets, it was the place where we want to put our excess through.", "We made a very concerted effort not to do any major cut up programs for our outlet stores, so that was a benefit that we took this year as well. ", "As far as inventory at our retailers, I think one of the things we do is we look at our retail business on a weekly basis and we look at several things. We look at how we're performing at retail and we look at what the inventories are at retail. We've been very careful to start the season very clean. And also, a percentage of our business at retail represents our core product which for us, is really a pull inventory. It's not something that you ship in and you wait. It's really a pull by the consumers. So the way our model is built allows us to be fairly clean at our retail stores. It's also performance has been very strong as well, so all factors were working together for us.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "We know you talked a lot about the cross training, the performance trainer launch with a million units, how can we start thinking about the size of running launch? I know it's a much bigger category, potentially a broader set of distribution partners, and is that going to start shipping in the fourth quarter? Is that one of the drivers of the fourth quarter growth or is that really '09 driver.", "Brad Dickerson", "When we put together our fourth quarter, we did not make any assumptions about shipping running footwear in that fourth quarter. What will dictate for us whether running footwear does get shipped is whether our retail partners and our stores really want to set their floors. So that will be the driving factor. But when Brad put together the outlook for Q4, it did not include our running footwear in it.", "Kevin Plank", "Let me lean on the running message we'd like to get out there. We've established a pretty solid record in footwear to date that began back in 2006 with football cleats, came back with baseball cleats in '07, and then training of course this year. In every instance I think we sold it and sold through the amount of product that we planned to do.", "What's happened there is really the support of some great partners that have helped us, but also some really good product and some really great stories that we're communicating to that consumer. With that, when we started, I used to use the statement that we didn't get into the footwear business to build football cleats. As much as we've built football cleats that put us in the position to sell additional categories of footwear.", "We also said that training would decide our success or not by our ability to enter additional categories. So with the announcement that in the first quarter of 2009, we're going to selling running shoes is a big statement for our brand. The message there is that as you look at the market sizes of categories, and we took a lot of gaff when we first said we were going to make football cleats, and people said, \"The market is so small.\" Football from a retail dollar standpoint is $110 million market and we took a 20% plus market share there.", "Baseball and softball is a little more than $200 market. Training is about $1.2 billion market. That's currently more of a $40 shoe sold at Kohl's versus the $89, $90 and $100 product that we sold through in sporting goods. And now we're entering into the first category with a little bit of wind at its back.", "It's nearly four or five times the size of the largest category to date which is training, with running shoes being $4.7 billion. We believe there's a lot of established brands there, because in these other categories we entered them. We said we're going to reinvigorate, we're going to raise ASP, and bring attention to markets that had been previously forgotten about.", "People know about the running shoe market, but we believe that, and I think we're pretty confident that our consumer runs. And our consumers are going to give us the opportunity to show them our product. What I can tell you is that our product has been tested. Our product has been received tremendously by the retailers who've seen it. ", "We've actually had some on-site fittings and try outs at some recent marathons including our own ballroom marathon that we have here with more than 18,000 runners going through our booth and looking at some of the footwear and participating in the marathon, and the feedback so far has been great.", "And most importantly, our job as a brand is to create innovation and create new stories out there. The ability to bolster our Big Box sporting goods guide and hopefully give a shot in the arm there, as well as the expansion we have with footwear for the first time about to be sold, with some of our new mall partners as well including [Flick] as well as Finish Line, and then of course run specialty.", "This isn't something which is just a Big Box story. This is something that the best specialty players out there, the mom and pops are giving our brand a shot. I think from a comprehensive standpoint, we feel good. ", "Wayne Marino", "One-third of our year over year dollar growth came from footwear. I think what I can tell you which we feel good about is 2009 that year over year dollar growth will be even greater for footwear.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "How many new doors is this footwear opening up for you with new channels coming?", "Kevin Plank", "For the most part it's where we've done business to date, but also the halo effect that's taken place. Florida is going to be big and we're basically going to be selling the product in 700 or so doors that we have apparel in today. So not big expansion. With 4,000 doors behind that partner, there's plenty of room to grow there as we look to expand.", "And then of course, specialty. The addition of having running footwear has made us relevant again. Where we had difficulty getting in as an apparel only brand in some of the Luke's locker rooms in Dallas, Texas and some of the more marquis specialty retailers, it's really given us a platform to enter the brand to give people the opportunity to experience Under Armour. ", "We really see it as a plus. You've got to understand that from the highest end, the road runners of the world, there's a lot of people that are giving us a shot with this, so we're going to learn a lot in the first few months. But we don't believe this is a one hit. We think that we've got some wags and I think the product speaks for itself.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [David Greg \u2013 Buckingham Research].", "[David Greg \u2013 Buckingham Research]", "Your Q4 revenue guidance is fairly broad ranged and obviously you gave us guidance for the year, but it's a fairly broad range for the quarter. Can you give us a sense of what's driving the variance? Obviously there's a lack of visibility in the environment, but is that coming from lack of retailers confirming order, potential returns on unsold product, that you're heavy in a seasonal category, is it uncertainly in direct to consumer? Can you give us more color on why it's such a broad range for the fourth quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "There's a lot going on in the revenues in the current environment and also with the retailers and consumers reaction to the environment. Also, as we've talked about in the past weather is a very important factor in Q4 for us also for cold gear.", "As far as the indicators we're looking at, the drivers of Q4, we're looking at a couple of things. One, our performance at retail that we've seen so far in Q4 are at one trends for our replenishment business, our booking percentages and cancellations on those booking that we've seen also in the last few weeks.", "So we make some assumptions there as far as Q4 goes and maybe I can just walk you through some of those assumptions. On the low end of our outlook for revenues for the year, we basically assume that trends do not worsen from what we've seen so far, specifically around your at once business as far as replenishment business goes.", "Also, we've taken a more conservative stance on cancellations of existing orders that are out there. That's at the low end of our outlook. At the high end of our outlook, we've assumed better at once trends we're currently seeing and reflects just the cancellations we've seen to date. Again, we're not counting on the weather as much. That is an important driver for Q4 though.", "[David Greg \u2013 Buckingham Research]", "Is it fair to say that since the third or fourth week of September is really when you've seen the slowdown and it really hasn't picked up since then?", "Brad Dickerson", "The visibility really has been over the last four to five weeks as far as the change in visibility that is reflected in our outlook for the rest of the year.", "Kevin Plank", "It's important to understand that when the weather gets cold we all get a lot smarter too. Trying decipher between we've slept on a warm October a year ago, and the market was pretty tough and we we're facing as drastic an economic climate as we're seeing and hearing about today. So when we see cold weather, I think our business reacts accordingly and I think our retailers act the same way as well.", "It's been pretty chilly and walking into 39 degrees and rain this morning, that's good news for runners.", "[David Greg \u2013 Buckingham Research]", "On marketing expenses, you had guidance to a flat percent of sales. Can you give us some sense on how that number came in where you may have pulled back on some marketing spending?", "Wayne Marino", "That number for the quarter is really timing shift. It's really when we spent that marketing. We're still going to be in the same range for the full year, the high end of the 12% or 13% range. There was really no adjustment in marketing, just really timing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna.", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna", "Can you give us an update on the European business and the indication of whether or not you're about to in fiscal '09 introduce a football boot into the European market?", "Kevin Plank", "Europe as a whole is something that we continue to invest in our opportunity that we have there and going back to the same three points of our strategy of market entry there as it has always been. First of all, to build the right team of people to tell our story, [Peter Marr] on board now is in his 16 or 17 year tenure here at Under Armour and is really building a great team of people in our Amsterdam office and really beginning to get traction with some relationships with people we're doing business with there.", "The second component is building authenticity on field and fresh off the German [inaudible] league that has been in play a little more than the last month and head over 96 is actually being competitive out there and I think they have a good shot including a win over [Byron] so authenticity begins there.", "Also, this past week we really began our kick off for the WRU, the World Rugby Union in Wales. Their first game is in Cardiff next week, and we're gong to go over and see that too. So we're going to spend some time in the market. We're listening and we're learning but authenticity is something that it's amazing what happens are people not only seeing it and discovering it as a surprise packet, underneath of people's uniforms, but as we become more visible in the market I think traction is beginning to take place.", "And then of course, distribution; we continue to have a little more than 2,000 doors in the market today and we like where we're doing business and I think we're seeing good traction. They're having a pretty good climate in the fall season as well.", "Probably the most important thing we have is what David McCreight is doing here, is helping us prioritize this and prioritize international for a company that 90% of our revenues and that we came from in Q3, 90% plus came from the U.S. We just see a tremendous opportunity there.", "Wayne Marino", "Just a quick note on soccer. We've built and continue to build a very, very strong footwear team and there's no doubt that we'll continue to work on those next categories. But right now, we really need to focus the organization, and we are focused, on running. That's where we're going to keep our focus. Our team is working on new products, but running is our focus today.", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna", "So no new boot this year, that's what you're basically saying?", "Wayne Marino", "There's nothing of material that I can really talk about. One of the things we always do when we put new products out, is we test. We test on field. We test with the athletes. So as we develop new categories, you may see small tests out there just to make sure we're authentic and it's working properly. But not planning our major launch, is running.", "Kevin Plank", "We've learned a lot of lessons as we grow this business and one of the best lessons we've learned is just a little bit of patience. As we learn and make sure that we have the product right before we do full blown market entry, we want to make sure that consumers are screaming for it. The product is tested, that durability is intact and when we enter, we enter with strength and we enter strong. That's the way we intend on that market.", "The short answer is we absolutely will be in the soccer boot business, and sort of hedging the question, unlike basketball, I think the product and product readiness will dictate the time as to when we enter those categories.", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna", "Can you give us an indication of the marketing spend for the running shoe launch? Will it be comparable to what you did when you launched the cross trainer and can you give us an idea of the size of the product offering that you're going to bringing in for running?", "Brad Dickerson", "As far as the marketing spend goes, I think what you can anticipate is the fact that our running launch is in the first half of 2009, similar to our performance training launch in the first half of 2008. I think you'll see the same kind of seasonality in our marketing spend year over year as far as first half versus back half.", "Wayne Marino", "I think what I said was that we had a very successful training launch and this year footwear in total was one-third of our year over year growth in footwear. With running in 2009 I would expect that year over year growth would be even greater as in footwear. So running is obviously a larger category. It will have a bigger impact on our year over year growth, but in terms of specific details, we're not going to get into that right now.", "Brad Dickerson", "It will be larger than training but also 100% allocated just like training was. I think the consumer and the market we can tell you there is more demand out there than we're putting in the market as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "The 29% growth margin mark for this year, how do you think about that mark on a go forward basis and planning process?", "Wayne Marino", "We've talked in the past about a couple of levers to gross margin, first being footwear and the second being direct to consumer really having the most impact on our margins going forward.", "When you look at going forward, always look at relative to the guidance we give around the growth in those categories. Obviously we're talking about a major footwear launch here in 2009, in the first half of 2009 and obviously footwear we've talked about in the past being below our historical apparel margins.", "As far as direct to consumer goes, again we're looking at direct to consumer growing above our overall company growth rate in 2009, and again our direct to consumer business is very strong in the back half of the year, especially in Q4 so you should an uplift in margins from that perspective. So those two will always balance each other based on their revenue growth year over year.", "David McCreight", "As you can expect with a company that's growing, and as we start to become more sophisticated with our supply chain, we're going to continue to look for opportunities for margin expansion in apparel as well. So you can see three material levers for us.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "On the direct to consumer, you were talking about 15% of revenue for the year? If I remember from your last call, you had expected to maintain that steady as a percent of revenue. It sounds like it's an increase on direct to consumer going forward?", "Wayne Marino", "Direct to consumer for 2008 should be around 14% to 15% for the year. We would anticipate, we'll give some more clarity around 2009 in our year end call, but we would anticipate direct to consumer to grow faster than our overall company and thus be an increase in percentage of revenues in 2009.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "The orders that didn't ship, can you provide a little bit more detail around that? Was that just a delay in the processing of shipments or pushing revenues from the third quarter into the fourth quarter?", "Wayne Marino", "The third quarter is one of our largest quarters. I think it was our highest quarter ever in the history of the company. It's a very busy time for the company and the start of the third quarter particularly around our product offering, specifically in the web business where we are basically offering our spring demand and also transitioning into fall. ", "As a result of this, we encountered in the third quarter, we had some problems with our processing which is really our ability to put through as many units in a compressed time in our distribution house. This is mostly centered around our web business.", "Although it wasn't overly significant from a top line perspective to our overall company, we did have lost line, lost sales on line. But it did impact our gross margin. As you can imagine our web business has a much higher gross margin than our overall business.", "The good news is that the operational team in the quarter was able to correct it and by the end of the quarter, the service levels for our web businesses were back to normal. And equally important to note is that we still see our direct to consumer business year to date even our web business alone with service issues, is much stronger than our overall company growth.", "It was a blip. We did lose revenue, but I think the impact to the company was gross margin. But good news \u2013 it's been resolved and we continue to take steps to make sure that doesn't happen again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "The revenue reduction related to slower men's growth in the fourth quarter, did you discuss existing customers by channel? Is that of a sporting goods box issue versus smaller accounts or the independents versus how your outlets performed? You mentioned tighter cost management for the guidance can you give us some examples of what you're going to be doing to keep costs down in the fourth quarter and in '09 as well?", "Brad Dickerson", "A couple of components I can walk you through. First of all, part of our team's compensation is tied to the company's top line and operating income so there is some offset in cost there as far as whether we hit our internal target in those two items. Also, there is some variability in our marketing spend as we talked about before. ", "Although we still anticipate being in the high end of the 12% to 13% range for marketing for the year, the fact that we brought our top line revenue down a little bit as far as an outlook means that the marketing spend will come down with it. ", "In addition, there are some other small variable costs we have; distribution and sales specifically, not a major part but there are some parts there. And probably lastly and more importantly, we've identified some specific areas just from a fixed cost perspective that we can control costs that maybe won't affect our Q4 revenues or the revenues going forward, things such as travel and so forth that we're looking at. So those are really the areas in Q4 that we're looking at from the perspective of cost management.", "Wayne Marino", "On the revenue side, it goes back to what we see in terms of visibility and whether it's men's, women's, youth in total. What we've looked for our visibility in terms of Q4 is really several things. One is how the retailers react to general conditions, the bookings that we have in place, our at once business. Our at once business is certainly impacted by cold gear which is related significantly to the weather and cancellations.", "All those factors together make up our visibility and so we looked at it for the full year. I can't give you any specific piece on why one part of the business is up or down. I can tell you it's based on the visibility we have.", "But also, equally important is what we see out there. We watch our retail business every single week and how we're performing at retail and all of our businesses continue to grow. We're pretty happy with that performance. ", "Again, it's all the factors that I mentioned that really has an impact.", "Kevin Plank", "Wherever we are performing right now, we continue to lead. We are clearly number one in the majority of places we are and at worst maybe a close two in certain categories. But for the most part, the majority of the time, Under Armour is far and away number one. I think we're very proud of the purpose that we serve for our Great Big Box partners and I think we're doing a good job for them right now and I think we're both appreciative of the businesses that we have with each other.", "We've got some great new programs on the floor right now from micro fleece programs to some folded hoodie and other programs with some of our big partners and especially Dick's Sporting Goods has a great presentation of Under Armour on the floor and Sports Authority is another one of  buyers so these guys are doing a fantastic job. But they're managing their own inventory trying to deal with environment that they have.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Is there a significant difference between your customers and them managing inventory versus the trends you're seeing in your own outlet stores or is it your own outlet stores are in line with little bit slower trends of orders for the men's business in the fourth quarter.", "Kevin Plank", "Our fourth specialty store just opened in the last couple of weeks so to be clear on our own specialty model, the way we're approaching retail, we don't have any more leases on schedule for the balance of 2008 or 2009. As we've mentioned all along, our specialty store model is purely a test. With the addition of David joining our team, it's going to help us make sure we're using the right metric to evaluate that test.", "On the outlet side, we'll have 25 factory outlet stores by the end of the year and what we can tell you from our own indicators, obviously our web site being the most immediate, and then our factory outlet store helping us, is that our business there is pretty good. We're not seeing the effects to the extent that we're hearing about or reading about or others are preparing for, but of course that business for us is simply liquidation and expelling excess product. It's been a big help for us in helping get our inventory down and I think assortment is pretty good and I think we're giving a pretty good product to our consumer right now too.", "Brad Dickerson", "Our outlet business and our web business as far as what we're seeing right now in Q4 is pretty much on par with what we had planned for for the quarter. On the wholesale side, if you look at our outlook for the year and the range of our outlook, at the low end of our outlook what we're assuming there is that the current trends we see stay pretty consistent going forward, what we have seen over the last four or five weeks.", "We've also taken a more conservative stance on potential cancellations with existing orders at that low end of the range. At the higher end of the range, what we've assumed there is that at once trends do a little bit better than we've seen in the last four or five weeks and then we've had to take into effect cancellations we've seen to date. That gives you an idea on the wholesale side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Camila Lyon \u2013 Bank of America Securities].", "[Camila Lyon \u2013 Bank of America Securities]", "With recent drop in oil prices, what indication is that having on your cost of goods? Are you seeing any benefit in raw material sourcing costs or transportation costs?", "Wayne Marino", "One of the things that we've done consistently is we've been able to lock our prices in. Typically we lock our prices in almost a year in advance, specifically as it relates to fabric. We've locked in 2009 prices. As oil fluctuates, we're not necessarily seeing any big change or benefit within our cost of goods sold. There's always the opportunity to impact the transportation, but the ability to lock it in is really something we've taken advantage of.", "The good news from my perspective supporting the finance side and operations side, is that we continue to hit what we consider our house targets, and for 2009 we're pegged pretty well. There's no surprises either way.", "Kevin Plank", "The bigger story on gross margin is going to be if we can continue to leverage the new platforms that Kevin alluded to earlier and also the company's growth. Our pencil is getting bigger. We're going to continue to be a lot smarter as we continue to invest and Wayne's team is building some pretty disciplines as it relates to leveraging that larger scale. We feel pretty optimistic about margins in the future.", "[Camila Lyon \u2013 Bank of America Securities]", "Could you provide a little bit of detail around how much the web order processing issues caused you on the gross margin line during this quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "It probably cost us for the quarter somewhere around 100 basis points. For the year, it's about 50 basis points when you do the math.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Any color around the response to the new generation two trainers and secondarily how you would expect that product to be positioned in year two given the running launch?", "Kevin Plank", "The product hit the floor in the last couple weeks and the early rates that we have are great tops. One of the things that you learn in the footwear business is that if it's much more seasonal, or the product needs to turn much faster. You don't get six months on the floor when the consumer is looking for something on a weekly, at the very worst a monthly basis. ", "The ability for us to freshen that up in our sold through; I think we're very pleased with the shelf life we have with the Gen One training but the ability to come back and now clean out. We sold through virtually what we wanted to with the Gen One training and then come back with a new color in the holiday is important.", "But for us, it's a lot of learning that's happening right now. We're going through this process of, instead of how two offers a year over a seven month time frame, begin to look and say, how are we going to compete, and more importantly begin to differentiate our important Big Box Sporting Goods partners, and the new players and existing players that we have in the mall, and then of course other categories.", "What you can count on from us though, is we're not going to forget about training. We're not looking to cannibalize our training business with running. We are very aware that that's possible and we're looking for a great big pop in the first part of 2009 with the launch of running, but you'll see us come back and see us continue to tell the training story because training for us as a business is a much bigger platform at the same time too, is that training has that halo effect beyond just the footwear but really leads back to our apparel as well.", "You'll see us stay consistent and make sure that we build that platform that when someone should not train in running shoes.", "Wayne Marino", "We expect certainly a full year of performance for trainers this year. We launched part year, so we'll get a full year in 2009. I think the other point that Kevin and Brad made consistently is there could be some cannibalization. People could actually choose the best shoe on the wall. But we've been very confident but yet not overly aggressive. ", "So our program for running is an allocated program and the benefit of that is to continue to keep that demand up pretty high. It's a smart way to launch a program.", "Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "The mountain category, you haven't talked a whole lot about it, how is that going to be expanded or is it going to expanded as we head into cooler weather?", "Kevin Plank", "We just finished our fall '09 outdoor sales meeting here and it was great. I can tell you that the product looks terrific. We are in the process of building a really great team. Of course I think a great authentic sales force, the great authentic athletes that we have out in the field for us, but just as importantly, our product team, our internal team is really very strong, especially from an innovation standpoint.", "A couple of big stories that we want to own, we launched outerwear at the end of 2007 and we learned a lot in that first year and we built some pretty high price points. We didn't build a lot of product but we learned where the market sits for $400 and $450 jackets. So we've come back jacket, we've engineered better product in the market, but I think also closer to more wheelhouse price points.", "We also decided as a company it's important first and foremost that we own first layer. We want to own the base layer. Our base program, we have the base layer one, base layer two and base layer three that are effectively three separate ways for replacing your old long underwear has just been out of this world.", "We've had a difficult time actually keeping up with demand with that product and I think it's something we made the long term plan awhile ago, in the out years, a million plus type of unit program and we still feel confident with that being something that we'll see going forward.", "Between our basic cold gear, some of the color block cold gear as well as some of our [umetal] cold gear products, we have the ability to own the mountain beginning with that first layer, and I think what you're seeing is some great outer wear as we put together a great team to own that outer wear portion as well.", "Then of course our affiliation with the U.S. Ski Team is something that will play a major role there as well.", "Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I would assume the youth business is one of the more resilient parts of the apparel and the gross is a little bit slower than we've seen in the past in the third quarter. Was there anything that went on there? Can you give a little more color on that category in the quarter?", "Wayne Marino", "There really isn't anything specific. It's really the timing of when we anniversary some launches. I think we feel confident that the low 20's is where we take the full year and we'll start to put in programs towards the fourth quarter.", "Year to date 21% is still very, very strong growth so I believe there's nothing I can call out specifically. It's just the timing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan.", "Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "On the trainers, the launch of version two, did you change the volume that you did this year or did the volume end up being about where you expected?", "Wayne Marino", "The volume really didn't change this year. For us, when we launched it was an allocated program and we stayed with it. The one thing, if anything was the timing really of how we shipped. I think the way we shipped was 70% first half, 30% in the back half and we were anticipating to ship a little bit more in Q4 versus Q3 but we ended up shipping a greater amount in Q3.", "If you've seen any shift, it really was the timing of when we shipped in Q3. But overall, the number itself was an allocated program and stayed that way.", "Kevin Plank", "Just to reiterate some of the assets that we've built around training, we really utilize, I think the sport of football is where we get the big bang from training. So we talked about our high school All American game, the Senior Bowl All American game at the collegiate level, and then we had from a marketing standpoint, we've owned the NFL Draft for years.", "The thing I would mention from that is the NFL Combine, and we're happy to announce this year that we actually signed a relationship agreement with the National Football League to take over the outfitting of more than 300 plus athletes that will be invited to the NFL Combine this upcoming March.", "That's something that's just a major platform for us to build the authenticity from our apparel standpoint, but again reaching back to the concept of combine, the concept of that when athletes are training and not just doing their movement. It's also about lateral flexibility and I think you'll see that authenticity bleed through the product that's on the field and also what you'll see great athletes wearing on the field when they are in training.", "Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "On the move into more of a mall store, can you talk a little bit about what you're learning in terms of the different consumer who's shopping the mall as opposed to the Big Box Stores and how that might impact what you're selling there?", "Kevin Plank", "From a wholesale standpoint, our customer goes to the mall. What we found is that our customer in the past hasn't gone specifically for Under Armour, so there's two things at play there; a, it's the presentation that we are receiving from some of our partners and Finish Line has done a terrific job to date. Just kicking off with Foot Locker, I think they've been pretty intent on the presentation that we have there too.", "We've been known in the past as just a [inaudible] and Navy brand. I think we've expanded that and we realize that in order keep people competitive, we need to be able to differentiate them. So a, we're going to learn a lot from that and we believe our customers there, we just haven't provided them the type of product that would be compelling to them in that environment.", "So I think you'll see with the addition of the parka on the apparel side, you'll see our apparel offering continue to expand and become more relevant there.", "David McCreight", "The opportunities for this brand and the platform for growth really is tremendous for the future and you're seeing all the hard work and authentication and development of training as a platform and the expansion into footwear is one of many opportunities that the company is going to be working on.", "In addition to the distribution growth in the mall, we're also continuing to develop our direct to consumer business which will be another strategic arrow in the quiver. We're going to continue to grow that at our pace and where it makes prudent sense as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "You had noted that the low end of your fourth quarter guidance assumes that there's not any improvement from the trends in the last four or five weeks. I would not that a lot of the retailers or customers of your that we talked to are suggesting that this might be the worst holiday season since 1991. Did you consider a scenario where the environment would actually worsen heading into the holiday season?", "", "Brad Dickerson", "I think we have a pretty wide range there in the revenue guidance for the rest of the year, so we do have visibility into the first of three months for this quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with the different assumptions we've used both in the low end and the high end of that range and outlook.", "In addition to that, also remember that our direct to consumer business is very strong in the fourth quarter so obviously we have a better visibility and a good idea of where we're tracking with our direct to consumer business.", "Wayne Marino", "One of the things that we do is we look every single week at how we're performing at retail and certainly as Brad and Kevin said, the outlook, we set that up several weeks ago. But I can tell you based on what we see, is that wherever we are, we continue to outperform in places where we sell.", "I think that's one of the best indicators for us on the strength of the brand and the loyalty of the consumer. ", "Kevin Plank", "Probably one of the greatest compliments we've received from one of our key merchants that we interact with was, \"I think you have always been impressive with our sell through\", and the way that we've led the market and outperformed the market when times have been good, but especially in difficult times, the fact that we still continue to drive foot traffic into stores and lead the categories where we compete, is a pretty great testament; a, to the brand, but more importantly to the strength of the brand.", "I want to reiterate again, we believe that our brand has never been stronger, never a wider or broader array of products, and more importantly a never a wider, broader array of opportunities. One of the biggest challenges that we're going to face in 2009 is, times get difficult, is deciding where we do deploy the resources.", "The timing of David joining our company is very helpful to us, because we've been a company that historically, we've got ten or twelve things on the list, and it's just the way it is. With the way that we're going to adjust and the way that we're going to prepare for what everybody's talking about, is we're going to take ten or twelve things and we're going to turn them into five or six things and we're going to focus and we're going to do them great.", "That we believe is the key. It's not necessarily what we do but just as important the things we don't do to execute to become a great company.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "During the months of August and September I know that you ran a few promotions on your web site offering free shipping. I was curious as to your thoughts behind that kind of promotion and why you were running that kind of promotion is you were simultaneously having difficulty in processing orders.", "Wayne Marino", "We've been running free shipping for over a year now. It's been part of our strategy and I think it's important to know that we've set thresholds which is very common. You hit over a certain threshold and you have free shipping. So it's not something that we did new with our business, it's something that we've been doing for over a year now in terms of how we dial that up.", "Brad Dickerson", "We run it over $100 from time to time on a promotion.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I didn't realize there was a minimum. The offers I saw, there wasn't a minimum.", "Wayne Marino", "The other thing is, in September I mentioned earlier that one of the things we did have, is we did have some service issues in September specifically to the web business where we were unable to process orders in what we would consider a timely manner, so we did whatever we could to process those orders, and in some cases, we probably put on some freight on our backs to make sure we got the goods to the customer and fill that demand.", "Since that time, by the end of the quarter we certainly had completed what we would consider everything that we had to do to get ourselves back in high processing so we could ship an order if you need it within two days. There was a period of time where we had that order processing, so it could have been related to that.", "Kevin Plank", "To lose that web business in the back to school time frame is probably the worst three or four weeks that you could have asked for. We learned from that and we're in a position now where the team has reacted to it just like we did when we reacted to inventories as well.", "", "Operator", "That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Plank for any additional or closing comments.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope that we have demonstrated the continued excitement that we have for the Under Armour brand. Our connections with consumers is as strong as ever. We're getting ready for the most exciting launch in our brands' history and we've added significant depth and experience to our leadership team.", "If you take one thing away from our call this morning, it's that Under Armour is a growth company, and while we did not provide specific outlook for 2009 today, we are certain that in 2009 we will grow.", "Our men's apparel business will grow. Our women's apparel business will grow. Our youth apparel business will grow. Our footwear business will grow. Our direct to consumer will grow and our international business will grow.", "We're focused on our consumer. We're focused on innovation, and we're focused on dictating the tempo that will enable us to execute on the growth opportunities we see ahead.", "Thank you all very much.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please stand by as we are admitting additional participants and we will be underway shortly.  Thank you for your patience and please continue to hold.  Please standby.", "Good day and welcome to the Under Armour Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Results conference call and Webcast.  This call is being recorded today and at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Alex Pettitt.  Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Alexandra Pettit", "Thank you and good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call.  During the course of this conference call we'll be making projections or other forward looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.  ", "The words estimates, intent, expect, plan, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risk uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "Important factors relating to our business including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking are described in our press release and in the risk factor section of the filings with the SEC.", "The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Before we continue I would like to direct you to our Website investor.underarmour.com.  There you will find this morning's press release and on our Webcast page images of a number of products and initiatives we will address on the call.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, followed by David McCreight, our President, and finally Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2009.", "After the prepared remarks Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30.  And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "", "Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone.  It's a very exciting time for Under Armour as we launch Running Footwear at retail this Saturday.  It illustrates not only our ability to continue bringing newness to our consumers and retailers but the opportunities that lie ahead and the potential for our brand.", "It's also a great opportunity to reflect on the progress we made in 2008 and while our excitement about the long-term opportunities for the brand remains so strong.  But I want to be clear that we are focused on the short-term as well.", "Our success in 2010 and beyond will be significantly impacted by the decisions we make in '09 and we are not taking our eye off of the long-term growth strategy.  Our five growth engines all remain very much intact; men's apparel, women's apparel, footwear, international and direct consumer.", "In large part 2008 was another very successful year for Under Armour.  We grew revenues 20%, successfully launched Training Footwear and significantly strengthened our management team and our balance sheet.", "For the long-term health of our brand the most important development was that our consumer continues to pay a premium for our product and our retailers view us more so than ever as an essential brand that consistently drives traffic for them.", "In a context of a very difficult retail environment what happened at retail for Under Armour for the back half of 2008 was very positive from a brand perspective.  There's been a lot of discussion about where the consumer is heading and where \u2013 we are very aware of the challenges facing all brands in this environment.", "Even the strongest of brands face significant obstacles in 2009.  The strong brands in our business will position themselves for consistent growth in the out years.  We like our long-term prospects for a number of reasons.  But the primary one is the strength of the Under Armour brand.", "We believe there will always be an appetite for the companies that deliver on their brand promise particularly those that are built on a foundation of performance.  It's exciting to think about the running room we have just in our current domestic apparel distribution especially in the categories of women's and youth's where we haven't really scratched the surface yet.", "Within our stage we believe we are operating from a position of strength and beyond that we have more long-term levers to pull than any other brand in our space, new categories, new distribution and new geographies.", "On the product front we've been building that infrastructure for growth over the past few years where our revenue growth has been explosive.  Because we invested and built the teams during those years of high growth we are now in position to pull the levers such as Running Footwear.", "This will not only drive growth in the short-term but will also position us to continue scaling our footwear business.  Beyond Running Footwear there are growth opportunities for us long-term in soccer boots and eventually once the product is ready, basketball.", "From a distribution standpoint our entry into Running Footwear provides a great opportunity to expand our brand presence into the mall specialty channel, places like Foot Locker, another logical step in the Under Armour brand story where we haven't sold our first pair of shoes yet.", "Through the constant evolution of our company our strategy of generating excitement among Under Armour's core consumers will not change, innovative new product, new categories, marketing that breaks through the clutter and a continued focus on connecting with our consumers.", "Under Armour's Running Footwear hits the market this Saturday and as many of you have seen on some of our communication already whether in print, in store or on TV the products in the campaign speak directly to our core consumer, the athlete.", "The campaign itself is our most inclusive ever.  All athletes run.  The buzz has been great on the running shoes with major media outlets and men's running publications reporting high anticipation of release of our very first pairs.", "We'll continue to invest in the business that will fuel our long-term growth but we're not blind to the realities of the current state of the consumer.  We will prioritize those investments to insure that we are delivering both short-term and long-term value for our shareholders.", "For example we've talked consistently about using our existing specialty retail stores as a test.  We believe the inside information we get in our four stores about how our consumer likes to shop for our brand will help guide our decision-making around developing additional specialty stores.  For 2009 though we are not planning to open any additional UA specialty stores. ", "In Europe we've invested in sports marketing assets such as the Welsh Rugby Union, the Hanover 96 Football Club in Germany to help authenticate the brand on-field.  In 2009 we are using those assets to help the brand take root and build our presence.", "We have been and remain a growth company and have a heightened sense of managing the profitability in 2009.  We are becoming better operators, better footwear developers and apparel designers, better at managing our inventory and our sports marketing relationships, better at managing our supply chain and better at understanding our consumer.", "The slower consumer environment affords us the opportunity to re-look at the operating structure we have developed over the past two years and identify areas where we can do things better and more profitably.  As COO Wayne Marino is driving our key initiatives from the operational side and David McCreight, our President, who brings experience in maximizing profit at multi-billion dollar brands is now charged with aligning our long-term growth strategy while fueling our near-term profitability.", "To take you through that opportunity I'd like to pass it over to David so he can talk about some specific areas we're looking to impact in 2009 and beyond.  David?", "David McCreight", "", "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.  Kevin spoke earlier about Under Armour operating from a position of strength.  For me the power of the Under Armour brand is really defined by the equity resident in the brand and the breadth of growth opportunities available to us unlike any other companies.", "Having worked successfully with brands where the business and company were more mature and the growth potential was less clear I have a strong appreciation for where and how to help UA grow and grow profitably.", "Some of the opportunities for growth were apparent before joining.  Yet further opportunities for growth and improvement were identified during my first few months with Team UA.  One of the more, one of the more apparent opportunities before joining was the footwear category Kevin mentioned.", "Credit for the existence of this growth vehicle lies in the wisdom of some of the investments the team made in building platforms around the brand, several years ago amidst rapid top line expansion with the clear and deliberate plan, investment in infrastructure was deployed which enabled us to entry the multi-billion dollar run foot wear business which will begin to bear fruit this Saturday.", "Our entrance into the footwear business started on-field.  The source of Under Armour's innovation and the heart of our brand equity and our experience to date in building high-performance footwear for elite athletes, in cleated, training and now running footwear, has materially informed how we bring product to market.", "And while we are in the early stages of building a great footwear culture and business model at UA it will be my role to insure that the construction of our platform remains true to our original spirit of authenticity and innovation but is also executed in a strategic and profitable manner.", "We will focus on insuring that we have the right team, supply chain, distribution plans and innovation pipeline to fuel what could be our largest near to mid-term growth platform.", "On the other hand, an example of the opportunities that were perhaps less apparent and were somewhat surprising to me, is the amount of untapped potential remaining in the Under Armour apparel platform.  While already viewed as the leader in the performance category, and currently the largest source of our revenue, when reviewing the apparel business it became clear that material growth potential remains for men's, women's and youth's. ", "With more aggressive merchandising capabilities and analytics, further developing product flow and assortment innovation, growing floor space with existing distribution points as well as targeting under-penetrated markets points to the opportunity for us to introduce even more athletes to Under Armour apparel.", "As Kevin discussed we are acutely aware of the need to manage appropriately in the current economic environment.  However we are confident that the tremendous power of the Under Armour brand and the untapped potential of our growth platforms when combined with more rigorous operating and investment disciplines will deliver a dynamic combination of market share and operating margin growth in the future.  ", "Thank you and with this I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brad Dickerson.", "Brad Dickerson", "", "Thank you, David.  With Kevin and David having taken you through some highlights and some strategies for our business I would now like to spend some time on our fourth quarter to full year financial results.", "As you will recall on January 14 we announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $179 million to $180 million for net revenues and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.16 to $0.18.", "Our net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 3% year-over-year to $179.3 million.  The growth is largely driven by our footwear business which was up 36% to $9.2 million and our licensing revenues which were up 33% to $8.4 million. Our apparel business was essentially flat in the quarter.", "The U.S. wholesale apparel business was impacted by a lower level of at-once orders and increased cancellations and returns on a year-over-year basis.  This was offset by growth in our direct-to-consumer channel which was up 47% for the quarter.", "For the full year net revenues increased 20% to $725.2 million.  Our apparel revenues increased 13% for the year while our footwear business more than doubled to $84.8 million with our successful launch in the performance training category.", "Fourth quarter gross margins were 50.7% compared with 52% in the prior year's quarter.  There were several puts and takes that impacted the gross margin for the quarter.  The largest impact came from the higher proportion of footwear sales in the quarter which had lower gross margins than apparel.", "The natural offset to this was the positive impact to gross margins from our growth in direct-to-consumer channel.  Two other factors contributed to the gross margin decline.  First although our core apparel sales continued to sell through at full price in a top retail environment we initiated markdowns on some seasonal styles towards the end of the quarter.", "Additionally apparel margins were impacted by a less favorable product mix.  For the full year gross margins were 48.9% compared to 50.3% in 2007 and our previous outlook of 49.5%.  The biggest impact to our gross margin on a year-over-year basis was the growth in the footwear business which was partially offset by growth in our higher margin direct-to-consumer channel.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $68.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 or 37.9% of net revenues compared to $62.6 million or 35.8% of net revenues in the prior year.  For the full year selling, general and administrative expenses were $278 million or 38.3% of net revenues compared with $218.8 million or 36.1% of net revenues in the prior year.", "Marketing expenses increased to $23.7 million in 2008 and were 13.1% of net revenues compared with 11.7% in 2007.  We had previously anticipated marketing expenses to be at the high end of the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues for 2008.", "Also impacting our SG&A for the quarter and the year was an increase in our bad debt reserves.  Although there are no specific items of concern we believe the current economic environment increases the risks in general for some of our customers.  As such we increased our bad debt reserves from $1.1 million to $4.2 million during the year.", "Operating income during the fourth quarter was $22.9 million compared with $28.3 million in the prior year.  Operating margin was 12.8% compared with 16.2% in the prior year quarter.  Operating income for the full year was $76.9 million or 10.6% of net revenues compared with $86.3 million or 14.2% of net revenues in the prior year.", "Our operating margin for the year was impacted by the year-over-year decline in gross margin as well as SG&A to leverage.  Based on the [time given] investments in our business including the greater front-loading of marketing expenses to support our Performance Training launch we had planned for substantial operating margins leverage in the third and fourth quarters.", "Although we managed costs tightly in the fourth quarter the slowdown in sales occurred late in the quarter and we were limited in our ability to adjust spending at that point.  Below the operating income line there are a couple of key items to address.  ", "Net other income and expense is comprised of net interest expense and the impact of foreign currency.  We had previously estimated net other expense to be approximately $3 million for 2008 based on projected interest expense for the year as well as foreign currency impact through the third quarter.  ", "As we noted during our third quarter earnings call although we had hedged a portion of our foreign currency exchange risk for the fourth quarter we remained exposed to some levels of currency risk.", "As a result net other expense was $5 million during the fourth quarter versus $90 thousand in the same period of the prior year.  For the full year net other expense was $7 million versus net other income of $2.8 million in 2007.", "For 2009 we have expanded our hedging strategy to help us mitigate currency risk and anticipate less exposure to foreign currency exchange risks in the upcoming year.", "Our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 45.3% compared with 41% in 2007 and our previous outlook of 42.7%.  The increase in our tax rate for 2008 came as a result of two factors.  First a higher proportion of our consolidated taxable income was earned in the U.S.  Second beginning in January 2008 the state income rate for Maryland, our home based state, increased from 7% to 8.25%.", "Our effective tax rate is expected to be lower in 2009 as a result of certain tax strategies that will be implemented beginning this year.", "Our resulting net income in the fourth quarter was $8.3 million compared with $16.9 million in the prior year period.  Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.17 compared with $0.34 in the prior year.  Net income for the full year was $38.2 million compared with $52.6 million in 2007.  Diluted earnings per share for 2008 was $0.77 compared with $1.05 in the prior year.", "Now a few moments on the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $102 million compared with $40.6 million as of December 31, 2007.  Cash net of debt increased $30.2 million at year-end to $56.5 million compared with cash net of debt of $26.3 million as of December 31, 2007.", "At the end of the year we had $25 million drawn on a revolving credit facility.  We had previously anticipated cash net of debt to remain relatively flat from 2007 year-end balance.  The increase was driven by the higher proportion of direct-to-consumer sales in the fourth quarter as well as more focused management of our receivables.", "Net accounts receivable decreased 13% on a year-over-year basis which was below our net revenue growth for the quarter.  Part of this was impacted by the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts which was mentioned earlier.", "Inventory at year-end which included approximately $15 million of running footwear to support this Saturday's product launch increased 9.7% to $182.2 million compared with $166.1 million as of December 31, 2007.  Without running footwear which began shipping in January inventory growth would have been flat at year-end.  While we did not deliver inventory growth at rate below sales growth for the fourth quarter due to the slowdown in sales we purchased over $50 million less of inventory in a year where we grew the top line 20%.", "We made progress in systems and process development around inventory management in 2008.  And in 2009 we are aiming for improved inventory churns.  As Kevin mentioned earlier brand integrity is top of the mind for us and we understand the important role inventory management plays here.", "Our investment in capital expenditures for the year was $40 million below our previous estimate of $44 million.  We had previously stated that we expected future CapEx to grow in line with our top line but we are taking a more conservative approach with CapEx as we look forward to 2009.  Although we are growing our business in 2009 we are currently planning our CapEx spending down year-over-year.  In this environment the balance sheet is a critical focus to us and an area we continue to look to strengthen.", "I'm pleased to announce that we've entered in to a new three-year revolving credit facility.  The new facility provides for an initial commitment of $180 million and replaces the existing $100 million facility.  Our new credit facility strengthens our banking syndicate and increases our access to capital.  Our ability to secure this facility in the current environment is a testament to the strength of our brand and our balance sheet.", "With the uncertainty around the current environment we believe it is prudent at this time to limit any specific financial details around 2009.  Although we cannot comment on how 2009 will stack up against the long-term goals we provided investors yesterday we would like to provide some color around what we see.", "We remain confident about our business and the growth opportunities we have this year and in future years.  Our excitement about this Saturday's launch is matched with excitement from both our consumer and our retail partners.", "In its first year running footwear is anticipated to be significantly larger than performance training and the product remains allocated for 2009.  Our direct to consumer business has been as strong in 2008 and remains a growth [inaudible] for 2009.  As David spoke to you earlier we continue to believe in a long term opportunity of our apparel business.  However, based on the trends in the fourth quarter and the limited visibility we have in the current environment we are taking a conservative view on our U.S. wholesale apparel business in 2009.", "As a growth company we are committed to driving short-term and long-term value for our shareholders.  Financial strength is critical and as CFO for a growth company in 2009 I am focused on two things, first the balance sheet and second cost controls.", "From a balance sheet perspective our liquidity is strengthened with our current cash position as well as the new credit facility now in place.  We are planning our CapEx down in the year with anticipated top line growth and we are focused on improving inventory turns in 2009.", "As far as cost controls, our goal is to protect our operating margin in 2009.  Our investments will be prioritized and when we do invest those costs we manage tightly.  We have always said that we are a cultural growth balanced with a cultural profitability and this year will be no exception.", "At this time we would now like to open the call to your questions.  We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible, operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robbie Ohmes \u2013 BOA Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 BOA Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much, good morning everybody.  Actually two quick questions the first question you know I understand that you want to limit the details on \u201909.  But can you just speak when you talk about conservative on \u201909 view for apparel, can you sort of speak to you know what that means in terms of approaching the category.  ", "Does that mean that you will not be pushing to expand, you know the number of doors that carry Under Armor apparel or does that mean that you\u2019ll, you know be careful about launching new styles or programs in the apparel business or that you won\u2019t be you know pushing to grow women\u2019s or kids?  Just sort of maybe a little bit around what that means in terms of how you operate that business.", "And then the second question you know I guess maybe for Brad trying to understand the magnitude of the foreign currency, you know sort of expense, other expense stuff that hits you in the fourth quarter and then how that lines up with the percent of your business that you do internationally or can you just walk us through how that works, either from a sourcing or the size of your international business and then we can get our arms around what happened there.  Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "", "Robbie, let me start off and then I\u2019m going to pass it onto Brad and let him actually pile it on the first, your first question as well and then get to question two.  ", "But I think you know we\u2019re pretty evident in the scripts is that you know we remain very optimistic about there\u2019s growth left in our apparel business, very much so.  Not only I think the way we highlighted the women\u2019s and youth but even in our men\u2019s business and that the levers that we still have to pull there, obviously with geographies but we also believe with distribution and even more importantly we believe within our existing doors.", "So I think the conservative approach that I think the market as a whole has taken toward apparel is one of the things where our selves being and continue in being the largest the number one performing brand everywhere, virtually everywhere we\u2019re doing business today.

So it\u2019s not just a matter of looking at the end of Q4 but how does that look in Q1 of \u201909 too. ", "So we\u2019ll be getting back to you guys obviously in 90 days, in 90 days from now we\u2019re going to have a lot more data and information around you know the behavior of that consumer in this environment.  So we think it\u2019s prudent this time to kind of be conservative and hold off on any specific guidance there.", "Secondly you know as it relates to the top line conservatism that flows through the rest of our, a lot of our numbers, not only on the income statement but on the balance sheet as well as inventory also.", "So you know as far as managing SG&A going forward, you know that matches our conservatism we\u2019re looking at the top, as far as the top line goes and also in our inventory management going forward.", "On the second question you have Robbie on FX just to kind of give you some more flavor around that.  If you look at the whole year of 2008 we had foreign currency exposure, losses of about $6.2 million for the full year and that\u2019s compared to about a $2 million gain last year in foreign currency for the whole year.  If you look at foreign currency I break it up into two components.  First would be our exposure to intercompany balances, owed by our foreign entities which right now for the most part are Canada and Europe.", "And in the second part would be the transactional foreign currencies, so I\u2019ll take the first one first here which is the inter company piece.  As we talked about in the past we had some hedging, done back in the end of 2007 and through 2008 and that was really on our Canadian currency.", "In 2008 towards the end of the quarter Q4 we implemented some European currency hedging relative to our intercompany balances.  The inter company piece was the biggest exposure by far we had in Q4 and it was the Euro piece that was the biggest exposure since we didn\u2019t really hedge that until the end of the quarter.", "So as you look into 2009, you have the inter company  Canadian dollar and intercompany Euro dollar hedged which should reduce our exposure in those areas and currently right now in Q1 of 2009 we\u2019re working on hedging strategies around transactions in Canadian and Euro dollars which is less of an impact right now in the inter company.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 BOA Merrill Lynch", "", "Great thanks very much and just one last question can you just remind us so for 2008 what percent of your revenues was international?", "", "Brad Dickerson", "", "For 2008 for the year 5% of our revenues were international.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup.", "Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup", "", "I was wondering if you could address how your manufacturing plans may have changed in order to address customers ordering more at once.", "Unidentified Corporate Participant", "", "Kate, I might [inaudible] on that.", "David McCreight", "We\u2019ve been fortunate where we\u2019ve had two types of models in our business very early on.  One has been the affluence ordering and the other one has been the futures program.  And for us the At Once position has been a pretty substantial part of our business and a very successful part.  What we\u2019ve done in at-once is we\u2019ve been able to shorten lead times, take safety stocks and use a much more statistical information to work with I would say a quick return to the floor.", "There\u2019s other things we\u2019ve done too and I have to call out a credit here to the logistics group, who has been able to utilize the shipments from our factories pretty much to the floor or to the doors of our customers.  That\u2019s cut lead time, its cut transportation time, so we\u2019ve been quicker in terms of responding to at-once.

You know frankly we were a little disappointed that our inventory growth was higher than our top line growth at year-end but the results would have been that much better had the top line not slowed.", "The team has done a good job and I think there\u2019s several things I want to point out.  One inventory remains a very key focus for this company for myself and we\u2019ve made great strides.  You know the first strategy we had was to minimize our excess inventory and that really comes about through buying a little bit tighter, managing the at-once business tighter and buying closer to bookings.", "We\u2019ve also made some progress with our lead times, so the first part of that is progress has been made with how we bought inventory and an example of that is you look at our full year and our top line increased by 20%, we actually purchased in the year $50 million less so great strides, great call out for the team.", "The second one I want to point out is that we talk about inventory and taking care of the excess or overage inventory, we have a very, very strong outlet division who has operated profitably at the same time has controlled our excess, and with the growth in stores last year and the ability to move it through the outlet stores we\u2019ve actually started to reduce some of that excess inventory.", "And third really is the fact that our company is finally putting in the systems and processes that I would expect of a large scalable company in managing inventory.  So I\u2019m very happy with the progress it was probably a little bit ahead of where we thought it would be, but we\u2019re going to continue to see improvement, we\u2019re not finished, we have a long way to go as you can probably tell and as Brad called out in the prepared remarks we\u2019ll see improvements in our inventory turns.", "And with our systems in place and processes I would expect us to continue to improve our balance sheet by managing the inventory.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay thanks and then actually want to ask David a question, you know you\u2019ve been there a little longer stretch now than last quarter and is certainly an interesting time to be joining a growth company.", "You know you talked a little bit about you know other revenue opportunities in different categories for this brand, you know what, what do you see from a profitability standpoint, are there opportunities in the margin line on the cost side or you know how do you think about helping the position, you know put in place some of the you know learning you\u2019ve had from your prior experiences and perhaps you know make Under Armor as a profitable brand as it could be?", "", "David McCreight", "", "Good morning, Omar.

As a matter of fact what we\u2019ve done over the last year or so actually consolidated our base a little bit went from 24 suppliers down to 17 so we\u2019re meaningful within our factories.", "But I have to point out some of the savings that we\u2019ll receive from being more efficient and focused on costing we\u2019re certainly going to want to reinvest some of that back into the product.  So there\u2019s many factors that go into gross margin.

", "Is that \u2013 I\u2019m guessing a combination of factors but does it way anymore on capital preservation versus an unproven retail model or fluctuating leasing prices at this point?", "Kevin Plank", "", "Jeff, let me just start with, you know, the direct consumer channel obviously with 47% growth there, we continue to see that we\u2019ve got, you know, big legs and availability there.  But it\u2019s about prioritizing the investments, which I think sort of lays into the second part of your question.", "You know, it\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve done is \u2013 at Under Armour we\u2019ve always had, you know, 13 items in our top 10 list as Wayne likes to say.  So, the one thing that 2009 has made us do as a company I think, is limit that down to the top four or five where we\u2019re going to spend money.", "And the question that we ask when we sit around this table is simply, where are we going to deploy the resources?  Where are we going to spend the time, the money and the resources of our people to be great?  And we definitely see that there is tremendous upside in our direct consumer channel but, you know, as we look at that specialty model, we\u2019ve got four great stores out there.  ", "We\u2019ve got four great tests that are taking place right now and we\u2019re still learning a ton.  We\u2019re interacting with our consumer and a great thing that we have just from an insight is that we\u2019re rolling out our goals for 2009 as a company.  ", "You know, we had more than a million people throughout all of our stores in just December alone of 2009, and the question from the information that we can learn \u2013 because again, we\u2019re not building this company for, you know, just today or even tomorrow as much as this is very much long term the approach that we\u2019re taking. ", "We\u2019re building a broad foundation in multibillion dollar platform for a large global brand, and all those steps, you know, begins one at a time, it begins with our insights, and it begins with our commitment to innovation.  ", "But I think you\u2019ll see, you know, prudent investments around that and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t feel that we had to stand on a soap box and demand that four stores would turn into 20.  ", "But we\u2019re going to learn a lot and we\u2019re going to listen to our partners and we\u2019re going to make great decisions that make best sense for our brand.  Brad \u2013 yeah, let me let Brad jump on the end there.", "Brad Dickerson", "", "Yeah, Jeff on the margin question, you take a look at the three components of our direct-to-consumer business, outlet specialty, retail and the web business.  ", "I\u2019ll work my way up as far as the positive impact in margins starting with outlet.  Our outlet channel has positive margins compared to our wholesale channel and obviously the outlet plays more of a brand, you know, brand equity, brand integrity play relative to the liquidation of inventory.", "But we do that profitably, we do that at margins greater than our wholesale apparel margins actually.  On the specialty store side obviously margins there would be greater than our outlet channel with four stores, though, obviously the impact of the overall business is relatively minor compared to the overall direct-to-consumer channel.", "At the top end of that would be a our web business, you know, pretty much selling through at full retail price in our web business as you can anticipate that would probably bring the best gross margins to our business overall.", "If you look at operating margins though, it\u2019s a little bit of a different take.  You know, again the web probably has the best operating margins of those three and then when you look at the specialty and outlet stores you do bring in a little bit more SG&A infrastructure into those, so from an operating margins perspective they\u2019re relatively comparable to our overall business.", "", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "This \u2013 one other question, last question for I think David on distribution.  You mentioned in your prepared comments that, you know, there are opportunities where you\u2019re underpenetrated and I\u2019m just curious if you get a little more color on that, particularly in light of the current environment.  ", "You know, is this 2009 where you prune unproductive distribution?  Do you net ad, net neutral?  And where are those under penetrated pockets?  I\u2019d imagine domestically is what you\u2019re referring to.", "", "David McCreight", "", "Yeah, we\u2019re starting as you look at it \u2013 the opportunities for distribution are pretty broad for us but again, we are focused first and most intently on growing within our existing partners and continuing to grow where we already have terrific partnerships in sporting goods and the specialty stores, as well as the launch, as Kevin mentioned earlier of a tremendous new channel to access many more people in the malls as well.", "The net we\u2019re going to continue to look at and view this as a multiyear approach and we\u2019ll be very structured and continue to be very planned as we continue to look for places where the Under Armour brand currently is reached and where there are pockets of customers who have yet to have been contacted by our direct channel or existing distribution.", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "David, just to clarify on your existing distribution when you talk about your sporting goods distribution domestically, where do you feel like you have \u2013 because you guys have pretty strong presence, floor presence obviously at Dick\u2019s and at TSA and Hibbett \u2013 I mean, where do you see \u2013 do you mean more product categories represented on those floors?  More floor space?  Where do you see that expansion coming from?", "David McCreight", "", "As you start to look at it if you were, you know,  to walk our stores today you\u2019d see a very strong men\u2019s presence but you\u2019d still see a very young and growing women\u2019s business and a very early step into the youth category as well.  ", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay.", "David McCreight", "", "And you just heard earlier Kevin talk about the footwear channel, I mean the footwear business that we have on the wall.  We\u2019re in training, we\u2019re in cleated footwear and we have other categories to expand within existing partners there.", "Kevin Plank", "", "If our answers sounded anymore certain or deliberate today it\u2019s probably because we\u2019re all sitting here wearing Under Armour running footwear which I would encourage all of you to go get a pair this weekend and try them.  ", "Now, I would like to leave you with three critical things that we would like you to take away from today\u2019s call though.  First, it\u2019s that our growth drivers remain intact.  Secondly, that we\u2019re approaching 2009 with the appropriate degree of conservatism and third and most importantly, we are focus on protecting our strong brand equity.  We remain intently focused on our consumer.  ", "That relationship is what the Under Armour brand was built upon and will ultimately determine our ability to execute our long term growth.  We\u2019ve invested in and protected brand equity since day one and that continued focus will drive growth in 2009 and lay the foundation for long term profitable growth in 2010 and beyond.  ", "And with that, we thank all of you and again encourage you to go out and see Under Armour at retail this weekend.

This call is being recorded today and at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Alex Pettitt. Please go ahead.", "Alex Pettitt", "Thank you and good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call we will be making projections or other forward looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.", "The words estimates, intent, expect, plan, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "Important factors relating to our business, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are described in our press release and in the risk factor section of the filings with the SEC.", "The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Before we continue I would like to direct you to our website investor.underarmour.com. There you will find this morning's press release and on our webcast page, images of a number of products and initiatives we will address on the call.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, followed by David McCreight, our President, and finally Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss this company's financial performance for the first quarter and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2009.", "After the prepared remarks Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the revenue increase at 27% and EPS growth of 33%.", "We believe this growth is a great illustration of the opportunities that exist for our brand, opportunities that will enable Under Armour to maintain our growth trajectory, even in today\u2019s environment.", "In fact, when you look at the three key drivers of our revenue growth in the quarter, Running Footwear, women\u2019s apparel and our direct consumer business, all of those categories are areas where we have invested in and built the infrastructure for growth over the past several years.", "Our ability to leverage these investments and generate growth, speaks of the willingness of our consumer to support our entry into new categories and channels, into the overall strength of the Under Armour brand.", "Our growth drivers are intact and they are working as designed; apparel, footwear, international and direct consumer. This past quarter\u2019s successful entry into Running and our increased presence in the mall are prime examples of how we can combine new product categories with new distribution channels to deliver growth.", "There has been a lot of discussion about our entry into Running Footwear and I would like to spend a few minutes on how we started off and what we have learnt so far.", "Our entry in the Running Footwear has been welcomed by both our retailers and consumers. As we discuss, the opportunity in Running Footwear is significantly larger than cleats in Training. And we consequently decided to wait to enter Running, while gaining footwear experience in these other categories.", "Our internal success metrics in Running Footwear are focused on our ability to deliver a technically sound product to our athletes and our accounts. Based on the feedback we have received from our consumers and our retailers, we are delivering against this promise. This early acceptance will help us build a solid base, which runs for the long-term and solidify our early steps into specialty and the mall, an important distribution opportunity as our brand continues to grow.", "In the short-term, we look at three key measures of our entry into Running Footwear. First, great product that delivers on the Under Armour performance. Second, retailer\u2019s support from a largest established accounts like Dick\u2019s, Sport Authority, Hibbett, Academy and [Model] and new partners such as Finish Line, Foot Locker and of course our strong foundation of independent and specialty accounts.", "And third, and most importantly, consumer acceptance from both our core as well as the broader consumer demographic that Running takes us to.", "We believe we\u2019ve gotten off to great start with all three of these metrics and we believe that we are here to stay. Just as we\u2019re learning to become a better footwork company, we are adjusting our marketing support to ensure consumers are being made aware of Under Armour Running on a more consistent basis.", "For those of you who watched NFL throughout this past weekend, there is a good chance you saw our athletes who are on Commercial. Again, we took a category like running and rather than focus on narrow target of racers, we opened the market to all our athletes, men and women, with the message that all athletes run.", "It\u2019s our most inclusive campaign to-date and it\u2019s still all about elite performance. Giving that Running Footwear is a twelve month business and we brought product to market earlier this year than we do with Training Footwear in 2008, we\u2019ve been able to spread our marketing support over a broader period. ", "With our initial launch campaign speaking to a broader audience, we were also able to hone in our sports specific campaign, while partnering with national and regional retailers. In baseball, for example, we featured the New York Mets All-Star shortstop Hose Reyes in media, online and in our billboard in Times Square.", "We will continue to partner with retailers to drive our marketing messages as we move to the introduction of our running line for back-to-school. We are in the process of building a great platform for growth in the running footwear business and it will remain a focus for us in 2010 and beyond. We are committed internally to getting better each season in all aspects of footwear and continuing to earn our stripes with athletes who demand the best from Under Armour.", "I also want to mention the introduction of Under Armour\u2019s Soccer Footwear. We are introducing the Under Armour soccer boot in a limited way to soccer specialty accounts here in the States and in Europe this spring. This begins with a great technical product that we expect to learn a tremendous amount from our consumers in the coming months.", "As we gain authenticity on the pitch, we will increase our allocation of product for the market. This is a bit quieter than we have typically launched products in the past but an approach that we feel is appropriate for long-term success and helps us add another leg to the growth platform of footwear.", "As proud as we are with what we accomplished this quarter in running, I believe that more important story is that we comp up in apparel for the quarter and did so largely at full price. We feel that as a strong achievement in this environment and we remain focused on generating growth in our apparel business for 2009 without sacrificing our integrity or the growth we see in apparel in 2010.", "For instance, our new T-MPT-shirt which retailed for $30 was one of our strongest performers this past quarter. The fact that we can continue to reinvent the apparel product paradigm is a great testament to the strength of our brand. At the same time, we believe that we have not built our brands defining product yet, and we see numerous avenues beyond new product categories where we will be able to grow our apparel business. Innovation will be at the heart of this.", "I want to pass it over to David in a moment, but want to leave you with one final thought. Under Armour was founded on a very simple idea with a pretty straight forward business model, which set us apart in that first phase of growth because that we brought the concept of performance to athletic apparel.", "That original insight got us a long ways, women\u2019s and kids businesses, product categories beyond our core compression, established businesses in Europe, Japan and Canada. But, now it\u2019s time to evolve into the next stage of the Under Armour growth story.", "Just as it was when Under Armour started, the key driver of this next stage will be product innovation, but it will no longer just be about Under Armour, the compression brand. The time has come to change the definition of performance. We believe it is up to Under Armour to create the next generation of performance products for athletes. Our consumers expect that from us and it will be our primary pursuit as we move into this next state of growth.", "As we bring this new level performance to consumers, we will evolve our company with new ways of looking at how we tell the Under Armour story and new approaches to achieve operational excellence on a par with this next generation of performance product.", "I am confident, this next stage of our growth story will be as compelling as the first, and we will build our team to ensure we balance our focus on athletes in achieving profitable growth.", "I will pass it over now to David, who will give you a color on some of the additional steps we are taking to build our long-term growth platforms. David.", "David McCreight", "Thank you, Kevin. As we continue to evolve our long-term growth platform, it has become clear to me that the opportunities that exist with the Under Armour brand remain near the top for our competitor\u2019s base.", "This quarter\u2019s results provide evidence particularly as it relates to our ability to sell-through at full price amid broad and consistent discounting activity in our marketplace.", "While volume may be as impacted by the current consumer environment, our pricing integrity and brands position remain intact. The willingness of our athletes to pay a premium for performance product is a great indicator of our brands strength. ", "As time goes on, we feel our ability to balance pricing integrity and bottom line profitability will ultimately prove to be one of our business model\u2019s strongest assets. As Kevin mentioned, we enter 2009 with our growth platforms under developed.", "There lie a meaningful opportunities within all our platforms, including our apparel business. While evolving our apparel model from a year-round basics assortment to one that includes more seasonal flow in collections, we have been disciplined around both distribution and category extensions. This discipline and model evolution provides us with much leverage for generating mid-to-long term apparel growth.", "But, while the marketplace looks for the consumer environment to normalize, we should be able to gain floor space in categories such as women's and youth within our existing distribution as well as strategically move into new channels where consumers will begin to expect our brand today.", "Another example of how our opportunities are manifested from our growth drivers is our entry this quarter in to the multi-billion dollar Running Footwear category. Following last year's successful training shoe launch, we entered Running Footwear with the intent to build overtime a scalable and profitable platform that helps us reach even more athletes, both domestically and internationally. This is a new business and a new model for us and one we plan to perfect in the coming years. ", "On the margin side of our business model, it is time we revisited our supply chain structure. We plan on moving from a sourcing model that due to our rapid growth needed to emphasize reliable delivery and quality to one where we continue to deliver high quality premium products, but at a better value to the Under Armour shareholders. ", "Wayne and team are beginning to develop networks, analytic tools and skill sets that will support this vital initiative. One natural example is the significant opportunity to take cost out of the manufacturing processes as we gain experience in categories such as footwear. We believe, long-term these efforts will help offset some of the gross margin pressure we anticipate from a higher mix of footwear as well as higher mark downs related to seasonal apparels. ", "As Brad will review with you, we are being diligent in managing our SG&A, working to align our assets and investments with our growth drivers. We have recalibrated our marketing spend for this macro economic environment, but we will continue to drive our consumer in to our retail partner stores at an appropriate level and where necessary spends to remain the brands most relevant to this generation.", "We believe that by continuing to prioritize investments and make the ones that will generate growth like Running Footwear, we are setting ourselves up appropriately for the long term. It\u2019s important to understand that our future model is not simply about entering new categories for growth.", "With each season, we expect to gain valuable insight that makes us better operators and strengthen the platform to reach more customers. This will help us ensure that the revenue growth we see in 2010 and beyond, will be more profitable and provide a strong return on our investments.", "2009 is a year of balance for our organization. Cutting cost in some areas while accelerating investments in others; balancing our long term business view and decisions with the right cause for the business and our financial strength for 2009. We will continue to focus on brand and pricing integrity as we understand the importance of our brand equity to our long-term growth.", "At the same time, we will protect our balance sheet and liquidity. We believe that our wholesale partners continue to adjust to the changing consumer environment. We are not planning on a significant increase in consumer activity for the balance of the year.", "On the other hand, we do have the benefit of sports being the primary driver of our business and team sports like baseball, football and soccer continue to be played everyday. We believe this makes Under Armour brand a less discretionary purchase than our pricing might lead one to believe.", "In the past, we were a company that relied on hyper-revenue increases to generate our profitability. The discipline that we are building on our investment in developing investments in cost management today is making us a better, a more athletic and powerful company for the future.", "We believe that this conservative approach in 2009 is not only the appropriate time for this year but sets us up well to generate meaningful profitable growth as the difficult consumer environment improves. While we are very confident in our future long-term prospects, we remain cautious on the outlook for 2009. We have a great brand, a strong team, who are focused, dedicated and committing to doing what is right for this brand in the long-term. ", "With that I'd like to turn it over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO.", "Brad Dickerson", "", "Thanks David. With Kevin and David having taken you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time on our first quarter financial results. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2009 increased 27% to $200 million.", "Driven by our entry into Running Footwear as well as shipments of performance training footwear which launched in the second quarter of 2008, footwear revenues in the quarter increased to $40.3 million to $56.9 million.", "Our Apparel revenue growth rate in the first quarter improved slightly from the rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. Year-over-year apparel net revenues are up 2.4% to $132.2 million in the first quarter with our women's business generating the strongest growth rate.", "Our direct-to-consumer channel continues to be a strong performer and was up 38% for the quarter. First quarter gross margins were 45.3%, compared with 47.6% in the prior year's quarter.", "There were several puts and takes that impacted the gross margin for the quarter. First was the impact of the higher proportion of footwear sales in the quarter. As we've discussed, footwear has lower product margin that apparel. In addition, footwear has an increased level of mark-down allowances associated with it due to the seasonal nature of the business. As our footwear business matures, we expect to improve our planning for product flow.", "Second; on the apparel side, margins were impacted by a less favorable product mix as well as higher product costs.", "Finally due to trends in the current environment our license business declined 7% in the quarter adding to gross margin pressure year-over-year.", "Driven by strong top-line growth in the quarter; selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 41.3% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with 44.9% in the prior year's period. SG&A dollars increased $12.2 million to $82.7 million during the first quarter was nearly half of the growth driven by increased marketing expenditures.", "As a percentage of net revenues marketing declined to 16.5% in the first quarter compare with 17.8% in the first quarter of the prior year. For the full year we still expect to invest in marketing at the high end of the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues.", "Operating income during the first quarter increased 84% to $7.9 million compare with $4.3 million in the prior year. Operating margin was 4% compared with 2.7% in the prior quarter.", "Below the operating income there are a couple of items to address. Net interest expense for the quarter was $860,000 compared with expense of $90,000 in the prior year's period. As discussed during our previous call in January, we entered into a new $200 million revolving credit facility.", "In connection with this we terminated the prior $100 million facility, which resulted in a $400,000 write-off unamortized deferred financing cost. The balance of the interest expense primarily relates to interest on our subordinated debts.", "The hedging strategies implemented at the end of 2008, allowed us to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. During the first quarter of 2009 we recognized a slight foreign currency gain. Although the gain was much smaller then the $600,000 gain recognized in the first quarter of 2008, it was much improved in the $4.6 million foreign currency loss reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. With that said, there is no perfect test and there is still risk that our results in future periods could be impacted positively or negatively by foreign currency fluctuations.", "Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43.8% compared with 40.3% in the first quarter of 2008. Based on certain tax strategies being implemented in 2009, we are estimating our full-year tax rate to be improved from our 45.3% effective tax rate in 2008.", "Our resulting net income for the first quarter rose 38% to $4 million compared with $2.9 million in the prior year period. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.08 compared with $0.06 in the prior year.", "Now, a few moments on the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalent at quarter-end increased $48 million to $65.6 million compared with $17.6 million at March 31, 2008. Cash net of debt increased $48.1 million at quarter-end to $46.9 million compared to net debt of $1.2 million at March 31, 2008.", "We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility. Net accounts receivable grew only 3.9% on a year-over-year basis, which was significantly below our net revenue growth for the quarter. In addition to the timing of shipments in the quarter and the slightly higher mix of direct to consumer sales, net AR was also impacted by year-over-year increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the first quarter.", "Inventory at quarter-end decreased 2.1% to $164.4 million compared to $167.9 million at March 31, 2008. Running Footwear was an allocated program, and as such much of it shipped directly from the factory to the customer, which benefited our inventory balance at the end of the first quarter.", "Additionally, we continue to focus on three main components of inventory management. One, managing our inventory buys, two reducing our production lead times, and three selling excess inventory through our outlets and other liquidation channels. Proper inventory management is critical to both our financial strength and brand integrity, especially in this environment.", "We need to continue to focus on proving our inventory turns by year-end. Our investment in capital expenditures in the first quarter was $8.7 million. During our last call, we announced that we would be taking a more conservative approach in 2009 and would plan our CapEx down year-over-year. Based on our current plans, we now anticipate 2009 CapEx to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, below the $41 million invested in 2008.", "In addition to the six to ten outlet stores, we are planning to open this year, significant portions of our investments will go towards improvements at our distribution center and additional in-store fixtures in concept shops. Although in the past, we have stated we would anticipate future CapEx to grow in line with our topline, we believe this year-over-year reduction in CapEx is appropriate in the current environment.", "We are pleased with the results we delivered to date in 2009 and we continue to believe in the growth opportunities that we have this year and in future years. We have shown discipline around cost management with the continued willingness to invest in the areas of our company that will be most critical to our near and mid-term growth.", "As we look forward the remainder of 2009, there are number of factors that can impact our full-year results, which I would like to discuss. Beginning with the topline; overall I would like to point out, we have not assumed an improvement in the environment this year and are planning our business conservatively, especially around our US apparel business.", "With our entry into the Running Footwear category, footwear remains planned as our largest revenue growth driver in 2009, and the next key indicator will be the performance of our updated running line for back-to-school.", "We are pleased with how our Running -- our Training Footwear performed at retail during the first quarter with our entry into Running Footwear, we have plan this business down in 2009.", "Finally, one note regarding the seasonality of net revenues in the back half. As you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we say a meaningful slowdown in the environment which caused back half revenues to be much more heavily weighted for the third quarter. We do not anticipate back half revenues in 2009 to be as heavily skewed towards the third quarter.", "Moving on to gross margins. As we have previously discussed, footwear gross margins are lower than apparel gross margins with the majority of our topline growth anticipated to come from footwear in 2009 and lacking significant offset to other components of our gross margin, we anticipate full-year gross margins to be down year-over-year. Additionally, we anticipate fourth quarter to our highest gross margin quarter for the year. ", "As we said during our last call, we would like to protect operating margins on a full-year basis. However we are still being impact by visibility challenges to the topline as well as market uncertainty. One item that we do control is our level of SG&A investment this year. We continue to balance the need for tight cost controls with the importance of key investments to our long-term growth.", "We are currently planning 2009 SG&A dollars to grow in the low teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. Additionally, we do not anticipate any significant change in the timing of our SG&A expend as compared to 2008. ", "I would also like to draw you some color on the second quarter. Similar to previous year, our second quarter is anticipated to be the lowest quarter from both the topline and earnings perspective. In addition, in 2009 we are comping last year's second quarter Trainer launch which will offset much of the growth in other areas of the business.", "We continue to remain cautious in our view of the business this year and like many companies in this environment, we are adjusting outlook for the mid term horizon, as we cannot project when the environment will improve. However, we have many uncap store of opportunities and remain positive on our long-term prospects.", "We\u2019re focused on the health of our balance sheet, driving liquidity and effective cost management. Our commitment to our share holders remains as we drive a long-term value creation through financial discipline and investments in our growth platforms.", "At this time we would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person, so we can get through as many of you as possible. Operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will go first Michelle Tan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs", "No problem, I have two questions. One was, some color on the growth in the apparel business. Any kind of more break out you can give us between new doors, you know new products and sell-through on the core products?", "And then my second question was just any additional color on the timing of the running shoe shipment through the rest of the year?", "Kevin Plank", "Michelle, David will take that one.", "David McCreight", "Hi Michelle. We are generally pleased with how we performed in apparel for the first quarter especially considering the very commercial environment we\u2019ve seen out there, and Under Armour\u2019s ability to sell primarily at full price.", "In the categories as we look across we saw some solid trends across there, nothing that really was unexpected for us. And what as Brad said we do remain cautious as we look at the balance of the year. What we have seen though as when we introduced new and compelling products, the consumer accepts this. As Kevin had mentioned even the TMP-T, which has a $30 price point has come out of the box and done very well and has not cannibalized other product offerings. So we're focused on continuing to drive innovation across all areas.", "Brad Dickerson", "Michelle this is Brad, the second part of your question on the timing of the Running Shoe Q1 will be the largest quarter Running Shoe for the year. As we stated previously running -- the entry into Running Footwear will be larger than our training launch last year but we do see Q1 being the largest portion, but obviously we will be selling running shoes throughout the year. Also as I've said in my prepared remarks, remember that we are planning the training business -- trained footwear business down here year-over-year also.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs", "Okay great and then any kind of color on the lumpiness on Running through the balance of the year is it more kind of even for the next few quarters or bigger in Q2 and then smaller in that or bigger in back-to-school and smaller in the other two?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think if you look at the year, Q1 and Q3 will be the biggest quarters of the year with the entry in Q1 and back-to-school in Q3.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chi Lee with Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Hey guys. Brad question for you on the provision. Can you give us what the level of provision was during the quarter for the receivables?", "Brad Dickerson", "Right now at the end of the quarter we have about little over $4 million in bad debt reserves. I think the increase in the quarter itself was about $0.5 million.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Okay great. And as I look at your SG&A growth rate, I mean it seems that non-marketing expenses was very well controlled. Can you just give us directionally what buckets you're seeing the greatest levels of opportunities as you progress through the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Really when we look at where SG&A right now is, is our controllable cost. So we look at those incremental cost that we haven\u2019t spent yet and what we can hold back on a defer on, just year-over-year just trying to control those incremental costs. Also any other semi-controllable cost that we have an opportunity to go back and get some savings on and we are looking at those also. ", "In general, you have to remember that also in Q1 that we had a 27% top-line growth so that definitely helped leveraging of SG&A in total.", "Operator", "We go next to Robbie Ohmes with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "Robbie Ohmes - Banc of America", "Hello, thanks, just two quick questions, the first I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the cautious business outlook for the year, is it backlog driven or are you concerned about G.I.Joe\u2019s closings and other regional going out of business. May be just help us think about where the apparel business, what the risks and issues are that keep you so cautious coming off a good first quarter like this?", "And the second question is, I don\u2019t know if you give it but if you could tell us what international revenues were for the quarter, percent of sales, I might have missed it and then may be update us on, if there is any change or anything going on in the international side of the Under Armour business. Thanks.", "Brad Dickerson", "Hey, Robbie, its Brad. I\u2019ll take the first part of this and Kevin and David might want to chime in after me but on the international revenue piece first. International revenues were 4% of our total revenues in Q1, first of all. Second of all, just on the customer credit side of being conscious going forward, obviously we did see some issues in Q1 with some of our customers and with our increase in our bad debt reserve in Q4, we anticipated some issues in Q1  So. so far, what we\u2019ve seen from mid-size customers and smaller customers hasn\u2019t really surprised us. Now we do think that we are adequately, our reserve right now and looking forward though, some of our cautiousness and conservativeness around our credit was a part of our overall top-line conservatism.", "Kevin Plank", "Hey Robbie, its Kevin, let me just follow up a little more, a give a little more about the way that we\u2019re seeing sort of the balance of the year. Particularly for us, what\u2019s so important is the apparel side of things.", "First and foremost, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our growth platform we believe is intact. We are aware what's happening out there in the market and we are planning our growth accordingly and frankly rather conservatively as well.", "The first and most important thing that we're doing is we're preserving our brand equity and our pricing integrity, and we want to position Under Armour for when the environment does change, because we do believe it will, although we're not making any predictions as to what that timing might be.", "The good news is that, we continue to be one of the top performing brands in the market, if not, the top performing brand in the market. And given that, we are the leaders in the category, the difference that we see. particularly we're investing in heavily right now is innovation. Some of the things and you heard David mentioned things like our T-MPT. We also have a couple of great new program, exciting programs coming out this fall, like a reversible HEATGEAR, COLDGEAR strategy. We've got a new product called Recharge which is about getting athletes on the field quicker and faster.", "So think you're going to see not only us continue to drive around the core basics that have sort of built this company, but more importantly, probably in the bigger part of our foundation is innovation. I think, if there's anything you'll see in the evolution of Under Armour is the fact that we continue to evolve away from being just the pure compression brand in being more of a performance brand. So, the place where and how we define what is, performance I think is what gets exciting around sports like golf and of course running and some other places that we can see we can take it, not only from apparel but obviously now from a footwear standpoint too.", "Robbie Ohmes - Banc of America", "Kevin, just a very quick follow-up on that commentary. So, when you look at the sort of mid-level and smaller regional sporting goods chains, is that a business that you think you might actually have to reallocate to another channel over the next year or two, or is it a situation where you think enough of them will make it though this environment that will just sort of come back when the environment upturns?", "Kevin Plank", "", "Well, first and foremost as a company our distribution is very, very clean. So we obviously have a lot different levers if we should ever decide to pull any of those. First and foremost, that we are committed to our core distribution, and I think you\u2019re going to see without question consolidation will happen. We\u2019ve already seen two of them occur this year.", "We continue to see our bigger players in the Dick\u2019s, in particular in the sports authorities and academies of the world, these guys are really driving us well. We\u2019re out there, we want to support the smaller independent account and we want to give them every opportunity.", "Again, I think you\u2019ll see a limited amount of consolidation, but at the end of the day, I think you\u2019ll see a healthier market. So, we are planning for that, we preserve for that. We\u2019ve got every worst case scenario in there for that, and we\u2019re of course optimistic in trying to support wherever we can, but also protecting Armour sales in the face of everything that\u2019s going on up there too.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Tom Shaw with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Tom Shaw - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hey guys, nice quarter. Kind of continuation of the last question, where are the opportunities in distribution throughout the rest of the year, obviously the mall has been a focal point. But its not only in the US but also in Europe where some of the other retailers you are having better at shoes.", "David McCreight", "Tom, it\u2019s David McCreight. We\u2019ll break it under several different areas. One is looking within our existing distribution, when you look at Under Armour\u2019s position in the floor space, while we\u2019re the dominant player in our existing distribution, we believe they are product categories slow and opportunities to gain more floor space within existing distribution. So we are focusing increasingly on that and we\u2019re smarter with flow, and as Kevin said, introduce new and innovative products.", "Secondarily, we know Under Armour has fewer touch points from the customers than many other larger companies and we are going through a relatively detailed and analytic review of that and beginning to map as sporting goods spend and performance apparel spent across America and we're going to identify these pockets and then wait to discuss that.", "Then finally, you've heard us mentioned as we introduced the mall channel this year with the Running shoes, and we think we've have a big opportunity to take advantage of that contact point. ", "Then finally, we have our direct-to-consumer, all of them are very good and a arsenal of growth opportunities for distribution to bring our brand to more athletes. ", "Kevin Plank", "And let me pile on if I could. The best way I think that we have going for us well on what we found is that there is such an unbelievable call of support for our brand too. I don\u2019t like someone from our distribution of again having someone step up. So, we've really at this time, and think you've heard, within my comments for praises, support that we received on our Running launch from our critical partners there. I think they've a lot to gain in Under Armour's success not only on the apparel side but obviously on the footwear side. So it takes a (inaudible), that\u2019s for sure, and I think what\u2019s you're saying with the successful foot of Under Armour. ", "Tom Shaw - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. David, you talked about recalibrated marketing spend. I think, Kevin you mentioned that, at the same time you're adjusting some marketing to support the improved awareness of the Running launch. You're still maintaining kind of high-end of the 12% to 13% range on marketing spend for the year. Its sounds like, if you're changing the awareness around Running and keeping the range, does that imply that you, or perhaps point back somewhere else when budgeting for the year?", "David McCreight", "No. It has to do with the shift in the timing between quarters as well as within categories and then with the way we break out our spend.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Kevin and David actually, I wanted to follow up on some of your comments from the prepared remarks. Kevin, you talked a lot about the next phase the new ideas, balancing the growth and the discipline I wanted to see if you guys would take this opportunity to be a little bit more specific and go into more detail about how you are going to manage this company, how you are thinking about managing this company over the next couple of years and where you are going to put your resources and emphasis behind and what are some of the areas at least in theory that you might have pulled back from. And because I the growth company that has really enjoyed such strong growth to this point and then at this point in time you are kind of at a cross road if you will, or you can continue to press the accelerator button and chase a lot of things or you can kind of be a little more specific about what pick?", "Kevin Plank", "Yeah let me by crystal clear first of all with the fact that, we remain a growth company. We have not given up on that and I think again our performance in the first quarter is demonstrative of our ability to be able to execute on that as well. We learned a lot of lessons in 2008 though and from a company who began with -- we have always had a top line that would always be there for us and one of the lessons learnt is that when things do become greater or out of your control, so the macro economic environment that we sell at the end of the year we have a different -- obviously a place that we need to focus. We need to figure out how to manage our business.", "And while we have been working toward that, one of the greatest examples of things that we are probably most proud of in 2008 was our ability to demonstrate our ability to manage inventory. In the market place though we continue to first and foremost protect the brand and protect our pricing integrity. You do see Under Armour in highly promotional way in a very commercial environment, at the end of Q4 frankly through Q1 we have continued to outperform and we are not as surely giving up market share while we just continue to sell at full price. We believe that these, the difficulty that people are seeing right now, in difficult times are going to make us a better company and I think we are executing on that.", "So, what you'll find with Under Armour, or maybe in the past we've been more of a top-line story. We believe that we are lot more than a top-line story we're demonstrating our ability to manage our business as well and frankly that's where the addition of David who would not only be able to have some else who is with me pound at our desk and saying, we are going to continue to grow but also ensuring that with David and Wayne and Brad\u2019s help we continue to make sure that we deliver on the bottom-line too and let me let David add on to that too.", "David McCreight", "", "Good morning, Omar. As Kevin had indicated we are beginning to take advantages in credible opportunity we have with this high growth brand and make sure we are smart how we sequence and stage this growth. And an example of that is Kevin, Wayne and I put together a series of goals for the company which, are all around; we are going to be a growth company, we are going to grow profitably, we are going to focus on innovation, consumer insight and becoming excellent in operations. And all of these things make us a well rounded and very portent for us in this sporting goods space to take advantage of this incredible brand we have. And we'll share more with that in the coming calls. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Excellent. I was also intrigued by the soccer launch, kind of this quite soccer launch, There hasn\u2019t been much fan fare on it. I know its not to the large distribution especially in the US, it sounds like. But what was the thought process there? Is this something we might see more of in the future as the brand kind of branches onto new areas?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think Omar, it comes back to just the approach is what was needed for this market. A good analogy that I will use there is that if I am playing around the Gulf and I need to take more out of my bag than just driver. In this situation we thought we need to do is to get into market and begin to just start operating. So we look at this more as an introduction with a limited allocation of product.", "And frankly probably if we made any mistakes on the Running \u201claunch\u201d, It was probably calling Running, a launch. We spend a fraction of what we spend in Training a year ago and the results we are looking for was something, we effectively we opted for three or four more month of selling season versus a sort of larger launch in the April, May timeframe.", "So we feel that it was a right decision looking back on it. But we think we may have created expectations that might not have been as realistic. We have been a little more quite on the soccer group side because again it is a hypercompetitive market that we know that we need, [over] technical product, which is latest and greatest. And what we want to do is we don\u2019t want to come out beating our chest, but we want to go - we want to build the grounds swell with acceptance among athletes and we are seeing that.", "We have got dozens of [membership] players now that are moving in and again we hear this these are established players that have been wearing other brands for years that are moving into our boot and really like the boot.", "Now more importantly, we are targeting is that younger generation who is in as brand consumed yet and that for again the business that we believe we can plan. So as far starting with some very high-end product, you are talking about $200 shoe and some very [niche] product that will give us sharpness. Again we believe that we believe that we can be successful there.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay so just to make sure I understand. It sounds like that there is a little bit of shift in the mentality in how you approach new category. So is there going to be less of this emphasis on a big fanfare driven, loud in the marketplace type launch and you are going to be a little bit more strategic about how you enter some of these new categories.", "Kevin Plank", "Omar we carefully plan to continue to be strategic but what we will do is modify our approach based on the marketplace, the environment and where we are in it. And so you may hear us trumpet loudly, we are not going to shy away from big bulled marketing our future but we are going to enter categories where we think so to be appropriate with the level  of marketing the future but we are going to answer categories because what we think sort of the appropriate level of marketing and some may build their crescendo and other categories will may come out of the box hot and strong.", "And at the same time we are not going to apologize for the company that we've been but we also believe we're bit more diverse than big guys in tight shirts just came out here to go by Under Armour. So I think that again you'll see a lot more from us you'll see a lot more prep and lot more diversity from us going forward particularly in our marketing messages.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jim Duffy with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Couple of questions. Kind of a follow-up to the way to define the dialogues here David, where are you guys in the process of presenting apparel collections, and then help us with some of the thoughts on new channels of distribution for the apparel business. Are you going to take us outside the traditional sporting goods channels and what was the timing of all of this? Is it an '09 thing or something we are not likely to see until 2010?", "David McCreight", "As it relates to collections with the recent hires, Suzanne Karkus and Kevin's charge to grow the women's and youth business, we look at our model and decided to recognize to how that athlete shops. And so you're beginning to see some of the collections primarily this fall season. We'll start to see an increase flow and a different sort of rhythm to how we deliver products.", "If you'd walk the floor today, you'll see different assortment and a different approach to women's than you've seen the year before. So, I think you're going to see us start to continue to build in the coming deliveries.", "As it relates to distribution, we feel confident that we can continue to grow in comp within our existing distribution, and it\u2019s largely going to be around our content and the strength of offer that helps us get there, while we do remain cautious for the balance of the year based on how our partners are viewing this space.", "And outside the existing channels, primarily what Kevin has challenged us to think about is to look at how to bring Under Armour to more athletes, and so we\u2019re still early in the analysis but when you do the broad overview and measures, you can see pockets and many actually large areas and athletes that we\u2019ve yet to touch with our current approach.", "So, we think as I was discussing earlier, we have many arrows in our quiver still and there is better analysis and decisions being done in the coming quarters.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, pretty interesting and the collections, so we should look for maybe a shorter window for some of the collections that we\u2019ll see in the fall line or it maybe a cycle things through.", "David McCreight", "Yes. It\u2019s probably or just be more apparent, the flow of freshness will increase, the amount of print pattern and the innovative technology that\u2019s been introduced be very visible, but you\u2019ll start to see that rhythm and we\u2019ve had it but it\u2019s been more quite in the past. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great. Thanks so much, and good luck.", "David McCreight", "A way to think of it is, we\u2019re evolving beyond sort of a basic year around business and building on top of that adding incremental opportunities to think of the athlete had to do.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to David Glick with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Yes. Good morning. Just a follow-up question on the apparel business. I was trying to get a better sense for the selling versus the retail sell through. The apparel business certainly kicked up in the quarter up, those single digits, possibly due to some new distribution in the mall. But, can you give us a sense for the trends at retail and your more existing sporting goods channel, how your trending versus last year and plan, how the natural margins are trending? Just a better sense or some more color on really what\u2019s happening with retail?", "David McCreight", "In Q1 we were, as Kevin said, pleased with the results of apparel. We benefited from some cold weather in that time period as well as the delivery of fresh new collections. We have made increased investments for their partners in certain strategic category that we've already discussed, and it\u2019s still very sort of early in the spring season to say how the balance of this season is going to play out. But we think we\u2019re in a pretty good position in apparel.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Okay. I appreciate that. Any difference you're seeing in the selling either by category or just any trends that you see differ between your new mall distribution and the selling there and footwear and apparel versus your more matured sporting goods channel?", "David McCreight", "They\u2019re very different assortments. They're not really fairly comparable. But what we are seeing is when we deliver newness and freshness, and it's being well received.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sam Poser with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee", "Good morning. I just have a couple of questions regarding; one, the updates that you're making to the Running shoes. Can you give us some indications as to what you're doing both from a color pattern and from possibly tweaking the existing shoes themselves?", "David McCreight", "Really, we're going to continue to deliver fresh colors through the balance of the spring season and then in back-to-school you're going to see another new edition of style delivered and starting with [selling one] on floor.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee", "So is that going to shift in your second quarter then?  Those new styles that you\u2019ll ship in Q2?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yeah, this is Brad. It will probably, some at the end of Q2. But I think Q3, as I said before probably it will be a little bigger.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee", "Okay. And then we're hearing lots of talk about your basketball shoes versus [Concorde] in Europe right now and a couple of players, so on. Can you talk to where you are right now with that?", "Kevin Plank", "We remain in fact we love the fact that you are hearing about it and we also have no designated data as to when we will be launching basket ball other than the fact that is exactly when we are ready. ", "But you will continue to see basket ball shoe show up under our NFL teams or collegiate teams like University in Maryland and Texas Tech and some of the other properties that we\u2019ll be adding as well. You will continue to see it on sort of the High School in NFL teams as well as Brandon Jennings shoes on of our -- he is our only professional athlete that we have today as well.", "But again we believe that we\u2019re going to be very important in basket ball. We also believe that we have the luxury of being patient as to the point when we decide to enter that market, and we\u2019ll do so frankly first and foremost and only when the products are 100% ready. So we\u2019re biding our time and going to make a strategic decision around that.", "Sam Poser - Sterne, Agee", "Yes then lastly, if you could give us the specific components of the SG&A for the quarter either by dollars or percentage, Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, this Brad and on marketing was 16.5% versus 17.8% last year like I had discussed. Selling was 7.3% versus 7.6% last year. Our product innovation supply chain was 8.6% versus 9.5% last year and corporate services was 8.9% versus 10% last year. Obviously you will see those in the in Q2.", "Sam Poser - Sterne, Agee", "And is there some - is there a work that we can, can we expect that kind of relative pattern for the rest of the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes I think because the top-line grew 27% in Q1 that\u2019s going to skew somewhat a little bit. So I think you are going to see similar SG&A year-over-year, the timing of SG&A and percentages year-over-year.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Thanks. Brad, did I understand your comment correctly that you are planning performance trainers to be lower, in \u201809 than \u201808?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Dan, that\u2019s correct.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "That\u2019s starting in the second quarter of \u201909 for you compared to second through the fourth quarter of \u201908, or are you saying that all of fiscal year \u201909 will be less than the three quarters of \u201808 the product was available?", "Brad Dickerson", "Dan, I am going to let David, add some color to that. But right now what we are planning is for the whole year, our training footwear will be down year-over-year. We plan that down year-over-year with the entry into Run. David might want to explain that a little bit.", "David McCreight", "Dan, as we enter, really added our second non-cleated footwear category. We wanted to be very cautious with their expectations around Training year-over-year and wondered to what degree people have participated in buying training shoes because of the first way to get Under Armour footwear on their feet and not beyond field.", "And so, we entered the season very cautiously and actually have been pleasantly surprised and actually very heartened by the response of the training business today. That being said, we are cautious for the balance of the year on training and do expect to be down year-on-year. As we build -- we are new in the running space and as we build the non-cleated footwear business ,we were expecting to in the future begin to grow all this, all versions of run footwear, including cleats, slides, training and running.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "So, if I understand correctly some of your running or customers who are buying running shoes are doing so perhaps instead of buying the performance trainers?", "David McCreight", "We had planned some of cannibalization and so, we had gone out with a smaller offering in anticipation of that in order to avoid any type of balance sheet issues. And have been impressed with the sell through in training in the first quarter.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "The other question I had is on the comment that the second half of 2009 will be less skewed towards the third quarter, I guess Kevin that would imply the fourth quarter for the bigger piece of the second half revenues. I that\u2019s correct, I just want to understand why the shift in the seasonality?", "Kevin Plank", "Sure and I think if remember late in Q4 of last year is when we saw some impact due to macro economic environment last year.  So as we planned out 2009 we anticipate it to look a little more like previous year's relative to the mix between Q3 and Q4.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "But you are not expecting the economy to improve though right?", "Kevin Plank", "I am not expecting the economy to improve so what you have is, you have a Q3 comp over last years Q3 environment and a Q4 comp over last years Q4 environment.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Okay I think I understand. Okay thank you.", "Alex Pettitt", "We have time for one more question.", "Kevin Plank", "And I request that someone ask a question to Wayne.", "Operator", "And out final question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird", "I think I may let Wayne off the hook this one time.", "Kevin Plank", "He is sitting here quiet. I can\u2019t believe it.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird", "Unless he wants to jump in and answer one of these, but two questions, one on gross margin. Brad you mentioned three factors dragging down the margin in the quarter that were apparel, mix in costs there and then license stock percentage of your overall business.", "I am assuming you mentioned those in order of magnitude and then how should we be thinking about those factors going forward. I mean obviously footwear growing as a percentage of the business is going to impact the balance of the year, but what about the apparel either the mix and I would think that the cost outlook might improve in the back half and then license, do you still think that comes down as a percentage of the total?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yeah Mitch, I think to your point yes. I did kind of list them in the order of magnitude. As far as apparel going forward, I think, as we talked about in the past, we tend to lock our costs in well in advance.", "So although we can obviously get better at renegotiating costs going forward we locked our first half of the year costs on the apparel side in early during the summer to last year when the environment was a little bit different from a inflationary perspective with price of oil and labor tightness across the world. And so as we get into fall and we enter \u201909 we lock those prices in after the environment changed in September of 2008. So we should see that change a little bit on the sell side.", "Licensing business; we anticipate our licensing business although was down in Q1, probably to be kind of more in line with our apparel business as far as visibility and challenges at the topline, I don\u2019t think it was a little bit choppy and just like our apparel business. So it is a little hard to say right now, how licensing will impact our margins going forward.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird", "Okay. And then second question. Your direct-to-consumer business was very strong in the quarter. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how that performed, e-commerce versus stores. How did your outlets comp in the quarter and I know that you said in your Q4 call, you expect your direct-to-consumer to be a bigger impact on your business in the back half -- as a bigger percentage of the business in the back half I think. So could you talk a little bit about what do you expect - how you expect that to play out for the balance of the year?", "Wayne Marino", "Mitch, this is Wayne. And I actually get our - sorry, I don\u2019t want to hear about it. I think the first thing is, we are not going to get into any specifics when it comes to the direct-to consumer businesses. What we can say is that, in all our channels of direct-to-consumer the outlet, as well as our web business, we have seen very positive results whenever we have gone to the consumer directly. The outlet business serves two purposes really, it has been helping the liquidation of our inventory, but it has also been delivering great profitability and strong balancing to us. ", "As far as the web, we are continuing to see growth in the web business as well. That\u2019s helped with what David has brought to the table in terms of reaching out to consumers, our service center of course, the addition of new products on the web. So we would expect that trend to continue and I would also want to point out that the ASPs are really holding, which is a real credit to the price and the integrity of the brand.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Miss. Alex Pettit, Director of Investor Relations.", "Alex Pettit", "Good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words estimate, intend, expect, plan, outlook, or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. ", "We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. Important factors relating to our business including that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, are described in our press release and in the risk factors section of our filings with the SEC.", "The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. ", "Before we continue, I'd like to direct you to our website, investor.underarmour.com. There you will find this morning's press release, and on our webcast page, images of a number of the products and initiatives we will address on the call.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plan, Chairman and CEO, followed by David McCreight, our President, and finally Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss the company's financial performance for the second quarter and provide an initial outlook for 2009.", "After the prepared remarks, Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marinox, our Chief Operating Officer will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you Alex and good morning everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrate our continued ability to successfully manage our business. As a growth company we possess a diversity of growth levers that will allow us to maneuver in a complex environment, and what you will hear our team talk about today is why we remain confident in our growth platform, the opportunities that lie ahead for the Under Armour brand and the building blocks we are putting in place to capture those opportunities.", "At a time when so many companies are focused solely on cutting costs and getting lean, our challenge is to accomplish those same things while investing and innovating to drive excitement and newness in the athletic apparel and footwear landscape. Through all types of economic conditions, one fact remains true. Consumers rely on the brands that they trust.", "As the brand leader in performance apparel, one measure of our performance is to what degree are we brining newness to the category and delivering on the promise that has earned our consumer's trust. ", "In Q2 we achieved double digit growth in all our apparel categories; men's, women's and youth. We delivered these results without compromising the integrity of our growth and maintained our brand's premium positioning and price integrity.", "But what you want to take away from today's call is while this revenue growth may look relatively strong in the competitive landscape, we have both the capacity and desire to do so much more. ", "In terms of capacity, we are becoming better operators each quarter in every area of our business. David and Brad will both talk about specific areas where this operational experience is directly impacting our bottom line, and in those areas where we are not making as much progress as we believe we should, we are committed to bringing experienced talent in the organization that will drive that change.", "As for desire, our challenge is to ensure that as we grow, we maintain both the energy and high expectations of ourselves that drove us from a small presence in the back corner of our sporting goods partners to our leadership position in performance apparel. ", "We are young enough of a team to remember that our early victories were won with hard work, taking that level of commitment to our work every day and shaping and forming it with the experience we've gained through our growth is what will enable this team to deliver on the promise of our brand.", "To maintain industry leadership at athletic apparel, we cannot rest on our laurels. Innovation does occur by happenstance. It takes investment, resolve and insight. For instance, we recently introduce the Recharge suit. Recharge is built with strategic compression that stabilizes muscle tissue and controls post work out swelling to create a healing environment for the body. It then lets the body repair itself to a greater magnitude through compression, getting the athlete back in the game faster.", "Under Armour athletes across all sports such as Mike McDonough in ice hockey, Heather Mitts in soccer and Hunter Mahan in golf, have all started to incorporate the Recharge suit into their training regimen.", "But innovation cannot solely exist for the elite athlete. Our challenge is to bring that same level of insight into the needs of the everyday athlete and to scale that innovation so that it reaches a broader range of athletes. ", "We will be bringing to market over the next six to 12 months, compelling new materials and technology that will reinforce our position as the thought leader in performance apparel. The Under Armour brand was founded on the principal of making athletes better, and we will continue to invest to bring new applications to the next generation of athletes. ", "While keeping our focus squarely on the needs of the athlete, we also remain vigilant about cost controls and prioritization of investments. During the quarter we demonstrated the ability to tighten our spending while continuing to invest in critical areas for growth. We believe we continue to have the most overcrowded white board in the industry.", "The opportunities for Under Armour in new product categories, new geographies and new distribution are as abundant today as they were in the past, but becoming operators of our business also means planning our business better, and we have cleaned up our white board to focus on our collective energy on the areas that will have the greatest returns for both our brand and of course our shareholders.", "This growing financial discipline positions us well for the future as we better funnel investments towards those areas with the best return. Over the last several years, we have demonstrated our ability to diversify our business and build a compelling platform for growth. As we enter these new businesses, we recognize we will not only be perfect, but our commitment to you is that we become better operators over time.", "Last quarter, we discussed that we planned our Training Footwear business to be down in 2009 as we planned conservatively given the introduction of Running Footwear in January. Our results are training in year two even with the addition of a running assortment tell us that the category of performance training is relevant to our consumer. They get it, and they want products specifically built for it.", "We are going to leverage our authenticity in this category to deliver the best training solutions in both apparel and footwear, raising the bar for the industry and growing the overall category.", "As we've discussed, there are three key measures for entering into Running Footwear; first, great product that delivers on the Under Armour promise, second, retailer support from all three channels that we entered, Big Box, Sporting Goods, Athletic Specialty and Run Specialty. And third and most importantly, consumer acceptance from both our core as well as the broader consumer demographic that running takes us to.", "Based on what we've seen in our six months since entering the Running Footwear market, we believe we checked the box on all three measures and that we are here to stay. ", "Over the long term, we will measure our success in new categories such as Running Footwear by our ability to earn equity with an ever expanding core of athletes. To that end, we have begun to put the team in place that will help us earn that position in footwear. We recently announced the addition of Gene McCarty who will join us as our Senior Vice President of footwear in August.", "Gene joins Under Armour with more than 20 years of senior level experience in our industry. We are excited about the recent additions to our team, and the impact we believe this will have over the long term. Dave will speak shortly about the continued progress we've made in building the team to support Under Armour's development into a major athletic footwear brand.", "The strength of the Under Armour brand has enabled us to enter new categories, new geographies and new distribution. We took a fairly aggressive approach to the Running Footwear market in year one and now that we are here, we have a better understanding of the things that we did right and certainly some opportunities to improve.", " ", "There is a learning curve associated with any new business. The key for us as always is that we learn quickly, we adapt, we correct and we move forward. Our growth story remains simple and our potential remains great. We are the athletic brand of this generation; a performance brand born of fuel with a growth platform focused on delivering the best head to toe solutions for athletes across the globe.", "We are proud of what we've accomplished, but will continue to hold ourselves accountable to a higher standard. We are committed. We are energized, and we are confident. We are on a mission.", "I will now pass it over to David for some color on our results and business strategy.", "David McCreight", "Our second quarter results validate that the growth platform we've built provides us with multiple levers to pull to generate growth. Apparel revenues were up 16% in the quarter as male and female adult and youth athletes continue to vote for our performance apparel solutions.", "As we look ahead, we are compelled by the potential for UA we see in gender, category, age and distribution. Our challenge is not to find more platforms for growth, but to invest appropriately and accelerate the capacity of our organization.", "What I'd like to focus on this morning are some of the strategic and operational initiatives we are undertaking to active and manage the platform as well as our plan to prioritize our investments against those opportunities while continuing to deliver growth.", "Kevin spoke earlier of learning quickly, adapting and correcting. One area where we see this manifest itself is the first half of 2009 is Europe. While our business in still largely concentrated in the U.S., we continue to make progress overseas. International revenues were up 51% for the quarter and 48% for the first half.", "Since entering the European marketplace, we've learned a great deal about our brand and the opportunity. Our current performance reflects a product strategy that has become more attuned to the needs of the European consumer and a distribution strategy more concentrated in specialty. We will refine our strategy and without material investment, continue to make progress and drive results.", "In our direct to consumer business, we made the decision last year to focus near term on our e-commerce and factory health opportunities and slowed the rate of investment in specialty retail. Direct to consumer maintained its strong performance for the first quarter with net revenues up 37%. We will utilize this area of business to connect with an athlete we are not currently reaching and to build deeper connections with our core consumer through branded content on our web site and in our stores.", "We control the pace in our direct to consumer platform and have opportunities to scale this business in the near and mid term.", "Now on to footwear; Under Armour has offered non cleated footwear for little over a year. We've consistently said that we'll approach all new categories and geographies with patience recognizing we need to learn as we grow. We are getting better at this with each season and we understand the challenges involved to be become a consistent player across the broad footwear spectrum.", "As Kevin discussed earlier, we've achieved a number of objectives with our initial entry into the Running Footwear market. We delivered a good product in a technically demanding space with many entrenched competitors. We introduced Under Armour footwear to two new distribution channels, athletic specialty and run specialty in addition to our existing sporting goods distribution, and the brand was accepted by the footwear consumer in all three channels.", "But the opportunities for Under Armour footwear are vast, and we will continue to refine our strategy. We have learned over the past six months not only what we have, but also what we need. First, we are going to further dial in our price value offering to the consumer. Improve sourcing; product and material engineering are par for the equation.", "The second is recalibrating our seasonal demand forecasting and finally is the development and delivery of our next technology platform in footwear.", "We are building the foundations for a long term successful footwear business. Each new season and every new year add to our knowledge set moving forward. It is important to maintain our learning and want to enter 2010 in the best possible shape at retail with our run footwear. To do so, we're going to mark down some of our current products to increase velocity and make room for the improved offering in the back half of 2010. ", "What we've learned being in the footwear business for over four years is significant, but I'm confident the new leadership we've added to our footwear team dramatically accelerates our learning curve.", "As Kevin mentioned, we recently hired a new head of footwear, Gene McCarthy. Gene was most recently the Co-President of the Timberland brand and prior to that, held senior positions at Reebok and brand Jordan. Gene joins another recent addition to the Under Armour footwear team, Gavin, our design and development consultant.", "Gavin served as the senior vice president and GM of the global footwear division at Puma, also held several leadership positions within the Nike footwear design team and began his design career with Apple.", "This infusion of decades of industry experience and world class design to our existing team is a first step to bring new skills to our strategy of becoming a meaningful performance footwear brand to an ever expanding audience of athletes.", "Our strengths are more apparent in the apparel area, and I believe the opportunities are equally clear as we add to our organizational capacity. In our current distribution, we believe we can continue to gain floor space as we prime our product engine to establish better seasonal flow and category extensions in sports where we are still building equity.", "Our R&D efforts, another area where we are laser focused on improving our capacity, center on delivering relevant innovation to our consumer. Earlier, Kevin described one of our exciting innovations for this fall, the Recharge suit. Recharge represents tip of the spear innovation and commands a premium price point at nearly $200.00 for the top and bottom and we will continue to invent ways to deliver innovation to a broader base of athletes as well. More on that in future calls.", "As the leading brand in performance apparel, we possess the capacity to dictate price and value. We spoke last quarter about opportunities we see to take costs out of the manufacturing process. Our core basic programs drive large volume and provide us with obvious targets on where we can focus our efforts to really move the needle on cost without compromising quality.", "The supply chain team was able to reduce apparel product and transportation costs for the back half of the year and we are reinvesting some of these savings by offering the consumer greater value in certain core basic programs.", "Ultimately, by offering more value in core basics, and expanding around those with introductions of new, more technical products, we believe we can tap into more athletes and can continue to grow our apparel share.", "Over the years, the scope of the Under Armour brand has expanded. We have entered many new markets and tapped into the needs of athletes across many sports. As our brand speaks with a louder voice to more consumers, it's critical we remain close to our consumer.", "Consumer insights and product innovation have always been the cornerstone of the Under Armour brand. Our original compression T-shirt came from a single key insight and through that, we were able to serve the needs of athletes across all sports. ", "While other brands rely heavily on markdowns and shift their assortments to basics, we are re-committing to insight led development. We've become more vigilant in the study of our athlete. We will improve our capacity for content, creating great product for the athletes to generate demand.", "Greater consumer insights research and analytics will help us understand the consumer segments and product categories with the greatest untapped potential and craft more strategic plans which accelerate our success path. We will couple these learning's with distribution mapping we're performing to then determine the best vehicle to deliver the brand to those underserved athletic segments.", "Under Armour earned its reputation amongst athletes by delivering a superior product, and we will secure our position in the global athletic apparel and footwear industry by raising the bar each and every season. We are proud, but not satisfied with what our organization has achieved in the past.", "We are creating a more nimble, responsive and sophisticated team focused on the opportunities with the best return, and all the while we will drive greater coordination and efficiency in how we execute.", "We are not content with being merely good, because our brand and competitive advantages give us the opportunity to be great. The multitude of our growth vehicles, our brand power and the strengthening balance sheet give us the ability to be patient and to optimize our time and investments.", "And though we are making strides, we have much to do to reach the potential for the Under Armour vision. It is clear that our organizational capacities need to continue to grow. My focus is on accelerating our capacity by aligning the organization strategically, improving our decision making processes and most importantly, building the team that can deliver on the promise of the Under Armour brand.", "You have heard today about where our initiatives are starting to bear fruit along with some opportunities for improvement. For Under Armour, the question is not if we should invest, but where we should invest.", "The runway for our brand in tremendous. As we gain experience and expertise, we will drive greater alignment across the organization to create a potent combination of product development, distribution and story telling to transform Under Armour into a global, performance platform.", "With that, I would like to turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "With Kevin and David having taken you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time on our second quarter financial results. This quarter illustrates the financial discipline we have developed within the organization. We managed our costs effectively, continued to invest in critical areas of our business and strengthened our balance sheet. These are all keys to putting us on the path to drive long term value creation.", "Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2009 increased 5% to $164.6 million. Year to date net revenues are up 16% to $364.6 million. Apparel net revenues increased 16% during the quarter, bringing our year to date growth rate in apparel to 8%.", "As mentioned earlier, the Training Footwear business was planned down in 2009 with the addition of Running Footwear. During the second quarter of 2009 we anniversaried our May 2008 trainer launch which as anticipated, offset much of the growth in other areas. As a result, footwear net revenues decreased year over year in the second quarter. For the first six months of 2009, footwear revenues were up 51%.", "Second quarter gross margins were 45.1% compared with 45.3% in the prior year's quarter. There were several puts and takes that impacted gross margin. First, in order to prudently manage our excess inventory, we increased our apparel liquidation sale above historical rates impacting our year over year gross margin.", "These liquidation sales still represent a very small portion of revenues and allow us to profitably sell excess apparel inventory while helping to free up working capital which we feel is important in the current environment.", "In addition, as David discussed earlier, with more visibility to our Running Footwear performance, we increased our reserves for footwear allowances and returns in the second quarter. Finally, these items were offset by improvements in apparel product margins as well as the strong net revenue growth in our higher margin direct to consumer business.", "Similar to the proficiency we have achieved in apparel, we believe that experience gained in newer businesses such as footwear as well as optimization of product engineering and sourcing will allow us to offset some of these factors long term.", "SG&A as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 43% in the second quarter of 2009 compared with 43.2% in the prior year's period. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing declined to 12.9% in the second quarter compared with 14.4% in the prior year. Partially offsetting this were selling expenses which deleveraged due to the contained expansion of our direct to consumer channel.", "Operating income during the second quarter increased 3% to $3.4 million compared with $3.3 million in the prior year. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 40.9% compared with 44.7% in the second quarter of 2008 due to certain one time items we recorded during the current year quarter. We are projecting our annual 2009 effective tax rate to be approximately 100 basis points improved from our 2008 effective tax rate of 45.3%.", "Our resulting net income in the second quarter rose 5% to $1.4 million. Second quarter diluted earnings per share remained at $0.03. Year to date, our EPS is $0.11 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.", "Please note, the company adopted a mandatory EPS accounting rule in 2009 which retroactively reduced our EPS for the first six months of 2008 from $0.09 quoted last year to $0.08.", "Now to the balance sheet; our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our efforts to protect our liquidity are paying off. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased $66.2 million to $79.5 million compared with $13.3 million at June 30, 2008. Cash, net of debt increased to $59.2 million at quarter end compared with net debt of $16.3 million at June 30, 2008. We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility.", "Net accounts receivable decreased 17% on a year over year basis which was significantly below our net revenue growth for the quarter. In addition to the strong performance of our collections team, part of the improvement in accounts receivable came from the higher mix of direct to consumer sales and a year over year increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts.", "Inventory at quarter end decreased 1.4% to $181.4 million compared with $183.9 million at June 30, 2008. In addition to improved inventory management processes, our inventory balance at quarter end benefited from apparel liquidation sales mentioned earlier, strong performance of our outlet stores and increased level of direct shipments related to footwear. We expect our inventory growth to be below revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "We are pleased with the stabilization of our inventory growth over the past several quarters, but longer term we'll continue to strive for improved inventory turns to strengthen our cash position and working capital.", "Our investment in capital expenditures in the second quarter was $4.5 million, bringing our year to date CapEx investment to $13.2 million. We continue to anticipate 2009 CapEx to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, below the $41 million invested in2008.", "Summing up the balance sheet, invested capital net of cash decreased year over year while we still achieved double digit top line growth for the first half. This is another indication of our improved inventory management and points to the opportunity in our balance sheet for greater efficiency.", "We now have improved visibility to our business, and as such we would like to provide an initial outlook for 2009. It is important to note that we remain cautious on the remainder of the year and our outlook assumes there is no material improvement nor deterioration in consumer spending trends.", "With a great deal of back half consumer activity centered on the back to school and holiday seasons, much remains to be seen. However, with our current level of bookings and trends in our business, we are estimated full year net revenue to be approximately $810 million in 2009. In addition after a soft last quarter, we do not anticipate back half revenues in 2009 to be as heavily skewed towards the third quarter as they were in 2008.", "Full year gross margins are anticipated to be down year over year due to a number of factors. First, the majority of our top line growth is anticipated to come from our lower margin footwear business in 2009. Second, as discussed earlier, we are recognizing a higher amount of reserves year over year related to our Running Footwear. And third, there is the impact of the increased liquidation sales to third parties.", "Apparel liquidation and anticipated footwear reserves will have a pronounced impact on third quarter gross margin. However, assuming continued strength in our direct to consumer business, fourth quarter gross margins are expected to be at least flat year over year.", "We are still planning 2009 SG&A dollars to grow in the low teens on a percentage basis year over year and do not anticipate any significant change in the timing of our SG&A expense as compared to 2008.", "For the full year, we continue to expect to invest in marketing in the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues. Based on our current top line projections, gross margin direction and planned SG&A, diluted EPS for the full year 2009 is currently expected to $0.80 to $0.82.", "We maintain a cautious view on the consumer spending environment and will continue to focus on effective cost management and liquidity. Combine such diligence with powerful brand equity and compelling growth platform will strengthen our ability to be a growth company, balanced with greater profitability.", "At this time, we'd now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On the apparel side of the equation, could you help us understand, I think it came in better than a lot of us expected showing some strong resiliency after a couple quarters of slower sales growth. Can you help us understand how much of that was from distribution growth versus comp growth versus ASP's, what role the ASP's play and men's versus women's and kids and if there is any disparity in the growth level in the second quarter on the apparel side.", "David McCreight", "We actually saw a pretty broad based acceptance to apparel in the quarter. As I said earlier, and as Kevin mentioned, we saw success in men's, women's and youth, so it was broadly received. In terms of actual distribution, we saw it with some key strategic account success as well as strength in our direct to consumer channels as well.", "", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Was there a big change in the amount of distribution you had year over year in apparel?", "David McCreight", "No.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And on the ASP side, was there much change?", "David McCreight", "Not material.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kate Mcshane \u2013 Citi Investment Research.", "Kate Mcshane \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Would you mind repeating what you said about inventories in the back half? Did you say you expect them to be up in line with sales?", "Brad Dickerson", "At the end of Q4 we expect it to be slightly below our sales growth for the year. Right now, Q3 probably relatively flat to maybe up a little bit, but more Q4 to be down year over year compared to the revenue growth.", "Kate Mcshane \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "In terms of liquidation sales for apparel, how should we think about that for the second half relative to what you saw during the second quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think when you look at apparel liquidation, I think it's important to note again, we talked historically about how we've handled the liquidations on the apparel side. We have our choice here of moving them through the outlet channel, our outlet channel, moving them through third parties and also holding on to that inventory for maybe future outlet sales down the road.", "We thought in this environment first of all, again more of a balance sheet liquidity play in this environment, we thought is was important to really look at our inventory and really make sure that we're as clean as possible going into next year.", "Also if you remember, we had Q4 of 2008, the destocking at retail that obviously puts more pressure on inventory on the front half of this year. So we're in more of a one time event here in 2009. Again, it's a pretty small piece of our revenue overall, not a material change in our strategy there at all, just more of a focus this year to clean up our inventories to get towards the end of the year.", "But again, we have the option of also moving our inventory through our outlets very profitably also. I think when you look at timing of this, it will be more pronounced in Q3 versus Q4. Some of that is just be design as far as number of units moving and also some of that is comparing this year versus last year and the different business environment in Q3 and Q4 also.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Michael Benetti \u2013 UBS]", "[Michael Benetti \u2013 UBS]", "Just a follow up to a prior question on apparel, I wanted to see if you could give a sense of how men's apparel trended in existing distribution versus distribution that was new for you this year.", "Kevin Plank", "First of all, in terms of the greater environment, we're seeing a lot of what everybody's seeing out there. The difference that we have going for us is the momentum of the Under Armour brand. So I would imagine being in the middle today in defining, I think we've talked about barbell effect in the past, is that people are going low and you either want to be down there or you want to be up high.", "So I think the way that we're currently positions is as a premium, and I think we're seeing the benefits of that through our decisions to protect our brand and especially our pricing integrity. There's not a lot of Under Armour on sale in the market place compared to what other brands are doing so a lot of the comps that you're hearing about and the success that other people are having is really being driven by price and I think what you're seeing drive the Under Armour brand is brand and great product.", "So we're really coming back and we are focusing on innovation. That's why making such a big pitch around the Recharge suit has been very important to us and I think again, going forward you're going to continue to see more and more compelling products out at retail.", "In terms of distribution, we did not, our men's comp and what you're seeing in the performance out there is that you're watching us adjust our business. We continue to take the definition of our compression business and redefine that as our base layer business. And so we're adding things around some core basics for us. Our core compression, we're adding things like the fitted component.", "So we're not really standing still and just waiting for the market to come to us as much as I think that we're really taking the fight to the market, and we're being really proactive about the way we address the business right now and I think that's coming through in some positive momentum, particularly in our products.", "[Michael Benetti \u2013 UBS]", "It looks like your guidance for revenues in the second half implies if my math is right, about an eight point slowdown versus the first half and that's versus a 15 point easier comparison in the second half of '08. I know you're planning conservatively, but perhaps you can give us some details on what you're seeing that's making you more conservative in the back half, and then finally how much of the back half revenue do you expect to come from new categories like footwear versus core apparel?", "Brad Dickerson", "Again, to look at that, obviously we're really happy with our first half of the year apparel growth. We do remain a little cautious towards the back half of the year, especially on consumer spending in Q3 and Q4. That's not a think you like to project obviously going forward, so we're going to remain cautious on our outlook for the back half of the year specifically around apparel.", "We have definitely seen less volatility later in the first half of the year than we did earlier in the first half of the year, but again, we're going to be a little cautious as we look towards consumer spending in Q3 and Q4 and what that means with the back to school season and the holiday season.", "As far as you look at, apparel is definitely the major driver of the back half of the year. Footwear for the most part at this point if you wanted to break footwear out, first half versus second half, probably about two-thirds of our footwear has shipped in the first half of the year versus a third shipping in the back half of the year so definitely more weighted towards the apparel.", "David McCreight", "While we posted good numbers for the second quarter and surprise, we still believe we have a long way to go and have much more opportunity to execute and grow the apparel business within the great brand platform that we have. So as Kevin alluded to, you should see more of that in 2010 and 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "On the increased reserves on returns for the running shoes and the increased amount of clearance, what is the reason for that given that product is so early in its life cycle. Was that a reflection of the pricing strategy might have been a big aggressive for this environment or was it reflecting more of some technical features with the shoes were not well received?", "Kevin Plank", "First of all, let me chip in here and I'm going to let Brad finish it up. First and foremost is that we've entered this new category. We've called it a launch and we are officially in the running business. And what we've seen and all indications point to the fact that its going to be long term rival business for this company and its brand. All the indications frankly point to that.", "We had three objectives when we kicked off getting into the running business. Number one was to have a great product and we feel like we achieved that. Secondly was retail support, and I couldn't tell you from the bottom of our hearts just how committed our retailers have proved to be and what a great job that they have done for us across the board.", "And thirdly, is consumer acceptance. We think that again, we checked the box on all three of those and with that was distribution. We really focused on three primary distribution channels. The first being athletic specialty. Also run specialty which was effectively new for us, and then of course our committed Big Box partners. And most important, we found out that the brand was not rejected from any one of these.", "Now as we did that, we planned for this business back in the beginning of 2008 and planned our production and other things accordingly. And frankly we made decisions throughout that process to adjust as best we had the information coming in for 2009 as we continue to do. The world changed a little bit, but I think that we feel good about the business that we've put in place and we will continue to make the proactive decisions.", "And some of those proactive decisions of course, began with our team and the people that we're putting around the table to help us make those calls, but also it comes back to inventory on some other things we're doing which is where Brad and his team come in.", "Brad Dickerson", "If you look at where we are today versus where we were at the end of the first quarter we have six months of information of sell through now on the Running Footwear side which is double the information we had the last time we chatted at the end of Q1. ", "So really with more visibility now to say what the sell through rate is in the front half of the year versus what we sold in, that really led us to make some decisions around what we do going forward. From an assumption perspective, we're assuming the sell through rate of Running Footwear in the back half of the year is similar to what we've seen in the front half of the year.", "So again, from an assumption perspective, that's what we're planning for in the back half of the year for run.", "A couple of other things too, one of the things David talked about was making sure we're set up for long term successful footwear so next season and 2010 is the first step in that and we wanted to make sure that we're as clean as possible going into 2010. So that's why we thought it was important here in the back half of 2009 to take appropriate measures to make sure that we're clean going into 2010.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "Just to make sure I understand the pricing strategy, earlier you noted that, I think it was in David's comments about adjusting the price value proposition. I guess that's implying that the 2010 product line will be a bit more affordable priced for the customers than what we saw in 2009?", "Kevin Plank", "Price value is a combination of perceived value of the product and what will be dialing in is in some cases, perhaps a more experienced view on what the value is of each shoe. But as it gets into for example, we were able to in year one, launch and in our space, deliver a top ten shoe, number six out of box.", "So we've shown examples of where we can dial it in correctly, and there are other places where we think we have to adjust. For 2010, you're going to actually see us continue to work on adding new technologies and you may see price points in some areas go up, and then you'll see some come down as we want to embrace and bring more athletes into the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America", "The footwear focused, I was wondering if you could talk about the hiring of Gene McCarthy and what drew you to him and how you envision the footwear division ramping up both from an expense standpoint as well as timing of a launch of basketball and sort of what the goal is. And related to that, when we would see footwear in Europe?", "David McCreight", "When we were looking for a leader, it was consistent with Kevin's vision for a leader within Under Armour bringing world class experience, the ability to really accelerate the capacity of our organization to match the reach of the brand and the desire from the market place for Under Armour to be an excellent performance footwear company.", "And so we went out in the industry. We spoke with as you can imagine, many people and Gene fit that bill. You can see the breadth of his experience, suits us quite nicely as clearly another skill set notch in the basketball area as well as the intimate relationship with the market place.", "As it relates to basketball, we currently are already on court. As you know we have one of the top ten picks in the NBA, Brandon Jennings is going to be playing this year with the Milwaukee Bucks. We've eight to ten D1 schools. We have 20 undeniable high school programs that we're working through and we're continuing to develop a great technology and great shoe to take to market when we think we're ready to do so.", "Europe, we will be testing footwear in Europe in the near future and will continue to read the market place there and roll out when appropriate.", "Kevin Plank", "I think just some color around the footwear category of our business for us as a whole. We've really, one of the things that we listened and we learned about when we got into this back in 2006 and really started preparing for that all the way back to 2003, was that footwear and apparel, they just don't leverage very well.", "There are some things you can coordinate on the back end, but for the most part you're building a brand new business. I think what you've seen us to, really beginning to start to put more dollars in as early as '03 and '04, it was really about our team. And so the addition of Gene has been well received and he's going to be a really big help to our team when he gets going here in just a few weeks.", "In addition to that, from an infrastructure standpoint, there is so much opportunity for us in footwear, and if we had a message today, number one it is that our team, they are just a work in lights out number one, but number two is that we can do so much more.", "When you look at just the margin opportunities that we have as a business, and you guys extrapolate the numbers of where we're probably coming in in footwear versus where some of our competitors are, I'd say we estimate there's more than maybe 1,000 gross margin improvement available to us as we begin to figure this out.", "And so I believe, there's no magic formula or anything else that any of these other brands have. It's a fact that Under Armour, we're in this business. The consumer accepted us in this business. We're going to grind. We're going to work hard. We're going to build the right team of people around it and you're going to see us continue to improve every single day, not just year or month.", "But that's the approach and I think that's the mentality that we have. It starts at a lot of different places, but most importantly, it starts with Under Armour's commitment to say we are going to be a great athletic footwear brand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan.", "Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "Could you talk a little bit more about your direct to consumer business? What's the current store account and is it up or down in the second quarter?", "David McCreight", "We are going to be, as we discussed earlier, adding additional stores, primarily in the factory house area, and we will be ending the year approximately at 35. We're going to continue to look for opportunities as you can imagine in the market place. With a brand as appealing as Under Armour, and the state of the real estate market, there are increasing opportunities for us to grow there. ", "And through the quarter, the direct to consumer results were fueled by comp door growth as well as new store count growth.", "Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "What was the store count at the end of the second quarter?", "David McCreight", "28 factory outlets, 4 specialty stores.", "Jeff Mintz \u2013 Wedbush Morgan", "Can you give us a sense of how much did the gross margin benefit in the product mix? It actually shifted a little bit back toward apparel this quarter compared to Q1 '08.", "Brad Dickerson", "I think when you look at the benefit on the apparel sourcing side and product mix, it was about a 60 basis point improvement year over year in the second quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I was wondering if you could give us any color on how much the close out sales added to the apparel top line this quarter and whether that pulled forward any of the second half business versus being most seasonal for first half?", "Brad Dickerson", "The apparel liquidation number is relatively small in total to our overall business, so it really doesn't impact the top line too much, and there was not really any significant fluctuation from Q3 to Q2 as far as the apparel liquidation.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "As far as kind of a follow up to the last question, I would have thought footwear penetration being down and direct to consumer being up, would be a bigger tail wind to gross margin. Can you help us think about whether the apparel, how much the apparel margins changed year over year versus the footwear margins year over year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Actually in Q2, we said that the apparel sourcing improved by 60 basis points. I think when you look to the back half of the year, our call outs there are really apparel liquidations and the footwear reserves are more pronounced in the Q3. On Q4, more flat year over year is actually more of a reflection of our direct to consumer, the strength in our direct to consumer business offsetting some of those in Q4.", "And also, obviously an easier comp in Q4, but I do like to point out there is a lot of initiatives we're working on right now. A lot of them are in the margin area along with some cost area. We're not really going to count on those until we know they're going to be successful and then we know the timing when those hit.", "So we're not just sitting here. We're actually working very hard on trying to get some better numbers here in Q3 and Q4.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You talked at several points about specific earnings related to Running Footwear. Can you be a little bit more specific about what that has been? What have been the challenges related to the product and how have you recalibrated for the second half deliveries?", "David McCreight", "What we did as Kevin had mentioned, we focused in on delivering a technologically sound product and so we've had learning across all areas; from product point of view, we continue to improve the cushioning and ride of the product. We continue to work closely with athletes to make sure that the technology platform is relevant and improving performance.", "We've learned a great deal about the distribution. As you mentioned, we're running specialty stores as well as mall based athletic specialty stores, and the pace and flow of deliveries, the pricing mechanisms, the breadth of assortment and finally we've also worked on our supply chain, and we have a great deal to learn still about making great shoes efficiently and bringing them to market accordingly.", "So we're learning in all areas. This is a first season of what we believe is going to be a multi-year growth platform for us, and we're going to get better each year, but we're absolutely committed to the space and we're going to learn at a very rapid pace, be it people, marketing process, all of the above.", "Kevin Plank", "We also, one of the things we realized, we came in with a business that had an opening price point of $90.00 where the meat of the business in sporting business, which is our wheel house, is a few dollars below that, actually $10.00 below that. Athletic specialty as a whole was a new category for us, and we were a new brand for a lot of these guys, so I think there's been a lot of learning on both sides and more importantly, the business is intact and we're going to adjust and you'll see us make some proactive decisions to move forward.", "One think that we should note as well, we talked about Running Footwear, is really success that we continue to see in our Training Footwear. The cannibalization that we predicted, it didn't happen as much. So I just really want to emphasize that we are not going to forget about training and that we think there is a real business there. The consumer really believes in the Under Armour brand there as well and they continue to see us drive innovation and put great product around Training Footwear.", "", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the apparel liquidation, in terms of just timing of when you actually saw those liquidation sales occur in the quarter, was it more back half loaded versus front half loaded?", "Brad Dickerson", "It was pretty much even though out the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company", "Can you give us some sense of the relative strength, the relative growth rates of men's, women's and youth apparel? Which of those apparel segments were growing faster?", "Brad Dickerson", "We're not going to get into that detail, but we just leave it said that all three segments grew. It was very solid and very broad based.", "Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company", "From the release it's not entirely clear whether all three grew double digits or the whole thing in aggregate grew double digits.", "Brad Dickerson", "All three grew double digits.", "Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company", "Currency impact on sales and EPS in the quarter, any meaningful impact?", "Brad Dickerson", "Nothing meaningful.", "Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company", "The question on the liquidation sales, has there been a shift in your strategy on how to deal with that? I thought in the past more of the kind of stuff that would wind up in other company's would go to a third party instead of your own stores. Are you using third party outlets more now? Can you talk about that?", "", "Brad Dickerson", "No, we're not. Again, I want to reiterate that this is a very small percentage of our overall sales and what you're seeing is more just a one time clean up from the destocking in Q4 and any change in the model, we'll signal to you on future calls.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "With regards to the gross commentary, can you quantify the apparel gross margin improvement that you saw or expect to see from process and cost savings?", "Brad Dickerson", "For Q2, we said apparel sourcing was about 60 basis point improvement year over year. We'll probably continue to see something similar in the back half of the year relative to apparel sourcing and needless to say, just as we talked about the other areas of the company, Wayne and the direct supply chain team are working hard. We believe there's still more head room ahead in apparel margins in coming years as well.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "You spoke about the opportunity on footwear gross margin, is there a near term opportunity or is the product cycle improvements might be delayed into 2010 or beyond?", "Brad Dickerson", "We're probably right now, in 2011, working on products so it's a combination of relationships with suppliers, a combination of our expertise designing cost savings into product as well, and really just staying smarter about it, so all those things come in time. All those things come as the team continues to play together. ", "So again, putting the right team of people around the table, the right team of experts that bring that experience to the company and then just letting them work together. So I don't know that we can declare a date, but I think you'll see consistent improvement, particularly on the footwear side.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "So in 2010 we should see improvement on the footwear side from a gross margin standpoint?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think we're talking about more longer term. Again, to get back to some comments we said before, the lock was in the margin relative to the price value relationship David talked about, relative to demand planning and forecasting in addition to logistics to move product from point A to point B and costing.", "So there's opportunities in all those things, so we could see maybe some slight improvement in the short term, but it's more of a longer term play.", "Kevin Plank", "Part of that is offset by our investment into footwear. So we want to be clear. We're really a long term growth platform for our company. We really believe in the footwear engine, so some of that investment is personnel. It's building really a complete company around Under Armour being in the footwear business. So it's not as much immediate as much as it's long term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Tom Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You talked about the price value relationship a little bit earlier with Dan, but you talked about savings in core basics. Is that an opportunity to potentially open up distribution or maybe expand a good, better, best assortment? How do you look at that savings that you're going to pass on to consumers?", "David McCreight", "", "We're always looking to be more efficient and define savings, and the core basics provide us with that as I mentioned earlier, a clear target where we have high unit purchases so we can focus on efforts and build our savings. We're going to continue, we're studying distribution. Ultimately our mission is to reach more athletes and that's something that we're looking at geographically, by sport, by gender, and we're also going to look economically.", "But we'll do that in due course. We've plenty of opportunity in the places where we are and we know that great product is going to fuel that pipeline. But our distribution is very tight and that affords us one of those levers in the future.", "Tom Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Just on the SG&A in the quarter, I think it looked a little bit lighter than maybe the guidance had implied. Was there anything in the SG&A side that may have shifted to the back half or just more greater expense control than expected given that the full year guidance remains intact?", "Brad Dickerson", "There wasn't too much of a shift, maybe a little bit, but it's really more just on the way we planned our business. So obviously we stated that marketing will continue to be 12% to 13% of net revenues which is consistent with the prior year. The pace of spend in the back half of the year should be pretty similar to last year, so it's just a matter of Kevin and David both talked about this, balancing our efforts around cost control with appropriate levels of investment we need in critical areas for our growth.", "So although we're leveraging our SG&A in some areas, we are investing in things like our direct to consumer business. Kevin and David both talked about talent, new team members on board, especially innovation around apparel and footwear design, a consumer insight visionary we're spending some money on to investing.", "We're also investing in people and resources that can help with margin improvements longer term in the future, material and costing engineers. So there's a lot of investments we are making and some of those are being offset by leverage we're getting in other areas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Poser \u2013 Stern Agee.", "Sam Poser \u2013 Stern Agee", "You talked about the 36% increase in the direct business. What kind of percent of total is your direct business? How do you foresee it being or what do you see it for the full year so I can have an idea of how important it is?", "Brad Dickerson", "In the quarter it was approximately 16% of our net revenues this year, about 13% last year. As far as the full year, we do see obviously with that business growing faster than our overall business that increasing as a percentage of net revenues year over year. Last year in 2008 we were at 14% and I would see that coming up a couple of percentage points probable.", "The important thing about that level is in a period where partners may be focusing on their balance sheet and it allows Under Armour to continue to grow and reach athletes we may currently not be reaching. Because again, we can control the pace of those openings.", "Sam Poser \u2013 Stern Agee", "You talked about the key price points at the sporting goods retailers being about $10.00 under the $90.00 opening price point you started running. How do you balance performance and those lower price points, because a lot of the price points they sell at that $75.00 to $80.00 price points in running on more foot coverings that on technical footwear and I just wonder how you're balancing performance and the price point to get the sweet spot of those sporting goods guys.", "David McCreight", "We're early in the non [creeded] footwear space and we're focusing on making sure first we're building a good product that delivers from a technical aspect, and then we'll worry about margins and margin growth later. We want to get great footwear on more athletes. That's our number one focus, and margin will come thereafter.", "Kevin Plank", "You won't see us compromise our performance or what we do with product. I think one of the things we're seeing in the competitive landscape is that you've got a lot of our competitors out there that are taking what was formerly $90.00 to $100.00 premium product and they're selling it down to $60,00 to $70.00 range.", "So again, it's more things to consider and that's where the market is, and so you'll find us, we're going to find a way to compete. We're going to find a way to win. So that's our commitment to the category.", "Sam Poser \u2013 Stern Agee", "With putting in Gene McCarthy, you said you're investing in the footwear space, continuing to invest in the footwear space. What kind of people, below Gene and rounding out what you need there, can you give us some idea of what kind of investment there, what kind of expertise you still think you need within the space?", "David McCreight", "We have a team in place and we've been building the organization for several years. But not just related to footwear, we're looking and want to make sure our team is developing and adding the skill sets necessary to deliver on the brand promise. So we've mentioned all the component scenarios and whether it's design, development, sourcing, technical, merchandising, all of those areas we have a team in place working very hard.", "And Gene and Gavin's addition really are amongst a few people who are helping us move into the next level.", "Kevin Plank", "What you're seeing happen is that people are calling us and so if there's any message I'll send out on today's call is that our number is in the footwear business and we're going to be here for a very long time. When we launched Creative Footwear back in 2006, we had a little more than a dozen people on our footwear team. Today we've got well more than 100. ", "We've got offices in China, Indonesia, sourcing office Hong Kong. We've got our offices here, design development and you're going to continue to see us commit to and build an unbelievable team of people and most importantly, terrific product for the athlete.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Plank for any additional or closing remarks.", "Kevin Plank", "In addition to our commitment to footwear, there are three critical things that I want you to take away from today's call. First, we remain confident in our platform and our ability to generate long term profitable growth. Secondly, we're going to continue to invest in the team and infrastructure to capitalize on the opportunities available to this brand. And third, we are committed to driving operational excellence throughout our organization. We are on a mission.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Alex Pettit, Director of Investor Relations.", "Alex Pettit", "Good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words estimate, intend, expect, plan, outlook, or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. ", "We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.

The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. ", "Before we continue, I'd like to direct you to our Web site, investor.underarmour.com. There you will find this morning's press release, and on our Web cast page, images of a number of the products and initiatives we will address on the call.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, followed by David McCreight, our President, and finally Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter and provide an updated outlook for 2009 and a preliminary outlook for 2010.", "After the prepared remarks, Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marinox, our Chief Operating Officer will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Good morning everyone. Under Armour is a growth company and we are on offense. This quarter's scoreboard is strong proof. Overall, revenues were up 16% with apparel growing 7% and footwear up 153%. And our year-to-date numbers are equally strong with total revenues up 16%, apparel up 8%, and footwear up 69%. These results are a great example of what Under Armour can accomplish as we build our multi-billion dollar global platform.", "And while our eyes are fixed on the road ahead, we thought that looking back to the playbook we were working from when we became a public company might provide perspective on how we've grown.", "In 2005 Under Armour revenues totaled $281.0 million. Our Women's business was just over $50.0 million, we had just set up our office in Europe, our retail store base consisted of just five outlet stores, our online presence was small, and we had not sold a single pair of athletic shoes.", "So fast forward to our third quarter results and let's look at how we've delivered against the opportunities we identified at the time of our IPO. 45% of our incremental revenue growth in Q3 came from wholesale footwear. Another 41% of that incremental growth this quarter came from our direct consumer business. European revenues increased 53% in the quarter and the dollar growth in Women's was the strongest of the three pieces of our wholesale apparel business.", "Overall we grew Q3 revenues 16% to $270.0 million, roughly the same revenue figure that we did four years ago in all of 2005. That is great evidence that the opportunities we identified four years ago are transforming from potential to being the large scalable businesses we believe they are. We are playing offense.", "David and Brad will take you through more detail and specifics around revenue growth, but to me, the most important part of this quarter's story is how we accomplished this growth. We did it by growing every piece of our business: Men's, Women's, and Youth apparel, footwear, accessories, and licensing. ", "We continue to grow because just as we did when we started, by making a break-through piece of equipment for the team sport athlete, we are a company focused on innovation and product-thought leadership, and we continue to have a great dialogue with our consumer, who happens to love sports just as much as we do.", "For Under Armour, innovation is taking many forms as we grow. We continue to innovate on the field. This quarter saw the introduction of the Armour bite and mouth wear, a revolutionary new technology that provides customized dental protection. The results have been proven to increase strength, endurance, and reaction time. At $500 it's not for everyone but we view it as a great example of what happens when we relentlessly seek to make athletes better.", "We also saw great acceptance among athletes this quarter for our recharge suit that we told you about on the last call. It is built with strategic compression that stabilizes muscle tissue and controls post-workout swellings to let the body repair itself to a greater magnitude, getting the athlete back in the game faster.", "This is the type of innovation that helps ensure our leadership position in performance apparel, but we are also aware that innovation needs to be scalable so we can bring that same level of innovation to more athletes and more categories.", "Towards that end we are taking the performance benefits of Under Armour and expanding our reach with consumers beyond those who wear UA compression with our expanded line of fitted ColdGear. It provides a similar level of protection and warmth as our tighter-fitting compression product, but both the cut and sleeve construction allow for a fuller range of mobility. It's a great example of taking our core competency of making athletes better and bringing that level of innovation to a much broader audience than we did four years ago.", "On the brand communication front, we are bringing the Under Armour story to that broader audience as well. The brand continues to show up strong on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons on high school and college football fields across the country, but the star of our [inaudible] campaign this winter will be Lindsey Vaughn, the world's best women's downhill skier and an Under Armour athlete.", "In addition to our relationship with Lindsey and top U.S. snowboarder, Lindsey Jacobellis, we will be outfitting the U.S. style sled team and the U.S. freestyle skiing team at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in February.", "We are protecting our house in football with our on-field presence in the Under Armour's football campaign airing now but we are also expanding our reach by using wider athletes in our brand messaging. We are much more than the company we were four years ago and you will see that with the athletes that we image going forward.", "By scaling our brand equity we are able to tell the Under Armour technology story off the football field and help shape our consumer's view of UA as a brand for all athletes.", "Under Armour is on offense and we are fixed on the road ahead. Apparel is the largest piece of our business and it is strong at retail and well positioned to accelerate in 2010. ", "Footwear contributed much of the growth this quarter and remains an area where we believe in the opportunity and will continue to invest. Our footwear business is young. We have made some great inroads on field with our number two market share position in both football and baseball cleats. Youth continues to be one of the largest opportunities and greatest successes in footwear for us. Our training platform is positioned to expand for us and running will be a major piece of our long-term growth in footwear.", "Our path in footwear is clear. Our goal is to bring the same level of innovation and excitement that we bring to performance apparel to every category we are already in or plan to enter. To accomplish that, we are committed to investing both the financial and human capital to ensure that we reach our potential in footwear.", "Our brand equity has never been stronger and more broad-based. We have grown in many ways the last four years. We are building large, scalable businesses as the foundation of our multi-billion dollar global platform continues to expand and we will continue to play offense.", "Now I'm going to pass it over to David, who will discuss more specifics on our progress in managing the growth drivers to drive that long-term profitability.", "David W. McCreight", "I would like to talk today about some of the areas that are driving our revenue growth in the short term as well as those where we continue to invest for the long-term. As Kevin mentioned, we are focused on cohesively managing our multiple-growth platforms to allow us the flexibility to do what's right for our individual businesses. We have strategically added resources across our organization to ensure that we sustain our trajectory as a growth company.", "The Under Armour brand was established, and continues to be validated, by athletes on field. Over the years, we have had tremendous success in driving growth through apparel, first through the locker rooms, independent dealers, and then sporting goods accounts. Next we are evolving from solely a compression brand by growing our offering beyond compression into loose-fit product and finally, by addition new apparel categories which began to address the needs of both youths and adults, male and female athletes.", "As we detailed earlier this year, we continue to believe the landscape for growing Under Armour apparel is abundant. And while U.S. wholesale apparel is the core of our business today, the foresight to aggressively develop our direct-to-consumer and footwear businesses is paying off now. ", "We benefitted in 2009 as our strong revenue growth, in both direct-to-consumer and footwear, has helped offset the economic pressures of today's environment. Our improved ability to manage the total Under Armour brand growth will be an important competency for long-term success. ", "Our direct to consumer business is robust, with revenues up 47% for the first nine months of the year. As we indicated in previous calls, we made the strategic decision to focus our energy on investing in our factory house outlets and online businesses and to slow the expansion of our specialty stores. By focusing our resources, we were able to better drive and deliver on this high-growth pace.", "Through the factory house outlets, we are able to reach athletes in new communities, build our multi-channel data base, and improve our ability to profitably manage excess inventory. ", "With the online business, we're able to better showcase the breadth of our product to hardcore Under Armour fans, build on our relationship with them in a brand-centric shopping environment, and drive profitable growth. ", "You have heard us talk about how we at Under Armour learn, adapt, correct, and move forward. Our experience to date in footwear has provided our team with some accomplishments and with some great lessons. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we play offense and our strategy around the long-term growth of our footwear business is no exception. We have meaningfully increased our expertise level in-house, we have a better aligned vision for footwear across the organization, and most importantly, we are singularly focused on making great athletic footwear for the athlete of this generation.", "Footwear has been a key component to our growth in 2009 and continues to be a key part of our plan to establish Under Armour as a global athletic brand. As we have learned in apparel, success comes from compelling innovation, thoughtful design, and powerful communication aimed at your target customer.", "Our experiences, learnings, and close consumer connection in sports are key to the re-acceleration we see for our football, baseball, and softball cleated businesses, as well as slides, in 2010.", "In our newer, non-cleated footwear businesses, we are applying greater focus on our core athlete, identifying their future needs, whether they run to train or train to run, by developing a unique, innovative design language specific to Under Armour that speaks directly to our athletes, just as we do in apparel.", "As our footwear team accomplishes this over the next several quarters and years, we will be working to position our run business for the improved product we see coming as soon as 2011. We are planning our running footwear business conservatively in 2010 and as such, our revenue plans for 2010 do not assume growth in our overall footwear business.", "While our year-to-date revenue growth in 2009 highlights our ability to deliver today, we remain a company and a brand investing in a platform for a multi-billion dollar future. During 2009 we continued to prime the apparel product engine. We grew our team of designers, merchants, product developers, and sourcing teams. ", "We invested in consumer insights to better understand the needs of our growing base of customers, we expanded our product assortment and price points that, with the support of our partners, will help us take advantage of opportunities to gain floor space, and we embarked on a detailed analysis of U.S. distribution to better understand the opportunity in our current distribution and identify potential new distribution in the future.", "What we learned reinforces our belief that the opportunity to grow through apparel and other categories for Under Armour remains vibrant. The investments and focus we have brought to the apparel product engine in 2009 will enable us to reaccelerate the apparel growth story in 2010 and allow us the flexibility to manage our footwear platform for growth in 2011.", "We have always had a good sense of where we could grow the pieces of our business. What we are getting better at is the when and the how of growing these individual pieces of businesses and coordinating that growth so we can better plan and allocate resources.", "We understand the challenges inherent in managing a brand with both the near and the long-term potential of Under Armour. The efforts entailed in building the necessary capabilities are not just what our consumers or athletes sees, it's an integration of brand building, product creation, merchandising, and distribution, as well as the coordinated alignment with the back end of the business to ensure that we are maximizing the opportunity and operational efficiency of the organization.", "In summary, we are pleased with our ability to grow revenue 16% in today's environment, but we recognize the need for continued investment to fuel this expanding platform for the future. Investments will encompass many areas, including brand building and product development, innovation, systems, infrastructure, and most importantly, talent.", "We continue to build our teams, bringing years of world-class industry experience to Under Armour. This ongoing infusion of talent, combined with numerous team members who have helped build this brand from scratch, instilled in us the confidence that the expansion of the Under Armour platform is an increasingly stronger position as we become the brand of this generation. We are building and we are playing offense.", "With that, I will pass it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson.", "Brad Dickerson", "With Kevin and David having taken you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like spend some time on our third quarter financial results.", "As an organization, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth by balancing financial discipline with a continued commitment to invest in the areas of our business, which we believe will generate the best long-term return for our shareholders. We believe our third quarter results are an example of this focus and commitment. ", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2009 increased 16% to $269.5 million. Year-to-date, net revenues are up 16% to $634.2 million. Apparel net revenues increased 7% during the quarter to $215.4 million, bringing our year-to-date growth rate in apparel to 8%. Footwear revenues were up 153% to $33.0 million in the quarter and were mainly driven by shipments of running footwear for the back-to-school season. Year-to-date, footwear is up 69%.", "Direct-to-consumer contained its strong growth to 62% growth in the quarter and 47% growth year-to-date. During the quarter, direct-to-consumer represented approximately 15% of total net revenues. ", "Third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 49.7%. There were several puts and takes impacting gross margin. First, as we have talked about in the past, effective inventory management has been one of our key balance sheet initiatives. While still a small percentage of sales, one aspect of this has been the liquidation of excess inventory to third parties, which impacted our gross margin for the quarter.", "These efforts continued to free up working capital and it's worth noting that without these liquidation sales, we still would have achieved a double-digit rate of growth in the quarter.", "Second, during the quarter, we also increased inventory reserves on obsolete seasonal products. These items were partially offset by strong revenue growth in our higher margin, direct-to-consumer business, and decreases in our reserve for sales allowance within discount incentives for our wholesale customers.", "SG&A expenses grew 21% year-over-year to $87.0 million in the third quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net revenues increased to 32.2% compared with 31% in the prior year's period. The year-on-year increase in SG&A was primarily driven by a continued expansion from our factory house outlet stores, as well as investments made in our team. Much of the increase in personnel costs went towards the build-out of our apparel and footwear design and production creation teams, as well as increased funding for our performance incentive plan relative to the prior year. Year-to-date SG&A increased 15%. The percentage of net revenues to SG&A decreased 37.9% compared with 38.5% in the prior-year's period.", "Operating income during the third quarter increased to $47.1 million compared with $46.5 million in the prior year. Year-to-date operating income grew 8% year-over-year to $58.3 million. ", "Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 43.9% compared with 42.6% in the third quarter of 2008. We continue to anticipate our annual 2009 effective tax rate to be approximately 100 basis points improved from our 2008 effective tax rate of 45.3%.", "Our resulting net income in the third quarter rose 2% to $26.2 million.", "Third quarter diluted earnings per share increased to $0.52 compared with $0.51 in the prior-year's quarter. Year-to-date our EPS increased to $0.62 compared with $0.59 in the prior year.", "As noted earlier, we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and improving our working capital efficiency. These efforts have paid off with total cash and cash equivalents increasing over $53.0 million year-over-year to $93.4 million at quarter end.", "Cash, net of debt, increased $72.5 million to $75.1 million at quarter end. We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200.0 million credit facility.", "Net accounts receivable decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis, significantly below our net revenue growth for the quarter. In addition to the strong performance of our collections team, partly improvement in A/R came from the higher mix in direct-to-consumer sales.", "Inventory at quarter end decreased 6.6% year-over-year to $152.8 million. In addition to improved inventory management processes, our inventory balance at quarter end benefitted from strong performance of our factory house outlet stores, an increased level of direct shipments related to footwear, and the third-party liquidation sales mentioned earlier.", "We still anticipate inventory growth to be below revenue growth at the end of the year. Our inventory strategy remains intact as we continue to manage our inventory purchases, reduce our lead times, and sell excess inventory through our factory house outlets and other liquidation channels. We also will continue with our efforts to improve turns while supporting our growth platforms going forward.", "Our investment in capital expenditures in the third quarter was $5.2 million, bringing our year-to-date capex investment to $18.4 million. We continue to anticipate 2009 capex to be in the range of $30.0 million to $35.0 million, below the $41.0 million invested in 2008.", "Now, moving to our full-year 2009 outlook. We delivered strong results in the quarter but we maintain a cautious view on the consumer spending environment. However, given our performance year-to-date, we are raising our outlook for both the top and bottom lines. We now estimate full-year net revenues to be $830.0 million to $835.0 million, an increase of 14% to 15% year-over-year. This compares to our previous outlook of approximately $810.0 million.", "Full year gross margins are still anticipated to be down year-over-year due to the increased sales mix of our lower margin footwear business. However, with the majority of our planned, third-party liquidation sales for 2009 having already occurred, and with the strength in our direct-to-consumer business expected to continue in the fourth quarter, we anticipate our fourth quarter gross margins to be up year-over-year.", "Based on higher personnel costs during the second half of the year, including increased funding for our performance and incentive plan, we now anticipate SG&A for 2009 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, year-over-year.", "For the full year we continue to expect to invest in marketing in the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues. ", "Based on our improved outlook for 2009 and our conservative approach in the beginning of the year, we now have the flexibility to invest in areas we believe are critical to our business. ", "Given current top-line projections, gross margin direction, and planned SG&A, diluted EPS for the full year of 2009 is currently expected to increase to a range of $0.85 to $0.87, versus our prior outlook of $0.80 to $0.82.", "Before we wrap up, I would also like to provide you with a preliminary view into 2010. Based on our initial view, we currently anticipate 2010 net revenues and EPS to grow in the high single to low double digits. This growth is expected to be driven by a degree of acceleration in our wholesale apparel business, as well as continued strength in direct-to-consumer, and does not assume growth in our overall footwear business.", "Obviously it is still early and we will provide additional detail on our 2010 outlook in the coming months.", "Once again, in 2009, we have demonstrated that Under Armour is a growth company. Most importantly, we are a growth company balanced with profitability. Our growth this year is a result of the investments we have made for many years in the brand in our infrastructure and our team. We are committed to investing in our growth initiatives while driving effective cost management and continue to strengthen our balance sheet.", "At this time, we would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the drivers of the apparel re-acceleration next year, from a product perspective. ", "And then also talk about the demand you are seeing in the current quarter for colder weather apparel and whether your sales are inventory constrained at all here in the second half.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Let me just start with some of the things that we are seeing in apparel, and obviously we are real encouraged by some of the indicators that are out there and particularly in the performance in the quarter.", "The first thing I think that's driving is more than anything is probably just our brand equity. I think we continue to see the brand move beyond being a sort of a narrow team sports brand into being much more open and accepted by athletes really of all backgrounds.", "And we continue to build it with the consumer with great product delivered in a very authentic way. And so not compromising our message, not buying our way into categories, but really allowing the brand to be pulled into categories by athletes has really been driving.", "And I think, as we mentioned, we really saw strength across the board, so apparel is obviously the highlight, but with Men's apparel, Women's apparel, and our Youth apparel all growing, as well as footwear, international, direct-to-consumer, accessories, and licensing, it's rare, or not often, I think, that you get every category up in a given quarter. So while apparel, of course, is the largest aspect of our business, we are really excited by all the different places we are seeing growth.", "But the equity, I think, that we found, particularly where you find a lot of people talking about today's environment, we've always had our relationship with that core athlete, and that core athlete is someone that never really leaves our brand and in good times or bad, football will still be played in the fall, baseball in the spring, and volleyball and soccer and so on. So we haven't seen them necessarily go away.", "But if we had any message around our business, and I think you will see us continue to innovate. I mentioned our fitted options that we will have to core compression business, and continue to expand the idea of base player, as we're not necessarily calling it compression anymore, but the next-to-skin product lines, as then us innovating with definitive products like we talked about Armour Bite as well, so we have those premium products that we'll have out.", "So I think our remaining focus on innovation is driving us and I think we're doing a really good job in apparel right now. So that's been a real positive.", "In terms of the quarter in inventory, obviously the cold weather helps and it always makes business, makes all of us a lot smarter, and so we are seeing some of the effects of that, but we will chase where we can and find the places where we see opportunities in the business, but for the most part we feel pretty good.", "Brad Dickerson", "Just to feed off what Kevin said, for the fourth quarter, we do have some ability to chase a little bit of product but based on our inventory management there will be a limit to how much upside we have in the fourth quarter. We will be able to chase a little bit, like Kevin said, but there will be some limit to that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of quick ones. The first one, I apologize if I missed it. If you could give us the number of outlet stores at the end of the third quarter and how many you expect at year end and then the growth in factory stores you expect for next year.", "And the second question is just on the 2010 guidance. Can you help us think about footwear for 2010? You are saying footwear revenues\u2014I guess growth in footwear isn't included in your initial 2010 take, but could footwear revenues actually be down? Or what's happening between running and cross training and new category launches, like basketball in 2010? Should we not expect that? If you could just give us a broad view on what footwear should like in 2010.", "And also, the 2010 international assumption in that would be great, as well.", "David W. McCreight", "We ended the quarter with approximately 33 factory outlet stores and we are looking to add a few more for the beginning of Q4. We see continued opportunity to expand those. We will get into more details on the direct-to-consumer expansion but we're very satisfied with the direction we're taking with direct-to-consumer. We think it's a great way to connect with the hard-core Under Armour athlete and we are seeing it as a nice way to partner with our retail partners. So we're, as you've seen all year, we have seen steady March in progress and we will continue to see that in 2010.", "As it relates to footwear and general guidance, we're not planning on growth in footwear. We have accomplished a great deal. We're seeing real progress in many categories. As I mentioned earlier we've launched and immediately became a leading force in cleated footwear in baseball, softball, and football. We are seeing great progress in the slide business, and we accomplished our goals with running this year, getting out, making a technically sound product, gaining acceptance from our retail partners, and gaining acceptance, more importantly, from our athletes. And we are going to continue with our new team to build that business and model but not planning growth in 2010.", "Brad Dickerson", "On the international question, we see international growing at a faster pace than our overall business in 2010, similar to 2009. But other parts of our business, we also see it doing that also, so I think as a percentage of revenues in general year-over-year, I think you will see international be relatively the same percentage of revenues year-over-year in 2010. But again, we will give you more detail on 2010 in the coming months.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch", "So footwear, your 2011 could be the big break-out year for you.", "Kevin A. Plank", "We're giving you what we're seeing right now. We would really probably rather come back in another three months and tell you what 2010 looks like. We've got two new bodies in the chair in footwear that are doing a great job and continue to evaluate and see what our opportunities are there, but if there is a story right now about 2010, the good news is that we do have five levers to pull on and the good news is that our apparel business is accelerating, or re-accelerating, think about it the way you want to look at it, and gives us the opportunity to make the prudent decision long term that's in the best interest of the brand.", "So I think there is opportunity there, but again, we don't feel any pressure to try to push something if the timing isn't right. ", "And in reaction to your question about categories, we like the categories we're in right now. We're going to become great and excellent in those categories and we're going to focus and refocus on the places where we're doing business today and the categories that we're in today. ", "We see those additional places, i.e. basketball, we're going to test, we're looking at them right now, we've eight division one programs who will be wearing our shoes this year. We've got 20 lead high schools. We've got Brandon Jennings from the NBA so we have presence and we, more importantly, have feedback from all levels of competition. ", "And we are evaluating and making those decisions to go at it, first and foremost when the product is ready and when we're ready to support if and tell a big story. Go heavy or go home.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "I guess just following up on the initial outlook for 2010, if higher margin apparels are growing faster than footwear, I am presuming you are taking this break in footwear to try to bring up those margins. Shouldn't we think about earnings growing at a much quicker pace than revenues? I guess I'm a little confused by why we're expecting them to grow in tandem in 2010 rather than the earnings outpacing the revenues.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, to your point, obviously with apparel growing, being more the growth in 2010 versus 2009 you would expect gross margins to have a benefit to that. But consistent with what we've seen here in 2009, we continue to invest in our business. We think it's important to continue to invest in our business to drive future performance in 2010, 2011 and beyond. ", "So in the SG&A area, similar to what we did in 2009, I think you're going to see similar investments in our team, product creation development teams, direct-to-consumer growing relatively above our overall company growth rates. We will continue to invest in direct-to-consumer. ", "So there's going to be continued investment in our SG&A that we feel is important to drive long-term growth.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Are you anticipating any material improvement in footwear margins next year or are you leaving that open?", "Brad Dickerson", "Footwear margins right now, I think with the growth that David and Kevin walked you through, I think we would see gross margins in footwear would be relatively the same year-over-year, as you saw in 2009. I think we, obviously, long term see tremendous improvement ability in footwear margins, but we won't see as much of that in 2010.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Let me clear, too, we are not taking a break in footwear either. We are continuing to push and drive in footwear. And so again, you will hear a lot more color from us on the next call, as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I wanted to ask you about your seemingly cautious view on the fourth quarter on the top-line side. It seems like you are planning for a little bit of a deceleration, albeit it a good number, but a deceleration from where you were in the third quarter. The cold weather, this used to be\u2014it used to focus so much on the cold weather for you in the last couple of years. Obviously the weather early has been cold in much of the country, kind of cold and wet and requiring some warm apparel. Can you help me reconcile what you're seeing at retail, given the weather and what the sell-through looks like and your outlook for the fourth quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "A couple of things, just on timing between Q3 and Q4, which might help you answer your question. We did see some timing shifts from October orders into September, to your point. Weather helped us in September a little bit and sell-through was very, very strong in September. So a couple of our larger customers did want to get some product in early in September, to stock the shelves. So we did see some of October sales come in September.", "Also, we talked on the last call about liquidation revenues, to third parties. You know, kind of being evenly spread out between Q3 and Q4. We actually saw more of those in the third quarter and as I called out, even with those increased third-party liquidation sales, we still had double-digit growth in the quarter. But more of those came in Q3 than we had anticipated earlier.", "Also, on the cautiousness of the consumer environment, I think in addition to that, we also talked about it in the previous answer, our ability to chase product in the fourth quarter will be a little bit limited based on our inventory levels.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is the weather impacting the demand for Under Armour apparel?", "David W. McCreight", "We continue to make the leading product in our space and as Kevin mentioned, we are always smarter when the weather changes, but we continue to see our market share remain very strong, if not grow, and we're building platforms that will be weather-proof in the future.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And also quickly, on SG&A, I like to hear the comments around SG&A and the willingness to invest. Philosophically, to the extent that you think about how to plan your spending, and to the extent that you see revenue upside over the next year or two, are you looking to kind of plow that back in the business: build the platform to the best of what your resources will allow you to do, marketing, advertising, the team, building up the team, systems, etc.? Or is it more kind of we have an opportunity to see some upside in terms of the bottom line to the extent that sales over the next couple of years kind of come in ahead of that high-single, low-double?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think we are very bullish on the future and we are very bullish on our ability to continue to grow as a company. In order for us to do that there is certain investment that needs to be made and I think that we have prudently been able to balance the ability, a) to grow, b) with the ability the need to invest in key resources.", "And I think, as Brad called out in his script, the key places we are investing first and foremost is around the product, primarily in continuing to put pressure around our apparel group and bring great talent in there, and as well as just filling out the boxes in footwear. I made the point on the last call, if you look at our business, look at the upside that we have in our business, where we've got, if you compare us to, or you can figure out where our margins are versus what some of our competitors, and there's more than 1,000 basis points of gross margin opportunity in our business, over time, for us to be able to invest back in.", "Again, it's not some magic formula that our competitors have that we don't, it's just a matter of timing doing business. So as we enter these other categories and frankly, as we begin to get better at it, we're doing well as a company and hats off to our team on the quarter, but we have a long way to go and we have a heck of a lot of improvement, which speaks a lot to opportunity.", "And the best way we think to be able to capitalize on that opportunity is some of the shorter-term investment that you are seeing us make in 2009, and frankly, in 2010 as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Could I ask you to speak to the split between apparel and footwear gross margins?", "And then I want to talk a little bit about gross margin opportunities in 2010. You talked about footwear staying roughly consistent. As you look towards the new categories for apparel growth and your overall systems and productivity, is there more opportunity on the apparel gross margins in 2010?", "Brad Dickerson", "As far as the split between margins, we don't really break out the split between footwear and apparel margins in detail. But as we've talked about in the past, obviously footwear in general, now and in the future, will be below our apparel margins, although we do see long-term ability to improve those footwear margins. Right now they are below our apparel margins.", "I think what you do see, though, in the third quarter and also we called out for the fourth quarter, is direct-to-consumer is a bigger part of our business in the back half of the year so you do see some benefit coming through with the direct-to-consumer business, which is mostly in the apparel side.", "When you look at 2010, we have been calling out the continued work towards improving our apparel margins, longer term. We still see the ability to do that. We do see more long-term upside in footwear margins but we do still see the ability on the apparel side to improve margins, too, in the short and longer term.", "You will also have to remember, direct-to-consumer continues to be growing above our overall company growth rate in 2009 and also we see that in 2010 and there should be a positive impact on margins from that, too.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "And then a follow-up question. With regards to your decision to let's say regroup in 2010 on the footwear side, can you speak to some of the process improvements and things like that? What do you hope to accomplish by kind of tapping the brakes there and, as I characterized it, regroup?", "David W. McCreight", "As we discussed earlier, and we had mentioned, we've been out in footwear, first started with cleated, and learned a great deal and were accepted by lead athletes across many sports, and rapidly gained a strong market share.", "And we're taking the same approach as we enter the larger and very competitive space in running footwear. We continue to sharpen the team. We've brought in just tremendous experience with Gavin Ivestor and Gene McArthy and others, in addition to the team we have in place. We are working on sharpening our product development cycles, working with key factories, our sourcing base, as well as our use of technology, to help us really define and develop a distinct point of view in bringing our technology and leading product to our non-cleated footwear categories.", "So you go through a cycle of introducing a product, connecting with athletes, staying close to their needs, and you have learnings and you then you build it and ultimately deliver on the brand promise. So we are very confident we've learned a great deal and feel even more confident about our future going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "Just a quick housekeeping first. You used to typically provide the revenue and break down for your top three retailers with your quarterly release. I was wondering if we could get those percent of revenues for your top three.", "Brad Dickerson", "We will put that in the 10-Q. We don't really put that detail out right now but that will be in our 10-Q, which will come out in the next few weeks.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "You commented I think at the top of the call that you were doing some assessment of where to take distribution next year. I'm assuming you're talking about away from your direct-to-consumer business. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what some of your initial findings are telling you there? Perhaps a revised emphasis on the mix going through existing channels or some emerging opportunities in different channels that you might be seeing. Any kind of detail you could help us with there.", "David W. McCreight", "What we've learned is that there is great desire and acceptance of the Under Armour brand across America and we've found that in many locations that our partners are doing a terrific job. Our plans in the near term, in 2010, are to continue to grow our share within our existing partners. We are continuing to try to build floor space and rack space in each of the locations and we are seeing nice progress there.", "Additionally, we are seeing a place to strategically position our direct-to-consumer business, both from our reach of the Web as well as to our own branded stores, and make sure that we are complimenting our existing partners as well. So we are seeing no material change in other partnerships for 2010 as an offing.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "And if I could follow-up on the direct-to-consumer business. You said that that business grew by 62% in the quarter versus last year, versus your total revenues, which grew about 16%. At the same time it looks like direct only represented about 15% of the total in the quarter, which was just a little bit lower than the 16% of the total in the second quarter. I would guess that based on the growth rate there, that that would have led to a higher percent of revenues in this quarter. I'm just curious if there's any kind of change you're seeing in the that business, as well as any kind of change you can talk to us about in the buying habits of the consumer in your direct business, or the average ticket that you're seeing through your direct channels that you would care to call out.", "David W. McCreight", "We continue to make solid progress with our direct-to-consumer. We sort of measure both comp growth as well as we look at new athletes we're bringing, and we're continuing to do both. Very solid comp growth in both our direct-to-consumer areas, whether it's in our own stores as well as through the Web site. And we're also reaching additional traffic as well.", "We've not seen any material shift in the purchase behavior and our average order of value, for the most part, is holding steady. It's one of increased traffic and conversion metrics.", "Brad Dickerson", "Direct-to-consumer was 15% of our business in Q3 of this year. Just directionally, last year it was 11% of our business. So we did see that increase grow year-over-year in direct-to-consumer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "Prior to the recession, you used to anticipate Under Armour growing 20% to 25% a year. Now, with this current environment perhaps being the new normal, is the 10% to 12% growth in 2010, do you anticipate more likely the growth rate for the company going forward, as the large numbers begin to catch up?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think first and foremost, our growth platform is intact. That's one thing I want to let you know. We talked about five growth levers as far back as our IPO. We talked about Men's apparel, Women's apparel, footwear, international, and direct-to-consumer. And I think that Q3 is great evidence that all of them continue to grow, in light of any environment that's out there. ", "So how we measure ourselves and put a barometer, I think long-term growth targets intact is that we see ourselves building the next great athletic brand. And the opportunities that we have in the product categories, distribution, and regions, I think we've, again, demonstrated our ability to have the brand equity to deliver. ", "So more important than anything, is right now we're focused on our 2009 and 2010. We've always said that we're the kind of company that had 13 items, typically, in our top 10 list. Well, 2009 made us prioritize and so instead, we turned that list into our top five. And we really began to prioritize our investment. And more importantly, is our ability to not only prioritize our own investment, but to continue to grow while we do that.", "So the thing that I think we're seeing from it and probably gives us the most upside, is as we look at the scope of who we are speaking to today, the athletes we're talking to, beyond just the team athletic fields, and particularly from the success we've seen in places like Women's, golf, footwear, running, and Europe. And I think that message of learning, adapting, and going is one that we will continue to push and drive going forward as well.", "But from a growth standpoint, I'm very clear on the fact that we remain a growth company and we will continue to play off those through 2009 and 2010 and so the size of that growth is one of the things we want to put off until our next conference call. We'll see a little more, see how the holiday goes, and get a little more understanding. But right now we feel very comfortable with the outlook that Brad provided and we will continue to execute on that.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "As a follow-up, in the prior conference call you noted that you were wanting to rework the pricing, maybe the technology with your running shoes. I think a lot of us were anticipating these changes would be in place perhaps by the midpoint of 2010. I was curious as to why maybe it takes longer to reformulate the strategy, it sounds like, on the running shoes, before it begins to grow again.", "David W. McCreight", "Like we said, and Kevin mentioned, we get out, we call a play, we run the play, we learn, we adapt, and then we revise. And we have done that in cleated, we've done that successfully in other areas, as you're seeing now. In non-cleated we've had some terrific traction with our Youth footwear and we think we've got a very good price value as well as an innovation story.", "Most importantly, we've had great acceptance and commitment and support from our footwear partners out there and we are continuing to look to build the business with them and find the spot for Under Armour.", "As you look to dial in, you will see us really adjust price value, probably in the first half of 2010, and then the product development cycle, it's not a short development cycle. So that's what you will see most of that coming in the future.", "But overall, we're very optimistic about taking a leading position in footwear, in the very near term.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "I think I wrote in my notes on the gross margin drivers in the quarter, did you say you reduced the incentives to wholesale customers?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, it was a combination of sales allowances and incentives to wholesale customers. It's more a reflection of last year's number being a little higher, more so than normal. I think this year's number is a little bit more normalized.", "Dan Werer \u2013 Raymond James", "So just with key retailers cutting back on inventories, they're earning fewer of these discounts than they had in the past?", "Brad Dickerson", "It could just be also that it is also a shift sometimes in how we spend those dollars, so sometimes it shows up in margins, sometimes it shows up in SG&A. So it's not really a significant change in the cost as much as it is where that cost shows up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Your sales guidance for next year, high single digits to low double digits. How should we be thinking of that in terms of first half and second half? Because you are going to be lapping a big footwear quarter in Q1, just based on the running shoe launch. I'm guessing that in terms of footwear being potentially flattish next year, you would probably expect it to be down in the first half and then maybe up in the second half. But tell me if I'm not thinking about it in the right way.", "Brad Dickerson", "I think we'll give a lot more detail on our 2010 outlook at the next earnings call, but to our point before and to what you're saying, with footwear growth not like it was in 2009, I think you can look at the timing of what footwear [inaudible] in 2009 compared to what you would see in 2010. ", "Also, similar to what we saw in 2009 on the direct-to-consumer side, again direct-to-consumer is a call out of ours that continues to grow above our overall company, and I think, as we pointed out, the back half of the year is usually a bigger growth area for our direct-to-consumer business.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And any color you can give us on your spring orders, how are they coming in?", "David W. McCreight", "Early on we have worked with our partners for spring and we're getting a good response to the product offering.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And lastly, I know you mentioned SG&A 12% to 13% of sales this year. Would you expect that percentage to hold comparable in 2010, because it sounds like you're sponsoring some Olympic athletes in some of the winter games so I'm just wondering if you would expect that percentage to come up at all. Our maybe you would be a little bit more lumpy in 2010 with a focus on the upcoming Winter Olympics.", "Brad Dickerson", "I think you meant marketing as a percent, on the 13%.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes, I'm sorry.", "Brad Dickerson", "We will give you more outlook on the timing of marketing on the next earnings call, but we don't see any significant changes in the marketing as a percentage of revenues in 2010 versus 2009.", "David W. McCreight", "I just want to add on to Brad's comments, one of the things I think is so unique about Under Armour, and it's just terrific to join, has been Kevin's focus on driving the business forward. And you're hearing of a lot of companies that decreased SG&A this year and the strategic push has been invest, build the future, we're investing in large, scalable businesses that are going to lead us to a multi-billion dollar platform. And there is clearly some tension on do you want to leverage now. And we are very committed to building what we need to. And so you are going to see continued investment, just like in 2009, in 2010, in building that platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kate Mcshane \u2013 Citi Investment Research.", "Kate Mcshane \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "I wondered if you could give a little bit more detail on deflation and how much it contributed to any margin improvement in the third quarter and can we expect an acceleration in Q4 going into 2010?", "David W. McCreight", "Wayne and team are working on some tremendous sourcing initiatives. Those will, as Brad was saying earlier, we will start to see continued apparel gains, but through a shift in channel, as well as we're further along in building that supply chain and refining it. And then we expect to see further opportunities for footwear\u2014actually, a tremendous opportunity for footwear\u2014but that's more in the mid-to-longer future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I have a follow-up question on the outlook for re-acceleration in the wholesale apparel side of the business. Can you just, maybe at a high level, talk about what the drivers you expect to be between distribution expansion, perhaps recalibration of inventory levels out there in the channel, and what you expect the economy to really do next year?", "David W. McCreight", "We are seeing the re-acceleration based on the strength of our apparels business within our existing partners. We are not planning on a tremendous expansion of doors with them, it has to do with the messages that Kevin related to earlier: exceptional brand, working on innovative product that resonates with our athletes. And we're seeing it in a broad-based manner. So it is less to do with back-filling of inventory and more has to do with the quality of the brand and the product we have coming in the future.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just on the economic outlook, is your expectation that things will largely run sideways from where we are today, in that outlook?", "David W. McCreight", "Yes. We are not planning on any macroeconomic factors to improve or detract from the environment as it is today.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I believe last quarter you called out about a 60 basis point benefit coming from the apparel costing gains. Can you talk about what that was this quarter and what you expect it be heading into the fourth quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "We did see some benefit from sourcing improvements, as David stated earlier. It was not quite the magnitude of Q2 but it was a positive. It was also offset by some mix, apparel margin mix, year-over-year in the third quarter. And also some distribution mix, also, which more than offset that apparel sourcing gain.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And with the benefit lower then in Q3 relative to Q2, should we expect that same trend to persist into the fourth quarter with perhaps no benefit coming from the pro costing?", "Brad Dickerson", "Again, with the mix issue, it's a little tough to give you direction on how apparel margins will go. What we'll say, as David stated, Wayne and his team are really working on improvements in sourcing going forward. We continue to see incremental sourcing improvements, quarter-over-quarter, but again, mix plays a big part, too, and that's a little tougher to give you direction on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "I just want to talk about footwear for a second as you go into next year, and I guess more specifically, on the merchandise and product margin trend. I guess my thought is, how we should look at that. I know you're not really looking for too much of a benefit, but between less close-out product as you go into next year, kind of fine tuning the business model from a sourcing perspective, etc. And I know there are lead times that get factored into this, but why wouldn't we really anticipate at least some improvement in the merchandise or product trend as we go into next year, just given what you're up against and given maybe tweaks to how you're sourcing and how you're doing materials, etc. Are you still dealing with some inventory potential on the running side of the business because of seasonality? I'm just curious if you could flush that out a little more.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Number one is I just want to drive home the point, we couldn't have greater confidence in the upside of our long-term potential in footwear. So we believe in it and we are investing in and around it. And hopefully that message has clearly come through today.", "As we do that, though, we are also realizing that you have got a long lead-time category of business here that typically runs 18 months or more when you figure in the design cycle and everything else that comes into it. So as much as we are working on enhancing, improving the supply chain or the cycle of product for us, more importantly, we are also working on trying to improve the product that we put in the market itself.", "There's definitely a price to value balance there, where bringing in the expertise and the experience of people like Gene and Gavin to our team have really given us the ability to take what, in the past, something\u2014and it's the ability for teams to work together longer and a shoe that would typically take us 20 pieces to build, we are finding ways and efficiencies to build it for 14 or 15 pieces. ", "So I think taking some of the performance, and just frankly, having the ability to build better shoes at a more cost-efficient pace, is something that we're building. So we have two wheels in motion. The first wheel is that long, 18-month cycle, which we've engaged the guys and which begins really in 2011. But also, we're not giving up on 2010. We do have some great product that we're going to have in the market in 2010 and again, we have mentioned momentum that we have with our number two market share with football and baseball cleats. ", "So those businesses will be growing in 2010 for us and we'll be taking more market share there. So I think we are very excited about what that means. I think the momentum we have seen around our Youth business, again, is another place that we believe we have great upside. But also we have the luxury, because of the growth model that we have with these five levers, I think to be more patient on areas where we want to ensure that we can put a great product in the market and ensure that we can deliver great value to the consumer at the same time, and not charge them more money just because we have an immature supply chain.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "And lastly, on Europe, give us your thoughts as you go into next year, about either how you might be investing in that business and kind of your thoughts about how you look at that business as you go into next year.", "David W. McCreight", "We see tremendous opportunity in Europe. We planted the flag year ago. And like we're seeing this year, we're planning on sizeable growth within Europe and we are continuing to build the team and develop the story and tell the brand story throughout the continent. So we will be investing additionally primarily in telling the story and reaching new markets within the continent.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Thomas Shaw \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Maybe a little clarity on some of the breakdown of the SG&A cost in the quarter, just from a modeling perspective. You have typically given out marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. Just any of that kind of data would help, from a modeling standpoint.", "Brad Dickerson", "For the quarter, I can give you some direction of some of the SG&A components. Marketing, year-over-year in the quarter, was down 40 basis points. We saw selling costs go up 60 basis points. Just remember that a big part of the selling cost is our direct-to-consumer cost, so obviously you would expect those to grow at a faster pace, cost-wise. And you also saw some increases year-over-year in product innovation supply chain, which we talked about, relative to building our teams.", "Operator", "This will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Kevin Plank for any additional or closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Number one, I would like to start by just congratulating our team on what we thought was a very solid effort this quarter, and particularly to our customer base. But more importantly, I want to reiterate the fact that we certainly aren't declaring victory by any stretch. We have a long way to go, a lot of work, and hopefully you sense one thing from our team and our performance is that we have the resolve to do it and will continue to go to work every day. ", "So with that, I wish everybody a happy Halloween and take it from there. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to today\u2019s speaker Ms. Alex Pettitt, Director of Investor Relations.", "Alex Pettitt", "", "During the course of this conference call we\u2019ll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.  The words estimates, intend, expect, plan, outlook or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The company assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which this statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Before we continue I\u2019d like to direct you to our website investor.UnderArmour.com.  There you will find this morning\u2019s press release and on our webcast page, imagines of a number of the products and initiatives we will address on the call.  Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO followed by David McCreight, our President and finally Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss the company\u2019s financial performance for the fourth quarter and provide an updated outlook for 2010.", "After the prepared remarks Kevin, David, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank ", "When we spoke to you early last year we talked about Under Armour having multiple levers to pull to fuel our growth.  Today, I want to discuss how pulling those multiple levers enabled us to finish strong in 2009 and how investing in these five levers: men\u2019s apparel; women\u2019s apparel; footwear; international; and our direct to consumer channels positions us well for 2010 and beyond.  ", "We closed with a great fourth quarter, revenues up 24%.  We had our best quarterly gross margin number in two years and we finished the year with a strong balance sheet driven by improved inventory management.  The combination of our strong brand and growing operational strength gives us confidence that we are positioned to win in this decade by continuing to strategically invest in our growth.  ", "When we look back all over 2009 we are even more proud of some of our other accomplishments.  For the full year we grew our top line 18%.  We maintained our leadership position in our core compression business even as large competitors heavily discounted their compression product.  We grew our share in non-compression which is the key to our long term apparel revenue story and most importantly, we continued to bring new consumers in to the Under Armour brand with new strength in key categories and even greater on field authenticity at every level.  From the NFL and college field all the way down to the middle school soccer field, the Under Armour brand has never been stronger and more ingrained in the fabric of American sports.  ", "Today, I would like to focus on how we are growing and investing on multiple fronts continuing to leverage the opportunities immediately in front of us while at the same time investing so we are prepared for what lies ahead.  In 2009 we saw double digit growth in our business units with apparel up13%, footwear up 61% and accessories up 11%.  For the full year our direct to consumer business grew nearly 50%.  ", "We\u2019ve added depth to our women\u2019s team across all functions and will continue to bring the right fit, the right colors and cohesive merchandising to our women\u2019s line moving forward in to 2010.  Our direct to consumer business was a key driver of our 2009 growth and will be a key element of our 2010 distribution expansion strategy.  Our goal is to continue bringing greater access to the Under Armour brand in a measured and thoughtful expansion.  David will discuss in greater detail our long range strategy to bring our brand to where our consumer shops.  ", "On the investment side we\u2019ve made great strides in building the organization that will deliver long term growth for our company and especially in footwear.  If we dive down in to our footwear business for a minute, we think you\u2019ll see an organization that much like Under Armour overall is deep in both execution and investment mode.  On the execution side, cleats are a great example of how we use our brand strength and knowledge of athletes to build great footwear for the world\u2019s best football and baseball players.  ", "We\u2019re entering our fifth year in the cleat business and our success there drives our confidence that we can accomplish that same thing for athletes of all types.  But, we know that footwear is a learning process and we learned a lot in 2009.  We learned that we need to invest capital both human and financial to fully leverage the Under Armour opportunity in footwear.  We have since brought years of footwear industry experience in to Under Armour and added depth throughout the organization.  ", "We have three goals for our footwear business in 2010.  First, strengthen the categories that we\u2019ve already entered and established ourselves, particularly cleats.  We expect to take market share in both football and baseball cleats in 2010 and beyond, additional market share.  Second, we are repositioning our training and running categories so that we are better organized to develop product that will move us down the path of being a multibillion dollar global brand.  Third, we\u2019re developing new footwear categories that will begin to impact our business in 2011 and beyond.", "Being a great footwear company is not just about making a big splash with launch product and we have no major footwear launches planned for 2010.  However, we are developing our basketball footwear and positioning for a future launch.  While you won\u2019t be able to find Under Amour basketball footwear for sale at retail you will find it being tested and authenticated throughout 2010 on the feet of 10 Division I basketball programs, more than 20 top high school programs as well as on the feet of NBA Rookie of the Year contender Brandon Jennings.", "We can be patient because the multiple growth levers that allow us the patience to prioritize.  For instance, in 2009 direct to consumer and footwear represented the two largest components of our 18% top line growth and we anticipate 2010 top line to be driven by an accelerating wholesale apparel business and once again a strong direct to consumer channel.  Our apparel business grew 13% and topped the $650 million revenue mark in 2009.  ", "Let me state it very simply, our apparel business finished 2009 very strong and we are in great shape heading in to 2010.  Performance apparel remains the story in the athletic channels and Under Armour continues to lead in both volume and our ability to maintain premium pricing.  Our apparel growth in 2009 is important to our long term story as we continue to grow our non-compression lose fit business at a faster rate than our core.  ", "There\u2019s always tremendous focus on the base layer category and that makes sense as it has been such a key driver of industry growth.  But, the facts are that while our compression business is where we have made our name, our business beyond compression is what will drive our growth going forward.  So our focus in apparel is two-fold, grow the core by continuing to lead in innovation and authenticity and grow outside the core by bringing the promise of Under Armour performance to a new audience. ", "Our brand communication is also two-fold.  First, we are protecting our core business by expanding our authenticity with several recent deals.  Starting this July we\u2019ll be outfitting Boston College\u2019s athletic program.  Also beginning this year, we are teaming up with IMG Performance to host athlete combines at regional sites across the country.  We\u2019ll host more than 50 combines this year touching thousands of young athletes on a grassroots level showcasing the Under Armour brand as well as new products in categories from us like footwear, building momentum one athlete at a time.", "As part of this partnership we\u2019re developing a comprehensive athletic training platform that will establish global measurement standards for improved sports performance health and fitness called Combine 360.  We believe the Combine 360 score will be as universal for athletic performance as the SAT score is for academics.  ", "Protecting our core means being about team sports and what has historically been at the heart of that for our brand is football.  From the opening whistle of the first college game in August all the way through the ball games, playoffs and the draft in April, our brand speaks the language of football.  All this week NFL coaches and scouts and the top senior collegiate players are at the Under Armour Senior Bowl in Mobile Alabama.  We are the official sponsor of the NFL combine held in Indianapolis at the end of next month outfitting every player head to toe in Under Armour and we\u2019ll be telling our brand story during the NFL draft in April which this year will be held in prime time on a Thursday night.", "We then use these authentic platforms to launch key products for our brand like the upcoming Under Armour core short that we are very excited to introduce to our consumer.  It is a patented compression short with an iconic x type design that stretches across the body which stabilizes and supports your muscles and core unlike any product before it.  The look of the short is as technical as its performance and we are currently showcasing it on athletes at the highest level but it is a unique product that will be just as relevant for athletes at any level and available at retail beginning this spring.", "So when we talk about team sports or product innovation we do it authentically.  We do it where our consumer lives and we do it non-stop.  Again, it\u2019s about protecting our foundation, staying close to the heart of athletes and not doing so by just adding another traditional sports marketing asset to our stable.  But just as we are rapidly growing our apparel business outside of compression, we are investing in brand communication beyond the football field as well.", "One great example of this in 2010 will be happening next month at the winter Olympics in Vancouver.  Given our position as the market leader in performance base layer, the winter Olympics gives us an opportunity to communicate our innovation story to a truly global audience.  We are the official uniform supplier for the US bobsled team and have created one of the most aerodynamic uniforms to appear on the track.

Lindsey won her eighth event towards the world cup this past weekend in Italy and is unbeaten in the downhill this season.  She\u2019ll be a favorite to metal in Vancouver and has been appearing in our most recent cold gear commercial that we made together with our partners at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.  ", "Our brand communication strategy is in synch with our overall growth strategy.  We are focused on maintaining our core while brining new consumers in to the brand.  We will continue to invest in our growth drivers, pulling the multiple levers to ensure long term growth and we will continue to invest in brand communication and distribution that will bring the Under Armour performance story to a new audience.", "Now, I\u2019m going to pass it over to David who will discuss hour our consumer focus distribution strategy and our growth in apparel will drive our business in 2010.", "David W. McCreight ", "This morning I will be covering three areas critical to our growth in 2010 and beyond: first, the positioning of our footwear organization and product development for long term growth; second, accelerating Under Armour revenue growth through our apparel platform; and third, our consumer focus strategy to expand the reach of our direct to consumer business through new doors and existing channels and targeting new distribution.", "To follow on Kevin\u2019s theme of investing and growing on multiple fronts, I\u2019m confident saying that all three of these initiatives are key elements of our long term growth story.  For 2010, driving apparel growth and expanding our distribution to new customers will continue to have a material benefit on our current and midterm growth targets while building the foundation in footwear will being greater benefit to 2011 and beyond.  ", "Footwear is a key part of our mid and long term growth story and 2010 will represent a year of continued investment and concentration for us.  With the strong momentum we have in both our apparel and direct to consumer businesses we are not relying on footwear to growth the top line in 2010.  We are fully capable of achieving our 2010 target for top and bottom line growth while taking a more conservative approach to footwear revenue.  ", "We believe strongly that coming out of 2010 with both clean inventories and a markedly improved footwear product line positions us well for growing footwear starting in 2011.  Our focus for the team in 2010 will be on delivering excellence in the footwear categories that we\u2019ve already entered and where materially opportunities exist for growth in 2011 and beyond.  For instance, cleated footwear which we launched four years ago is a study in how Under Armour successfully entered the market and grew to command a substantial market presence.", "Earlier Kevin talked about the strength of our cleated business one where we have worked closely with our athlete partners to develop football and baseball cleats that deliver the level of performance they expect from Under Armour.  We entered the cleated category several years ago, learned from our marketplace experience, adjusted our game plan, calibrated the offering and the byproduct of those efforts is reflected in the strength in our cleated market share and our double digit growth trajectory for 2010.", "In our newer running and training category, two large segments where we have been recently embraced by our partners and athletes.  We are using 2010 to accelerate our learning curve.  We are rapidly absorbing the lessons from our recent marketplace experiences, recalibrating the product offering and supply chain and moving quickly to build a world class footwear team.  Based on the strength of our brand, the response from our retail footwear partners to our future direction and our progress in building our team, we are confident that we will make material progress in 2011 and beyond in the run and training categories just as we\u2019ve shown the ability to command strong share in the cleated businesses.  ", "As Kevin said our apparel story coming out of Q4 and in to 2010 is robust.  We finished 2009 with strong growth across men\u2019s women\u2019s and kid\u2019s.  Our strong performance in base layer and training is evidence that our core business remains strong while our growth in both mountain and golf shows that our brand is playing well outside of the core categories of compressions.  ", "One of the stated goals of our apparel engine was to continue the expansion of our women\u2019s business to rival that of our men\u2019s.  We closed 2009 with momentum in women\u2019s apparel and expect it to continue in 2010.  With our increased understanding of the female athlete, development of the Under Armour Fit, the evolution of our merchandise flow and with the support of our partners we continue to gain floor space and by focusing our products and intensifying our market voice around our team girl target, increasing shares in our bottoms offering and the new training products being introduced we are confident that we\u2019ll have a strong 2010 in women\u2019s apparel as well.", "Much like Kevin\u2019s discussion of parallel and growth discussions, our distribution story is around expanding our core contacts while adding new athlete through additional reach.  First and foremost our long term distribution strategy is consumer focused.  We intend to meet our athletes where they prefer to interact with the brand.  Our distribution is tightly controlled especially when compared to some of our athlete apparel competitors and each additional layer of our distribution reach will be intention and have the consumer in mind.", "The key to expanding access to the brand is doing so in a way that keeps what\u2019s special about our brand special.  We are keenly aware that our core consumer seeks out our product in a much different manner than their predecessor one generation ahead of them.  The retail landscape has shifted dramatically over the past few years and every brand has had to adapt to this new way of selling.  As a brand with a young core consumer we\u2019ve been witness to this in an even more acute way.", "As we said on earlier calls, we believe there remains opportunity to grow Under Armour apparel business within our existing base of retailers as well as explore other ways to expand our reach.  The largest percentage of our distribution growth in 2010 will come from existing wholesale partners through a combination of new doors and increased dedicated space within existing doors.", "The second piece of our distribution expansion and the area that was so critical to our revenue growth and margin expansion story in 2009 is our direct to consumer business.  As we continue to expand our brand\u2019s access to new customers it becomes even more critical that we focus on the way our brand is presented to the consumer.  Our ability to control and influence this presentation at retail is essential to our strategy of expanding our distribution.", "With the key facets of our direct to consumer business, our global direct online business and our factory house outlet stores, we can ensure that the brand presentation and merchandising mix of our product is aligned with our growth strategy.  Being a brand that is for and about athletes we have always prided ourselves on maintaining an intimate relationship with our target athletes and while we believe our investment plans for direct to consumer business in 2010 are meaningful the benefit to our margin and inventory management story and our ability to bring the brand to new consumers is meaningful as well.", "We will continue to invest in our global direct business ensuring that we have a robust shopping experience online.  Whether they wind up buying online or not, we know that a large percentage of Under Armour fans use the web as the primary element of their shopping experience.  We need to provide that consumer with the ultimate Under Armour superstore with an online environment with access to and information about everything we make.", "In 2009 we invested in our global direct business and saw the benefit of those investments in both our top line and gross margin and we believe continued investment and even more focus on the global site will deliver both financial and strategic benefits in the future.  Our factory housed outlet stores have proven to be a great channel as well for bringing new consumers in to the Under Armour brand.  This channel has meaningfully evolved over the past few years and gives us a great view in to the consumer. ", "In addition to being a great inventory management tool we were able to bring the Under Armour brand to this consumer in an environment they have clearly shown to like and surrounded by other top brand, bring the brand to places where we are not well represented geographically by our existing wholesale distribution.  ", "For 2010 our plan is to open 15 factory housed stores which would bring us to a total of 50 stores by yearend.  While we believe that\u2019s an appropriate number for a brand that is approaching $1 billion in sales, we also believe that number will continue to grow over time as the channel continues to evolve and our inventory management structure evolves as well.", "In closing, I will echo Kevin\u2019s comments about our unique ability to pull upon multiple levers to drive growth.  In 2009 we leaned on our footwear and direct to consumer businesses for revenue growth.  In 2010 direct to consumer and wholesale apparel will be the primary drivers of revenue growth while we continue to make the strategic investments necessary to keep our current and future growth drivers primed to deliver great results in 2011 and beyond.  ", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson.", "Brad Dickerson ", "With Kevin and David having taken you through some of our highlights and strategies of our business, I would now like to spend some time on our fourth quarter and full year financial results.  This year demonstrates the financial discipline we continue to develop within our organization.  We continue to invest in the critical areas of our business that will drive sustainable, profitable growth while managing our costs effectively and strengthening our balance sheet.  These are all keys to putting us on a path to drive successfully long term growth in 2010 and beyond.", "Our net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 24% year-over-year to $222 million.  This success was largely driven by apparel which was up 26% to $192 million.  An important part of this apparel growth came from our direct to consumer which continued its strong growth up 53% during the quarter with success primarily in our factory outlet stores and web.  Our international business also continues to gain traction and was up 45% for the quarter.  Footwear was down approximately $500,000 to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter due to returns and sales reserves. ", "Driven by our fourth quarter results, we exceeded our previously provided outlook for both our top line and EPS for the full year.  For the full year, net revenues increased 18% to $856 million compared to $725 million in 2008 above our previously stated outlook of net revenues in the range of $832 to $835 million.  Our footwear revenues increased 61% for the year with our entrance in to the running category while apparel gained 13% to $652 million with strength in men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth.  Direct to consumer grew 49% in 2009 representing approximately 18% of net revenues, while our international business was up 48% in 2009.  ", "Fourth quarter gross margins were 51.4% compared with 50.7% in the prior year\u2019s quarter primarily due to strong revenue growth in our higher margin direct to consumer channel and a favorable product mix shift towards apparel.  For the full year gross margins were 48.2% compared with 48.9% in 2008.  Although still a small percentage of sales, the liquidation of excess inventory to third parties impacted our gross margins for the full year.  These liquidation sales was one of our key balance sheet initiatives specifically around inventory management which we feel was especially important in the 2009 environment.  The growth in our footwear business also impacted our gross margin on a year-over-year basis.  These items were partially offset by strong revenue growth in our higher margin direct to consumer business.  ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $87 million in the fourth quarter up 2009 or 39.3% of net revenues compared with $68 million or 37.9% of net revenues in the prior year\u2019s period.  This increase is primarily driven by the continued expansion of our factory housed stores and higher personnel costs.  For the full year selling, general and administrative expenses were $328 million or 38.2% of net revenues compared with $278 million or 38.3% of revenues in the prior year.  ", "Similar to the fourth quarter the year-over-year dollar increase in SG&A was largely driven by the continued expansion of our factory housed outlet stores and higher personnel costs.  In addition, marketing expenses increased $11 million in 2009 and were 12.4% of net revenues compared with 13.1% in 2008.  Our full year SG&A growth of 17.9% exceeded our previous outlook of growth in the mid teens.  This was primarily driven by increased direct to consumer variable costs relative to fourth quarter top line and performance equity expense tied to the impact our strong fourth quarter results had to the full year 2009 as well as our improved visibility in to 2010.  ", "Operating income during the fourth quarter increased 18% to $27 million compared with $23 million in the same period of the prior year.  Due to the SG&A deleverage in the quarter operating margin was 12.1% in the fourth quarter compared with 12.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter.  For the year, operating income increased 11% to $85 million compared with $77 million in the prior year.  Operating margin for 2009 was 10% of net revenues compared with 10.6% in 2008.  The primary impact to our full year operating margin was the decline in gross margins I discussed earlier.  ", " ", "Below the operating income line we had some significant improvements.  Our enhanced and expanded currency hedging strategy significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations below the operating income line during the fourth quarter and the full year.  In addition, due to decreased losses in our foreign subsidiaries and tax planning strategies implemented during 2009 we had improvements to our effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and for the full year.  Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 42.1% compared with 53.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  For the full year our effective income tax rate was 42.3% compared with 45.3% in 2008.  ", "Our resulting net income in the fourth quarter was up 83% to $15 million compared with $8 million in the prior year period.  Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.30 compared with $0.17 in the prior year an improvement of approximately 76%.  Net income increased 22% for the full year to $47 million compared with $38 million in 2008.  Diluted earnings per share for 2009 was $0.92 compared with $0.76 in the prior year.", "As we have noted in previous quarters we continue to focus on strengthen our balance sheet and improving our working capital efficiency.  These efforts continue to pay off resulting in total cash and cash equivalents increasing over $85 million year-over-year to $187 million at year end.  Cash net of debt increased $111 million to $167 million at yearend.  We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility.", "Net accounts receivable decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis.  This came as a result of our conservative approach to credit terms during 2009, the strong efforts of our collections team and the fact that our direct to consumer business was a higher percentage of our overall business.  Inventory at quarter end decreased 19% year-over-year to $148 million compared to $182 million at the end of 2008.  This improvement in inventory efficiency year-over-year was driven by increased demand for our product in the fourth quarter 2009, increased liquidations of excess inventory during the year and continued improvements to our inventory management from systems and processes implemented during 2009.", "Our investment in capital expenditures for the year was $25 million compared with $41 million in 2008.  Our previous outlook was for 2009 cap ex to be in the range of $30 to $35 million.  Capital expenditures were lower than anticipated in 2009 primarily due to the shift in timing of some investments in our distribution facilities and IT infrastructure. ", "Now, moving on to our full year outlook for 2010; previously we provided an outlook of 2010 net revenues and EPS growth in the high single to low double digits.  Given our current visibility we are raising the low end of our outlook and now anticipate 2010 annual net revenues in the range of $945 to $960 million an increase of 10% to 12% over 2009.  2010 diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in line with net revenue growth.  ", "It is also important to note that both net revenues and EPS in 2010 are expected to have first half second half seasonality similar to that of 2009.  We expect our top line growth in 2010 to be fueled by continued strength in direct to consumer as well as higher growth in our US wholesale apparel channel.  US wholesale apparel growth accelerated in the fourth quarter and based on current bookings and feedback from our accounts, we believe our US wholesale apparel sales will continue to be a point of strength in 2010.  ", "As Kevin and David mentioned earlier, our focus in 2010 for footwear is to continue to excel in the cleated category while taking a conservative approach to the running and training categories to better position ourselves for new product in 2011.  As a result of this approach, we are planning footwear revenues to be down in 2010 with the most significant dollar impact incurring in the first and third quarters.", "As Kevin and David both stated, we are in the footwear business for the long term.  As a business we have many levers for growth and we believe that this prudent strategy best positions us for the future.  Driven by the product mix shift towards apparel and the continued anticipated growth in our higher margin sales and direct to consumer, gross margins are planned to be improved in all four quarters of 2010 over 2009.  ", "In 2010 we will continue to invest in areas of our business we feel are important to drive near and longer term results.  We see these investments impacting our selling, general and administrative expenses in four critical areas of our business.  First, we will continue to invest in marketing in the range of 12% to 13% of net revenues.  Second, within the selling cost area we will continue to invest in direct to consumer, specifically around factory house and global direct online.", "As David stated direct to consumer will be one of the primary drivers of our 2010 growth as we are planning the addition of 15 new factory housed stores and also anticipate incrementally investing in our online website.  The third area of our investment focus will be around product innovation and supply chain as we continue to build the team that will innovate, design, develop and bring to market Under Armour products in 2010 and beyond.  Fourth, we will have increased investments in information technology around analytical tools to support the growth of our company longer term.", "With these investments to support our growth, SG&A is expected to exceed our top line growth in 2010.  We believe these investments are the key to building the growth platform to provide accelerated profitable growth in future years.  Based on continued tax planning strategies, we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to improve approximately 50 basis points from the 2009 rate of 43.2%.  We anticipate fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 51.1 million to 51.3 million for 2010.", "Now, a quick outlook for a few key balance sheet items in 2010.  We anticipate that the seasonality of our cash balance in 2010 will be consistent with prior years with the second and third quarters having the lowest cash balances for the year.  Our key inventory metric remains turns and we will continue to drive improved inventory efficiency in 2010 while also balancing the important needs to service customer demand.  For 2010 including the impact of shifting some investments from 2009 to 2010, capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to be in the range of $35 to $40 million.  ", "We are proud of our accomplishments in 2009 but as we have stated in the past, we have  many opportunities to improve gross margin and operating efficiency and these will be a focus of our business as we head in to 2010 and beyond as we strive to reach our long term targets.  At this time we would now like to open the call for your questions.   We ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I actually have a couple of questions.  First, David you were talking about some of the distribution opportunities for the brand as you think about apparel growth opportunities out there across the region for the Under Armour brand.  You talked a lot about the direct side, can you give us a little bit more color on outside of direct and your wholesale businesses how we should be thinking about some of those opportunities?", "David W. McCreight ", "As you may have noted from earlier calls when we look at the brand we see just great strength in the brand but we also see gaps in our distribution and we\u2019re very proud of our existing partnership and believe we are going to continue to grow with our existing partners in wholesale and that is going to be our primary target for growth and as you had just mentioned we think direct to consumer we are going to then deploy that as a lever to fill in some of the gaps.", "But, as we look across the landscape and looking at where athletes are and where they are being under severed we are going to find areas that our current partners don\u2019t fill in those gaps.  A good example is the pacific northwest where due to some bankruptcies in 2009 and even before that some lack of penetration we went, studied the market, evaluated our opportunities and identified a very good potential future partner like Fred Meyer to fill in that gap.", "But, that solves a very specific geographic need and that\u2019s not a broad national opportunity.  In addition to that, we still know there\u2019s lots of opportunities in urban markets and we have still great opportunity to reach athletes in the malls and we\u2019re going to continue to work on solving that in 2010.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Do you think about Europe in terms of that distribution, some distribution opportunity there?  I don\u2019t know if you really highlighted in on the call?", "Wayne A. Marino ", "In terms of our European distribution I think we\u2019re really proud of what we\u2019ve achieved so far in Europe in terms of authenticity with Europe and we truly recognize that to be a global brand we\u2019re going to have to be relevant in both Europe and Asia one day.  But, our Europe strategy right now is to continue to build the equity that we have with our athletes on field.  One particular area that we\u2019ve done well with is youth and golf is another call out.  But, right now as far as Europe is concerned we will continue to refine our strategy but we\u2019ll really leverage on the investments that we\u2019ve made in the past and let them take route.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you also elaborate on the comment about repositioning training and footwear, what that means and how we should think about that?", "Kevin A. Plank ", "Let me spend a minute on footwear if I could and just dive a little deeper there.  David and I were pretty clear in speaking through the five growth levers that we have as a company giving us the ability to lean heavier on any one during any particular quarter or phase of our growth.   What we did in 2009 I think was evident of our ability to pull on footwear and pull on the direct to consumer and as we mentioned heading forward to 2010 with the reacceleration that we\u2019re seeing in our apparel business and again, as David mentioned around our distribution strategy again leaving us opportunity.", "The one thing about footwear is first of all we are absolutely committed to it.  We absolutely see momentum in it.  The idea about repositioning is just making sure I think that we\u2019re spending time prudently to invest in the right leadership and continue to bring on the right amount of talent.  We want to focus I think this year on being excellent in the categories that we are in, taking advantage of momentum that we built and established in things like our cleated business and again, football cleats and baseball cleats we\u2019ll sell more pairs this year.  Our market share will grow this year and you\u2019ll see more consumers and more kids on field wearing and participating in that product.", "Our training and running programs though, that\u2019s where we want to really reposition and I think you\u2019re really going to see a big coming out party for us in 2011 but again it says that 2010 is that we\u2019ve got good product in the marketplace and our distribution continues to support us.  You\u2019re not going to see a drastically different presentation at retail either this year.  So we didn\u2019t see any surprises in Q4 that really changed our position in the way that we saw footwear. ", "We feel really good about where we are and more importantly we feel really great about where we\u2019re heading.  The last thing is what we\u2019re doing as we look at some of the new categories too.  2010 for us is a year that we really want to use to become excellent in the categories where we\u2019re doing.  Cleated is a great example.  ", "We\u2019ve come back and taken a fresh look at training and really bolster that category as well as the same thing in running is that we want to offer the consumer \u2013 one thing we found in 2009 is that consumers are highly adapt at looking at what the price to value relationship is and we want to make sure that comes through from our supply chain, our sourcing, our development and of course great looking product that actually performs at the retail shelf.  We have all hands on deck and absolutely are committed to becoming excellent in this category going forward.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kate McShane \u2013 Citi.", "Kate McShane \u2013 Citi", "I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color around the wholesale apparel growth in the fourth quarter?  How much of your sales growth do you think is being pulled forward because retailers were a bit light on inventory and do you think that\u2019s a phenomena that will continue throughout 2010?", "Kevin A. Plank ", "Kate, as we said we had really strong performance in Q4.  Certainly last Q4 we left some opportunity on the table with our partners but in general we\u2019re seeing really strong core base growth out of it.  It is more than restocking and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so bullish as we look to 2009 in apparel.  The distribution levers, the growth within existing floor space and share we\u2019re gaining with our existing partners new product introductions, we feel very strongly about with both the balance in wholesale and direct to consumer driving very strong results for apparel in 2010.", "David W. McCreight ", "With that Kate too the emphasis that we put on inventory in 2009 is one of the things that had us with inventory being down 19% over the year as well we look and say we\u2019re really well positioned as a company and we think that going forward as our systems really begin to take hold and we become better I think positioned as a brand and just better at forecasting some of the other things that there is of course additional upside as we get better at what we do.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "On the balance sheet it was very nice to see the inventory improvement.  Related to this, I have a couple of questions about the outlook.  15 new outlet stores that\u2019s better than 40% door expansion on the outlets.  Given where the inventory position is it seems like the outlet strategy is about more than just profitable inventory management.  How much of the revenue you\u2019re doing through the outlets is currently from first run products versus excess inventory?  Then, a follow up to that, what are you hearing from key channel partners like Ed Stack about the outlet strategy?", "David W. McCreight ", "As we look at it and go forward where we\u2019ve made changes we think it remains a very viable portion of our apparel business in terms of providing a prudent vehicle for liquidation.  But, we\u2019re also seeing opportunities to manage the brand experience, complete size ranges, color ranges and ensure the experience for 365 days a year is what Under Armour athletes expect in that location.  We\u2019ve partnered and communicated very closely with our key partners about our growth plans and they are aware of where we go geographically.  It\u2019s a partnership.", "Wayne A. Marino ", "In terms of where our partners are it is first and foremost they\u2019re committed as to what\u2019s the growth brand for Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods or The Sports Authority or anyone else.  So, we\u2019re highly keen on putting together plans that continue to grow the Under Armour presence and more importantly grow their overall business.  It is not about where else we\u2019re showing as much as how we\u2019re affecting and impacting their business.  So that\u2019s our commitment to them and I think 2009 was a great example of our ability to deliver that to them as well.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Are you doing specific things to differentiate the product that you are representing in the outlet channel versus what is represented at retail with wholesale partners?", "David W. McCreight ", "Yes we are.  It\u2019s different product but it\u2019s still first grade high quality product that\u2019s going out in the marketplace.  But also, don\u2019t think of it as the outlets being the primary focus, it\u2019s really a multipronged strategy between wholesale, direct to consumer being on our online web superstore that we\u2019re going to continue to build and the factory housed stores filling in that last component.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Final question about this, Brad as you project this out how does growth in the contribution of outlet stores impact the return on invested capital versus the alternative growth vehicles?", "Brad Dickerson ", "Obviously direct to consumer in total is one of our best return on invested capital models that we have.  Factory housed specifically again, a very strong return on invested capital.  When you look at factory housed obviously higher gross margins on the overall business but you also do have some increased selling, general and administrative expenses to run those stores and that has been a call out as to why our sales costs have increased year-over-year is really the build out of those stores.  But overall, from an operating margin perspective, they are very positive to our business and from a return on invested capital they are one of our best models in the business.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a follow up question on the wholesale outlook for 2010.  I don\u2019t know if you guys could maybe speak to it this way for us.  When you are looking for good growth in 2010, can you break it up in to sort of in your view how much you think 2010 there is still restocking going on in apparel versus new product introductions versus new doors?  I think you guys mentioned Fred Meyer, when would that be rolling in?  Then, can you also give us sort of a feel for how you think that is going to break out men\u2019s wholesale apparel growth versus women\u2019s wholesale apparel versus youth?  That would be I think incredibly helpful for all of us?", "David W. McCreight ", "Coming off of a strong Q4 and 13% growth in 2009 and with the line of site we have with our partners and future bookings, we\u2019re seeing strong growth in our wholesale apparel business both through new products, additional doors and additional floor space within additional doors.  We\u2019ve reviewed the line and both our partners and ourselves feel very confident on what we are going to deliver in terms of results in 2010.

We think what\u2019s going to happen with our direct to consumer, wholesale and online and factory housed stores will be equally balanced.  It\u2019s not overly weighted on one side or the other.", "Men\u2019s, women\u2019s and kid\u2019s are all showing growth.  We\u2019ve discussed earlier we believe there is opportunity to continue to grow men\u2019s apparel in North America and not to mention apparel at large.  Men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth will all be growing substantially in the year.", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Does one standout pretty dramatically for 2010?  So for example I know you guys really talked about women\u2019s a lot heading in to \u201909.  Would you say that \u201910 is going to be more balanced between those three than it was in \u201909?", "David W. McCreight ", "Women\u2019s will continue to lead the pack followed by youth and men\u2019s.", "Kevin A. Plank ", "Rob just let me follow on real quick of just compression versus loose and I think people understand that as we get and build out a better \u2013 we move beyond where compression dominate our business, we actually sell more loose product today than compression.  But, we still see compression growing for us, we still see opportunity growing for us.  I mentioned the core short in my script plus innovating at the core and being able to really reach and explain that and lead for our consumer.", "But also, the loose fitting product is something that is a real differentiating driver for us across all channels between men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth.  Fitted has been a big opportunity for the company where we\u2019ve gone from frankly one compression and one loose fit to now we have compression, we have fitted, we have semi fitted and we have loose so we\u2019re really drilling in to the things that are relevant to our consumer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Kevin, just following up on the compression point I think I\u2019ve heard up to recently you were still about 40% compression product.  How do you think about the right ratio between compression and non-compression?  Ultimately is there some trade off as the non-compression grows or is it all incremental?", "Kevin A. Plank ", "I don\u2019t think so.  We like organic growth and look we began as a compression brand but I don\u2019t think that defines Under Armour as much as being a performance brand.  So whether it\u2019s compression, whether it\u2019s loose apparel or frankly, some of these new categories that we\u2019ve found where the brand has the right or the ability to enter, call it footwear.  In our fourth or fifth year now that we have established ourselves and are growing market which you will see happen as we are in the process of repositioning training and running, we\u2019re going to be successful there and making sure that we authenticate ourselves in the right categories like basketball.", "So how your question evolves in to how can we be relevant in to entering the basketball category someday, we\u2019re going to earn the right.  We\u2019re going to wait for the consumer to demand that we\u2019re there and we think more importantly that we have a strong point of view that gives the consumer a value proposition, an equity proposition of what we\u2019re being able to deliver to them that is unique and different.", "Our job is to innovate and I think you\u2019ll see us do that at the very tip of the sphere but our job is also to elevate those base layer entry price points.  2009 was really defined by discounting product and I think if you walk in and you saw the way Under Armour was positioned in the store there wasn\u2019t wholesale selling off of Under Armour versus some of our competitors.  The fact that we were able to not only maintain but in some cases grow market share in that environment I think is a real testament of not only the brand that we\u2019ve built but more importantly the momentum that we have going forward.  We feel very, very good about our position in apparel and I think everyone gets excited about what that growing wholesale apparel can mean for us.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is there a magnitude as we think about the non-compression piece if it\u2019s 60% today should it be 80% over time, should it be 70%?", "Kevin A. Plank ", "I think base layer and layering in general is almost a new phenomena.  The way that people dress is not putting on a big jacket and going out as much as people are smarter about what layering can mean to them.  We think there is almost an untapped market that we\u2019re continuing to uncover in base layer as a whole.  I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re as specific as saying or mandating that we need to be X percentage of compression versus X percentage loose.  There are obviously a lot more people wearing loose product or capable of wearing loose product than are capable of wearing compression product.", "That\u2019s not a vision that we have someday of everyone walking around in form fitting clothes but we do want people walking around in better clothes.  We do think that people can think and expect more from their apparel than just the color block or the design on the front as what drives someone to wear it.  We think that what you\u2019ll see from Under Armour is that our job is to be the thought leaders of all things apparel, of all things footwear.", "But really in what we are investing in on the research and development side is what other next grade technologies around product and particularly around apparel that we can lead.  So long story short we\u2019re proud of our market position in compression, we\u2019re not exceeding compression to now becoming a loose fitting brand.  We think we continue to lead on the compression side, in fact we think that the authenticity and more importantly the smarts we developed from understanding compression gives us great credibility and capability of developing great loose fitting product as well. So we\u2019ll continue to push on all fronts there.", "Michelle Tan \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then a question on gross margin just quickly, it seemed like there was a lot of opportunities in the quarter from the mix benefit of direct, deflation, the discounting that happened when the world was collapsing last year so help us think about what some of the offsets were this quarter and then magnitude of the kind of increases you\u2019re thinking about for 2010?", "Brad Dickerson ", "When you look at the quarter we called out direct to consumer being a big driver to the upside of our margins year-over-year.  That was about a 70 basis point impact, direct to consumer.  Everything else in the quarter for the most part there was some impact here up and down but it was pretty small and minor compared to the direct to consumer impact to the upside for the quarter.", "When you look to the full year, next year and going forward we\u2019ve talked all along about what drives our gross margins of the business.  Obviously direct to consumer is a big benefit to our margins on the upside with direct to consumer as it continues to grow.  So as we\u2019ve talked about a big growth driver for us in 2010 is direct to consumer and direct to consumer business is very strong in the back half of the year so there should be a benefit to the upside of our margins year-over-year.", "On the flip side of that, we talked about footwear being lower margins than our overall margins in our business.  Obviously 2009 we had a lot more footwear with the entry in to run.  We talked about footwear being down on the top line year-over-year for 2010.  That will have a positive impact to gross margins in 2010 also.  So that\u2019s why we called out the fact that we see our margins being improved in all quarters in 2010.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Another question on the wholesale apparel distribution for 2010.  As you look out after you\u2019ve added doors and expanded distribution within your existing customers do you expect a meaningful exchange in the A, B, C type quality composition of the doors your distributing for 2010?", "David W. McCreight ", "No, we still see opportunity.  We really look at it by market and by customer and where they\u2019re located and we still see quite a bit of premium space and premium locations that we\u2019re not distributing.  So, we\u2019re still very bullish.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then I know earlier it was still discussed that the mall doors continued to be an opportunity.  Can you talk about how that expansion in the mall will work with a little bit more of a conservative approach to footwear?  Is apparel going to fill the space in the mall doors or is it just greater door expansion with your mall partners?", "David W. McCreight ", "We think it\u2019s ultimately going to become a combination of the brands and our drivers in footwear and apparel that\u2019s going to fill the void in the mall doors.  You\u2019re going to see that take shape as the product is ready and matures and we reposition footwear.  We also see opportunities for accessories down the road as well.", "Chi Lee \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Lastly, with inventories being down 19% at the end of the fourth quarter, will there be any restrains to what apparel can grow at least in the first quarter in the near term?", "Wayne A. Marino ", "We\u2019re very proud of the inventory management that we\u2019ve had this year and the success in having the growth that we had in the top line and the improvement in inventory efficiency.  One of the strategies for next year is to continue to move forward with the inventory efficiency but also keep a very, very close eye on our fill rate.  So in certain categories this year we felt that demand outpaced our ability to supply.  Some of that is around the cold weather product and some around some training product.", "But, going forward in 2010 we\u2019re just going to be a little bit smarter about how we take positions in raw materials and positions in finished goods.  We\u2019re gearing up to certainly improve our fill rate and I think that is going to be a big plus for us as we move in to 2010 and we also have the efficiencies in place to manage through inventory and buy it smarter.", "Kevin A. Plank ", "Chi, let me jump on the last question too just again about distribution because I think we want to make sure that everybody really comes through with our message here on 2010 from a distribution standpoint.  One of the areas that David really prioritized when he joined the company was us getting around consumer insights and really talking and understanding our consumer.  Probably some of the things that blew us away as second tongue under the world Under Armour all that\u2019s at the table a lot of consumers out there haven\u2019t heard of us.", "More importantly, there are consumers who have heard of us but haven\u2019t had the access to the product.  So making sure that we can be in places where our consumer shops because frankly they\u2019re not shopping in some of the current places that we\u2019re selling today.  But, I want to be really clear about one point is that while we may be expanding some of our distribution we are absolutely not compromising either number one, our premium brand positioning or just as importantly our price integrity.", "Just because some of the places that we sell I think you will continue to see and of course a consistent branded and pricing strategy everywhere we go. Our message here is about reaching more consumers it is not about Under Armour taking a discounted approach to 2010 and changing anything about our business.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Michael Benetti] \u2013 UBS.", "[Michael Benetti] \u2013 UBS", "I was hoping you could just help me fine tune the comments you\u2019ve been talking about a little bit today.  It looks like inventory some of the cold weather and some of the fleece items ran pretty low in the quarter and we saw that with the cold weather coming through here in December and January on the east coast.  I think you mentioned that you were talking about the order book for fall 2010 with your retail partners and I was wondering if you would comment maybe a little bit more on how those conversations are going so far particularly whether you\u2019re seeing increases in orders for the high ticket fleece items to better match consumer demand next year.  Then I have a quick follow up.", "David W. McCreight ", "Both for our new introductions in the lines for spring and then the early discussions around fall have gone very well and that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us an additional confidence in the wholesale arm in addition to our direct to consumer side helping to drive greater share and really growing the apparel business in 2010.  We\u2019re seeing it again as I said earlier continued very strong growth in women\u2019s and gaining share in floor space there as well as Kevin alluded to earlier with increased developments in the core shorts, really expanding the pie and the reach through fitted product versus just compression and our great brand equity in kids.  We\u2019re going to see strength across the board.", "[Michael Benetti] \u2013 UBS", "So obviously, and you guys talked about this, you have some tough revenue comparisons lapping the shoe launch in the first quarter but maybe if the initial order book for the back half is looking strong do you think once we get pass the tough comparisons for the first quarter there could be an opportunity to get a little bit more optimistic in our models for the second half of the year?", "Brad Dickerson ", "When you look at the seasonality of revenues that we talked about, similar front half versus second half of the year but when you talk about quarters a little bit we did highlight the fact that running footwear in 2009 was prominent in the first quarter and third quarter of 2009.  So when you\u2019re looking at the comps of revenue growth even though front half second half is kind of the same percentage of revenue for the whole year I think Q1 and Q3 will have the most impact relative to comping footwear from a revenue perspective.", "[Michael Benetti] \u2013 UBS", "If I could ask just one last question, if you wouldn\u2019t mind giving us a little more detail on how you see I guess the three components that make up direct to consumer as growth vehicles maybe in 2010?  Obviously, those all have different levels of profitability even though they are all above corporate profitability.  Maybe you could just give us a little bit of help on the breakdown of that.", "David W. McCreight ", "We\u2019re seeing very strong double digit growth in our online business and we think we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that.  As I was saying earlier we believe that is going to be both a way to reach more athletes, shape their brand experience in a way that may not be currently served and provide strong financial returns as Brad discussed earlier.  We\u2019re also going to see continued very strong growth when you look at ending the year with a base of 35 factory housed stores and ending with 50 you can see it\u2019s going to drive material growth both in top line and we\u2019re going to see comp store growth from those markets as well with the existing 35 store base.", "Specialty, the third lever we have four stores currently.  We have no plans to open a store or roll out additional full price but we\u2019re going to continue to work on that in 2010 because we can see a time in which full price specialty roll out will help us add yet another lever to solve the distribution gaps and the way to bring an even different and richer brand experience.  But, that will be for the future.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from [Tabash Berry] \u2013 Jefferies & Company.", "[Tabash Berry] \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "I was hoping you guys could elaborate maybe on the visibility of the Under Armour brand as we head in to the Olympics next month?  Obviously I know you guys are obviously partnering with those high profile athletes but how should we expect to see or hear about the brand whether it\u2019s social events during the competition itself or on the podium?", "Kevin A. Plank ", "First of all the Olympics is our first real opportunity to tell I think a global story and we\u2019re taking advantage of our relationships that we have with a couple of different teams.  2010 was a little premature as a lot of these deals are done four or five years in advance but we were lucky enough to form a relationship with US Ski a while back and US Bobsled as well.  You\u2019ll see some other teams that will pop up from time-to-time for instance the number one curling team in the world is the Canadian team who will probably be outfitted in Under Armour at the upcoming Olympics.", "But, what you\u2019ll see on the teams that we\u2019re going to have is absolute innovation and we\u2019re really looking for a grassroots story.  We\u2019re very focused on what 2012 is going to mean for us, we\u2019re very focused on what the future is.  So, you\u2019re seeing Under Armour as we continue to \u2013 there are two decisions that we make when we look at making investments.  The first decision is first and foremost we protect what we have with 94% of our business coming from the United States today we continue to plant seeds internationally.", "Wayne mentioned Europe and Asia and China in particular and some of the other places that we are thinking about or looking at as we think globally.  We\u2019re currently doing business in more than 40 different countries today and we want to be careful about the investments that we\u2019re making there or the way that we\u2019re thinking about expanding globally.  But, for the most part it\u2019s protecting what we have.  ", "The second thing in the decision of the investments that we\u2019re making is ensuring that they are global decisions.  Our plan, our goal, our mission is to be a multibillion dollar global brand and what you see and what you\u2019ve heard about today is some of the investments in the foundation towards accomplishing that goal in the future.  So we haven\u2019t done everything, we continue to learn everyday but I think we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage and run a pretty good business.  It gets better and better every day.  We feel really good about the team that we have.  We feel very good about the team that frankly, we continue to build and put together and I think there\u2019s a lot of great upside and you\u2019ll see just a small part of that showcased in Vancouver this February.", "[Tabash Berry] \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "If I could ask a quick follow up for Brad, how should we think about marketing on a seasonal basis in to 2010?", "Brad Dickerson ", "When you look at SG&A in total I think as you look at the breakup between first half and second half in total it\u2019s going to be pretty similar to what we have in 2009.  Marketing may be skewed a little bit more towards the back half of the year only because in 2009 with the entry in to run we had a little bit more marketing spend in the front half of the year in 2009.  But, not significant change.", "Operator", "", "That concludes the question and answer session.  I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Plank for any additional or closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Plank ", "The Under Armour growth story remains pretty simple, our strong brand and our willingness to invest provide us with multiple levers to pull for long term growth.  Last year two of those levers footwear and direct to consumer drove our growth.  This year it will be wholesale apparel and our direct to consumer driving the growth story.", "Our balance sheet and inventory position are much improved versus a year ago and our team is deeper, more experienced and better prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that lay ahead.  Under Armour is a growth company and we are intensely focused on delivering against the promise of our brand.  We appreciate all of your time today.  Have a great day.", "Operator", "", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Alex Pettit, CFO [ph 0:04:24].", "Alex Pettit", "Thank you, and good morning to everyone participating in this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements contain [ph 0:04:40] uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the respective section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. ", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, who will address the drivers of our second quarter results and our strategy for continued growth in 2010 and beyond; Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the company's financial performance for the second quarter and provide an updated outlook for the year. After the prepared remarks, Kevin, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available for a Q&A session that will end by 9:30. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to cover two key topics. First, how we are continuing to lead in the performance apparel market to the right balance of great product and a great story. And secondly, how we are building the organization that will take us beyond the $1 billion platform that we discussed on this morning's release. ", "We have consistently talked about the abundant growth opportunities we see for the Under Armour Brand and how we are balancing that growth with making the right assessments to ensure we are doing two things: returning value to our shareholders and preparing our company for its next phase of growth.", "This past quarter, or more accurately, the first half of this year, is a great example of our ability to balance growth while investing and a great example of how much horsepower is contained in the Under Armour engine. Our Apparel business in the U.S. was up 32% year-to-date and up 34% in Q2, the strongest increase that we've seen in 10 quarters, going back to Q3 of 2007. ", "The best and simplest part of the apparel story is that everything was up, with strong double-digit growth across Men's, Women's and Youth. Our growth is across-the-board. Gender, channel, category, wholesale and direct. I'm going to talk about a couple of key areas of growth, but the fact that our strength is so broad-based is evidence not only of the growing power of our brand but of our ability to step confidently into the next phase in our growth story, a multi-billion-dollar global platform. ", "As I said last quarter, the growth story for Under Armour apparel is more than just intact. In fact, it's revitalized. Our Men's business continues to accelerate, with strong double-digit increases in our training, golf, football and underwear businesses. We believe there is still meaningful growth for our brand in all of these drivers as we build up our position as the thought leader in performance and bring Under Armour innovation to a broader range of consumers. ", "Our Women's business also accelerated in Q2 as our improved fit, style and color helped drive growth. Our Women's Training business almost doubled in Q2 and, along with underwear and base layer, made up the majority of our growth in Women's for the quarter. ", "The one common thread in both our Men's and Women's apparel business for the first half of this year has been the success of our fitted products. In both Men's and Women's, our fitted products, which provide the same functionality of compression materials without the constriction, gives us the opportunity to offer a broader range of silhouettes across key categories like base layer, golf and running, in both Men's and Women's.", "In addition, this fall, we're introducing a great new evolution of our ColdGear fabrication that is warmer, softer and also has a more generous fit that will bring more customers to the brand. This new high-performance moisture-wicking fabrication delivers great neck-to-skin warmth without the squeeze of compression. ", "Without question, fitted product will be an important driver for us in 2010, but longer-term, offering multiple fit options and introducing new fabrications like our Catalyst T-shirt, which is made from recycled water bottles, shows us that we can successfully reach new consumers with these new technologies and fits without cannibalizing our core compression business. This continued success will be a critical driver of our growth as we evolve into our multi-billion-dollar global platform.", "Another key to our long-term growth strategy is executing against the opportunity we have online, both from an e-commerce and consumer engagement perspective. When our consumer is not on the field, they're online, and we are working to improve our relationship with them there. ", "In the short term, that will mean more focused marketing efforts and enhancing access to our site on mobile devices. Over the longer term, we need to consistently upgrade the consumer experience in our online store so that we are growing along with our consumers\u2019 expectations, and that expectation is a robust Under Armour shopping experience online.", "On the brand communication front, we continued to spend our marketing dollars in a targeted way. This quarter, we broadened the reach of our \u201cProtect This House. I Will.\u201c campaign outside the football world using the likes of Michael Phelps, Lindsey Vonn and Georges St-Pierre, the world's best pound-for-pound mixed-martial-arts champion. On the field, the University of South Carolina Baseball Team won the College World Series wearing Under Armour, and starting this fall, Boston College and Tampa Universities will also be joining the Under Armour team. And as we build equity with new athletes on-field, we're seeing our brand grow in stature and popularity beyond the field as well. This is an ongoing part of our brand's expansion, and we'll continue building on this equity as the athletic brand of this generation.", "Outside the U.S., we continue to make solid progress, both in Europe, where we are building our base as a performance brand on-field through compression, and in Japan, where the Under Armour Brand has a great presence in the country's most important sport, baseball. In fact, nearly 25% of Japanese professional baseball players wear Under Armour beneath their uniforms, a great testament to our brand\u2019s ability to translate globally. Our growth in the Japanese market, where our brand is approaching $100 million in wholesale, is a great indicator of how Under Armour can bring the performance apparel story to athletes outside of the United States.", "Footwear will be a key long-term growth driver for Under Armour. We will deliver growth in our Footwear business in 2011. Equally important is that we are vesting today to ensure that growth in not only 2011 but beyond. We continue to build that long-term equity with our athletes with our football and baseball cleats, and we have become much more competitive on the retail floor in both Running and Training when we strike the right balance between price and value. Footwear is a long-term proposition for Under Armour, but one that we are continuing to invest in as our Apparel business continues to accelerate.", "Now finally, I'd like to talk about our structure and team. As we continue to lay the foundation of our growing business, we have moved to a more defined business unit structure that we believe will drive better accountability and create more opportunities for our teams to innovate. As we approach the $1 billion revenue mark, we are focused on bringing new talent into the organization, talent that will mesh with our existing leadership to provide the foundation for our multi-billion-dollar global platform. Since just our last earnings call, we have brought in Henry Stafford from American Eagle to run Apparel and John Rogers from Orvis to run e-commerce. With these two additions plus Gene McCarthy in sales [ph 0:12:17], and Edward Giard will take over our Accessory business for us, we now have well over 100 years of industry experience overseeing these key business units.", "I've said on a number of occasions that the Under Armour brand is about leadership. Leading on the field, leading in sell-through and leading and communicating with our consumer. With our U.S. Apparel business strong and gaining momentum, we are building a team that will take Under Armour to its place as a multi-billion-dollar global brand. ", "And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. With Kevin having taken you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time on our second quarter financial results.", "Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 24% to $205 million. Year-to-date, net revenues are up 19% to $434 million. This strong growth is largely driven by Apparel, which was up 34% to $150 million during the quarter and up 32% to $323 million year-to-date. ", "Notably, our second quarter Apparel performance was the highest growth we experienced since the third quarter of 2007. Double-digit Apparel growth was registered across the Men's, Women's and Youth apparel businesses during the quarter, with particular strength in Women's. ", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 60% for the quarter and 66% year-to-date, representing 21.3% and 19.6% of net revenues, respectively. Second quarter net revenue growth in Direct-to-Consumer was driven by a combination of new Factory House stores, strong same-store sales growth and the Web business. We opened six new Factory House stores during the second quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 45. We expect to end 2010 with 52 to 54 total Factory House stores, representing nearly 50% year-over-year growth.", "International net revenues increased approximately $2 million to $9 million in the second quarter and represent approximately 4% of revenues. Footwear net revenues were down roughly 4% to $36 million in the second quarter. We've previously indicated Running and Training footwear revenues were expected to decline in 2010 compared with 2009. ", "Second quarter gross margins were 48.8% compared with 44.8% in the prior year's quarter. Several factors contributed to the 400-basis-point gross margin expansion. First, we continue to see strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, contributing approximately 130 basis points. Second, we experienced more favorable Apparel gross margins during the quarter due to favorable product mix and sourcing efforts, accounting for approximately 120 basis points. Third, lower sale returns, markdowns and apparel liquidations accounted for approximately a 100-basis-point improvement. And finally, as previously forecast, a lower mix of lower-margin footwear sales contributed approximately 50 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 45.4% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with 42.7% in the prior year's period. Let me take you through the four major components of SG&A, many of which are consistent with our story last quarter. Marketing costs held relatively steady at 13.4% of net revenues in the second quarter compared with 13.3% in the prior year. Second, selling costs increased to 10.4% of net revenues from 9.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores, which carry better gross margins but also incur higher SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue. Third, product innovation and supply chain costs represented 10.8% of net revenues in the second quarter compared with 9.6% in the prior year. This increase was primarily a function of increased investments in personnel associated with the design and sourcing of our expanding apparel, accessories and footwear lines. Finally, corporate services increased to 10.8% of net revenues compared to 10.5% in the same period of the prior year as we invested in additional corporate personnel and facility expenses to support our growth. ", "Operating income during the second quarter more than doubled, to $6.9 million compared with $3.4 million in the prior year. Operating margin was 3.4% compared with 2.1% in the prior year quarter. ", "In other expense, we experienced only a modest net loss of $170,000 related to foreign currency during the quarter and a net loss of $850,000 year-to-date. Our hedging strategy allows us to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. With that said, there is no perfect hedge, and risk remains that with future currency fluctuations, we could have positive or negative foreign currency impact.", "Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 43% compared with 40.9% in the second quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting discrete items which positively impacted the year-ago rate. Based on continued tax-planning strategies, we now expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to improve approximately 120 basis points from the 2009 rate of 43.2%. Our resulting net income in the second quarter increased to $3.5 million compared with $1.4 million in the prior year period. Second quarter diluted earnings per share increased to $0.07 compared with $0.03 in the prior year. ", "Now shifting over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 96% to $156 million compared with $80 million at June 30, 2009. Cash, net of debt, increased $81 million at quarter end to $140 million compared with $59 million at June 30, 2009. We currently have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility. ", "Inventory at quarter end decreased 1% year-over-year to $179 million compared to $181 million at June 30, 2009. While inventory growth has significantly trailed our top line performance in recent quarters, we expect this trend to reverse for the back half of 2010. I will add more color on that later.", "Our invested and capital expenditures was approximately $8 million for the second quarter and approximately $16 million year-to-date. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures in 2010 to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million. ", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2010. Previously, we provided an outlook for 2010 net revenues in the range of $965 million to $985 million, an increase of 13% to 15% over 2009, and 2010 diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.07, an increase of 14% to 16%. Given the sustained strength in our Apparel and Direct-to-Consumer businesses and our improved visibility for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. We now expect 2010 annual net revenues in the range of $990 million to $1,010,000,000, an increase of 16% to 18% over 2009. We also expect 2010 diluted earnings per share for the full year in the range of $1.11 to $1.13, an increase of 21% to 23% over 2009.", "To give a little more context on our updated 2010 guidance, we want to elaborate on three areas: gross margins, SG&A and inventory. For gross margins, we still keep the same dynamics playing out that we've previously outlined. This includes higher year-over-year gross margins in the next two quarters, driven by product mix shift towards Apparel combined with continued anticipated growth in higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer sales. ", "We recognize the industry-wide concerns around higher labor input and freight costs for the remainder of 2010 and continuing into 2011. We would remind you that our product costs are largely locked in at this point through Spring 2011, so we see minimal near-term impact from input cost inflation. And with minimal apparel manufacturing exposure to China, we remain comfortable that growth in our Direct-to-Consumer channel should mitigate these headwinds in the near term.", "Looking at our SG&A, we continue to see higher near-term investments to support the infrastructure needed to build out our growth platforms. Importantly, this includes attracting new talent to support our business units, particularly in Footwear and Apparel. It includes building the infrastructure to bring the Hats and Bags business in-house starting in January 2011, an effort that yields no current revenues to absorb the incremental costs. It also means higher costs as we continue to expand our Factory House store base. As we indicated, we expect 17 to 19 new Factory stores in 2010, which will put us at 52 to 54 total Factory stores by year end. We would also expect comparable new store additions in 2011.", "As we have indicated, we expect our full year 2010 SG&A growth rate to exceed our net revenue growth rate and expect our year-over-year SG&A growth rates in the third quarter to look roughly similar to the growth rates for the second quarter. On a separate note regarding SG&A, we continue to invest marketing dollars prudently and maintain our annual target range of 12% to 13% of revenues. ", "On to inventory. As we indicated last quarter, we plan on increasing our safety stock in key core programs, which should improve our service levels within the wholesale channel to better meet consumer demand. In addition, several key program developments, including the shift of the Hats and Bags business in-house and the increase of our made-for [ph 0:22:34 ] strategy for Factory House stores will acquire an inventory build later in 2010. These factors are the major drivers for anticipated year-over-year inventory growth rates outpacing sales growth rates during the back half of the year. ", "While we are not prepared at this time to provide our initial outlook for 2011, we wanted to provide some color on the impact of bringing our Hats and Bags business in-house from our current licensing partner. As we have discussed, we have been investing on building the team internally to take this business in-house beginning in January 2011. With this transition, we expect this business to contribute an incremental $60 million of revenue for Under Armour in 2011 versus the existing license model.", "Before opening up the call for Q&A, I wanted to thank Alex Pettit for over three years of terrific service as the head of our Investor Relations team. As many of you know, Alex has recently broadened her role within the company, and we are excited to leverage her talent and industry knowledge towards new UA business opportunities. Thank you, Alex. ", "Over the next couple of months, Alex will be transitioning her Investor Relations functions to our new Director of Investor Relations, Tom Shaw, who joined the company a few weeks ago. Tom most recently covered our company and industry as a senior self-led [ph 0:23:50] analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus here in Baltimore. ", "With that, we would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chi Lee from Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Question on the gross margin side. Of the 120 basis points that we saw coming from sourcing efficiencies as well as the Apparel mix, how much on the sourcing-efficient [ph 0:24:32] side should continue into the following quarters?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. We lock our prices in about six to twelve months in advance. So obviously, the pricing that we're seeing right now was locked in last year. With some of the headwinds that have been talked about a lot out there in the industry, we will see somewhat of an impact of that in the future. But the biggest drivers of our gross margins in the near term and the longer term continue to be our Direct-to-Consumer business and the mix of footwear to apparel. So just strictly on the Apparel side, we don't anticipate seeing the improvements that we\u2019ve seen recently year-over-year in just Apparel, but we still see the ability to maintain our margins in the near term within Apparel.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then, Kevin, with some of your retail partners talking about starting to showcase some basketball product in the current quarter, can you just update us on your thoughts in terms of timing and strategy on the basketball side?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, well, basketball, first of all, it's not an \u201cif\u201d as much as it\u2019s a \u201cwhen\u201d for us. We've been out in the market testing product, and you've seen it between our AU programs, more than 10 Division 1 teams, 20 high school teams and of course, star rookie last year Brandon Jennings for the Milwaukee Bucks. So we think we have a lot of assets to build on. And I think what you're going to find about basketball, while we're not making any decorations of timing right now, what you will see from us, hopefully, is all the learnings that we\u2019ve found in footwear over the last five years. And hopefully, we will apply a lot of those learnings that I think we've learned and we, frankly, have paid for into our approach into the basketball category. So we're tempering words like launch, we're tempering the way that we're going to get in the market. But when we do, we expect that to take [ph 0:26:16] meaningful market share, and I think we'll let the numbers and the results prove exactly how we define \u201cmeaningful\u201d.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And presumably, then, what you're looking at in terms of the third quarter strategy is really just again testing consumer tastes with limited product?", "Kevin Plank", "I mean, again, we're going to approach basketball when the time is right and make that decision when we come across it, so\u2026", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Less inventory in the model, can you comment on how service levels have been trending? And maybe the opportunity to meet more demand by increasing the inventory balances some?", "Wayne Marino", "Jim, this is Wayne. Service levels have been acceptable to a point, but we think there's going to be a greater opportunity if we provide some additional safety stock within our core programs. Our core programs, for example, are offered mainly throughout the year. We feel that's a very deliberate debt on our part. To increase that, we broadened our core programs as well. So one of the strategies in the near term is to increase that safety stock level, and that will have an impact on the inventory levels that Brad mentioned.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Is that a third quarter phenomena? Or is it really something that you're looking at into spring of next year?", "Wayne Marino", "We'll start to see that, Jim, in the third and fourth quarter this year.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, recognizing that the past three years have been anything but normal, what's the maturity curve that you've seen on the Factory House stores? And then related to that, looking to the back half of the year, given the growth in Factory House stores, would you expect stronger year-to-year growth in the fourth quarter?", "Wayne Marino", "Yes, this is Wayne, let me start that. The basis for the Factory stores initially was to liquidate our excess inventory. And then, what we did was we learned that there was a consumer out there that we could reach. We really take a lot of effort in building around our core customer base first, and we'll add consumers who we\u2019d like to reach with other points of distribution. We're finding that the Factory House is another opportunity, another point of distribution to reach other athletes. As we continue to expand the factory base, we're certainly not going to have enough excess inventory to be able to fill that demand, so we'll start to move towards a made-for [ph 0:28:48] model. But the Factory stores really balance out our ability to reach that athlete in places that we don't reach him today.", "Kevin Plank", "And Jim, Kevin. Some of the numbers that we have, we\u2019ve opened 10 stores year-to-date. We\u2019re on track to open a total of 17 to 19 new Factory House stores this year. And we're very selective in looking for the opportunities that meet our specific criteria that we have for opening. But with that, we're still, by the year end, we'll be in the 40s in terms of the total number of stores that we have, in the high 40s, and that leaves us, I think, a lot of opportunity to continue to grow there. But as Wayne mentioned, made-for [ph 0:29:25] is something that, as we get into this, is an opportunity for us, I think, to be a little more efficient in viewing outlet as something more than just liquidating product, to give our consumers a better experience. Because frankly, it's one of the best brand experience they have, in addition to some of our key retail partners that where you come and see Under Armour shops. But it's the one opportunity that we have to tell a comprehensive story to the Under Armour consumer, which we just don't get many opportunities to do that. So it's a big area of an investment. It's an important story to be told to our consumer.", "Wayne Marino", "Jim, one last point on your question around the back half of the year revenue growth. My answer is maybe in a broader context, but obviously, we did see pretty strong revenue growth, particularly on Direct-to-Consumer channels, in the back half of last year. So the comp in the back half of this will be a little bit tougher than it was in the font half of this year because of that. And in addition, we've been calling out all along that the biggest impact of the decline in footwear year-over-year when it happened in the first quarter, which we saw, and also in the third quarter of this year too. So that also has an impact on the back half of the year comps.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I see. And so I'm thinking about the number of new Factory House stores that you have and trying to get my arms around how they ramp from, say, year one to year two. What type of comps or increase have you seen in stores that are just entering the comp base?", "Wayne Marino", "Jim, this is Wayne. We're not going to go into specifics about comp store sales. What we can say is, the factory outlets have been a very additive piece to our gross margins and also very positive in terms of profitability, and they also have a very favorable return-on-cash model. So it's, as Kevin pointed out, one of the strategies for us that we will consider within our Direct-to-Consumer strategies.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Seems like it\u2019s been a big driver.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Kevin, I wanted you to expand a little bit around your opening comments on the organization structure and the reporting lines in light of David McCreight\u2019s departure. What's changed, or how is the organization changing in terms of how you're viewing the best way to structure the management teams? And which businesses are reporting in to you versus Wayne or other people? And also, if you could comment on rumblings of a cotton-based product and the fact that it might open up kind of the whole new casual market to you guys and to the Under Armour brand?", "Kevin Plank", "So first of all, when David joined the company two years ago, we were in a much different place, and I think it's important that we let everyone know how much better of a company, how much better structured and organized we are, of a company today because of the team that we've been able to build and put in place. And David was an important part of that. With that being said, we made a decision to realign the organization for what was better, I think, to get accountability from the different business units that we built. And so, roughly, there's nine different business units that we have as an organization, and the way that we're managing them is really in a monthly review format. And so it gives us the ability for executive committee. That includes Brad, Wayne and three or four other of our key executives here, where we bring the different heads of the business units in to come present their business. And in those meetings, you'll have the president of the business unit and then you\u2019ll also have their head of strategy, their head of finance, and they\u2019ll bring in whoever else they need to tell their story. And the way that we view those meetings is as simple as answering three questions. Tell us, number one, about how you're tracking for the year, tell us about how you\u2019re tracking for your 2013 plan. The second set of questions would be around structure and people. Is there anything, as we get bigger as an organization, that's slowing down? Requisitions sitting on desks, people that you need, people that you need to move to different parts of the organization? And third and probably most importantly, tell us the top five things you're working on to ensure that the organization stays aligned. As we\u2019ve grown, becoming from a pretty good North American wholesale apparel company into an organization that has a lot more complexity to it, bringing in Women's, bringing in footwear, we want to make sure that we leave accountability within business leaders that can drive their businesses but make sure it's all working in one song that works for the Under Armour brand. So I tell you, we've had it for the last several months, and it's been really effective, the way that we\u2019ve been running the company. So I think it's given great empowerment. Secondly, what both our consumers and our retailers, they\u2019ve come to expect Under Armour being about thought leadership when it comes to product, so any category that we enter is going to be a large, scalable business, because we like large, scalable businesses. And you're going to see us attack that with innovative products and higher price points. But you think you'll continue to see like in the fourth quarter us moving to a wider consumer base with things like our ColdGear product. It's a wheelhouse product for us, the franchise business for us in the millions of units, that has been only offered in compression. And the fact that we\u2019ve now offered that in a fitted silhouette and fitted style, we're opening ourselves up to more consumers. So I think what you're going to see from Under Armour going forward, I'll tell you, is that we'll be much more sensitive to the idea of opening up to a wider broad-based sets of consumers versus a consumer who can, frankly, handle wearing a compression T-shirt all the time.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. So does that mean cotton is no longer the enemy?", "Kevin Plank", "It means that performance is our friend, Omar, always.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "All right, great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Taposh Bari from Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just wanted to get a sense of what you're hearing from your retail accounts as we head into the fall season here. Just maybe talk about how you see your inventories positioned at retail. And maybe talk about if you're seeing any restocking at retail. Or just some thoughts about that. And I also just wanted to get just a quick follow-up on that accessories coming in-house. I appreciate the color there. I wanted to get a sense if any of that $60 million is going to be accretive to EPS for 2011. And if so, if you can maybe help quantify that.", "Wayne Marino", "Let me start off first, this is Wayne. As far as our inventories at retail, right now, we're having very strong results, as you can see, for the quarter and for year-to-date, up over 30%. And our inventories are in line at retail. In fact, there is still a strong demand for us to increase our fill rates to our retail partners, which is one of the reasons we indicated earlier that we're going to take a greater position within our key and core items as far as inventory in the third and fourth quarters. So I say we're well positioned and in good shape as we get into the second half of the year.", "Brad Dickerson", "Taposh, this is Brad. On the accessories question, as you mentioned, $60 million accretive top line year-over-year in 2011. Right now, it's a little too early for us to talk about any kind of outlook or guidance for 2011 in general, but part of the criteria about bringing the licensing in-house, along with looking at the products and synergies with our other product lines, is the economics of that business. So just to tell you that we would look at that, and we would expect accretive operating income dollars to bring that in-house. But at this point in time, too early to talk about 2011 EPS.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michelle Tan from Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "I know you guys don't want to get too much into 2011, but I was wondering if you can give us any sense of, as we think about the SG&A investments behind some of these initiatives like footwear and taking the licenses in-house, how much of it is being front-loaded into 2010 and leverage-able for next year? Versus how much incremental spend you're going to anticipate for '11 as you bring these initiatives actually online?", "Brad Dickerson", "Hey, Michelle, this is Brad. To answer that, first of all, maybe if I can just go back and kind of reiterate the data points we did give you for 2011 so far, even though we're not giving any kind of outlook or full year outlook for guidance. A couple of data points we did give you, obviously, is on the Direct-to-Consumer side, relatively same number of new stores in 2011 that we had in 2010. And Kevin did mention Footwear will grow in 2011. And also, we talked, obviously, about bringing Hats and Bags in-house and the incremental revenue for that. As far as the SG&A related to those, I think you look at our SG&A and look at what's the ROI near-term versus maybe longer term in some of these businesses. Obviously, on the Apparel side, we're seeing a lot of benefit from our investments over the last few years currently, and we'll see that benefit in the near term too, especially around our wholesale apparel and our Direct-to-Consumer. You\u2019ve seen some benefits there. As far as costs in 2010 that are for the benefit of the future, I think obviously, we've talked about increasing our investment in the Footwear team and the Footwear business, and we've also talked about the Footwear revenues coming down in 2010. So obviously, with Footwear growing again in 2011, you would see that there\u2019s a benefit on the Footwear side going into 2011. From an Accessories perspective, obviously, we've been building the team in-house over the last 18 months or so to bring the Hats and Bags business in-house. So obviously, there is some cost over the 18-month period of an investments that had no revenue attached to it that will have revenue in 2011.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "Great. And thinking about both of those teams, I mean, is the majority of the build out in terms of personnel happening this year? So you wouldn't need to necessarily add a lot of people, add a lot of headcount to manage those businesses as the revenues come online? Or is it something where it\u2019s kind of a two-year process to build up those teams?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. I think that there's an ongoing investment that\u2019s needed with all of our teams, obviously, with our growth rate and our growth trajectory. There's a constant need to bring talent in-house and investing our businesses, so even though we do see some maybe heavier investment here over the last couple of years, we'll continue to see investments drive our business going forward.", "Michelle Tan - UBS", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Actually, two questions. The first question was just, you mentioned the new ColdGear fabrication and also on the cotton apparel that I think a lot of us were expecting to see in spring 2011. Are these programs mainly targeting existing customers? Or would these be opportunities for you guys to broaden your distribution into accounts that you're not dealing with? And then, the second question is just, if you could comment at all on the Youth apparel business momentum versus Men's and Women's? It sounds like you flagged Men's and Women's, and then when I listened to the programs that you're coming out with, in maybe cotton or the ColdGear program that you mentioned, might be more targeted towards adult versus youth? And if you do expect your business to skew towards that demographic.", "Kevin Plank", "Hey, Robbie, it's Kevin, so let me start with the categories we've commented on. So Fitted ColdGear, to begin with, I think it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. And number one, building around the franchises that we have, I think, leveraging the places where the consumer expects us. ColdGear is one of those obvious places, it's almost become a brand in and of itself, that a consumer walks in the store and they refer to ColdGear, frankly, as the brand. And so in doing that, we realized that there are the large consumer base that we weren't hitting by just offering compression. And so, part of the logic that we actually -- we baited this spring with our HeatGear and Fitted HeatGear. And we have the same concerns I think the market does. When you offer fitted product, what does it do to cannibalize the existing business? And the good news there, it actually did nothing. We grew the overall pie as the business and we're selling more base layer products. And so, I think we've changed some of our vernacular internally as a company, from saying, \u201cWe're a compression business,\u201d to, \u201cWe are a base layer business where we want to be dominant.\u201d And that means not in just one fit but in multiple fits. And so, number one, never giving any ground and continue to own compression, but also, I think, attracting new consumer by offering them someone who isn\u2019t interested in having it suctioned to their body in a compression shirt and giving them a little more room to breathe in the shirt. And frankly, that's not influenced just by the fact that I'm getting older, either. Secondly, so we see that in we've done in Fitted HeatGear, our $25 basic all year long and now, having Fitted ColdGear, I think you\u2019ll continue to see that trend where we just become a little more aware of what the market is looking for. And in fact, we're moving to multiple fits like we've done in our Women's business. We're also doing the same thing in our Men's business, from a compression fitted, a loose and a semi-fitted, fits across the board. So you'll see roughly four fits from the company. And again, it's about attracting new consumers there. With regard to our Youth and our Men's and our Women's biz, number one, Youth continues to be a huge driver for us. When you look at the places that we\u2019ve seen and had success, particularly Footwear is a great example of that, some of our biggest successes come out of our entry and in our relevance with the Youth consumer. Europe is another place where we\u2019ve found that when we enter a market, we really resonate with that Youth consumer and driving around brands that matter. So we don't see any weakness in our Youth. In fact, as we've aligned and begun to put our business units together, Youth will get a renewed vigor and focus, because we see that the big opportunity that I think the company has yet to really capitalize on.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Terrific.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "As Women's continues to be one of your strongest, if not the strongest category, and growth in Apparel, I'm just curious kind of what you're learning about how that female consumer shops for Under Armour? Is she shopping at different places? And how maybe the product choices of that consumer is influencing the design of the product going forward. So just any learnings that you're getting from the Women's side of the business?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, well, five years ago, when, I think, we went on our road show and we talked about having five distinct growth categories and growth levers for business, and it was Men's Apparel, Women's Apparel, Footwear, international and direct consumer. And part of the strategy we mentioned is that we envision a day where Women's would actually be larger than Men's, which I think a lot of people didn\u2019t, frankly, believe. And until you see the momentum that we've been able to put around our business today, it's really beginning to come to life. An example I use is of our recent line review, and this is, I guess, more than five or six weeks ago now. As we're came and we were looking at spring '11 we started getting the first rounds of fall \u201911 products, and in the room, it wasn't a team of one product person building products for Women's. It's a comprehensive team that\u2019s includes both product and marketing and sales and across the board, where we\u2019ve really done the things and put the infrastructure in place to become a relevant Women's brand. And that doesn't happen overnight. And I think the last five years have been good learning for us, but what I can tell you is that the excitement that we\u2019ve generated not only, I think, in some of the fall '10 product that's out on the floor and just hitting right now, we feel very good about. And what you're going to see in spring '11 is even better. So most importantly, I think our head of sales in the West Coast, she put it really well for me. She said, \u201cKevin, you remember three or four years ago when I said, \u2018The problem with our Women's is we just don't have a point of view.\u2019?\u201d She said, \"Well, today, we have a point of view on Women's.\" And I think we\u2019re very proud of that, and I think we\u2019re excited about what that\u2019s going to mean for us. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest there, and I think it's a fantastic product that has a unique positioning to the market.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "As a follow-up to that, in which channel is your Women's next to highest?", "Kevin Plank", "I mean, it's sporting goods, is where we've seen the biggest impact. But I think that's pretty good. We have not been, from a distribution standpoint on the Women's side, there is more opportunity for us to find and to sell in places where women shop. I think in the past and, number one, that means helping our existing retailers drive more women to their stores, to see that as a women's destination, but we do think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to find and be in more relevant distribution as well, which is another task, another opportunity that we have in front of us.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. Great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "With such strong demand for your product, can you talk about any challenges you have experienced with freight? And have you had to resort to air shipping to meet some of this demand?", "Wayne Marino", "Kate, this is Wayne. I think Brad touched upon it. As far as input costs, which has been a conversation that's been out recently, we've been committed for the next six to twelve months, so we feel pretty good about our input cost, our total cost, as it relates to our season through spring '11. As far as freight costs, there\u2019s no doubt that the cost to move product has been increasing. Air freight is not something that we use on a regular basis. It would be an exception basis. So we're certainly able to weather whatever increases that we've seen in the marketplace. I think the key point in terms of costs, and then Brad was really key on nailing this, would be our Direct-to-Consumer business and how that impacts our overall gross margins has really been the key lever for us in offsetting some of the increases that could be creeping up in logistics.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And then my other question, I think the number is that you have UA shop-in-shops at Dick's that only represents about 60% of Dick\u2019s stores. Can you update us on how many more shop-in-shops we can see in Dick\u2019s stores in 2010? And how maybe they\u2019ll look differently from what you currently have in Dick\u2019s? And also, what role will UA be playing in the new Sports Authority stores?", "Kevin Plank", "So I think when we go to Dick's, a couple of years ago, we invented and we went around a program called Under Armour City that we invested at Dick's Sporting Goods. And as we built that out, I think there are a few legacy stores, particularly some of the old Galleon [ph 0:48:19] stores that weren't a part of the Under Armour City, which, again, the definition of what a shop is and what not a shop is, is not really defining of the amount of product that we have in the store or, frankly, the performance that we have in the store. And obviously, we see upside when we put in a shop. And it\u2019s one of the things, I think, that we've been very open with the entire Dick's team about, our wanting to have a committed presence in their stores. And so that's one of the things, of course, you'll see us working toward in this fall and particularly in spring '11 as well.", "Brad Dickerson", "And just to jump on that, one of the key growths for us would be comp store growth within existing shops. And we haven\u2019t fully taken advantage of the floor space that we we\u2019ve been able to invest in, in the last couple of years. So it's going to depend on the type of door and the presence that we have, but I just want to note that, especially within Men's and also in Women's, you'll start to see if you go into a shop that we don't always have all of our pictures on the space that we've built out. And that's one of the growth levers that we're going to see going forward.", "Kevin Plank", "I think, Kate, with regard to the Sports Authority, the new SA shops that they have in place, so the model there is less brands and more focused in higher-end product and story gelling [ph 0:49:35] in that smaller 10,000- to 15,000-square-foot range, and Under Armour, of course, will be one of the, I think, key brands that they\u2019re going to have in the store, give us an opportunity to feature some higher-end product and some things that you maybe wouldn\u2019t see in a traditional big-box format, either. So we wish them the best of luck and be very exciting if they open that new format.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Great, that\u2019s really helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays Capital.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital", "So, Kevin, understanding that this is more of an investment in your Footwear. But can you, perhaps, provide us with some color on how some of the new product launches are performing, particularly like the Fleet or the Captive? And what lessons you've been able to incorporate into those lines?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, well, I mean, one key thing about 2010 is we actually didn't launch anything this year. And part of our approach in the repositioning of Footwear for our brand was that we wanted to become excellent in categories that we're currently in today. And that means going back and, of course, beginning at the top, beginning with leadership and Gene McCarthy, who is still less than a year in the chair, and the one thing that people need to understand about Footwear as well is that there's an 18-month product calendar that takes place. And so, frankly, the impact Gene and his team is not something that's in the market today. And so while we feel very good about the product that we have out in the market in 2010, again, we've really taken a strong approach at balancing a price-to-value relationship with a product that we have in the market. And we're not waiting by any stretch, but we have, again, recalibrated our footwear. And it\u2019s something that, beginning in 2011 and throughout 2011 and, frankly, into 2012, you're going to begin to see what happens as Under Armour becomes dominant in footwear. And I say that with the confidence of an example, what we've done in Women's and the same reaction that people have and they said, \"How can you possibly become a Women's brand in 2005?\" It just has taken some time, and now, we may be one of the least patient companies in the world, but what I can tell you is that we do have the resolve and we continue to show and demonstrate our ability to invest in this business, that we're going to figure it out. And as we have been doing, it's not just in the personnel that come in, it\u2019s the relationships with factories, it's the learnings that build with the infrastructure throughout a company. Apparel and Footwear do not leverage the business, and as we sit here in year five and we look towards when does that breakeven point and when do you start really getting momentum? Number one, we don't believe we're far away, and number two, we think that we continue to put ourselves in a position to have a great product and a signature product in the market at any time. And can you make that evaluation of new categories that we'll enter at the appropriate time too. But short answer, we've learned a lot, and hopefully, we're beginning to apply some of those lessons profitably.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital", "All right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.", "Daniel Wewer - Raymond James & Associates", "A question on the inventory grid. You noted that, that reflects the increase in the safety stock inventory as well as bringing the licensed product out. At what point will the renewed effort on Footwear begin to impact inventory growth? Is that next year? Or in the fourth quarter of 2010?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Dan, this is Brad. We don't really see Footwear being a major driver of our year-over-year inventory growth. I think to go back to the things we called out, it\u2019s the biggest three divers we see, really, is that increase in safety stock on core programs. I'll also recall that we also are increasing our auto-replenishment programs year-over-year also, so we have more products on auto-replenishment, which is part of that driver, along with increasing our safety stock levels across auto-replenishment products. And obviously, there are two items we called out, Hats and Bags coming in-house, and also the increase in made-for [ph 0:53:31] for outlet. Those are the three major drivers of inventory, Footwear not releasing its con drive [ph 0:53:37 ] year-over-year.", "Daniel Wewer - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. Second question I had, accounts receivable growth of 13%. Is that a good proxy of the revenue growth that you are seeing from your core customers? I know we'll get that data when you release the Question, but is that going to be a good proxy of the revenue growth from your core customers?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, in general, yes. Our DSOs, whether you look at them in total or with or without ETC, are improving year-over-year slightly. But in general, that's relative to the growth of our core consumers.", "Daniel Wewer - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. In the second half of 2009, you called out the cold weather as being ideal for your ColdGear sales. Obviously, weather is unpredictable. Can you tell us as to how that impacts your forecast for second half revenues?", "Wayne Marino", "Dan, it's Wayne. First thing we learned a long time ago is not to bet on weather. We're going to put ourselves in a position, ColdGear is one of those items that is an auto-replenishment and safety stock item, so we're going to be well positioned for that. The consumer demand will come. The timing of it depends on various factors. So we're not sitting here betting on weather, but we're sitting here making sure we\u2019re going to have the position for the Fitted ColdGear as compression as well.", "Daniel Wewer - Raymond James & Associates", "Wayne, was that a reason why you did not raise your revenue guidance for the second half of the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Dan, I'd go back to the tougher comps in the back half of the year relative to Direct-to-Consumer, first of all. And second of all, also we also called out with that the biggest impact year-over-year decline of Footwear would be in Q1 and Q3. So the decline in Footwear is pronounced in Q3 versus last year, and we had a very strong Direct-to-Consumer in the back half of last year also, which we\u2019ll be comping this year. Those are the biggest drivers.", "Daniel Wewer - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay, great.", "Alex Pettit", "We have time for one final question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Robert Baird.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Kevin, on the Apparel businesses, you talked about the broad-based strength in the quarter. Could you guys be a little more specific on how Apparel grew wholesale versus consumer direct. I know consumer direct was very strong on the quarter as a whole for the company.", "Kevin Plank", "Let me speak, I'll let Brad follow up. Again, yaddar seen is that [ph 0:56:06] with our brand, so 40% of our total Apparel businesses is compression-based. And so there's a consumer that, I think, we've omitted, and I'm coming back to the stated answer again, of just we see the opportunity and how that expands across Men's, Women's and Youth. And again, the product or the opportunity that we see is to continue to grow and expand there. It's been equal. We're seeing double-digit growth in our Men's business, and that's around key products like our core compression, ColdGear, HeatGear and some of the basics. And then, as we've begun to expand that core too. And that's where Henry Stafford, our new head of Apparel, who\u2019s someone who\u2019s been living them all for the last 15 years of his career, is going to help us move from beyond just on the field or at practice to, to and from the gym and other venues too.", "Brad Dickerson", "This is Brad. So just to kind of look at the growth rates in the second quarter, obviously, we don't get into the details of wholesale versus Direct-to-Consumer and so forth but a couple of data points that we did talk about. Direct-to-Consumer was 21% of our business in the second quarter and accrues 60%. Obviously, a majority of our products through Direct-to-Consumer is on the Apparel side. So if Apparel grew 34% for the quarter, obviously, the Wholesale business would have to be a very strong growth rate too, as that\u2019s a major part of our Apparel business.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Right. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about your wholesale distribution right now? I know you guys have said that there are certain major markets in the U.S., whether it's like Los Angeles or New York, where you feel you're under-penetrated relative to some other ones where maybe the brand\u2019s just been more established historically. How are you guys thinking about that? How do you feel like you can get better penetration in some of those markets? Is it through your Direct business? Or is through things like the new TSA concept? Or working more with like the longer finish line [ph 0:57:48]? Can you maybe address that a little bit?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, well, when we look at distribution as a whole, we begin with looking at from a consumer point of view. Where is our presence lacking? And where is our target consumer shopping? And we do believe that we're under-penetrated in certain regions of the United States. A great example of those numbers is that in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, for instance, we have more than 100 points of distribution for the Under Armour brand. In New York City, we have just less than 30. So when you look at where are we showing up and where are we appearing as a company, we think there's opportunity for us to be a bit more aggressive there. We brought in, and a great example of that too is, we have existing partners that we still have opportunities to grow. For instance, Foot Locker is, and in the mall channel alone, we're in 700 or 800 Foot Locker doors today, with more than 4,000 doors globally for us to continue to move into. So we're declaring is not that we need to go to new partners as much as, I think, there's [ph 0:58:45] room for us to grow within some of our existing partners as well. So I think you'll see us to be opportunistic, but I think you'll also see us take a little bit of a different approach to defining our distribution as strictly being one particular channel, as much as we want to be much more consumer-focused with that than just channel-focused.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. Brad, you talked about SG&A growth. I think you said in the third quarter that you'd expect it to be up a similar rate as Q2. Is that correct? And then, how do you see that going into the fourth quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, to that point. Q3 growth and SG&A will be similar to Q2. That's mostly going to be driven by marketing. So we see in the back half of the year marketing be a big driver of Q3. But again, marketing in total will still be at 12% to 13% for the year. But a higher growth rate in Q3 than versus Q4 driven by market.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. And then lastly, on the Direct business, I know 45 stores, or Factory stores at the end of this quarter. What was that number at the end of Q2? And I don't recall if you said what your comp was in the second quarter.", "Wayne Marino", "Yes, Mitch, this is Wayne. Let me just take that. This year, our range is about 48 to 53 stores. I just want to clear that up. If we have opportunities to get over 50 and if there's places for us that are right for us in the right locations, we're going to be able to take advantage of that.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "All right.", "Kevin Plank", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program.

Third Quarter Earnings Webcast Conference Call [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Shaw. Please go ahead.", "Tom Shaw", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone participating on this morning's conference call. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, who will address the drivers of our third quarter results and our strategy for continued growth in 2010 and beyond. Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter, provide an updated outlook for 2010 and introduce our preliminary outlook for 2011. After the prepared remarks, Kevin, Brad and Wayne Marino, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available for Q&A session that will end by 9:30 a.m.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. At Under Armour, measuring success has always started with a scoreboard, and I'm going to get to that in just a moment. But as we complete year five as a public company, the measure of our success as a brand gets a little more complex.", "So in addition to our quarterly numbers, I want to talk this morning about four benchmarks, by which we measure ourselves to ensure we are building our platform for long-term brand strength and long-term return to shareholders: Product, story, service and team.", "But first, to our scoreboard. Our Apparel net revenues are up 30% year-to-date. We think that number speaks volumes, not only in our ability to continue resonating with our core consumer but to the strength and validity of our strategy. We believe that 30% year-to-date apparel net revenue growth is great evidence that there's still a tremendous opportunity for us in the U.S. Apparel business as we continue to lead in our core sporting goods accounts and gain traction outside of our core distribution.", "For the quarter, our Apparel net revenue growth was extremely balanced with Men's, Women's and Youth, all growing at least 25%. In addition, our growth being broad-based, we continue to see our market share of dollars run ahead of market share of units, which we believe is a great indicator that our consumer remains willing to pay a premium for Under Armour apparel. We have consistently talked about building our Women's business to be larger than our Men's. This past quarter, the dollar growth in wholesale women's training apparel, our largest category in Women's, was equal to the dollar growth we saw in men's training apparel. Well, that is just a snapshot, we think it's a great sign that we've established the right cadence to build the same level of equity and loyalty among our female consumers as we know exist with our core male consumer.", "So to become strong in areas like Women to Direct-to-Consumer, we are also able to invest in areas where the opportunity is even larger. First, there is Footwear. In this past weekend, consumers got their first taste of Under Armour basketball footwear. And while a few days of sell-through are an accurate measure of how well we've been received, we are much more confident about our entry into this important category because of the approach we've taken, and because of what we have learned and now applied to basketball with the experience for the past five years of building footwear.", "By the time our first basketball footwear arrived in sort of last week, literally hundreds of the country's best players have tried our product and given us feedback. That process has helped us deliver a basketball shoe that works for the player and gives us confidence that we will see a return to growth in our Footwear business in 2011.", "Outside the U.S., the Under Armour brand continues to gain traction and build a base for long-term growth. Our International business grew 60% in the quarter, with both Europe and Japan showing very strong growth. In Europe, our base player continues to lead the way, but we are making strides for diversifying our apparel mix as our fitted product grows as a percentage of our business, moving into 2011. We're also bringing grassroots marketing to our European business. As of the past quarter, we brought hundreds of young athletes to the Under Armour Rugby Combines in the U.K.", "Our business in Japan continues to perform exceptionally well, where our partners, Dome Corporation will pass $100 million in sales in 2010 as they continue to push forward, including the launch of the first non-cleated footwear for the Japanese consumer this quarter. We also saw the first UA brand in full price retail store opened outside the U.S. as Dome opened the UA clubhouse in Tokyo. Our success in Japan and the traction we are gaining in U.K. are great indicators of our ability to speak to athletes who play something other than American football, and better position us to succeed in new categories to help drive our growth.", "We've talked about developing the Under Armour brand like chapters in a book, with each chapter connecting to both the previous and following ones. As our brand continues to reach new consumers, both here and the U.S. and internationally, we will be bringing the next chapter of Under Armour innovation via athletic apparel next spring. When we first brought the idea of moisture-looking compression apparel to the market, our goal was to make athletes rethink expectations for their apparel. Our history is built on our ability to trade consumers up when we deliver true unexpected innovation. And it is with this spirit that 2011, we will bring to market the world's first true performance cotton t-shirt. This evolution will introduce Under Armour to a whole new audience of consumers while bringing a new level of performance to a category where expectations for it have been low. You'll be hearing a lot more about the next chapter in Under Armour's performance apparel platform in the coming months, and we're confident this innovation will expand both the reach and equity of our brand.", "I talked on our last call about investing to build the UA team. That's an ongoing part of my job, and one where we continue to make great strides. I'd like to focus on another area where our apparel net revenue growth is enabling us to invest and that's from the field of play. Our strong apparel engine is fueling our ability to invest, not just in new categories and geographies but in marketing as well.", "Under Armour was born on the football field, and our business there remains very strong. To help ensure that brand strength going forward, we continue to activate and invest in sports marketing assets. On the college field, we continue to generate great visibility for the brand with our great collegiate teams. And this week, we are very proud that the Auburn Tigers, an Under Armour school for more than five years who exclusively wear our uniforms and cleated products has just moved to number one in the BCF College football  standings, War Eagle.", "On the pro side, we recently signed on to not just maintain but expand our relationship with the NFL. So in addition to teaming with the league to maximize our involvement at the NFL combine this spring, we are adding pro bowl players like Miles Austin and Anquan Boldin to the roster of UA athletes wearing Under Armour cleats that you will continue to see on-field.", "So while we're investing to help us grow our share in the core category like football, we are also positioned to invest in assets that we believe will help us accelerate our growth in categories where we're just establishing ourselves. We're confident these coming investments will enable us to quickly build the UA identity in these new categories and bring increased focus to the global opportunities for our brand.", "I talked at the opening about setting additional benchmarks to help guide us towards a multibillion dollar platform. Going forward, our focus is very clear. There are four areas where we need to win as we continue to drive value for our shareholders: Product, story, service and team. First and always foremost, at Under Armour, it's product. Our apparel engine is strong as we continue to create the best solutions for the athlete. We will continue to demonstrate our apparel thought leadership in 2011 with our next generation of apparel innovation involving the brand new category for Under Armour in cotton. We promise to make it exciting, and the market opportunity is very large.", "2011 will mark our fifth year of making footwear, and we believe that the opportunity in footwear can someday be greater than apparel for us. We have built up our equity with athletes over the years, and they have embraced our footwear product on the football and baseball fields. Our challenge is to invest and win outside the Cleated business because while our core consumers found in the football turf and baseball diamond, the bigger dollar opportunity remains at growth categories such as running and basketball.", "Our second focus for growth is around telling the Under Armour brand story globally. We have begun to lay the foundation for the storytelling in key markets like the U.K. and Japan, and have now taken our first steps in the world's largest market in China. Our challenge will be to assemble the pieces in each of those markets, retail presence, sports marketing assets and grassroots storytelling that will position us to win. We've established our priorities in our key markets, are investing to grow globally. And we're confident that you'll see these pieces start coming together over the next several months.", "Third is our ability to service the business. We look at 30% growth in our apparel net revenues year-to-date, and it looks like we're checking that box pretty well. But we are not satisfied with our consistency and servicing consumer demand for UA product. We have made servicing the business a top priority in 2011, and are committed to making it a competency that will help drive long-term operating leverage.", "The fourth and final piece of our plan is building the team. I've spoken to this consistently on these earnings calls as I believe it's the number one priority for the CEO of any growth company. Our results this past quarter gave me confidence that progress is being made. Our retail team continues to drive net revenues, exceeding our wholesale growth and bringing in new consumers to the UA brand. Our Web business continued to deliver strong numbers while building the next evolution of what UA needs to be online for our core consumer. And the continued strength in our core Apparel business is fueling our growth and enabling us to invest across both categories and geographies. All three of these areas are run by experienced leaders we have brought to Under Armour within just the past 12 months.", "Building the team will continue to be my primary focus as we build out the infrastructure of a multibillion dollar global brand. Our revenue growth and the opportunities ahead means we continue to attract the best and the brightest. We will continue to bring an experienced industry pros to help us navigate these new categories and geographies, and complement the homegrown UA team, who has built our business and brand equity to date. Making great product, telling a great brand story, servicing our business and building a great team of people that are going to help us do that. Our goal is to continue to win in each of these areas, ensuring that our core consumers maintain his and her loyalty to the Under Armour brand in 2011 and beyond.", "With that, I'll pass it over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. With Kevin have been taking you through at some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time discussing our third quarter financial results.", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2010 increased 22% to $329 million. Year-to-date, net revenues are up 20% to $763 million. This strong growth was largely driven by Apparel, which was up 28% to $277 million during the quarter and up 30% to $600 million year-to-date. Apparel strength was broad-based during the quarter, with each of our Men's, Women's and Youth Apparel businesses growing at least 25% year-over-year. Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 47% for the quarter and 58% year-to-date, representing approximately 18.1% and 19% of net revenues, respectively. Similar to last quarter, third quarter net revenue growth was driven by a combination of new Factory House stores, strong same-store sales growth and the Web business. We opened five new Factory House stores during the quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 50. We expect to end 2010 with approximately 54 total Factory House stores, up from 35 locations at the end of 2009.", "Footwear net revenues declined 20% to $26 million in the third quarter, in line with our previous indication that Running and Training Footwear revenues were expected to decline in 2010 compared to 2009. International net revenues increased 60% to $21 million in the third quarter and represented approximately 6% of revenues, up from roughly 5% of revenues in last year's quarter.", "Third quarter gross margins were 50.9% compared with 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. Several factors contributed to the 140 basis point gross margin expansion. First, we incurred lower sales returns and markdowns contributing approximately 60 basis points. Second, we experienced a favorable impact year-over-year from liquidations and inventory reserves, contributing approximately 50 basis points. And finally, we continue to see a higher percentage of net revenues from our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, contributing approximately 45 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 33.6% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 32% in the prior year's period. Let me take you through the four major components of SG&A, many of which are consistent with our story throughout 2010. First, marketing costs increased to 10.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.5% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by increased sponsorships and higher marketing costs for specific customers. It's important to note that third quarter marketing costs reflect an approximate $2 million shift of certain media costs to the fourth quarter. Given our updated four-year plan, we now expect 2010 marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues at approximately 12% compared to our previously indicated range of 12% to 13%.", "Second, selling costs increased to 7.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 6.6% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores, which carried better gross margins but also incur higher SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue.", "Third, product innovation and supply chain costs represented 7.7% of net revenues for the quarter compared with 7.3% in the prior-year period. This increase is primarily a function of increased investments and personnel associated with the design and sourcing of our expanding Apparel, Accessories and Footwear lines.", "Finally, corporate services increased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter compared to 7.6% in the prior-year period as we invested an additional corporate personnel, facility expenses and information technology initiatives needed to support our growth.", "Operating income during the third quarter grew nearly 21% to $56.7 million compared with $47.1 million in the prior year. Operating margin was 17.3% compared with 17.5% in the prior-year quarter. In other expense, we experienced a net loss of $180,000 related to foreign currency during the quarter and a net loss of $1 million year-to-date.", "Looking at our tax rate, several factors positively impacted our third quarter rate. First, we received a state tax credit similar to one's previously received by us in 2002 and 2006, along with a federal research and development tax credit. Second, we continue to develop and implement our tax planning strategies. These efforts reduced our effective income tax rates in the third quarter to 37.7% compared with 43.9% in the third quarter of 2009 and are expected to result in a full year tax rate of approximately 39.2%.", "Our resulting net income in the third quarter increased 33% to $34.9 million compared with $26.2 million in the prior-year period. Third quarter diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $0.68 compared with $0.52 in the prior year. While our operations remained strong during the quarter, we did experienced approximately a $0.05 favorable impact from the lower-than-expected effective tax rate during the period and approximately a $0.02 benefit from the shift of marketing spend from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.", "Now moving over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 43% to $134 million compared with $93 million at September 30, 2009. Cash, net of debt increased $40 million at quarter end to $115 million compared with $75 million at September 30, 2009. We continue to have no borrowings outstanding on our $200 million credit facility.", "Inventory at quarter end increased 28% year-over-year to $196 million compared to $153 million at September 30, 2009. In line with t previous guidance, the inventory growth outpaced net revenue growth as we increased our safety stock around core programs to better meet consumer demand and increased or made for strategy across our Factory House store base. Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $9 million for the third quarter and approximately $25 million year-to-date. We now anticipate capital expenditures in 2010 will come in towards the lower end of our previously indicated $35 million to $40 million range.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2010. Previously, we provided an outlook for 2010 net revenues in the range of $990 million to $1.10 billion, an increase of 16% to 18% over 2009. And 2010 diluted earnings per share of $1.11 to $1.13, an increase of 21% to 23%. Given the sustained strength in our Apparel and Direct-to-Consumer channels, our improved visibility for the remainder of the year and a lower effective tax rate, we are raising our full year outlook. We now expect 2010 annual net revenues in the range of $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion, an increase of 20% to 21% over 2009. We also expect 2010 diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.24, an increase of 34% to 35% over 2009.", "Similar to last quarter, we want to elaborate on three areas of our updated 2010 guidance: SG&A, taxes and inventory. For SG&A, we see year-over-year dollar growth in the fourth quarter, approaching 30%. We continue to make the right investments to support our growth platforms. This includes Footwear, which was planned down this year and hats and bags, which are not generating revenue until 2011. They also includes higher personnel costs at our Factory House channel will we planned to end the year with 54 stores, up from 35 stores at the end of 2009.", "Now looking at our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter benefited from one-time state and federal tax credits, along with an improved outlook relative to long-term tax planning strategies. As we stated earlier, these items will drive our effective tax rate for the full year in 2010 to 39.2%, down from our previous outlook of 42%. As we move into 2011, we anticipate our effective tax rate will increase to a range of 40.5% to 41% due to the one-time nature of the tax credits received in 2010. However, this increase we partially offset in the permanent impact relative to the our continued long-term tax strategies.", "Finally on inventory. We continue to see the same factors from the third quarter, driving fourth quarter inventory growth ahead of sales growth. This includes an increase in our safety stock and continued investments around made for products for our Factory House outlet channel. It also includes new product categories for 2011, including hats and bags coming in house and the introduction of our new cotton product.", "Before we turn it over for Q&A, we'd also like to provide you with a preliminary view for 2011. Based on current visibility, we anticipate both 2011 net revenues and 2011 EPS growth to be at the higher end of our longer-term growth target of 20% to 25%. We intend to give more details on our 2011 guidance in the coming months. With that, we would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "If you could maybe help us out a little bit some more detail on the gross margin. I'm just wondering, I see what you guys talk about as being year-over-year lifts to the gross margin. What were maybe one or two of the biggest offsets to that in the quarter, please?", "Brad Dickerson", "Mike, this is Brad. I think, when you look at a lot of positive things on the gross margin side, as far as negative maybe offsets, we did have a little bit more apparel liquidations year-over-year. But I think that really is more a function of just keeping our inventory clean. And actually, you're seeing some of the benefit of that in what I call not as lower returns and markdowns. So even though we have a little bit more volume on the apparel liquidations side, which had a little bit of drag on margins, very small, have more than offset by the fact that our inventories are very clean now, and we're seeing less returns and markdowns.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "As I look through the national statements on 2011, how should we think about I guess the gross outgrow and then our models for 2011, should we think about -- it seems like there's been quite a bit of preloaded costs this year, you guys bring in hats and bags and you buildout for Footwear to be getting bigger. Should we think about EPS start levering revenues next year as we think about this 20%, 25% targets? Should EPS be growing ahead of revenues? Did you guys start leveraging some of those costs? And maybe to what extent should we be thinking about that at this point?", "Brad Dickerson", "We'll give a lot more detail around 2011 on the next earnings call. But I think as we kind of sit here, targeting that a higher end of 20%, 25% both for top line and bottom line, we are going to target a modest SG&A leverage in 2011. We need to continue to invest in our businesses, but with hats and bags coming in house to your point, also with footwear returning to growth. We are targeting a modest leverage in SG&A. They talked about the tax rates. So year-over-year, the tax rate will be going back up again a little bit because of the one-time nature on some of those tax credits. And on the margin side right now, we're still working through a lot of the details. Although, we've been seeing some of the challenges that the industry's been seeing relative to some margin pressures out there. We're working through that right now, specifically around the back half of 2011.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "That's the gross margin comment, Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Right.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "So that's why we shouldn't expect a huge amount of leverage on the growth. There's quite a bit of noise in that gross margin outlook for you guys next year, so I'm just trying to think how we should maybe think about that number heading into next year, even though it's early for you guys?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think you've got some puts and takes there with SG&A, with the tax rate. And also with right now, we think we have more detail on the gross margin later at the next earnings call. So I think for now, we look at that 20% to 25% both top line and EPS line higher into that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I apologize if I missed it, but more any basketball shoes shipped in the third quarter or does that shipment all fall in the fourth quarter? And then related to that, can you talk about the sort of the inventory investment there and the allocation strategy for basketball shoes? And then my follow-up question would be for the Performance Cotton business launching next year, maybe a similar sort of discussion, is this an allocated launcher? Could this be pretty broad and does it encompass any new distribution channels?", "Brad Dickerson", "Robbie, this is Brad. On the Q3 shipments for basketball, now, there was not any Q3 shipments for basketball, that's a Q4 entry into that marketplace. And as Kevin mentioned, we're really talking about a takes here. So from an inventory perspective, don't really anticipate any significant movements in inventory relative to the basketball footwear. As far as allocation, yes, it's an allocated program this year as we head into next year also for basketball. On the Cotton side also, for the most part of an allocated program, we'll have a little bit of replenishment on the cotton side too going forward. From a distribution perspective, no significant changes in distribution in 2011 for us, and that includes our cotton product.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And just a quick follow up on Footwear. If you look at the shipments for the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, for the third quarter, it looks like your revenues were down about 20%, if I think I have the right number in there. Were there some wholesale accounts where your Footwear business was actually up in the third quarter and/or, were you doing Footwear in your outlet stores? I would've thought you would have planned that Footwear business down more significantly versus the numbers last year. Any comment on that?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, Robbie, I think when you look at year-over-year in the third quarter, obviously Q3 last year was a pretty big quarter for us, with the back-to-school program around run. So obviously, it makes sense that year-over-year, as we called out Running and Training to be down this year, that Q3 would be down. We have seen some pretty good success in our outlet channel with our footwear, so that helped a little bit offset some of that. But again, you actually saw as we called out consistent with prior quarters, our footwear is down overall.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Kevin, I wanted you to elaborate on a comment you made at the beginning on the basketball launch. Under Armour's greater level of confidence, given the experience and key learnings over the last five years of footwear. Could you elaborate and maybe give some examples of things that you've learned in the Footwear business that makes you more confident on the basketball side?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, actually I want to give a little more color around footwear in general. So let me take a minute to do that. And if I could drop it into three buckets, which the first bucket is reality, the second is what we've learned and the third being what we're doing about it. So first of all, I want to set expectations for people, and when we talk about what we believe our opportunity in basketball is. We've been pretty clear about saying our goal is to be the number two player in basketball in the next several years. Now keep in mind people that a $1.3 billion market opportunity in the U.S. alone, that's currently dominated by one company through three different brands, controlling 90% plus of the market. So as we say targeting number two, you're looking for about mid-single digits would accomplish that goal for us. That being said, our long-term goal, like it is in every category we enter, is to someday be the number one player, but that of course is going to take time. But as you can tell for our brand, we are thinking more about Under Armour 2020 than we are even about Under Armour 2011. So we've absolutely had a great education in footwear since 2006. And first and foremost, we have listened, and I think hopefully applied most of those learnings to what we're doing through our basketball introduction. First and foremost, the emphasis on use. Winning brand fans over inception versus at age 25. A great example is when we launched running shoes even after training shoes, one of every two pairs of shoes sold in training in 2008 were to use. When we came back in 2009, we didn't sell youth products in the initial launch. So lesson learned. Narrow distribution for the introduction and limited amount of pairs, we put out for the market a fraction of what we've done with other introductions from a total number of pairs in the market. And most importantly, we built around our key sporting goods partners that have been great and terrific with us through this past weekend, as well as incredible support from the mall with both Foot Locker and Finish Line, really doing a great job for us. And then, most importantly, the acceptance that we had from some of the top specialty door, to some of the top urban doors around the country. So there's a lot of lessons to be learned here. And again, it's very early, but the indications are that we're going to get started. And again the one certain thing that we can tell you is that day 365 will be better than day one. And that comes back where I think one of the places where we've been pretty critical of ourselves is what we've done when we introduced the product versus what we do in season two and season three. And what I can tell you with confidence is that season two and season three will be greater at again than we were on day one. And most importantly, we've core tested and approved the product. We'll have 20 division one teams wearing in this fall and throughout several years, 12 Men's, eight Women's teams, 10 UA programs, 30 high school teams, Brandon Jennings in the NBA. I mean we've really taken the time to build a good product. And more importantly, a great product that is a foundation that's something to build on. And then finally, as you know, what are we doing about it? I think the culture of being a basketball company is one of the most important things that we've really been able to evolve into. Not just talking about being a basketball brand, but really walking about being a basketball brand. And a large part of that, you're not allowed to call them six for earnings calls, but I just got back from a week in China visiting our factories and visiting our office in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. So I'm fighting between costs here, but bear with me. But you have to go there and you have to see it. And I can tell you that the partner base, distribution base, the manufacturing base that we have today, the office, the more than 40 people that we have in Asia, the nearly 100 people that we have here, the opened requisitions, the culture of building a Footwear business, and particularly, a pretty successful sport in Basketball business is something we're pretty proud of.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just to follow up, talking about things that run in the past, with this kind of new cotton product launch, you also alluded to some new channels or new consumer, new markets that's opening up. So can you be more specific in that?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, I think that obviously the addressable market of what cotton product would be for in large form is a big opportunity. We looked in our athletes store and you'd find that typical teenagers sure you find 30 t-shirts. Four of which were performance, 26 of which were cotton. Of the four, we had three of which were Under Armour and one was another brand. So we're fighting ourselves to try to capture that other fourth T-shirt when we realized looking at the other 26 shirts were a greater opportunity. And so we never had issue or we never had problems with when think about Under Armour getting into cotton, with frankly cotton T-shirts as much as we had issue with non-performance. So the ability for us to make a product that performs is something that we think a, speaks to our existing consumer, as well as opens us up to a new consumer who always just said I'm a cotton person, I don't like Under Armour, which is that synthetic goods. So we think that there's a much larger market opportunity there. Again, for consumers that are walking through existing distributions and then, of course, I think there's probably a bigger opportunity as we think about where we can go, where we haven't been able to go before because we didn't make cotton products.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Taposh Bari with Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Kevin, you talked about in your prepared remarks about service brand experience. Maybe give us an update on your latest thoughts on your retail strategy? Obviously, your outlet stores are doing very well. Any update on where you stand on full price retail?", "Kevin Plank", "We have no plans to open any additional specialty stores in 2011, but you're going to continue to see us test the market as well. For instance, we got a great pop-up store that you'll be seeing in New York City in November, right around the marathon and right around our ability to find out what we can do at holiday. As we look at distribution U.S. and where we're under-penetrated as a brand, one of the vehicles we consider is the Direct-to-Consumer Business as a whole. And that's includes both retail as well as our Web business. Our goal with owned retail is to supplement our existing distribution to get to that consumer, because we think there's still a lot of places where still frankly were under-penetrated. And so by offsetting or frankly augmenting our existing distribution base with the appropriate full price strategy is something that may make sense in the future, but we have a long way to go and we have a lot of work to do with our existing account base. But you look at where the most comprehensive branded story is told for the Under Armour brand, and we have some great distribution partners that make that happen. But in a lot of cases, it's an outlet store. It's Branson, Missouri where we opened up our first outlet, and on day one, we'll have 53 outlets by year end. For the place like at Branson, Missouri on day one, we sold nearly $60,000 out of a 5,000 or 6,000-square-foot store in the opening day. And you think about what that opportunity means for us from the having the ability to continue to find pockets where Under Armour brand and frankly the need from the consumer for the Under Armour brand are not met, I think we want to be and remain thoughtful with that.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "It seems like there's some exciting new product launches scheduled for next year. Can you maybe give us an update or some kind of idea of timing for this new cotton fabric and also I guess running 2.0?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, as we mentioned, we basically, I haven't told you anything about cotton yet, and so just giving the indications. So there's a lot more indication, that, and you'll see that around the first quarter of 2011. We have a lot of great products out right now, probably some things and just some one-offs that we're really excited about this, out of the marketplace right now is our new Ego ColdGear, which in the past, if you've ever said tried an Under Armour compression cold weather shirt, we should say that two best times of a day, at the minute you put it on and the minute that you take it off. And so imagine putting an Under Armour shirt, not being a full contact sport, something more excited about this new fitted product. So we think this opens up again to a much wider, more addressable market as well for people that aren't really looking for super compression. So it's a little more of a relaxed fit, and I think with all of the benefits and properties of Under Armour. So a lot of new product categories like that, but I think that performance that you're seeing with 30-plus percent net revenue growth in Apparel, it speaks to I think the trust that we have for the consumer and the fact that we have a pretty good thought leadership position when it comes to apparel.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Any indication on when jeans, new running products should be expected at retail next year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Well, it's consistent. You're not going to see one big great new launch. What you're going to see is consistently better product in the marketplace. And again, we feel very good about the product that we have there. Now we feel very good about the product that we have there now. We feel very good about the product we have in 2011, which is why we've taken some of the steps backwards to reset in 2010, that sets us up for position to have clean inventory and to grow attractive business in 2011 and especially heading into 2012. So what you're not hearing us say right now are any major predictions. What you are hearing us say is that 2011 will be bigger than 2010, that basketball be an important part of what we're doing. And that we have great confidence that for the long term, both Running and Training are going to be important categories for our brand.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Investment.", "Oliver Chen", "It's Oliver Chen for Kate McShane. We had a question related to gross margin and looking for it in relation to product costs. Do you feel that your business model has sensitivity to any of the recent escalation in cotton prices? And if so, kind of what is the base case assumed for that outlook? And secondly, for modeling purposes, what kind of -- should we be projecting an inflection towards positive footwear growth as soon as first quarter 2011? Is there any kind of feedback around how to think about that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, this is Brad. As far as gross margin goes, I think the important thing to note is that still for us it's consistent with what we said in the past. That's the biggest drivers of gross margin for us. We'll continue to be the growth in two businesses for us. One, our Direct-to-Consumer business, which positively impacts gross margins and two, growth in our Footwear business, which we've called out right now impacts our margins negatively from a gross margin perspective. So those two really will still continues to be the biggest drivers of our gross margin story going forward. To your point around some of the pricing issues. We are kind of rolling up our prices right now for the back half of 2011, thoughts on work to do on that. So we'll get some more details around gross margin in the next earnings call. I think the important thing to point out though is that we don't anticipate cotton, as a percentage of overall business to be a significant driver of our cost. So from that perspective, I don't think cotton will have a negative impact for us in 2011. But again, we'll get more detail around margins in the next earnings call. As far as Footwear growth and timing of Footwear growth, I think what you should anticipate is probably Q2 and Q3 kind of being the quarters that have the best footwear growth, and that really is more around the back-to-school season. So to Kevin's point before talking about some of the categories of footwear, I think you're going to see the most impactful growth in Footwear on Q2 and Q3.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Tracy with FBR Capital.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Maybe if I could just follow up a little bit more on the Footwear side and Basketball in particular. I know you don't give specifics next year but just in terms of, is there sort of a goal or a market share grab you expect to what's embedded in that top line guidance for next year?", "Kevin Plank", "In basketball, like I said, I think we've got a few years to start really showing up in terms of absolute market share. So our number one goal right now is learning the cadence of how to work within that category, getting the consumer acceptance from the athletes on court, and then of course building up a little bit excitement around some very key and limited doors. So there's nothing from a basketball specific. In terms of footwear overall market share, we're thinking more about how that compares to ourself, what are we doing to ensure that footwear in 2011 again is greater than it is in 2010.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then just on footwear margin side, as we think about next year again from a gross margin, it sounds like it still is a little bit of a pressure, but sort where we are in the stages of scaling that business up to sort of leverage the costs that have already put in, or we have that inflection point next year? Or are we still working through that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Eric, this is Brad. I think from the margin side, we still, we calling out about 1,000 basis point plus opportunity in margins in footwear, longer term. We continue to see that opportunity longer-term in 2011. I think from a margin perspective, you'd probably see something similar to what we've seen in 2010, some puts and takes to get to. But we'll give a little bit more detail on that in the next earnings call.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And I know you don't want to get too specific on the gross margin side, but certainly you got the pieces of Direct-to-Consumer helping, but in terms of some of the takes again around these product costs inflation, not just cotton but be at labor or freight, even polys continue to escalate. Is that obviously, and as we think the back half of the input costs there embedded within your sort of guidance already or is it still you're working through relative to the sort of price increases you think you can take to offset?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, our guidance takes into account the visibility we have today, which is pretty good on spring, summer. On fall, winter, we're still kind of working through that. So that's why we're not able to give so much detail until the next earnings call. But just to kind of reiterate again from an apparel perspective, when you talk about labor costs, less than 10% of our apparels manufactured in China. So China labor is less of an impact to our Apparel. It's a little more of an impact to our Footwear margins, which is a small percentage of our business obviously affected before cotton. Although, incremental top line for us in 2011 still relatively small percentage of our overall business. But we're kind of working through all of those margins and give you a more detail in the next call.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's Nicole [ph], filling in for Michelle. We wanted to see if you could give us an update on your international efforts? And is there any new initiatives that are driving the strength in that market?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, it's Kevin. So I think, first of all, our goal is to be a global brand, which we defined that is being more than half of our revenues should come from outside of our home country. And so in doing that, we have a long road in front of us, with 90% plus of our business coming within North America today. That being said, we've got great confidence of what global can mean. So as we think about global, there's three regions that we consider, that the Americas, Asia, and Europe. In Asia, I think that we've weight from great groundwork, again with Dome Corporation demonstrating that our brand a does translate, and the success that we've seen with Dome Corporation passing a USD $100 million, it's been 10 years to get to that point, but I think that they are really positioned to start scaling and start leveraging their business as well. And so, again, it took seven years to get to the first $35 million, and just three to get over $100 million since then. So we feel like that the tipping point effect is something that's taking place there. And again, it helps lay a little bit of a model as we think about other, particularly Asian countries. So China is the next one that we have on the map. And as we think about entering China, we're going to do it very conservatively. And within the next several months, we expect to have a shop-in-shop up in China at some point and opening our first full price store in 2011 as well. So again, all of that has been around putting to work all of the studies and all of the market research that we've done to date, putting ourselves in a position to enter that market. But again, as we see or what we found with entering other countries is that the first five years are about understanding culture and understanding on building your teams. So we've got a very long-term plan with that, and we're very fortunate to have an Apparel and a Direct-to-Consumer business that allow us to make these kind of investments. Europe, for us, is a place that we continue to believe in. And again passing that five-year mark, we're in a point where we think that Europe is something that poised for growth for us as well. As we said, our International business is up over 6% of the quarter, 59% year-to-date, so we feel very good about and encouraged by what we're seeing internationally. But it's all up of the small base and something that we think over time, again, our goal is to build out that global base where half our revs are coming from outside of America.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Could you talk about how many stores do you have right now, and what is your store growth plan into next year?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, Sam. Right now, at the end of the third quarter, we have 50 Factory House stores. And obviously, we still have a four full specialty stores on top of that. We anticipate opening another four Factory House stores in the fourth quarter, So we'll end the year with about 54 stores. And next year, right now anticipate building approximately 20 new Factory House stores in 2011. There'll be a little more on front end loaded to as far as opening than we've seen in previous years too.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then, the big basketball launch that's going to happen next year, the big basketball launch that you're going to do next year when it's no longer just an eye dropper, that's going to be more of a back-to-school event rather than third quarter based on what you said?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, no. I think, Sam, is that, we haven't said any major launches next year. I think one of the lessons learned that we have figured out of being in footwear for the last five years for us is not putting that big bull's-eye on any particular date. And so what you see now is, I called it a little more than a slow roll. But we're looking to basically create some market want and desire or need from the consumer. And we now have that platform from a distribution standpoint. I think we like the partners that we have selected right now. I think we have a great balance between our core sporting goods guys, mall channels as well as some of the specialty urban doors. So we're going to basically go where we find heat, and we see that with a product standpoint. As I mentioned in my comments, I do want to make sure it doesn't get lost is that when I say we'll be greater on day 365 than we will be on day one is that we feel great confidence in the product that we have out there and we'll be able to start looking at future seasons to come. What we have coming in the spring, what we have coming next summer and we look at what we have coming next fall. And so there's no big surprises that we're waiting for what the product's going to look like. But it's been tested and we're working with that in our teams are now. And I think we feel very good about the progression and majority that's going to be basketball footwear for the Under Armour brand.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "The comps, how did you comp in your retail stores? And what is the breakout between made for goods right now and selling markdown product, just all of the products that we just start products?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sam, so I think we don't really talk about comp percentages at the retail stores. What I will say is that's probably the benefit we can see from a made-for strategy to some degree is better comp year-over-year. That helped obviously at our product assortments, it's been a better consumer experience within our outlet stores themselves that helped our comps more than anything. As far as made for itself, I think the industry range out there right now is about 75% to 95% made for in the factory store base. We're well below that as a brand right now. And year-over-year, we're probably -- even though we're below that year-over-year, we're probably about double our made for last year at this time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Couple of questions around footwear sourcing. Can you speak to the progress you're making on cost there? And whether are some of the keys to getting better leverage on the footwear gross margins? Is it really just a volume thing? Or are there some other aspects of it that should represent inflection points for you?", "Brad Dickerson", "Jim, I think volume definitely plays a part. Obviously, when you look from a tooling perspective, the more volume can have on your footwear side. It helps to offset some of those upfront tooling costs. So that would always help. Our footwear team and specifically, our sourcing team within footwear has been doing a lot of work around short-term and long-term strategies of sourcing to be able to be more flexible going forward with our source base, and really put us in a position just from a product category perspective to improve margins across the board pretty much in all categories for longer-term. So as I spoke about before, we think there's a lot of opportunity on the footwear side margins, 1,000-plus basis points we think, it's going to take some time. But right now, we're kind of working through that strategy, and we anticipate seeing some benefits from that in future years.", "Kevin Plank", "And Jim, just coming back from Asia and spending time at our factories where our key partners too is part of that learning progression over the last five years has been us becoming a better customer to the vendors we do business with as well. And so erratic buys and some of those things when you just don't know the size of the business and you're learning and getting your molds and your laps and all the amortization that you're going through, so there's some significant start up costs. When we open footwear five years ago, we started getting into that category, we had one partner. We had 13 people on our team. Today, we have, with outsourced development, outsourced design, today, we have five or six key partners that we're working with. We have an office in Guangzhou, we've got 40 people in Asia. We have 100 people here, we have 30 up for requisitions from new people joining the team. So we've become a lot smarter, but we've come a lot bigger, but I think we have become a lot smarter about this. And a lot of the infrastructure build that we've had, even with categories that we haven't been in yet like basketball we're now a, starting to see some revenue come in there, it's also beginning to apply a little bit of an consistency with some of our factory base because when we started as a football company, that was seasonal. And with factories, like anybody wants as they want the ability for 12 months of production that can smoothen out and some other things. So we're becoming a better company customer, which are allowing us to be more strategic and thoughtful about a, where we're manufacturing and where we can take advantage of appropriate local conditions to take advantage of the costs and some of the other things. But I think that's giving us -- we're again much more mature as a Footwear business today than we were obviously five years ago.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, Kevin, are you working with fewer factories and trying to concentrate your sourcing through factories just to get some captive capacity? Or help me understand the dynamic there as to how you're securing capacity and how that's helping you from a cost standpoint?", "Kevin Plank", "We're not alike our Apparel business is that we want to have a few key strategic partners. And so I wouldn't saw three partners on this last visit in six or seven different factory locations, but we can minimize sort of geographic risk and geopolitical risk and some of those things. And I think that the world of footwear manufacturing is going to move very quickly beyond just China. And so that's one of the things we have to be thoughtful with. And again, we're working with very large-scale partners who have that ability because we want to be very important to a few partners versus trying to have a lot of those relationships.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt McClintock with Barclays Capital.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital", "With all the folks on basketball, I just wondered if we can get an update on the Cleat Business. What trends have you been seeing in market share in this category? Is the company still building on this position? And granted that there won't be any major launches next year, but should we see anything exciting in this category next year along with training and running?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, well one thing that's exciting, I mentioned to some of the authenticity that we have with some of our collegiate properties that we'll have wearing our footwear from both baseball and national champion baseball winter, University of South Carolina to the number one team in the country on the collegiate level and Auburn University to just re-upping our deal and more importantly, expanding our deal with the NFL by taking over combine but ensuring that our athletes will be wearing on our football cleats and football gloves beginning in 2011 as well. Market share on the cleated categories continues to grow and expand for us. And so, we see continue to take market share in 2011 in both baseball and basketball cleats. And so it came out on a very small categories, they're also very strategic and very important categories for us. And we think gives us a great foundation and a great base as we continue to build on things like our training footwear as well as give us the credibility of going after categories like running and some of the bigger platforms like basketball as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chi Lee with Morgan Stanley.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Kevin, can you just talk about have you guys been able to manipulate the supply chain so that you'll be able to read it and re-up on basketball to what you're seeing at retail business, what you guys we're able to do with running or training?", "Kevin Plank", "Number one is that we're not looking to be reactive with any of the categories that are running right now. And so, I think we're putting a very firm plan in place and the ability for us to chase, something we could think about long term. But frankly, we don't need the revenues. And so, we're not -- we're very fortunate to have the strong Apparel business that we do that allows us to be thoughtful and strategic. And so when we say we've issued a taste of basketball footwear, there's a much more demand than what we're putting into the market. And again, we're selling at about a fraction of what we've done with other categories that we've entered. And so, we're positioning this as, this is a long-term three- to five- to 10-year plan for us to look to become the dominant and leading player in every category where we were participating.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "I guess my question wasn't so much on the quantities and being able to actually chase quantities, but actually being able to manipulate either design or actual qualitative aspects about the product?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I think that we stayed very close to consumer. Today alone, I mentioned that 12 Men's and eight Women's Division One teams that we have to more than 10 AU programs, the 30 high school teams. So hopefully, we're doing a lot of that work upfront, and we're finding out what the consumer wants. But shortening and staying closer to consumer, shortening those lead times and staying closer to the market, I think that's everyone's goals. But in footwear, we want to be careful before we try to reinvent the wheel. We want to understand the way that we can deliver a great product to consumer. And that unfortunately today's working with an 18-month calendar. So that creates its own limitations, but we're trying to shorten that anyway that we can. But right now, again, I think most important, the one thing you'll find about our basketball is that some people will like it, some people will not like it but it definitely has a point of view. And it's something that we're very proud of and we feel very good about the way we're coming to market with that product.", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Just Brad, following up on the gross margin, can you talk about what categories you saw and the higher liquidation sales year-over-year in 3Q? And as I looked at your fourth quarter guidance, it seems to imply some acceleration in the gross margin trends 4Q from what we saw in 3Q. Is that just an expectation that those liquidation sales will go away?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think on the liquidation side, I won't get too caught up on the components of that. I mean as a percentage of revenues, although in the apparel side, it's a little bit higher. As a percentage of revenues in Q3 this year versus last year, it's still very, very small part of our revenue base. And usually, right now, on the liquidation side, we've obviously seen a lot of success in our outlet channel liquidating apparel. So from a third-party liquidation perspective, it's more kind of a one-off things that are a little bit more difficult to liquidate but we look to do that with. As far as -- I'm sorry, what was your second question again?", "Chi Lee - Morgan Stanley", "Just in terms of what I think the implied fourth quarter gross margin seems to imply something like 170 bps or so improvement year-on-year. Is that just really driven by lower liquidation sales vis-\u00e0-vis 3Q, just help us understand the drivers?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think I would anticipate your fourth quarter margins to be relatively similar improvement as your third quarter margins. Again, strong Direct-to-Consumer quarter as it has historically has been for us. And also on the Footwear side, with the taste of basketball, I think you'll see a positive impact in the top line from footwear also. Although it's a small quarter for us, we'll be able to do a positive impact there. So that may offset some of the Direct-to-Consumer benefit.", "Tom Shaw", "Operator, we're done.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

First Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Shaw. Sir, you may begin.", "Tom Shaw", "Thanks, Melissa, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's conference call.

We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.

", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, President, CEO and Chairman; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the first quarter and provide an update to our 2011 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. I will then close with the tentative date of our second quarter 2011 earnings call. Finally, a replay of the teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. After surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark in 2010, we are truly at the beginning of a new era at our company. And the great news is that as we enter this next phase of our growth, our business is as robust and our revenues as broad-based as at any time in our history. ", "And most importantly, it's our core business in U.S. apparel that is driving our growth. We are proud of the growth culture that we have instilled at Under Armour, and that was evident with revenue growth in Q1 of 36%. Some of the highlights included: our wholesale Apparel business with strong growth across Women's, Youth and, of course, Men's; our strong launch for Charged Cotton with great consumer acceptance and awareness of the technological benefits of the Under Armour approach to cotton; Direct-to-Consumer, which continued strong growth of 53% over 2010 and represented 20% of revenues in the quarter; 20% footwear growth in the quarter highlighted by a solid sell-through for a certain running shoe among starters; taking our hats and bags business in-house, which helped drive 213% growth in our Accessory business; and increasing our brand strength and visibility with athletes like Tom Brady and Cam Newton, as well as the global signing of the Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League. We are a growth company. The continued strength of our U.S. Apparel business provides a great platform for our investments and growth drivers like footwear, where our team is in place and starting to develop great products.", "In International, where we are still building a team and foundation for Under Armour in key markets including China. While we are investment mode in those areas, we are funding that spending by being in strong execution mode in apparel, growing our business across categories, gender and distribution.", "Under Armour remains a growth company, so let me take a minute to give you some examples of where that growth is coming from. On the category front, our overall training, golf and running apparel businesses were all extremely strong in the quarter with training accounting for almost 1/2 of the incremental revenue. We saw a great consumer acceptance of our Charged Cotton product that hit retail shelves last month. For Under Armour, Charged Cotton represents the type of innovation we expect to deliver, it's innovation that starts on the field and in the lab for the elite athlete for innovation that will also find its way into every athlete's closet. Our mission is to make all athletes better, and Charged Cotton is off to a great start on helping us deliver on that promise.", "It's important to point out that Charged Cotton is not a one-item introduction, as much as a platform for Under Armour that increases our addressable market from the $2 billion to $3 billion synthetic market we have played into date to the more than $11 billion active use apparel market that cotton now gives us.", "Charged Cotton will, of course, live on into the fall season and will be bolstered by the introduction of Storm Cotton, a heavyweight water resistant sweatshirt that includes all the Under Armour performance benefits that consumers come to expect from us and unlike any similarly positioned product in the market. ", "At the same time, we had strong growth in our core baselayer. Great evidence of the core Under Armour athlete continues to invest in and prefer our brand as we step into this new category like Charged Cotton. On the gender side, we consistently talked about opportunity in Women's since we've been a public company, and it's very satisfying to see that piece of our business really coming together from a product perspective. And while we're very excited about the opportunity around Women's with Charged Cotton, we are equally excited about how our young women's consumer is adopting the technical fabric that is the heart of our brand. This gives us great confidence that we can build a long leadership position in Women's athletic apparel over the long term.", "Our success in Women's is just one part of the growth we are driving in our U.S. Apparel business. Our strong performance in Men's this quarter came primarily from our big categories, including training and golf, great evidence that there is still plenty of runway to grow with our core consumer here in the U.S. within our core distribution. On the wholesale distribution front, we continue to outpace the industry growth rate across our full spectrum of retail distribution. Under Armour revenue growth within our key accounts was broad-based and speaks to the critical position we now occupy both on the floor and the future plans of our key retail partners.", "And beyond the strong growth, our key retail partners our Direct-to-Consumer business continues to grow with revenues up 53%. And there is runway there as well as we continue to add factory help stores to our existing base and invest in the next generation of our e-commerce platform. Given the current focus on material cost and our experience with surgical price increases late in 2010, we are very encouraged by our ability to communicate the value we build into our products and maintain our premium brand position as a result.", "Brad will provide additional detail later. But we are gaining confidence in our ability to better navigate these types of challenges as we grow. So after the solid quarter, it's fair to ask what are we doing for the next 9 months, and I think our plans for Charged Cotton are a good example of how we're evolving as a company, entering this next phase of our growth. In the past, we looked at all opportunities in front of us as a rapidly growing brand, and we're anxious to get after all of them. We focus a lot of energy into our launches to create awareness and drive revenues, but then we were quick to move on to the next opportunity. With Charged Cotton, we understand how it provides us with a great opportunity to dimensionalize the brand and bring Under Armour D&A to what has traditionally been a commodity business. As a result, we are being patient with our growth strategy in reaching this new consumer and are staying focused on building that relationship for the long-term with great product and consistent communications.", "We are focused on building this long-term asset for our brand, and we'll gradually roll new products out within the Charged Cotton platform over the next few months. So while we were pleased with the selling of cotton product for the first time in Q1, I want to spend a moment on a product that we didn't sell any of yet. At this year's NFL Combine, we introduced the E39, which stands for Electric 39, the style member of our first product. The world's most innovative, athletic evaluation and improvement tool, all contained in our compression baselayer, the electronic t-shirt measure data points of the athlete including horsepower and g-force, body temperature, as well as breathing and heart rates. One of the benefits of our sports marketing strategy is being able to showcase this level of innovation on a stage as authentic as the NFL Combine. With the next generation of great football players wore the E39 at the Combine in February, it was a great example of us demonstrating our thought leadership in the absolute rate environment. And if you weren't hard core enough to watch the Combine for the full week, You'll see a lot of footage of the players wearing the E39 during the NFL draft coverage that starts this Thursday in prime time on ESPN.", "So as I said at the outset, we are in strong execution mode. But as we enter this next stage of our growth, the definition of strong execution is evolving as well. When we are $100 million brand executing was about developing great products, getting it made and shipped and ensuring it's sold through. That process remains the core of what defines our success in 2011. But the UA lens has widened, and we are now equally focused on the financial and human capital needed to fund our long-term growth drivers. Pushing hard on both of those funds to ensure we strike the right balance that will enable us to fully capitalize on the promise of what we have built to date. So much like the E39, the investment we announced in March about our partnership with the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and the English Premier league generated no revenues for us in the quarter. But it does put us squarely in the middle of the pitch in the world's best soccer league, starting next year. ", "We feel strongly that our relationship with this championship league will level north 1 and base club will accelerate our business in not only the U.K. but everywhere that soccer is played. Tottenham is an Under Armour kind of team, like the Auburn Tigers and the FCC, they come with a great tradition in the top league, and we hope that our partnership will help bring the same level of success that Auburn saw this past year. And finally, one last investment we are making that really speaks to the possibilities on the Under Armour brand. Later this week, we are scheduled to open the first UA retail presence in China. As we always do, we will initially be in test mode with a shop-in-shop store and the Grand Gateway Mall in Shanghai. We'll be telling the UA gearline store in this initial retail location, that our primary goal will be to learn about the Chinese consumer in how we can bring our performance story to them in the years to come.", "As I said earlier, it was a great quarter. And innovations like Charged Cotton and E39, our new partnership with Tottenham and taking our first step in China later this week are great examples of the investments we are making now to ensure more great results in the years to come. So with that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. Now Kevin has been taking you through some highlights and strategies for our business, I would now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter financial results and updated 2011 guidance.", "Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2011 increased 36% to $313 million, reflecting momentum in both our Apparel and Direct-to-Consumer businesses. Apparel grew 34% to $230 million during the quarter. Category strength was once again broad-based across each of our Men's, Women's and Youth categories.", "Our training category continues to lead the way accounting for nearly half of our net revenues growth. Including our training category was the launch of our Charged Cotton product in March.", "Overall, in 2011, we expect a mid-single-digit total growth contribution from Charged Cotton off of our 2010 net revenues base.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 53% for the quarter, representing 20% of net revenues compared to 18% in the prior year's period. We opened 9 new Factory House stores during the first quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 63, up from 39 locations at the end of last year's first quarter. We expect approximately 16 additional Factory House stores to open in 2011, bringing our total door count by year end to 79.", "Our e-commerce business also remains robust as we continue to capture higher traffic and take deliberate steps to drive conversion.", "Footwear net revenues during the first quarter increased 20% to $51 million from $43 million last year. Growth was predominately driven by new basketball offerings and strong performance in slide. Our expectations for footwear growth in 2011 are unchanged. We now see the majority of growth balanced between the second and third quarters, compared with the second quarter concentration indicated on our last call.", "Accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 213% to $24 million from $8 million last year, reflecting the addition of our hats and bags business, which we brought in-house in January. International net revenues increased 22% to $17 million in the first quarter and represented approximately 5% of total net revenues. First quarter gross margins were 46.4%, compared with 46.9% in the prior year's quarter. We had several factors contributing to the 50 basis point gross margin contraction. First, higher footwear stores and cost negatively impacted margins by approximately 100 basis points. And offset to this, we experienced lower footwear sales returns and markdown reserves positively impacting margins by approximately 40 basis points.", "Second, less favorable apparel product mix negatively impacted margins by approximately 50 basis points. Third, we continue to generate a higher percentage of net revenues from our higher margin, Direct-to-Consumer business positively impacted margins by approximately 60 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 39.6% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 41% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing cost declined to 13.3% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.6% in the prior year period. During the quarter, we incurred incremental marketing expenses related to the Auburn Tigers national championship game. However, overall costs were lower than planned, giving a shift in timing, approximately $2 million related to retail market spent for Charged Cotton from the first quarter to the second quarter.", "Second, selling costs increased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.6% in the prior year period, primarily driven from the contained expansion of our Factory House stores, which as we have said carry better gross margins but also incur higher SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue.", "Third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 9.3% of net revenues from 9.6% last year. We continue to invest in these areas to support our long-term growth, but we're able to show modest leverage given our top line strength. Finally, corporate services decreased to 8.1% of net revenues, compared to 9.2% in the prior year period to leverage corporate personnel and facility expenses.", "Operating income during the first quarter grew nearly 56% to $21 million, compared with $14 million in the prior year. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 6.8% from 5.9% in the prior year quarter. Our first quarter tax rate of 39.5% compared favorably to the 42% in the prior year period. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to approximate 40%.", "Our resulting net income in the first quarter increased 69% to $12 million, compared with $7 million in the prior year period. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 64% to $0.23, compared with $0.14 in the prior year. ", "Now shifting over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end decreased 33% to $111 million, compared with $166 million at March 31, 2010. We have no borrowings outstanding on our new $300 million revolving credit facility, which we recently expanded from $200 million. Inventory at quarter-end increased 68% year-over-year to $249 million, compared to $148 million at March 31, 2010. ", "As we indicated on our last earnings call, we expect that inventory growth during the first and second quarters of 2011 to exceed the 45% growth experienced at year-end. Two notable factors contributed to our inventory growth during the quarter: the transition of our hats and bags business in-house, and as discussed in our last earnings call, an earlier planned build of our ColdGear apparel for our 2011 fall winter season. Excluding these 2 factors, inventory would have increased approximately 45% versus the prior year period, a position that reflects our efforts to better service anticipated demand. We will provide more detail on our inventory positioning shortly.", "Accounts receivable at quarter-end increased 48% year-over-year to $163 million, compared to $110 million at March 31, 2010. This increase was largely based on the timing of our wholesale apparel shipments, which were concentrated more toward the end of our first quarter.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $12 million for the first quarter. We are now planning capital expenditures for 2011 in the range of $45 million to $50 million, up from our prior guidance of $40 million to $45 million, partially reflecting incremental in-store market initiatives with key retail partners.", "In addition to our normal operating capital expenditure plan and as previously disclosed, we have an agreement to purchase the Tide Point office complex, home of our corporate headquarters here in Baltimore. We now expect this deal to close in May subject to certain closing conditions at a purchase price of $60.5 million. Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2011.", "Previously, we anticipated 2011 net revenues of $1.33 billion to $1.35 billion, an increase of 25% to 27% over 2010, and 2011 operating income of $143 million to $147 million, an increase of 27% to 31% over 2010. Given our current visibility, we are raising this full year 2011 outlook. We now anticipate 2011 net revenues in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, an increase of 29% to 31% over 2010, and 2011 operating income in the range of $149 million to $153 million, an increase of 33% to 36% over 2010. Our current guidance implies full year operating margins between 10.9% and 11%, leveraging 30 to 40 basis points in the 10.6% level achieved in 2010.", "Below the operating line, contingencies and effective tax rate were approximately 40%. In 2011, although as discussed in our last call that maybe opportunities to capture certain tax credits throughout the year enabling us to improve on this rate. Finally, we anticipate fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding to approximately $52.5 million to $52.7 million for 2011, a slight increase over our prior guidance of $52.3 million to $52.5 million.", "We would also like to provide additional color around our outlook for 2011. First, with respect to gross margins. Our visibility around 2011 gross margins and the puts and takes remain relatively the same from our last earnings call. The transition of our hats and bags business from a licensing model to in-house although accretive to operating income dollars in 2011, will negatively impact gross margins as will near-term challenges around apparel and footwear sourcing cost. ", "These gross margin pressures would be partially offset by the continued strong growth in our higher margin Direct-to-Consumer business. From a seasonality view, we continue to expect the largest year-over-year decline in gross margins to occur in Q2 and Q3, with a modest improvement to gross margins year-over-year in Q4. We anticipate full year 2011 gross margins to be down approximately 100 basis points from 2010. We also want to provide some early insight into 2012 gross margins where we continue to evaluate product costing and pricing. We are facing the same challenges as the rest of the industry where near-term input cost pressures have intensified for both cotton and oil-based synthetics. As a result, in addition to select retail price increases in fall winter 2011, we are looking at more broad-based pricing increases commencing in spring 2012 to help mitigate some of these pressures. We believe our premium position in apparel gives us unique opportunity to mitigate much of these pressures. In addition, similar to 2011, we anticipate our continued growth in our higher margin Direct-to-Consumer business will also play a part in offsetting product cost pressures.", ".", "We will give updates to our progress as we get more visibility into 2012. Now some additional color on SG&A. As we previously mentioned, we shifted approximately $2 million in retail marketing expense for Charged Cotton from the first quarter to the second quarter. We continue to expect a higher weighting of marketing cost in the first half of 2011 as compared to 2010. Given the cadence of new Factory House openings, we would also expect more pressure in selling cost in the first half of 2011, compared to the second half of the year. As experienced in the first quarter, corporate services expense leverage is expected to be the primary driver of improved operating margins in 2011.", "Regarding inventory. The same factors that impacted the first quarter carrying total gear apparel into the fall winter 2011 season and the transition of our hats and bags business will continue to impact inventory levels in the next 2 quarters. In addition to these 2 items, our ongoing efforts to manage inventory effectively must be balanced with our desire to meet consumer demand. Over the last few years, we have discussed many investments and systems and technology to design to achieve this balance. Although we expect these investments to be a significant part of improving inventory turn efficiency over the longer term, we must be careful on our expectations of how quickly this will occur, especially in balancing this with immediate consumer demand.", "We believe in the near term, a forward inventory turn of 3x and a 90% to 95% fill rate are realistic goals for our team. If we look back to the first half of 2010, our forward inventory turns were well above a 3x turn rate. In Q2 of 2010, they jumped as high as 3.6x. And as we discussed last year, our fill rate became challenged. To put it more simply, in the front half of 2010, we believe we were under-inventoried to meet demand.", "This led to our decision to start making incremental inventory investments in the second half of 2010, which have continued into the first half of 2011. Included in these investments are greater positions and core auto replenishment inventory or safety stock and also higher levels of seasonal product. Regarding seasonal product, we feel this gives us greater ability to meet anticipated demand with the backdrop of an efficient and highly profitable Factory House closeout vehicle, which will approach 80 doors by year-end. ", "With all of these factors taken into consideration for inventory, we expect the year-over-year inventory growth rate will peak in the second quarter before moving more in line with our net revenues growth in both the third and fourth quarters.", "We also want to provide a few comments on our business in Japan with our licensing partner, Dome. As a reminder, we received a royalty payment from this $100 million plus business, which equated to less than 1% of our net revenues in 2010. While revenues and thus our royalty improved significantly in the first quarter of 2011, the environment has clearly changed since the March earthquake and tsunami. Our thoughts are with the people of Japan and with our friends and partners at Dome. We will continue to work closely with them to monitor the impact to their business and our royalty revenue.", "In summary, demand from our brand remains robust, and we are off to a great start in 2011. While unprecedented sourcing challenges present a greater challenge to the industry through 2012, we believe that we can deliver strong top line performance while improving our operating margin rate, which we see as a compelling combination in this environment.", "Now I would like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to 2 per person, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "My 2 questions would be, first, on the Charged Cotton distribution, as you gradually roll it out, can you give us a little more detail on whether it's a sort of a gradual rollout of expansion into existing customers, like a Dick's Sporting Goods? Or do you see it going further into the Footlockers and Finish Lines of the world? And any more color on -- is it more SKUs and different styles beyond t-shirts and shorts that we should be looking at? And then the second question, maybe for you, Brad, I just want to clarify, the guidance I think implied by what you're saying on footwear is we should expect footwear revenues to be down in the second quarter, any help on that would be great also.", "Brad Dickerson", "Robbie, so let me jump on the cotton question. First of all, I think that we view cotton is opening us up to a whole new consumer that this has given us a totally new dimension to the company. And while we are not trying to be as explicit in saying this is giving us new distribution, we think that this will access our existing distribution but takes us into the hearts and minds of an existing consumer, as well as opens us up to a new consumer. So we're pretty clear about how -- going from the $2 billion to $3 billion synthetic market that we play in today to more than shifting to that going into active use or something that we'll really expanding our addressable market. But more importantly, we see this being broad-based in everywhere where we sell Under Armour, we see acceptance of having Under Armour Charged Cotton. Some of these we're dealing with, though, is that getting into a program like this. This is millions of units. And so it's a new manufacturing base for us. It's a new supply chain. It's a lot of new pieces. And so I wouldn't say we are cautious but we are definitely -- we tempered ourselves as getting going, making sure that we could keep the fixtures that we've invested in to put in stores, keep the fixtures full and making sure that the supply chain is in place to service that. So we've been very pleased with the sell-through. It's actually exceeded expectations where we sold it, exceeded expectations for our retailers as well. And you look at where we're starting to see this product really come into play. Our entry price point in the past has been what we call our tech tee at $20. And we're seeing the consumer who look at that again without cannibalizing that category for us, but it's the consumer's who's going a tech tee at $20 is there still seeing we're seeing them buying the tech tee. But more importantly, we're also seeing them trade up and spend money on a $25 cotton t-shirt as well. So I think in 1 we've got a new product category, a new market and also take an ASP for our retailers.", "Kevin Plank", "Robbie, on the footwear question, sorry for the confusion there. But our highest dollar volumes quarter for footwear are going to be Q1 and Q2. However, our highest growth rate for footwear this year will be Q2 and Q3. So you will see footwear revenues up in Q2 and Q3. Obviously, Q1 footwear is driven by baseball, and Q2 is driven by football. Also year-over-year, last year, we shipped our running footwear a little bit late in Q3 for back-to-school. We'll get more of that out in Q2 this year, so you would see some good growth in footwear in Q2.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks very much guys.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Robbie.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair & Company.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I had a bigger picture question on the International business. I guess as you're investing in some of the other kind of sponsorships overseas, should we think about the International business becoming less profitable before becoming more profitable? And I guess, how do you expect to be the sales ramp there to really occur over the next 5 years, Kevin, I think you've made comments about wanting to make a splash at the next World Cup.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I think we're tempering that as well as we recognize that 90 plus percent of our revenues is coming from home-based. And so the theory that we use from we deploy period that we use when we deploy the resources and that means time, money and people, our #1 protect that we have and that is the 90 plus percent of our business is coming from here at home. But the second criteria we use is making sure that every decision we make has global implications. And so the decisions to go after something like Tottenham, you look at places where it affected the deals that we didn't do and whether it's traditional colleges, whether broader or standard deals that we potentially do with some of the bigger leagues here the U.S., are dollars that we said decided to deploy outside of the United States. So I think that we are -- we believe in being a global business, which our definition of that means that half of our revenues will come from the outside of the United States. And the way that we are thinking about doing that I think is pretty measured. We're very fortunate to have the success that we do right now in a growing Direct-to-Consumer business, up over 53% for the year. Our largest business 70% of what we do is in apparel, up over 30% for the quarter as well. And I think those two successes allowed us to really fund the longer term investments. So the more near-term longer term of that, that we see is footwear. And we've seen success in footwear that's coming on in the back half this year as we said we have seen success we the running shoe that is coming out. And we've got some styles in '11 but I think feel very good about it, the running category is going to look like for us. But really as we get into '12 and we get into the '13, we see that business coming on. The longer term investments that we're making right now is happening within international. And so we plan more than 10 years in Japan, $100 plus million business in 2010. And again as things normalize there, we see continued growth in trajectory. The recent opening that we're having in China, find the ability to deploy dollars there that will get us started. And we see that those things, not unlike the comparison is to a good dollar line but something that will begin to come on for us in 3 or 4 years. And so we feel very good about -- I think Europe as we're sitting here 5 or 6 in Europe. The timing for making the investment in cotton is something that's prudent. And I think it's a worthy investment. In fact we think it's even bigger and more global than just the U.K.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And can you talk about how much of your SG&A is dedicated for non-U.S. at this point?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Sharon, we only break that out on -- but again, I think that to Kevin's point, I think that 90% of our business is here in the United States, and then you would expect that the majority of our investment is really focused on protecting what's here in the U.S. and also protecting what our near-term growth drivers are around apparel and Direct-to-Consumer.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Tracy of FBR Capital Markets.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "If I can focus on the gross margin, first, just from the quarter perspective, Brad, I think you mentioned the less favorable apparel mix. Just want to get sort of what exactly was going in there and then sort of bigger picture as you go to the balance of the year, the 100 basis points down year-over-year, is it possible to quantify those buckets as you talk about via the input cost how the Direct-to-Consumer helps to offset and then the level of surprise, and I know it's been surgical to date. But the level of pricing you put through and then maybe quantify how we should think about that building in FY '12?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure. On gross margin for Q1 in apparel, really the mix there is again this is just some lower margin product mix. Cotton obviously we've talked about having some cotton in Q1 some growth there in cotton is coming a little bit less margin as we saw the product pressure, costing pressure around cotton came in a little earlier than the oil-based synthetics. So just a little bit of a mix issue there on apparel, which created 50 basis points down for the year in the quarter. For the full year, not ready to break out and categorize the individual things I called out. But obviously, as you look at the 100 basis points in total, 1 of the things the hats and bags business in-house which is the business model change from a licensing model to in-house model, so more dollars to the bottom line but does negatively impact gross margins this year on a comp basis. You'll see the biggest pressure there on Q2 and Q3 where we're comping the highest royalty revenue last year in hats and bags. So you'll see the biggest impact there in Q2 and Q3. Footwear in general, again, returning to growth and some of obvious sourcing pressures in footwear also that's facing the industry too. So you'll see some pressures there again. But just to answer the question before, specifically, around Q2, as we saw in Q1 with footwear towards the back half of the year, footwear becomes a smaller number in total. So it's not as impactful on the back half of the year. ", "On the apparel side, although we did see some pricing pressures in Q1, most of the pricing pressures we talked about in our last call really were focus more towards the back of the year as we start getting to fall winter and that big key programs up in fall and winter, and it was really just a few select key programs it was not broad-based at all. Because it is that we probably had some room in any events kind of raise prices based on our premium position. So they'll come into play in the back half of 2011. And it really kind of wrapped up with Direct-to-Consumer on top of it. Obviously Direct-to-Consumer growing faster than the overall business will help mitigate a lot of that, especially around Q4. Where we have a high volume and direct consumer year-over-year obviously, just growth to.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. And then, Kevin, if you think about the Direct-to-Consumer business, obviously, the outlook format has been highly successful. I know you tested some of the full line stores in the past. Any kind of thought to bringing that back into the mix, or how should we just think about that longer term in terms of sort of an opportunity to carve out your own distribution?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, we have 63 outlets today. We are anticipating roughly 80 by the end of the year. I think that gives us a lot of versatility as a brand with the opportunity for liquidation to move inventory when we need to. So we've obviously seen the benefits of what having controlling your own distribution can mean. I want to reiterate, we have great partners, and we still see great growth within maybe the existing doors that we are in today and that we've been for many years. So same time, long-term, we see from a factory base standpoint, about 110 to 120 stores is the opportunity we have. But we often see the ability to test in different concepts because the goal and the reason that we have are in distribution is to supplement where our current partners are not in. And so we mentioned places like Sevierville, Tennessee that we talked about a few times. But I think, there's 1 or 2 sporting goods stores within an 80- or 90-mile radius of that store. And of course, outperforming from an outlook standpoint because that proves to be the only place the consumer within that range can find our brand. So we still believe we are underdistributed as a company. And I think that we will continue to test different options that will give us the ability to satisfy those needs for our consumers. So there's nothing that we're looking to do to cannibalize existing distributions. Our goal remains if we can find the right opportunities with the right presentation. And frankly, I think there's an opportunity to have a comprehensive presentation of the Under Armour brand that we're still pushing that a, within retail partners. And I think we also have the ability and someday to do that ourselves.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Thanks guys. Best of luck.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Pamela Quintiliano with Oppenheimer.", "Pamela Quintiliano - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just had a quick question on your approach to the escalating sourcing costs and between the apparel and the cotton and the oil component which you talked about and also footwear, if you can just give us more clarity on where you're seeing the most pressure and kind of what you're forecasting going forward. And along those lines, are you coming more aggressive or thinking about becoming even more aggressive taking ownership to safety stock?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Pamela, this is Brad. If you break out the sourcing from apparel and footwear and look at that separately. First, from the footwear side, the majority of our footwear manufacturing is being done in China right now, and there's been a lot more pressure in not only commodity price but also labor price in China. So like a lot of other brands, I think heavily are more weighted towards China in manufacturing. You see some pricing pressures there. So how we're approaching that is trying to mitigate this going forward by maybe moving some of that manufacturing out of the coastal areas of China where we see the most pressure on labor, either to in-land China or to other parts of Southeast Asia where labor is less of a price pressure. So that will take a little bit of time. So we'll continue to see some of these rising pressures in footwear in the near-term for this year. And as we look to get into the back half of 2012, maybe start to have some more impacts around moving some of those manufacturings to different parts of the world. On the apparel side now, the same issue that we've been talk about commodity price pressures but also labor in China is an issue to people rate also but the good news for us in apparel is that less than 10% of our apparel is manufactured in China, so that's not as much of an issue for us. On the commodities pricing side, I think everybody kind of saw the impact to cotton come in play a little earlier than the impact to oil-based synthetics. So for us, a little less pricing pressure in the front half of 2011 because we're more obviously heavy weighted to oil based synthetics, but if we got into the back half of '11, we're starting those a little less pricing pressure in the front half of 2011 because we're more obviously heavily weighted to oil based synthetics. But as we got to the back of 2011, come into play to. And obviously, as we talked about taking some key styles up in fall winter '11 will help to offset and mitigate some of those pricing pressures. As we look forward in 2012 with apparel, much more broad-based increase in prices. We have talked on our last call about a mid-single digit increase in the back half of '11 in product cost. And we're seeing a similar type of increase as we get into Spring/Summer '12 on top of that fall winter increase. But as we stated, we're looking and analyzing more of a broad-based view of our products in Spring/Summer '12 and how we can increase prices to help mitigate that.", "Pamela Quintiliano - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And just as a follow-up on that given you're so early in your Charged Cotton launch, do you see it as an opportunity potentially from the pricing perspective how do you view that? Do you want to try to attract new customers so you're going to not take the opportunity to take pricing there despite demand? Or is that something where because it's an open field there's more of an opportunity to take pricing?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think and again, I don't want to speak for fall winter '11 but for Spring/Summer '12 and forward, I think again more broader based deals around our products in total. And to see where we think that we have that premium position to increase prices and that will include cotton products. So I think we see enough value in our products. Oil-based synthetics and cotton where we have that ability we think to increase prices again based on our premium positions.", "Kevin Plank", "Just to add to that. I think there's a little bit of latency from our manufacturing base as well how can this program be. So I think we're coming in with a pretty good check book around the size of those cotton products. So we don't believe that we've maximized the supply chain yet it with being in the best shops, and we have some great partners, so we think there's more opportunities within that back. So I think from the increased demand and increased production that we'll be driving the opportunities there as well as I think the consumer really likes the product. And so we won't be restricted to being tapped out on the price of the top side either. So we have a lot of flexibility both top and bottom.", "Pamela Quintiliano - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Great. Best of luck.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Just a follow-up on the last line of questioning, I think you did comment on some new components in the supply chain around Charged Cotton, sounds like demand has been good initially. Do you feel like you've been able to ship enough products at this point to meet demand? Or has there been a governor on your ability to your sales because of some of new supply chain components specifically?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think the same thing we talked about in the back half of this year has come into the front half of '11. So the conversation that we have around inventory and increasing safety stock levels and also taking some more positions in seasonal products is really starting to come to kind of fruition here in the front half of this year in Q1 and Q2. From a cotton perspective, for the most part, for 2011, we've kind of kept our position as far as how much cotton we're going to put in the marketplace based on our current forecast. But again, from a core auto replenishment safety stock level for again our oil-based synthetics products, we're increasing that perspective here in the front half of the year to better to be able to meet demand were to back of the year. As far as fill rates and service levels have gone, we've seen those improve with that investment as we got to the back half of 2010, and the front half of 2011, so it appears obviously investment is paying off for us.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And is there any way you can get some incremental color on what the increase in CapEx is for -- can we expect to refresh and some of the Under Armour pad and some of your big sporting goods retailer later this year or maybe how that will flow quarter-to-quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think there's not much of a timing, I think, issue relative to seasonal Spring/Summer versus fall winter. But I think on the CapEx side, the retail marketing side, there is some refresh going on. But there's also some ability for us to take some extra floor space at some of our key retail partners, and we did have some fixturing to do that and obviously that makes sense for taking the floor space.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then if I could just ask 1 last question on the gross margin from footwear there. I think the negative 100 basis points is probably going to be summer of a surprise for people today. I mean do you feel like that's a bigger impact, and you're maybe expecting last time we talked to you guys, and do you think that, that's still fluid and something we need to keep an eye on for the rest of the year at this point?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, again, although we didn't really quantify the full year impact, the gross margins in the last call our view of gross margin for the year remains relatively the same as with our last call. So there really wasn't too many surprises there year-over-year. I think the interesting thing in footwear too though is at the offset of some of that 100 basis points on the costing side is the benefit we're seeing from really being clean at retail with inventory levels for footwear, and that's helped reduce our kind of markdown in return reserves, which had a 40 basis point improvement to offset the 100 basis points. So I think we got some sourcing costing pressures there. But you have overall cleaner and more healthy position of footwear going forward. So I think you're going to see a similar type of thing in Q2 as you've seen in Q1 relative to footwear because Q1 and Q2 are the highest volume quarters for footwear. As you get to the back half of the year, footwear becomes a smaller component of our overall business.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Thanks, Brad.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Duffy of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Brad, a couple of follow-ups on the pricing line of question, first, will you be taking price in footwear as well? And then as a look to the Spring/Summer '12 price increase in apparel, many in the apparel industry are talking double-digit price increases. As you think about your pricing strategy, are you pricing to the increase in cost of goods to protect margin? Or are you following the pricing trends of the industry?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, first on footwear, again, I think we're going to have a broad-based approach across all of our product categories, and we're kind of in the middle of that right now in analyzing where we think they have the ability to do that. So footwear will be open to that analysis, just like hats and bags and apparel would be. So that will be included in our analysis, and again we'll give more color on that later in the year as we have more detail around that. On the apparel side, I think along the lines of what Kevin was saying too, it's not just about raising prices. So our ability to look in where we can save in costing is important to us. Our ability to maybe move from lower margin products to higher margin products is also important to us. And also, I think reaching out and maybe making a little bit longer term commitments to some of our key factory bases, especially around some of our core auto replenishment type products, I think, also can help mitigate some of those costing pressures, too. So raising prices is kind of one tool we have as our premium position. But we're looking at all different types of things we can do relative to mitigating some of those cost pricing pressures.", "Kevin Plank", "Jim, I'll jump on there too is that innovation is the greatest validator to price. And so I think from -- we were the first company to sell a $25 t-shirt volume of volume more than 15 or 16 years ago. And I think as we continue to come back and lead the industry from a thought leadership standpoint, with the products that we have and the shirts that we had that combined, I think, will just illustrate above our commitment to innovation. But probably more importantly, we're going to sell a lot of $25 cotton t-shirts because of it. And frankly, it's not just another basic cotton t-shirt. It's a cotton t-shirt that drives 5 times faster than anything else in the market. And so that is something I think the consumer has demonstrated the ability and their willingness to pay for in the past. And I think as we maintain that premium positioning, we'll have a lot more flexibility the most. So we don't see ourselves driving in. This is not how we're going to keep up with our $12 or $13 Cotton T-shirt business but how are we taking $25 in fact in expanding those price points as well.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I understand. And you guys have done a great job with the innovation. I guess, I'm thinking from a standpoint -- the consumer is seeing the backdrop of double-digit -- even with those cost savings that you're putting in place, could you potentially use pricing as a source of margin as you look to 2012? Or is that not a lever you would pull?", "Kevin Plank", "We don't like it. We have a very consistent model when it comes to gross margin. And it comes to our approach the margin for the consumers basically. As we build it, I said this before but we find what's the problem in the market. And then we find what's the best solution to solve that problem. We source the ends of the world to find the most efficient way to make that on behalf of our consumer. Whatever that causes to build to effectively double the cost of that, sell to our wholesale partner and allow them to double it again. And so whether it's a $20 t-shirt or $200 jacket, that model stays pretty consistent. And I think that's something that keeps us in favor with the consumer and frankly builds the trust that will keep Under Armour here and relevant for the next 5, 10 years and beyond. So that approach is something that we want to make sure we keep doing. But we source, we frankly we see ourselves sourcing on behalf of our consumer deliver as much value back to them as possible. But of course there's opportunities where we can take advantage because we like our gross margins in those high 40s and that 50 range. And so that is a long-term target for us as a brand.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michelle Tan of Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Sorry if you addressed part of this earlier. But I had a couple of questions on the full year guidance. First, I was wondering if you're expecting the contribution from the new cotton platform to accelerate in the second half versus the first half as you introduce the things like Storm Cotton? And then as you look at the guidance raised from 3 months ago, can you give us a sense of exactly what drivers are shaping up better than you expected at the start of the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Michelle, on the cotton seasonality, I really don't see any significant fluctuations in cotton seasonality compared to our overall Apparel business. It should flow through relatively the same as our overall Apparel business. So obviously, again the back half of the year, the cotton product will have higher ASPs in the back of the as well as our other products, too. So there's not really any seasonality impact of cotton as opposed through our business. As far as the call up in our outlook, not surprisingly is the 2 things we keep calling out to strengthen our business right now in the near term, that's apparel across all channels and then Direct-to-Consumer, via the growth in our factory help store base and also some good strength in our e-commerce business. So those are the real drivers there that are giving us the ability to call our numbers up.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just on the cotton question, when you look at that, I understand the seasonality is similar, are you expanding the level of sell in or distribution more significantly with the expanded product line? So the seasonality on like-for-like product is similar but there's actually more product out there in the second half relative to your total?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think we're taking a more proactive approach on price as well. The good news is that we're just entering this market, so we have a lot of styles that will be coming onto market. And that we haven't set price or established a precedent with the consumer of something that they are expecting. So there's obviously that supply and demand curve, one affects the other. So we want to be a commercial product in the market. We want to be available, we want to be premium product available to most. And as we approach that, strong cotton is a great example of that. We're entering what is seemingly a pretty dry and a pretty boring category of business and we're going to go at a premium price. But frankly with the innovation standpoint, our product unlike anyone has ever seen before. And so we think there's going to be a lot of hype and excitement, and I think as the summer demonstrated any market that if you get a great product out there and you communicate a great story about a product, and frankly just works the consumer that always be there for you. So we feel pretty good about that.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Michelle.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kate McShane of Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Just to go back again to the sourcing side of the discussion, I wondered if you had any issues or have encountered any issues with availability of capacity at the factories and based on the demand for your product, have you had to air freight any of these products?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Kate, obviously, last year as we started talking about demand, servicing demand issues, air freight became a bigger component of our story. But in total from a margin perspective, it wasn't really a huge impact last year. And we're seeing similar levels this year in the front half of '11. I think obviously with our ability to complete our investment and getting safety stock levels up as we get to the back half of the year, that should help mitigate some air freight numbers but those again out of that significant our overall gross margins. On the capacity side, we've got pretty good bench strength right now, and some new factories for is coming online, and I think capacity is always a challenge when you're trying to meet demand. But we feel pretty good about where we're at right now with the capacity especially from our larger suppliers, and we've had some pretty good bench strength coming forward.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "And then my second question is a little bit longer term about your strategy, about pushing more into Europe. And I know you've mentioned in the past that the London Olympics are going to be a leveraging point for you. What can we expect to see, is there any update with that strategy, and when will we start to see the sell-in for that event?", "Kevin Plank", "I think where you'll see us continue to leverage the big assets that we have. And we did a pretty good job at the last Winter Olympics with the U.S. bobsled and ski and of course we have our ongoing relationship with Michael Phelps as well. I think there's a lot of big stories but 1 of the things were looking to do in line particularly is to leverage the new deal that we have with Cotton. And I think we're clear to say that our strategy globally, it's more of a 10 and a 20 year plan and we don't want to bite off more than we can handle today because again, as I said earlier on the call, our first priority is protecting what we have, which is a 90% plus of our business here at home. But of course our long-term goal is driving that relationship to being more than 50% of our revenues from coming outside of the U.S. And so Olympics is 1 of the keys to that. But in fact that the investment that we're making in cotton, the hype that we'll be in London in the summer of 2012 when this deal commences is going to be a great platform for us, as well to utilize and to be able to leverage. And so you're not going to see official range from Under Armour today, and I don't think that's a prudent spend of our dollars. What you'll see is being thoughtful and strategic about places where we can be impactful in utilizing the assets that we do have like the Michael Phelps and some of the other places. But we'll have relationships with the Olympics and we'll be a little more forthcoming as soon as come in the future. But I think you're not going to see Under Armour blank at the Olympics. But you'll absolutely know that we're there. I think that will be very telling and sort of where we are at the moment in time in Europe and particularly in international. And so we've demonstrated a pretty good ability I think to probably come across bigger than we are. And I think that we'll anticipate doing that with overspending and making $1 spend like $3, a favored analogy that we use around here.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Operator, we'll take one more question.", "Operator", "Our final question is from Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Thank you for taking my question. I guess I wanted to just clarify what you said about the footwear plans for the balance of the year. So Q2 is going to be the largest quarter, then Q2 and Q3 are the largest quarters as a percent increase over the prior year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, if you look at the full year for footwear and seasonality of footwear, Q1 and Q2 are the largest volume quarters in 2011. The largest growth quarters year-over-year are Q2 and Q3.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And you've talked about running and so, where do we stand with basketball? Where does that fit in, and I would think that could be some opportunities for the back half of the year?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, we've got a big push I think that a lot of the growth that we saw in the first quarter, a lot of that was coming from basketball because obviously that was new business for us. But we're staying pretty consistent with the theme that we have. We're very tight with the distribution. We're very tight with the number of doors we have out there. We're still learning a lot about the product. But we have some products that we like very much, and we've seen some really good success with some buying. The 1 thing we are looking for is the kid going to accept as a footwear brand if they can't accept us a basketball footwear brand. And we're not getting any of that reluctance, and so as we continue to become more important in sort of the social conscience of this consumer, who would not only on court, I think we've demonstrated our ability to be a great on court supplier within basketball. And I think we needed to just keep moving that exposure. So 1 thing I will tell you that you will see from us in the back half of the year, you will see great storytelling from us around basketball in the back half of the year. People will know that we are in the basketball business. And frankly today, Sam, I'm not sure that we've gotten that message out yet. But I'll tell you that there will be an emphasis around the messaging that we're making there.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then, thank you. And then to that messaging question, marketing spend as a percent of sales, I mean, how we should think of that on a full year basis this year, given the numerous new initiatives that you really have this year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, consistent with our previous outlook around marketing, it should be relatively flat as a percentage of revenues year-over-year right now based on our view. A little more front end of the year weighted as a percentage of total marketing spend compared to last year. But again, similar percentage in total for the year.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "So around 12%?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, last year, we were 12%, correct.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "All right. You already answered the question about the Olympics. So thank you very much.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks very much, Sam. I appreciate it. Thank you, everyone, for your time today.", "Tom Shaw", "Thanks for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting to you our second quarter 2011 results, which tentatively have been scheduled for Tuesday, July 26 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Last month, we held our Investor Day here in Baltimore and laid out our strategy to double revenues between 2010 and 2013. We identified the key growth drivers we'll need to execute on in order to deliver that growth. And today, we're providing our first update against those drivers. From a gross perspective, there are a number of highlights. direct consumer revenues grew 81% in Q2. Footwear revenues were up 31%, and our largest business, apparel, grew 36%, led by the strong introduction of Charged Cotton. These numbers are great evidence that we continue to deliver against the promise of the Under Armour brand, and are delivering the innovation our consumers expect from the thought leaders in performance. ", "For Under Armour, thought leadership means finding the answer to a simple question, \"How do we create technical breakthroughs that change the way a  product is used by athletes?\" Our brand was founded on a single insight around athletic performance, and the innovation that grew out of that has taken us over the billion dollar mark. We set the bar, and athletes have come to expect us to take them to some place new. But our opportunity now is so much greater. With the strength of what we built so far, we can now take our brand to a whole new audience of athletes. ", "In March, we brought the next generation of Under Armour innovation to every athlete's closet with our introduction of Charged Cotton. We looked in the athlete's closet and saw that the overwhelming majority of their t-shirts were cotton. We had an incredibly high share of their non-cotton t-shirts, but understand that the broader opportunity in getting a disproportionate of share in cotton as well. But we could only accomplish that by bringing innovation to the cotton category and changing the way athletes use the product. With our entry into performance cotton, we are just beginning to tap into this broader audience of athletes. We see Charged Cotton as our path nearly quadrupling our 2010 addressable market in apparel from the previous $3 billion market side to the more than $11 billion active use market, while continuing to blur the lines of a much larger $58 billion activewear market over time. ", "Our strong launch of Charged Cotton and our continued strength across core apparel, such as baselayer in training, help drive the 36% increase in U.S. apparel revenues. We're especially proud of driving this level of revenue growth in apparel, considering it comes off of 34% growth in Q2 of last year. We see these quarterly results as continued evidence that performance apparel remains the key driver of industry strength, and Under Armour continues to drive that leadership, especially from a premium pricing perspective. We feel very good about the strength of our core business, and we continue to lead the industry in share ASPs and most importantly, innovation.", "In an important core category like baselayer, we remain a full-price brand. We continue to widen the gap between UA and our competitors in the category from an average selling price perspective, and are doing so by raising consumers' expectations around products through innovation that changes how they use our apparel. We'll continue raising the bar with our recent introduction of the next chapter in our Charged Cotton story, Storm Fleece. It's a water-resistant cotton hoody made of a heavyweight and durable cotton, and we're bringing a new level of performance to one of the most basic pieces in the athletes' closet. This is what our consumers expect from Under Armour, and we will continue to deliver this level of innovation as we grow our addressable market well beyond compression.", "We built our apparel business on a platform of authenticity. At Investor Day last month, we discussed how we are building that same authentic platform in our footwear business. So while we remain focused on the long-term opportunity in footwear, we are showing signs of solid growth both on field and at retail. ", "First, we continue to get our shoes on the feet of champions, as the University of South Carolina took home their second consecutive NCAA baseball championship wearing Under Armour head to toe, including fleece. And with the NFL about to get back on to the field, we will be on the feet of not only the lead MVP and Tom Brady, but on the league's most watched new player in Cam Newton. ", "At retail, we are seeing some positive developments in footwear as well. Our Assert running shoe had strong sell-through in the second quarter, as we look to build the same level of authenticity with runners as we have with football and baseball players. We know it takes time to build that credibility as we enter each new category, but we're going about it in an authentic and surgical way. We are building credibility with runners in the same way we did with football and baseball players, with great product that solves an athlete's needs and looks as good as it performs. ", "Our other key deliverable in footwear is to raise awareness levels to make more consumers know that we are an authentic and growing footwear brand. Our multimedia back-to-school footwear campaign will include many of our top athletes, including Tom Brady, Cam Newton, and UFC fighting champion, Georges St-Pierre, and will be our first brand campaign where footwear takes center stage. We'll be introducing our Micro G cushioning technology to consumers in the campaign that will feature 2 new running shoes: the Split and the Charge RC. We've begun to shift the momentum in footwear with a strong product like the Assert, the Split and the Charge RC. We're also working closely with our partners, Foot Locker and the Finish Line, to deliver exclusive products that will help differentiate the Under Armour brand in the mall. ", "In basketball, we're going to bring the Under Armour product DNA to our footwear and be laser-focused on fit. Brandon Jennings signature shoe, the Micro G Bloodline, will launch in Q4. And we'll also have our newest athletes, basketball players Kemba Walker of the Charlotte Bobcats and Derrick Williams of the Minnesota Timberwolves, both top 10 picks in the recent NBA draft, wearing Under Armour basketball footwear this season. We talked at Investor Day about building the platform for long-term growth. We are able to make the needed investments in footwear and international and still show the increase in operating leverage that Brad will discuss. Because in part, our growth in apparel and our direct consumer business continues to outpace even our own expectations. ", "With 81% revenue growth in direct consumer this quarter, we continue to reach new consumers both online and at our retail doors. And as our product mix continues to expand, we're able to offer a much wider breadth of products in our DTC sales channel as well. This allows us to build bigger footprints  for our Factory House stores and begins to leverage the opportunities in both footwear and apparel as we go deeper into the athlete's closet. With our continued growth in direct consumer, we've learned to become better retailers, and this is helping us improve our retail presentation within our existing key wholesale partners. As we grow our presence in footwear and accessories, we will be able to tell more integrated product stories at retail. This summer, we are launching a new concept in Dick's Sporting Goods called All-American shops, featuring an enhanced shopping experience with more efficient fixtures and the capacity to tell great head to toe product stories. We will install 50 All-American shops by the end of 2011 with a more aggressive rollout in 2012. The very best of these shops, what we're calling blue-chip All-American, will feature interactive digital centers, larger floor space and what can be described as monumental storytelling. And the blue-chip All-American shop that is being installed at Dick's Roosevelt Field on Long Island upon completion will be the largest single retail presentation for our brand in the world.", "With the Sports Authority, we're introducing Armour  Build 2.0, which involves an all-new innovative and flexible fixture package for better storytelling and more productive floor space. Expect this expansion of Armour Build in 100 of their doors by the end of this year. In the improvement in our retail presentation, it doesn't stop there. In all, we will be enhancing our presentation in more than 700 new shops over our existing distribution over the next 12 months. Combined with the next generation of our e-commerce site, which debuts this fall and the improvements we're making to our own retail stores, we will be impacting the retail presentation of over 50% of our revenues. ", "We're also taking our first steps into retail outside of the United States this year. Through our distribution partners, we've opened a new UA store in South Korea, a second store in Japan and the first UA store in Madrid in just the last quarter. We also opened our first store in Shanghai and are learning as much about the operations required for a store in China as we are about the consumer. We're planting the seeds to tell the full Under Armour story globally, much like we did with football and baseball cleats in footwear more than 5 years ago. And these new doors help provide a great platform to do that. ", "In summary, our industry is in a very strong growth mode, and Under Armour continues to drive that growth through product and thought leadership. By bringing innovation through a new audience of athletes, we are growing the industry and bringing new consumers into the performance market. As a team, we are committed to getting our operational capabilities to the same level of execution and leadership as our brand and products, so that we can fully benefit from the demand of our consumers. We believe we will make our operational platform a world-class partner to our products and brand competencies. We will invest in the people, processes and systems to fully leverage the power of the Under Armour brand. We believe we will double revenues from 2010 to 2013 and show operating leverage as well. While our rate of growth may vary from quarter-to-quarter, it will always be driven by our ability to innovate, to continue finding new ways to improve the products that make all athletes perform better. With that as our number one goal, we will work as a team to fully realize the incredible financial opportunity provided by being the athletic brand of this generation and next. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our second quarter and year-to-date financial results, as well as our updated 2011 guidance.", "Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2011 increased 42% to $291 million. Year-to-date, net revenues are up 39% to $604 million. Apparel grew 36% to $205 million during the quarter, our highest quarterly growth rate for the category since the third quarter of 2007. Apparel was up 35% year-to-date and continues to see broad-based strength across each of our men's, women's and youth categories. As Kevin mentioned, we are pleased with our Charged Cotton launch, and the program remains on track to generate approximately $60 million of net revenues in 2011. And as we have discussed, we will launch the next chapter of our Charged Cotton story, Storm Fleece, this September. ", "Beyond the training category, which includes Charged Cotton, we are also seeing strong growth in our graphics business, which more than doubled during the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 81% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date, representing approximately 27% and 24% of net revenues, respectively, as compared to 21% and 20% in the prior year period. We opened 9 new Factory House stores during the second quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 72, up 60% from 45 locations at the end of last year's second quarter. We expect approximately 7 additional Factory House stores to open in 2011, bringing our total door count by year end to 79. In addition, we expect to open our first hybrid store model this October. ", "Growth in our e-commerce business, which remains strong from -- primarily by higher traffic and conversion rates year-over-year, and we expect our new web platform to go live this fall. Footwear net revenues during the second quarter increased 31% to $47 million from $36 million last year, representing 16% of net revenues. Growth was predominantly driven by our running products led by our Assert products and initial selling of some of our back-to-school products. We continue to see greater 2011 footwear growth concentrated in the second and third quarters. Accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 266% to $32 million from $9 million last year, reflecting the addition of our hats and bags business, which we brought in-house in January and which has also received strong consumer acceptance. We now expect our hats and bags business to contribute an incremental $70 million of net revenue in 2011, up from our prior guidance of an incremental $60 million.", "International net revenues increased 58% to $14 million in the second quarter and represent  approximately 5% of total net revenues. Growth was driven primarily by results in the EMEA region. As expected, our licensing revenues in Japan through our partners at Dome Corporation were impacted in the quarter by the March earthquake and tsunami. We are starting to see some recovery in this market, and still expect our overall business there to be up meaningfully year-over-year in 2011. Licensing net revenues declined 27% to $7 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by the transition of our hats and bags business in-house and the year-over-year pressure with our licensing business in Japan that I just mentioned. ", "Second quarter gross margins were 46.3% compared with 48.8% in the prior year's quarter. We had 3 primary factors contributing to the 250 basis point gross margin contraction. First, in apparel, less favorable product mix, input costs and sales allowances negatively impacted margins by 160 basis points. Second, a lower mix of licensing net revenues negatively impacted margins by approximately 120 basis points. Both the hats and bags' transition to in-house and the recent challenges for our Japanese licensees were key factors. And finally, we continue to generate a higher percentage of net revenues from our higher margin direct-to-consumer business, which grew 81% during the period, positively impacting margins by approximately 45 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged to 42.4% in the second quarter of 2011 from 45.4% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows. First, marketing costs declined to 11.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.4% in the prior year period. While we experienced some shifting of dollars from the first quarter into the second quarter, our strong top line growth allowed us to leverage marketing costs during the second quarter. Second, selling costs increased slightly to 10.5% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.4% in the prior year period, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores and investments in our e-commerce business. Third, product innovation and supply chain costs decreased slightly to 10.7% of net revenues from 10.8% last year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to invest in these areas to support our long-term growth. But we were able to show a modest leverage given the strength of our top line. Finally, corporate services decreased to 9.5% of net revenues, compared to 10.8% in the prior year period as we leveraged corporate personnel, IT and facility expenses. ", "Operating income during the second quarter grew nearly 65% to $11 million compared with $7 million in the prior year. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 3.9% from 3.4% in the prior year quarter. Our second quarter tax rate of 41.7% was favorable to the 43% rate in the prior year period. Our resulting net income in the second quarter increased 78% to $6.2 million, compared with $3.5 million in the prior year period. Second quarter diluted earnings per share increased 73% to $0.12, compared with $0.07 in the prior year. ", "Now on to the key balance sheet items. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end decreased to 23% to $120 million, compared with $156 million at June 30, 2010. We have no borrowings outstanding on our $300 million revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we did take out the $25 million term loan, and was included in the overall credit facility to finance part of our purchase of our corporate headquarters here in Baltimore. The closing for the purchase took place in early July 2011. In connection with the closing, we also assume a $38.6 million loan attached to the property. Inventory at quarter end increased 74% year-over-year to $311 million compared to $179 million at June 30, 2010. Similar to last quarter, 2 factors contributed to our inventory growth during the quarter. The transition of our hats and bags business in-house and an earlier plan build of our ColdGear apparel for the 2011 fall/winter season. Excluding these factors, inventory would have increased approximately 57%, compared to our net revenues growth of 42% and reflecting our ongoing efforts to better service anticipated demand. Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $20 million in the second quarter and approximately $32 million year-to-date. We are now planning capital expenditures for 2011 toward the high end of our previously indicated range of $45 million to $50 million. In addition to our normal operating capital expenditure plans, we'll have approximately $65 million in total investments  for 2011, related to the just completed purchase of our corporate headquarters along without other investments and improvements in the campus. ", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2011. Previously, we anticipated 2011 net revenues of $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, an increase of 29% to 31% over 2010, and 2011 operating income of $149 million to $153 million, an increase of 33% to 36% over 2010. Given our current visibility, we are raising this full year 2011 outlook. We now anticipate 2011 net revenues in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.44 billion, an increase of 33% to 35% over 2010, and 2011 operating income in the range of $155 million to $160 million, an increase of 38% to 42% over 2010. Our current guidance implies full year operating margins of between 10.9% to 11.1%, leveraging 30 to 50 basis points from the 10.6% level achieved in 2010. We expect additional gross margin pressure for the year to be more than offset by improved SG&A leverage due to our top line strength. We'll provide more details on this shortly. ", "Below the operating line, we continue to expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 40% in 2011. We are pursuing certain tax credits in the back half of the year similar to those obtained in 2010, which would enable us to improve on this rate. As a reminder, our full year effective tax rate in 2010 was 37.1%. Finally, we continue to anticipate fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $52.5 million to $52.7 million for 2011. ", "Now we'd like to provide some additional color around our outlook for the remainder of 2011. First, with respect to gross margins. We had previously outlined some of the headwinds we faced in 2011, including the transition of our hats and bags business from a licensing model to in-house and near-term challenges around apparel and footwear sourcing costs. As expected, these specific challenges are still in place with the impact largely unchanged from our previous guidance, this previous guidance call for gross margins to climb approximately 100 basis points in 2011. Over the past 6 months, we have raised our top line guidance by approximately $90 million or nearly 7%. There's a balance between trying to service the strong demand for our brand with our ability to execute operationally. The level of efficiencies and planning for and executing on this demand are not where we need them to be. Because of this challenge to meet demand and the continued near-term pressures around sourcing costs, we currently expect gross margins in 2011 to decline approximately 160 to 180 basis points, compared to our previous guidance that's down approximately 100 basis points. ", "Let me walk you through the factors that have led us to this change from our prior guidance. The first major factor relates to higher sales allowances. As we continue to chase increasing demand this year, we have not optimally serviced our wholesale accounts, resulting in higher sales allowances. The other major factor relates to the profitability of our Factory House channel. While our direct-to-consumer gross margin dollars will be significantly higher in 2011, our gross margin percentage in this channel will be lower than initially planned due to a higher mix of sales from lower margin close out product. These 2 factors are the primary drivers contributing to the change in our guidance on gross margins for the full year. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the greatest year-over-year gross margin pressure to occur in the third quarter, with declines expected to moderate for the fourth quarter. ", "As we have said on previous calls, we are building a long-term platform for growth and remain focus on investing in people, process and systems in order to gain efficiencies and leverage opportunities around gross margins. While servicing the strong demand for our product poses challenges to our operational platform, we are making important strides in building a team to make our supply chain a core competency. These included the hiring of a senior vice president of sourcing earlier this year who brings over 28 years of global sourcing expertise, and a senior vice president of planning hired earlier this month, who brings over 18 years of planning and supply chain experience. In addition to this leadership, we continue to add talent and are realigning our profits to help drive improvements in our supply chain. ", "Now to inventory, which as expected hit peak year-over-year growth levels during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we expect the year-over-year inventory growth rate to move more in line with our net revenues growth in both the third and fourth quarters. Part of this movement will reflect our lacking of incremental inventory investments, which we commenced in last year's third quarter to better service demand. We will also be shipping the ColdGear Evo part that we have been carrying in the past few quarters. We continue to work toward our goal of delivering a forward inventory turn of 3x and a 90% to 95% fill rate. Despite the additional gross margin pressure, our top line upside is allowing us to better leverage our SG&A expenses this year. Marketing is an area where we now plan to be at approximately 11.3% to 11.5% of net revenues, down from our prior guidance of approximately 12% of net revenues. Importantly, this lower spending percentage in no way means that we are sacrificing our ability to tell compelling product stories. Our second half plans include a new footwear advertising campaign, expanded basketball investments, including a TV campaign and the addition of 2 first-round draft picks to our roster, Derrick Williams and Kemba Walker. ", "And finally, we will invest with our leading retail partners in developing compelling new shop and shops and co-branded holiday commercials. This spending is expected to be concentrated in the third quarter where we expect a similar year-over-year rate of spending as a percentage of net revenues before leveraging in the fourth quarter. With these puts and takes, we are able to raise our operating income guidance and the high-end of our implied operating margin target by 10 basis points. While the near-term components of our operating margin structure have changed, we believe the challenges driving this are largely operational and a byproduct of strong consumer demand. We are taking the prudent steps to address these challenges and believe key leadership is in place to enact the changes. Now we'd like to open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "One of the follow-ups in some of Brad's more recent comments at the end of the call there on the gross -- the change in the gross margin outlook, can you help me walk through the higher sales allowances piece? How does that -- does that tie into the inventory build that you've had? Help me understand, is there inventory that you're not happy with it, or is it really a servicing the accounts issue?", "Brad Dickerson", "Omar, it's really more of a servicing the accounts issue. This item obviously stems for our ability or maybe more probably our inability to achieve a 90% to 95% fill rate on our wholesale customer orders. So it's basically either incentive or penalty to take product or our fill rate issues fall below that fill rate threshold over their delays in the receipt of the product, and we're seeing a little bit of both of those right now. So we did see an escalation in these allowances or we sometimes call pricing incentives last year, as we ran into some fill rate challenges that we called out last year. In fact, we called out this as a -- in our Q4 margin explanations last year as a reason for margins being impacted year-over-year last year. We had assumed in our original plan that we would have improved on this item year-over-year, as we move towards a more desired 3x forward inventory turn rate compared to some turn rates that were higher last year. But as we closed out May and June of this year, we were continued to see some challenges to get to that 90%, 95% fill rate, specifically around some of the Chase products that we're talking about. So even though we called our top line up $90 million from our original estimate 6 months ago, some of that revenue has been a little bit difficult for us to chase. So when we saw May and June's trend relative to sales allowances and pricing incentives, combined with early sights of this item in Q3, we revised our forecast and kind of tempered our outlook on our ability to gain improvement here for the remainder of the year. So as you look at going forward, it's a slight opportunity for the back half of this year compared to our forecast although obviously, we're not planning for it to happen this year but obviously a much, much larger opportunity in the longer term.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "And then one quick question on the international side, I thought it was interesting that you guys are opening more Under Armour stores. You mentioned one in Europe and some stuff happening in Asia. Can you talk about the balance of wholesale, retail, what you're learning internationally, why you're kind of moving maybe away from the wholesale business -- a little bit more towards on retail?", "Kevin Plank", "No, we're not. I think what we're doing is we're empowering the local partners that we're putting on the ground. So in many cases, that's either distributor relationships or licensing relationships. So in Japan, probably our most mature international market, we've got a partner there who's -- they have a really vibrant -- and the majority of their business is wholesale. But they're also complementing where not unlike we find here in the states where they don't have the ability to reach all the consumers they want to, they're going to open up full-price retail. So that's what's happened again in Japan opening their second full-price store there. It's something that, a, it's a great brand presentation, and it really provides a vision for many of the wholesale accounts too of what the power of brand can be and frankly, the breadth of the product line that we now have to offer and their ability to localize and make that important to the consumer. So as we're moving into other markets, creative being a good example, I think having that, I wouldn't call it a flagship, but I'd have that aspirational view of what can the Under Armour brand look like. I think in creative   it's a great place where it's painting a vision for many of the wholesale accounts of what our presentation can be and more traditional sporting goods or whatever that would that mean to a local market. So what's happening again, I think, that was a pretty big statement, in my script, of opening our second store in Japan, opening our first store in  Shanghai directly as a company in China, then what's happening in Madrid with distributor, as well as we're just beginning to see and feel some growth from the international. But again, this is more like planting seeds for the future and something that we anticipate harvesting 2, 3, 4 and 5 years out.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kate McShane of Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "With the NBA lockout, and I know there's still some time here before the NBA season even starts. But with having the 2 new draft picks as endorsers of your brand, is there any possibility that you'll move your basketball offerings up from the beginning of the season to maybe earlier in the fall?", "Kevin Plank", "A couple of things that we're working on now is how can we be opportunistic with -- if there is any time for the athletes because one of the things we're contemplating, it's probably a script that's been played before as okay, let's put our athletes together, and as we start breaking into new markets like China, we should take these guys on a roadshow. And I think what we're coming back to is sort of the back to basics of we know want to take these guys on a roadshow through the United States, and what you'll see is the amount of exposure where the ability, I think, it's a real testament to our team, particularly to our product team, the type of product that we're putting out there. We didn't go out to these athletes and pay them more money, and that's why they're with our brand. We went after these athletes, and they believe that we can bring something compelling to themselves and most importantly, give them a great product that will help improve their game. And the ability for them to endorse that to tell that story and to provide the social credibility as much as anything with the fact that Under Armour is a basketball brand, it's not going to happen overnight. But as we sit here in our seventh or eighth month of basketball, I think we're pretty opportunistic about what that category can mean for us.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "I wondered if you could give any inventory guidance for the rest of the year, where can we expect to see inventory levels at the end of 2011?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Kate, I think as we called out in the previous call, we peaked our growth rate in inventory here in the second quarter at 74%. So we expect as we get into Q3 and Q4 to start to get that growth rate more in line with our net revenues as we get into Q3 and Q4. So as our net revenues grew 42% in Q2, inventory growth 74%, you're going to see the delta between those 2 growth numbers come down much more significantly towards Q3 and Q4.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "If I look at some of the comments, Brad, that you made about the direct-to-consumer gross margin update, and the related to the higher close-out  product cost, does that imply to you that the made for factory strategy in that channel has started to level off, and we don't see that as an increasing driver going forward? Is that a fair assumption?", "Brad Dickerson", "Michael, I think some of the challenges that we're seeing around planning and execution in our wholesale channel we're also seeing in our direct-to-consumer channel. So obviously, growing our business 42% in the quarter and trying to plan and execute around that is a challenge in itself. And obviously, in the DTC business, which has grown 67% year-to-date, is also challenging. By adding 27 new doors this year, it's a lot of growth in the DTC channel. We're seeing some of the same pressures and challenges we see in the wholesale channel. So we originally planned for a benefit in gross margins for the year due to our DTC business and the plan levels of made for that we had in our original plans versus excess product. And we've been relatively satisfied with our made for strategy and the levels planned for this type of product. But we underestimated the capacity that we had to move excess product in addition to that made for. Our current guidance takes into account the capacity we have to move excess for the remainder of the year that we have this ability to now that we didn't a few months back. So although our Factory House margins in total are accretive to the overall company, this change from a more excess product being moved the back half of this year, is impacting the gross margin percentage. It's important, I think, to note even both the sales allowance, pricing incentives I mentioned before, and the change in the Factory House gross margin, both of these items involve adding incremental dollars to the top and bottom lines for 2011. So in the case of our wholesale business, our ability to meet, plan, demand is more specifically to this conversation. Chase on plan demand is a decision that although impacts gross margins negatively, it does add positive gross profit and operating income dollars to the bottom line. In the case of Factory House, identifying and planning for the appropriate optimum capacity resulted in us adding some additional revenue gross margin dollars, even though this mix attribute to a gross margin contraction from our previous guidance.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "And then, you mentioned in your sourcing team and if I could just change directions for a minute, what are some obviously, question one, with that would be we're obviously looking at input costs -- commodity cost levels that are much lower than last time we talked to you guys, and I'm sure you guys are starting to look at what the cost outlook is for early 2012 at this point. Obviously, you're going to have prices in place, price increases in place as well with the potential for input costs to be much, much lower. So maybe just an early look at what you're seeing as far as sourcing goes, but then also maybe some things excluding cotton that the sourcing -- the new sourcing team isn't finding as they start peeling back the onion and start really looking through the chain would be helpful.", "Kevin Plank", "Michael, I think, similar to we talked about in the last few times we spoke on the sourcing side is continued pressure, obviously, the back half of this year and into the first half of next year. So although there's been some relief in commodity prices, you really won't see the impact of some of that relief until you get in the back half of next year based on the timing of commitments and purchase orders and so forth. So as we talked about continued pressure, spring/summer '12, and we'll obviously give more guidance around our 2012 outlook in the future calls, it's important to note also that obviously, although cotton is a part of our product now, still, we weight more towards the synthetic fabrics, and the price of oil is up higher year-over-year. When you look at last year at this time versus this year, so there's some added pressure there on the synthetic side even though cotton prices have somewhat started to be relieved year-over-year. But in addition to those data points, I think bringing the expertise in-house that we talked about and the talent can help us plan and execute better going forward, especially as we get into the back half of 2012. So even with some pricing pressures, we see tremendous opportunity with the additional expertise and talent we brought in to help mitigate some of those cost pressures.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mitchel Kummetz of Robert Baird.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "First question on the gross margin outlook. Brad, you're not saying down 160 to 180 on the year, so how much of that -- can you be specific as to how much of that pressure is on the higher sales allowances and the weaker Factory House margins, and to what extent you think those margin pressures could potentially reverse themselves next year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Mitch. As far as the additional 60 to 80 basis points that were calling margins down, it's relatively even. Sales allowances and price incentives are a little bit more than the Factory House but pretty close as far as the call down. And as far as opportunities for next year, again, I think, planning and execution in supply chain are tremendous opportunities for us as we move forward. So the addition of some new leadership will take a little bit of time, but I think we should start to see some benefits there as get to the back half of next year.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Was there any expected pressure from those 2 gross margin items in your prior guidance of down 100, or is this all just the incremental pieces all from this -- it wasn't -- there wasn't really something expected in the guidance previously?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, there wasn't anything in the previous guidance. This is really more of a change based on our outlook. In the sales allowance pricing incentives, we thought that would see less of that as we got to the back half of this year. And we thought we'd be able to service demand a little bit better than we're seeing. So maybe in our forecast, we have assumed that there won't be an improvement year-over-year in those line items, and that would be called down and the same thing in the Factory House side, it was just a change based on really getting better visibility around the capacity we have to move product, which drove more excess product.", "Kevin Plank", "Mitch, let me weigh in here too if I could, because I think it's important as I touched on at the end of my script as well. But at first and foremost, a lot of people know that, number one, we're not satisfied certainly with our operational execution, I think, that came through. The people, process and systems, we are committed to all 3 of them, and we've demonstrated that with some of the talent that we brought in, in 25 and 18 years type of experience in sourcing and planning aspects of the business, and we're going to continue to bring in talent around to support the operational side of our business. But first and foremost, our brand and products have never been stronger. And I think it's important to note managing 42% growth, I get questions all the time of how about this opportunity and that opportunity, I think we've got enough growth for the company right now, and we feel good about it. But managing 42% on $1 billion base, it's not going to be a straight line. And we've hired and we're going to continue to do so, and we've processed and we've implemented systems, and we'll continue to do that until our operational excellence is as strong as the product and the brand. And if anything, when we look at where we are -- I feel very proud of the quarter that we put up and most importantly, that $1 invested in Under Armour a year ago is making 38% to 42% more than it was as you look at the 2011 outlook. So within that, we absolutely have work to do, and we're going to continue to put the pieces in place and make sure that we are strong operationally as we are in the other aspects of our business.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then second question, you guys touched upon in terms of incremental revenues, the expectation of picking up $60 million on Charged Cotton and $70 million on the hats, bags transition. Can you say where you are in terms of incremental revenue that you've picked up on those 2 items year-to-date through the first half?", "Brad Dickerson", "As we called out in previous calls, the seasonality of those items on the Charged Cotton side is relatively even throughout the year as far as year-over-year Charged Cotton comping, obviously, no Charged Cotton last year. So you're going to see a relatively similar impact quarter-by-quarter on Charged Cotton. On the hats and bags business, much more in Q2 and Q3 impact year-over-year, also the higher quarters as we ship back-to-school and start to ship some pre-holiday shipments for hats and bags. So you'll see, I think, the first half versus second half of hats and bags probably relatively in the same impact year-over-year first half versus second half, but highlighted more in Q2 than Q3.", "Operator", "Our next question from Michelle Tan of Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I was wondering if you could give us a little more color around the DTC growth? It accelerated pretty dramatically this quarter to that 80% growth rate. It doesn't seem like the year-over-year store growth accelerated from Q1 to Q2, so it looks like it's coming from either comps or online. Can you help us think about what's driving that, and how we think about the growth rate going forward?", "Brad Dickerson", "Michelle, I think, in Q2 obviously, it's our lowest volume quarter of the year, so some of the things that happen in DTC can be compounded a little bit to our overall growth rate. But we are opening Factory House stores earlier than we have usually done some in the past. For the fact that we're currently at 72 doors up from the -- at the end of the year which was 54, we already opened 18 to 27 doors in the front half of this year. So that somewhat contributed year-over-year especially in Q2 the high growth rate with the stores opening a little bit earlier. But the growth rate we saw in DTC was relatively similar on then the Factory House and website, so we've seen some good positive things in the website with some small tweaks we've made to the website, even prior to going ahead and doing the revitalization of the site towards the end of the year.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So Brad, just to be clear, the web piece of the business did accelerate this quarter as you made those tweaks in terms of growth rate?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just on the marketing spend, I know you're looking for a little more leverage on that line item this year than you previously thought. How do we think about leveraging marketing going forward? Is that a line item we should expect to kind of stay in that 11% to 12% of sales level, or is that something where you'd look for a longer-term leverage against the two?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think we've thought talked about in the last few years that the optimum target to be 12% to 13% of net revenues. But this obviously is an item where as we grow our top line significantly, we get additional significant dollars to spend in marketing. So even though our percentage is coming down, if you look at our guidance, we're talking about a $30 million to $35 million more spend in marketing year-over-year, which is enabling us to do things like support Charged Cotton, the sending of Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Derrick Williams, Kemba Walker and so forth, and operate some of our shop and shops. So I think it's an area where as our top line continues to grow and we get benefits to our top line expectations, it's an area we can see leverage. It doesn't change our long-term outlook of 12% to 13%. But in a year like this where our top line is growing compared to our expectations, it's an area where we can leverage.", "Kevin Plank", "Michelle, this is Kevin. I think you're saying is we're beginning to take chances where -- more certain chances on athletes and probably stepping out where in the past, we go with authentic grassroots athletes that can drive them, we're certainly doing that. But there's a time for refining the benefit of signing celebrities like Tom Brady, who's as authentic on the field and frankly, as much of a celebrity off the field as well, Cam Newton. And then also building our own celebrity, where is Lindsey Vonn, et cetera. So we've got a much bigger and broader staple of athletes today that give the stability to be and think a lot more. But that is one of the challenges we have as a team. We've got more money to allocate, and so that means making longer-term investments when we announced cotton a few months, and I think there may be some head scratches. But for us, we're thinking about the impact that can have for our business 2 and 3 years down the line as we start to prepare for things and frankly the impact that can have of a double banger for things like the Olympics next year in the summer, what cotton will be and then going forward of being an EPO and being in premiership football. So our spends are really broad-based, and if we can do it while leveraging some of those dollars and being broader in the way that we approach becoming a global business, I think you can see us continue to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Charged Cotton and a couple of things on that? Can you speak to how Charged Cotton is performing in the sporting goods channel versus the newer mall customers like Foot Locker and Finish Line, and then versus your factory stores and then maybe some insight into how you're going to grow that business in the next year? And also if you could clarify, the $60 million that you guys are expecting for this year for Charged Cotton, does that include Storm Fleece, and if you could sort of talk about that business as well and where you see that being distributed for fall, and then how you're planning Charged Cotton for next year?", "Kevin Plank", "Robbie, it's Kevin. First of all, Charged Cotton has done very, very well. I think everyone is very pleased about it. There's a couple of different indicators we are using for that. First and foremost, we're -- our tech tee program was sort of the entry price point in Under Armour in the past, and it's a 20-dollar option. And I think, there was some concern that we had from everybody of the -- is this going to mean cannibalization coming out with a $25 in addition to basic to $25. And what we found is that going into the market is that, number one, we didn't see as much cannibalization and more importantly, the effect, if you look at baselayer as a category, versus what is this going do to tech tees, or what is this going to do to Charged Cottons, we're effectively selling somewhere north of 70% more total units than we were a year ago, and we just had one solid $20, and we're doing it at a price point at $25. So taking consumers up, more importantly, taking retail or ASPs up as well, has been some of what we've seen with Charged Cotton. But just -- I think, again, I can still make that statement of nearly quadrupling the addressable market for Under Armour by going into a market like cotton is something which is very important to us. We've also learned we haven't been flawless in the launch. I think we've been more successful in the men's side than we have in the women's side, and we're taking strides with that, because we believe there's a great consumer on the female side as we begin to approach there's 2 markets that we look at or 2 consumers we target, women and one is called teen girl and one is called city girl. And we think that by being in cotton, we're going to have a lot more legs to really attack city girl, where we think there's obviously a big revenue opportunity as we find that more casual approach with that consumer. But all in all, it's been very successful. And yes, that Storm Cotton, it is a part of the $60 million that we have. And just a moment on Storm Cotton, I think we have the ability to do something really  special there. I think, we, number one, have a great product, and it's going to give us legs, of course, into our existing big-box sporting goods partners. But we also think that Storm Cotton we've got some exclusives that we have out there with some of our partners like Foot Locker and some of the things you'll see with what we're doing in Finish Line, so really giving us access into the mall and activating some of our biggest assets as around Lindsey Vonn, Cam Newton and Brandon Jennings and putting them in the product and really activating them from a BOP standpoint. So cotton is, we believe, it's, of course, it's going to be here for a long time with us, and we think it's a story that we just kicked off in '11. It will only get bigger and bigger.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And just a quick follow-up, Kevin, are you guys phasing in any price increases this fall or for spring of next year on existing items?", "Kevin Plank", "We're going to be opportunistic but nothing really large scale this fall. And then of course, we have the ability to come back in the spring and make appropriate price adjustments. But where we sold this a year ago is where Storm Cotton a $60 hooded fleece, which I think is an unbelievable value for the consumer, and I will note they are now available on our website, so please don't hesitate to buy one and give it a try.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Duffy of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple of questions. You talked about enhancing the presentation at retail. Do you have any quantitative evidence of improved productivity from those investments, or is it too early yet?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think it's early. I think we're still making some of those investments right now, and the most important thing that we have as we continue to address and readdress our most important distribution. And as we've brought the point up when you look at the ability to control and impact a new direct consumer, a new website coming out this fall, the factory stores that we have opened controlling our presentation and then 2 of our biggest partners in Dick's and the Sports Authority, and being able to affect 50% of our revenues, I think, there's a new phase and there, frankly, is a much broader product line that Under Armour has today versus even just 2 years ago, the last time we really talked about refreshing some of our shops. And so this is a joint effort between ourselves and our partners that we believe we can be a lot more productive, and where we can take some chances and some products in frankly some product categories. And from a retail perspective, our brand is flat out in performing, and particularly on the men's side, where we are hands down the number one apparel brand just virtually everywhere we do business, and on the women's side, fast approaching. Towards that, I think that having the right ability to tell and communicate the right type of story is what we're hoping to accomplish with this and, of course, improve performance for our partners.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Brad, questions on the operational direction. What are the service levels now? What do you feel is the gap you need to close, and is there any way to quantify what that would mean to margin? And what are some of the key operational things that are important to closing that gap?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Jim, I think we don't really disclose what our fill rates are. But obviously, they're not at that 90% to 95% sort of need. They've improved a little bit from last year, so we're seeing them headed in the right direction, but we're still below where you need to be, and obviously that's impacting with the sales allowances and the pricing incentives. Some of the things like just planning better, again, being able to appropriately and really plan your business and seeing the demand, so instead of having to chase some demand, being able to plan for that demand upfront would be a very, very important thing for us. So hiring a vice president of planning was a step in acknowledging that in trying to get better at the longer-term. Again, on the sourcing side, lead times and being able to position ourselves to meet some demand in the much more efficient ways are things that we're going to look at and will be important for us going forward.", "Operator", "Our final question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Two quick questions. Just one on quarterly cadence, it sounds as if perhaps given some other color you gave us, margins might decline, and the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth on a year-over-year basis, just wondering if that's correct? And then secondly, on the Charged Cotton, I know it's still relatively early, but just wondering if you have any market research on whether or not that's bringing new consumers to the Under Armour brand?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sharon, this is Brad. On the quarterly cadence of margins. As I said in my script, you're going to see the greatest contraction in Q3, so we're down 250 basis points in Q2. A lot of the similar things we talked about in Q2 are going to be there for Q3 also. So I would expect that margins would be down in most year-over-year in Q3. And in Q4, that reduction in margins year-over-year would come down significantly from what we've seen in Q3 but still be down slightly.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Brad, I guess, that was taken out through the operating margin one?", "Brad Dickerson", "From an operating margin perspective, I think, what you're going to see is Q3 will leverage less in SG&A than Q4 will. So again, when you're looking at operating income, you have the highest pressure on gross margins in Q3 and also the lowest leverage in the back half of the year in Q3 compared to Q4. So from an operating margin perspective, you'll see more pressure there in Q3 than in Q4.", "Unknown Executive", "In terms of Charged Cotton, I think, that it's probably still anecdotal at this point, but the flat out performance if you look at t-shirts sold at Sporting Goods a year ago, versus t-shirts sold at Sporting Goods today, the increase in size and the lack of cannibalization, meaning, that we are growing those overall categories without question, I think, we'll bring in more consumers. But we'll continue to press that because we're finding out where the consumer wants us to take that product line, and away from just being on field and to, frankly, moving them off field and off court as much, which is again the big opportunity we see with Charged Cotton.", "Kevin Plank", "All right. Thanks for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting to you our third quarter 2011 results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Tuesday, October 25 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. I will then close with a tentative date for our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. One of the internal mantras that we use here at Under Armour is \"focus and finish.\" Its purpose is to remind ourselves that while the strength of our brand has created abundant prospects for growth, we will be measured on our ability to fully harvest these opportunities in new product categories and geographies. So we look at where we stand at the end of our third quarter, I want to start today with how we are focusing and finishing in our apparel business, and how that is driving us for continued strong results we reported this morning.", "Our performance in apparel year-to-date has helped enable us to pass last year's full-year revenue number of $1.06 billion in just three quarters this year. In the third quarter, we put up a net revenue increase in excess of 40% for the second consecutive quarter. And not to steal all of Brad's thunder, but third quarter apparel net revenues increased 31%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 30%.", "So while we continue to lay the foundation for growth in categories like footwear, and new markets like China, we are achieving these strong results by focusing and finishing on the opportunities we see in our core apparel business. Specifically, we're seeing great success in our twofold strategy of innovating to drive better performance product with higher prices in our core, while expanding our reach beyond our core with new products like Charged Cotton. Let me start with our core though, and specifically Armour Fleece, which is exceeding our expectations in helping us drive higher price points at retail. Armour Fleece is our signature synthetic-based fleece with a soft-brushed inner layer in the inside and a lightweight fast drying outer layer. Armour Fleece is helping Under Armour, again redefine the performance category. Much like we did with the basic T-shirt, we have taken the basic hoodie, the go-to apparel product for our core consumer, and raised expectations of what that product can be. And it has enabled us to bring new price points to retail as well. With hoodies ranging from $50 to now more than $75. All of this with the consumer who has been accustomed to playing less than half of that for a hoodie in the past. This is a great example of focusing and finishing, as we take our strategy of reinventing the basics and being performance to the garment. Our Charged Cotton Tees are redefining the T-shirt category and our Charged Cotton Storm Fleece, which I'll speak to in a moment, is the initial phase of redefining that very large category as well. We believe we are one of the very few brands that continue to bring a true performance message to the athletic consumer and that's enabled us to continue raising our consumers' expectations and driving the performance apparel category, which continues to be a bright spot for the industry. Under Armour remains the market leader performance apparel, especially as we continue to take our average selling price up in an environment where others have chosen not to or have been unable to do so.", "So while Armour Fleece is driving great volumes and higher price points on its own, we're also bringing the first of our cold weather Charged Cotton Storm product to consumers, and this latest innovation from Under Armour is up to a great start. Storm is really the next generation of protection. We've taken the classic cotton heavyweight sweatshirt with it's heavy weight feel and make it water resistant, so water rolls right off. We're bringing this product to market at price points from $60 to $100 and again, without sounding like a broken record, our consumer has shown a willingness to pay a premium when we can change the way an athlete uses our product. And that's what Charged Cotton Storm does.", "So we think there's a great opportunity here for us to build another wheelhouse product in Charged Cotton Storm. As we've said before, using cotton opens access to the Under Armour brand to a much broader range of athletes. Instead of competing to have 3 out of the 4 compression garments they may have in their closet, we're now competing for share of the 30 plus garments, many of which are cotton. Or to put it in a more quantifiable measure, we've gone from competing for share in a $3 billion category, just a year ago, to competing for share in a $12 billion category today. And that's why the phrase, focus and finish, is at the heart of what how we see the business at this point in our growth. We know there are abundant opportunities for our brand outside of our core and outside of the U.S. but we will not pass up the opportunity to create these new building blocks in our core while the same time bringing the Under Armour brand to new consumers. Innovations like Armour Fleece and our Storm product also give us a much larger tool box of products as we expand outside the U.S.. And we will continue to consistently flow UA innovations to consumers, with next-generation technologies like Coal Black, that reflects heat and UV rays before they get to you. Imagine staying 10 degrees cooler in the summertime because of the effect of the material on your body. That is Coal Black and it's an innovation coming to the market next spring. ", "I said before that Under Armour remains the market leader in performance apparel. Equally important is that with technologies like Charged Cotton and Coal Black, we remain the thought leader of performance apparel and believe the continued strength in our apparel business is the true indicator of our relentless focus on innovation and what's next. One of the benefits of our success in apparel is that our core sporting goods distribution continues to allocate more space to the Under Armour brand. We launched the first of our All-American shops at Dick's Sporting Goods this quarter. And it's really the pinnacle of presentation for our brand within sporting goods. As you can imagine, we have a much more richer story to tell our consumer at retail these days, and these shops enable us to present the brand in a much more powerful way. We have 50 All-American and Dick's open to date, with many, many more to come and we're also significantly upgrading our retail presence in other key partners including the Sports Authority, and Academy Sports and Outdoors. ", "Beyond sporting goods, our brand is having an impact within the department store channel. As our initiatives in women's, youth, and underwear extend the reach of the Under Armour  brand. First, within Nordstrom, our women's assortment has seeing very strong sell-through's and our footprint continues to expand. Secondly, our licensee of product for infants and toddlers is outperforming, as we get traction in the department store channel. We'll grow our department store presence in youth going into 2012, not only as that younger license business grows, but as we add new doors with our own youth product for older kids. And third, we see the expansion and relaunch of our underwear program, in 2012, as a key driver for our department store channel as we will offer a differentiated assortment and widen the distribution within this channel where consumers shop for their underwear already.", "In footwear, the arrows continue to point up as our third quarter business grew 97% to over $50 million. Through September, we have already surpassed what we did in all of 2010, and our sell-through's over the past 6 months give us the confidence that our footwear is resonating with consumers. That confidence in running has come through great product at tiered price points, starting this past Spring with the Assert at $70, then the summer with the Split at $90. And just this past month, with our strong introduction of the Charge RC at $120. Just as we are expanding our reach within department stores with new women's, youth, and underwear programs, the traction we are getting in footwear brings us to new consumers through key mall partners such as Foot Locker, and the Finish Line. As we've said before, it's about getting the product to look and feel like Under Armour and running shoes, like the Split, Charge RC, and some of our upcoming basketball footwear definitely capture our DNA. By focusing and finishing on the needs of the athlete, our footwear team has shifted the conversation on footwear from if to when. And this quarter's results reflect the progress our team has made.", "Outside of the U.S., the Rugby World Cup just concluded this weekend, and this event gets one of the top 4 global TV audiences. Behind only the Olympics, World Cup, and the European soccer Championships. The Welsh Rugby team made their way to the semis outfitted in their Under Armour, Armour Grip Kits, putting the Under Armour brand in front of hundreds of millions of new consumers. In China, we're very pleased with the results from the small sample we've seen since opening our first store in Shanghai, our brand position there is firmly rooted in performance and we believe that our longterm opportunity in China will be grounded in sport, just as it will be anywhere we take the Under Armour brand.", "On the team front, you hear me consistently talk about building the foundation for growth. We made 2 key appointments that we believe are important steps in assembling that right team for this next phase of our growth. First, Kip Fulks, who has been with Under Armour since the beginning and has the most complete knowledge of our products and processes, has taken over as COO. He'll continue to oversee design and development of all product and has added oversight of our sourcing information technology areas. As today's results illustrate, product development has been an Under Armour strength, and Kip has helped lead these efforts. We believe this operational knowledge and insight will help us build the right team for an improved supply chain that is aligned with the strength of our product and brand. ", "On the brand front, we are officially announcing today that Stewart Redford [ph] has joined Under Armour as Senior Vice President of Global Brand. Stewart brings a wealth of global brand management experience, most recently at Sony Electronics where he served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Marketing. That global knowledge will be critical as we continue leveraging the Under Armour brand into categories and geographies. As we look to harvest these new opportunities for our brand, we'll remain focused on what drove our success. We will continue to do more with less. Whether it's with the next generation of great athletes like Cam Newton or bringing innovation to the college football uniform. Under Armour will continue to grow by speaking with a disruptive voice across broadcast and social media. We will focus and finish, and continue to drive innovation for our consumers, and value for our shareholders.", "And with that it, I'll throw it over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO, and then we'll be back later to take your questions. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, followed by our updated 2011 guidance. I will conclude with our early read on 2012.", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2011 increased 42% to $466 million. Year-to-date net revenues are up 40% to $1.07 billion. Apparel grew 31% to $363 million during the quarter and is up 33% year-to-date. We continue to experience strength across each of our men's, women's and youth categories. Our Men's business was driven in part by growth in training category, including Armour Fleece and Storm Fleece, while both graphics and hunting easy outpaced overall growth during the quarter. In Women's, Armour Fleece continued to be a standout, and we also saw strong growth in running led by our skate program of both tops and bottoms.  Our direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 73% for the quarter, representing approximately 22% of net revenues compared to 18% in the prior-year period. The growth rates for both the retail and e-commerce business were strong during the quarter. On the retail side, we opened 4 new Factory House stores during the third quarter increasing our Factory House store base to 76, up over 50% from 50 locations at the end of last year's third quarter. We plan to open 4 additional Factory House stores in the fourth quarter, bringing our total Factory House store count by year end to 80. Our e-commerce growth remains robust as we continue to drive both higher traffic and conversion rate year-over-year. In addition, we expect our new Web platform to go live over the next few weeks, with enhanced features and functionality added during 2012.", "Footwear net revenues during the third quarter increased 97% to $52 million from $26 million last year, representing 11% of net revenues. We had solid results with our back-to-school running product led by the Split and strong consumer response to our New-Line of outdoor boots. From a timing standpoint we shipped the bulk of our basketball footwear during the third quarter this year, compared to our initial product last year, which launched in the fourth quarter. In addition we continue to introduce footwear to our Japanese consumer through our licensee Dome by shipping nearly $5 million of product to Dome during the quarter.", "Accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 211% to $40 million from $13 million last year, reflecting the addition of our hats and bags business, which we brought in-house in January, and has received strong consumer acceptance. We are on track for our hats and bags business to contribute $65 million to $70 million to net revenue for the full year 2011.", "International net revenues increased 53% to $33 million in the third quarter, and represent approximately 7% of total net revenues. The footwear sales to Dome that I had previously mentioned also played a significant part in the growth rate of our International business during the quarter. Licensing net revenues declined 18% to $10 million in the third quarter driven, as expected, by the transition of our hats and bags business in-house. ", "Third quarter gross margins contracted 250 basis points to 48.4% compared with 50.9% in the prior year's quarter. Results were largely in line with our prior guidance and primarily reflect 3 factors. First, in North American apparel, less favorable product mix and higher input costs negatively impacted margins by 140 basis points. Second, a lower mix of licensing net revenues negatively impacted margins by approximately 70 basis points. And finally, an unfavorable year-over-year impact of inventory reserves, net of benefits and discounts in sales allowances negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points. It is important to note that the prior year period margins benefited from a reversal of inventory reserves.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 130 basis points to 32.3% in the third quarter of 2011, from 33.6% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing cost declined to 10.4% net revenues for the quarter, from 10.9% in the prior-year period. Once again, our strong top line allowed us to leverage marketing cost which increased 35% during the period. Second, selling costs increased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter, from 7.1% in the prior-year period. Primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores and investments in our e-commerce business. Third, product innovation and supply-chain cost held steady year-over-year at 7.7% of net revenues as we continue to invest in these areas to support our long-term growth. And finally, corporate services decreased to 6.3% of net revenues, compared to 7.9% in the prior-year period as we leveraged corporate personnel, facility expenses, and IT.", "Operating income during the third quarter grew 32% to $75 million compared with $57 million the prior year. Operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 16.1% from 17.3% in the prior-year quarter. Below the operating line, other expenses increased to $2.7 million from $700,000 in the prior year's period. Two factors drove this increase. First, given the sharp decline in the Canadian dollar and Euro late in the quarter, we had a little over $1 million of net foreign currency exposure during the period. Second, we experienced a $1 million increase in interest expense related to the debt assumed for our acquisition of our corporate headquarters. Our third quarter tax rate of 36.3% was favorable to the 37.7% rate in the prior year period and our previous 40% guidance. The lower tax rate during the quarter was a function of favorable developments in our ongoing tax planning strategies including a benefit of $1.8 million during the quarter. As a reminder, during the third quarter of last year, we benefited from the receipt of state and federal tax credits. ", "Our resulting net income in the third quarter increased 32% to $46 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. Third quarter diluted earnings per share increased 29% to $0.88 compared with $0.68 in the prior year. Results include the aforementioned tax planning strategies which benefited EPS by approximately $0.04. ", "Switching over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end declined to $68 million compared with $134 million at September 30, 2010. From a funding perspective we borrowed $30 million from our $300 million revolving credit facility. Given the level of cash flow we typically generate in the fourth quarter, we expect to fully pay down these borrowings during the fourth quarter. Long-term debt also increased to $80 million from $19 million in the prior year's period, reflecting the acquisition of our corporate headquarters. As we outlined last quarter, this debt consist of a $25 million term loan and a $38 million assumption of debt at cash to the property. ", "Inventory at quarter end increased 63% year-over-year to $319 million compared to $196 million at September 30, 2010. Although still exceeding our net revenue growth rate of 42%, our inventory growth rate has moved more in line compared to the second quarter inventory and net revenue growth rate of 74% and 42%, respectively. Two factors to consider in the third quarter inventory growth are transition of our hat and bags business in-house, and higher input cost. Excluding these 2 factors, inventory would have increased approximately 52%.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $13 million for the third quarter and approximately $45 million year-to-date, excluding capital expenditures related to our acquisition of our corporate headquarters. We are now planning capital expenditures for 2011 in the range of $50 million to $53 million compared to our prior indication of the high end of the $45 million to $50 million range. In addition to our normal operating capital expenditure plan, we have approximately $63 million in total investments for 2011, related to the purchase of our corporate headquarters and other investments and improvements in the campus.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2011. Previously, we anticipated 2011 net revenues of $1.42 billion to $1.44 billion, an increase of 33% to 35% over 2010. And 2011 operating income of $155 million to $160 million, an increase of 38% to 42% over 2010. Based on third quarter results and our visibility for the remainder of the year, we are raising this full year 2011 outlook. We now anticipate 2011 net revenues in the range of $1.46 billion to $1.47 billion, an increase of 37% to 38% over 2010. And 2011 operating income in the range of $159 million to $162 million, an increase of 42% to 44% over 2010. Our current guidance implies full year operating margins of between 10.9% to 11%, leveraging 30 to 40 basis points from the 10.6% level achieved in 2010. ", "Similar to my comments in the quarter, other expense should remain higher year-over-year as we incur additional interest expense tied to our headquarters acquisition. With the benefits of our ongoing tax planning strategy during the third quarter, we now expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 38.4% for the full year. As a reminder, our full-year effective tax rate in 2010 was 37.1% due in part to the one time tax credits received in both the third and fourth quarters last year.  Finally, we anticipate fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $52.5 million to $52.7 million.", "Now, I would like to add some additinal on our outlook for the remainder of 2011. First, regarding gross margins. Consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to anticipate a 160 to 180 basis point decline in gross margins for the full year. The contributors to this decline are unchanged and our primarily due to lower apparel margins driven by higher input costs and the transition of our hats and bags business in-house. Second, a little additional color on SG&A. We previously indicated that marketing spend would equate to 11.3% to 11.5% of net revenues. While we expect a consistent level of dollars spend, as implied in our prior guidance, our higher top line guidance should allow us to leverage this line to a greater extent. We now expect marketing spending, as a percentage of net revenues, between 11.2% and 11.3%. This additional leverage in marketing will be offset by higher spending in selling costs related to our direct-to-consumer business as we continue to invest to drive current and future growth.", "And finally regarding inventory. We closed the gap between inventory growth and revenue growth during the quarter and continued to anticipate inventory growth moving more in line with net revenue growth during the fourth quarter. As we highlighted on our last call, we believe we are continuing to make the right investments across supply chain and planning to help stabilize and then improve our inventory turns and fill rates in 2012 and beyond. ", "Before we turn it over for Q&A, we would like also to provide you with our preliminary review for 2012. Based on our current visibility, we anticipate both 2012 net revenues and operating income growth to be at the higher end of our longer-term growth targets of 20% to 25%. While we will provide additional details on our 2012 guidance in future calls, there are a couple of preliminary factors to consider when comparing 2012 growth to our updated 2011 guidance. First, we will anniversary the hats and bags transition in 2010, which is providing over a 6% lift to this year's net revenue growth. Second, we are planning for Factory House store growth of approximately 20% to 25% in 2012 compared to nearly 50% in 2011. An additional consideration for 2012 is our tax rate. As a function of our ongoing tax planning strategies we expect our effective tax rate 2012 will be at or below the 38.4% level forecast for 2011.", "We will now like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Tracy of FBR Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So, yes. I guess, Kevin, if we could first touch on footwear. Obviously, quite a bit of traction here, more than anticipated. You say not if but when. Can you talk about the cadence? How we should talk about that business playing out. I know you're not going to talk, specific about product introductions, but now that you've got this traction just talk about the potential for new platforms coming out as we think about FY 2012.", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think going back to 2010, we took a lot of the pressure off of footwear. Our plan was to reposition, recalibrate, effectively relaunch footwear. And we did that through leadership, we've done that through product, we've done that through cleaning up our inventory in the marketplace and so we feel really good about where we sit from footwear today. And when you look at the way that we've layered in product, we took a very patient approach and frankly, because of the other growth drivers that we have, with DTC and apparel, it's given us the ability to be as patient as we've been. So it started, really this past spring with a clean market and we brought a product called the Assert, which is a $70 running shoe that we brought into the market. And we saw a nice sell-through with it but frankly, $70 shoes isn't where we think the brand should be positioned in footwear, and so the idea was walking the consumer up. And then this past summer we launched the Split, which is a $90 option, which is a great shoe and we've gotten great feedback and again, great sell-through with many of our key partners on that product. And then, just most recently launching the Charge RC, which was a $120 product. So when Kip took over the product role, more than a year ago, the charge that we gave him, particularly as they're going to focus a lot of his time around footwear, was to make product in excess of $100. So where we see the brand position, long-term, is having those types of products. And what you see now is a little bit of texture to our footwear business, where we've got $70, we've got $90, we've got $120. We've got more than just one shoe that defines Under Armour footwear business. And more importantly, where we're heading in the future is, we've got some really great technologies we'll be introducing in 2012, that I think can start becoming more accounts specific, and giving us a little bit more range as we move beyond just 3 shoes into segmenting by sporting goods, the mall channel, and a few other places that we'll add. And then also, most importantly -- probably in addition to the product is going to be the story telling that'll go along with it. We launched the Footsteps campaign that featured Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Georges St-Pierre this past summer, and the tag line at the end was Under Armour footwear. I'm not sure that we had that message out there and so we want to make sure to tell that story very loud and you'll hear, in just a few weeks as well, a new basketball campaign that'll be breaking also, around the 1st week in November with Under Armour footwear space there. So it's really a pretty balanced approach, but as we said all along, you're going to see a little bit of traction -- and we're not declaring victory but any stretch, but I think we've demonstrated that we know how to win and the team that we've assembled has really done just a great job, having us in a position of strength there going forward. So we feel very good about the footwear business and more importantly, the future of the footwear business.", "Eric B. Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe switching gears, if I could, to the supply chain. Coming out last quarter, obviously identified some inefficiencies in terms of supplying products. Could you give us sort of an update there? How should we think about the team and sort of executing on the strategy you have in place to sort of lift the gross margins as we head into '12?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Eric. Obviously, we talked about, the last quarter, some pressures there around gross margin going forward. As we look into the rest of this year, continue to see some price pressures, the back half of Fall '11 here. Also into 2012 and if you just think about 2012 when we locked in pricing for spring, summative '12 specifically. It was back in the Spring, April-ish timeframe, our commodity prices were still pretty high-back then, so we're still going to some price pressures into Spring/Summer '12 on the input side. We talked about the ability to raise ASPs in Spring/Summer '12 and offset most of that, but not all of that in Spring/Summer '12, so you'll still see some pressures in the first half of the year. We think we have some opportunity in the back half of the year, Fall/Winter '12. And a lot of that will be based on, again where pricing comes in, that we roll-up here in the next 30 to days 45 days or so, so we're still rolling up those numbers right now. We think we have some opportunity, but I haven't quantified what that opportunity is. And obviously, with Janet, her team being on board, since April timeframe, the ability to impact Fall/Winter '12 for her is a little bit more than what she had for Spring/Summer '12. But going forward we feel pretty good for 2012, that we have some opportunity in the back half of the year but still trying to roll that up.", "Eric B. Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly if I could, on the inventories. Obviously worked-down a bit here in the quarter, but still elevated and I get there's some things going on. Should we assume by, kind of year-end, we can get those in line with sales growth or is this going to be, kind of, a couple of quarter thing to work through?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Definitely think it's going to be a process over time. We had called out hiring SVP of Planning back in July, Rich Rapuano, from Black and Decker. He's bringing some competencies in also, some additional people he hired. Won't be able to see too much of an impact from him and his team in Spring/Summer '12 but again, probably more towards Fall/Winter '12, maybe a slight impact on inventory management. We do see though our ability to continue to close that gap in the fourth quarter, the difference between revenue growth and inventory growth. So where will have a 32 point gap in Q2, down to a 21 point gap in Q3. In Q4 we should continue to see that pace come down, in the gap in Q4 for inventory versus revenue growth. As we get into 2012, obviously letting Rich and his team take root a little bit. Really from the Spring/Summer '12 perspective, again the impact of Rich and his team is pretty minimal. But I think our goal, as we stated in the near term, is to get to a 3 forward turn and hit that 90% to 95% fill rate for our customers. That's really going to be our focus throughout 2012. Again, Spring/Summer '12, I think we can continue to try to improve on the gap between revenue and inventory that we've seen earlier this year. But the real benefit and I think the real ability for us to achieve those goals and the 3 forward turn in the 90%, 95% fill rate will be in back half of the year when Rich and his team have more impact.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of cool questions. First, you had a great answer earlier on your strategy for segmenting, for footwear, across more channels and I thought you guys might be looking at right now. Can you talk more about apparel through all of those channels? Foot Locker, Finish Line. You talked a lot about underwear in youth, in women's. How but the men's business in the department stores as well? And then maybe top it off with your oldest and dearest distribution channel. Where you guys are at on in-store shops and what we could be looking at through this year and into 2012. And then the second question is just on Europe. Maybe talk a little bit more about, if the strategy is changing there, I think near the beginning of your comments, you mentioned some of the newer products potentially being key products for Europe. I'd love to hear more about that as well. Sorry about the long question.", "Kevin A. Plank", "All right. Let me take them in pieces and I may circle back with the second one. But to start off, with the mall first of all, I think we're gaining traction in footwear and again, as I said, we're certainly not declaring victory but we are very encouraged by what we're seeing. But the fact of the matter is while we've some very healthy apparel business in -- for instance, the mall channel in the past, and we'll continue to do so in I think diversifying our own line with things like graphics and hooking better. The fact of the matter is that the key to the mall is footwear. And until we are a significant player in footwear, everything else there will be taking a backseat to that and that's the approach they've had. But at the same time, we've had unbelievable support from both Foot Locker and Finish Line, from the patient standpoint. And I think that they're continuing to give us the opportunity but they're just saying, guys when you get the product, we have an opportunity but it's incumbent on us to put the product there. So we feel good about where we're positioned now in basketball but a lot of that is going to come down to story-telling as well. And it's a little bit of a chicken and the egg here between the story with the consumer and the product of performance. Basketball is a good category just to look at where I feel that we've made great strides with this consumer in terms of believing that we make a quality product. And so of the 30 state championships that were played for, wearing Under Armour product last year, and the buy-in at our Elite 24 of nearly a dozen kids, the top 24 players in the nation that chose to wear our product when they have a choice of any other shoe they wanted to wear. We're seeing those kinds of encouraging signs but what we're not seeing yet is the kid after the game, putting their shoes on and walking home with a pair of jeans. That comes in time though and frankly, we're fortunate to have the ability to be patient with that thought process. And at the same time, you mentioned -- and I'll get to the department stores in a second. Our own sporting goods distribution. I think we're seeing great success there. I mentioned in my script about success we're seeing with our heritage product like the Armour Fleece and then also the introduction of things like the Storm Cotton product that we've now brought into the market. Taking kids and really realizing higher ASPs in the $50 range in the Armour Fleece and our opening price point that Storm Cotton fleece is $60 and that full zip is $70, $80, $90. And so we are driving, again I think bringing, a, an innovative story and driving consumers to retail and really helping our partners there. But what's going to drive that is that there's so much storytelling in our product. It really hasn't come to life and it's hard to sell a $70 hoodie unless you're telling that story on the floor as well. So our partners have been great. In particular, Dick's Sporting Goods has been great with us with the All-American shops and some of the blue-chip shops that we've built out at Roosevelt and in Lombard. And we're going to continue to expand those programs from just some of the 50 shops we're in now and we're working with them on how big that can we take up based off the lift that we're getting with some of the storytelling. And as I mentioned as well, it doesn't just stop at Dick's Sporting Goods either, it's that we're really trying to take a target approach. And when you look at the way that will be affecting our in-store presence, we'll be touching more than 700 doors over the next several months and so it's really an enhancment across the board. Where we're selling in those 700 doors and I'd probably guess the math, but I'd say it's at least 20%, 25%-plus of our total business will be affected by affecting those 700 plus stores. The Department store channel, that we mentioned, there's a 3 prong approach that we're taking there, as we're thinking. And number one is women's and I think it's selling products where women's shop and so it's doubling down in some of our existing partners like Nordstrom where we've had great, very good success and very solid -- that's led to the 30%-plus growth we've seen in apparel. Women's is driving a lot of that growth force. And so I think it's a bit of a misnomer when people look at our Women's business. We have great success and we have certainly haven't done everything perfect and there's certainly a heck of a lot of opportunities for us. But we're driving that, of course in the product, of course in the storytelling, but also in the distribution. And again, that goes back to the distribution in the way and the setup and some of the shops that we're building out. Women is a big focus in our sporting goods distribution, first and foremost. But again, back in the mall. Youth, it's always a tough channel because we have such a great youth presence and such a great youth driving demand for our brand and so distribution has always been a bit of a challenge there. So frankly, department stores gave us a little bit of range to be a little bit more open and so we've had and seen some success there. And finally, with the underwear program, and underwear for us has been -- I look at that business and it's a relatively small business, that we're saying when we look at some of the competition out there. With our brand, our name, our positioning may we believe that we could be the clear-cut leader in underwear. And so in addition, first and foremost, of building out a comprehensive underwear line and our existing sporting-goods distribution that we basically -- have started with many of them. It's also going where a lot of underwear is bought in the department store. I hope that covers it Robbie, and then coming back on the European question. What were you looking for in Europe, Robbie?", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You had mentioned some of the products. Some of the newer products potentially being very good for targeting Europe. And I didn't know if there was an update on the strategy there and what you're doing there.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. Well, I think it's about not entering a market with a compression shirt in 9 different colors and saying look how innovative we are. The fact is, amenities markets, we're not going to be first to market with things like compression, and so it means bringing some of our new technologies to bear. And whether it is things that Storm Cotton that get that jaw-dropping response from people who look and see the performance of the product -- or the Storm Cotton products rather or just the hand and the feel and sort of the DNA that is Under Armour. I think that it gives us the ability to reinvent ourselves and the we go to new markets. There's not one playbook, and the one thing we've learned and -- probably characterize the last 6 or 7 years since we've really tried become a global business. Number one, the seeds that we've planted, and whether it's in Europe, in our headquarters, in Amsterdam, and the things that we've done in the U.K., and the way that we're doubling down on some of those businesses. We're not a lot smarter but we know a little bit more than when we went into these markets. And they're certainly not easy, and it's certainly going to be something we'll be fighting for a while. But we're beyond just the, we're-investing-in-Europe mode, we're-breaking-even-in-a-Europe mode. But we think, more importantly, that there's the opportunity for us to drive and move forward. And the confidence that we've demonstrated with the investment in something like cotton, I think shows that we're ready to cut our teeth. And I think the Olympics next year and a lot of things happening in London -- I don't believe we truly told our story to the European consumer, and maybe I'm focusing a little bit on just the U.K., but I think that there's the ability for Under Armour to be successful there. We've seen some of the beginning signs of it and I think we, frankly, have only gotten started. So with the right product line, frankly, with the right supply chain that can support us and moving beyond the sophistication of trying to keep up with the 40% grower, just here in the U.S., and having the right team on board that can think globally and has built supply chains globally, that can be effective for us. I think we feel very good about how we're positioned in the first 6 years in a place like Europe, that we are not that far from a tipping point, not unlike we saw in Japan, in year '07 and '08. I think we're very close to something similar in what we're doing in Europe right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, I was wondering how are you guys thinking about the opportunity to move consumers more upstream, technical, innovative products at higher price points? I know there's some really interesting launches like the Storm Fleece and Coal Black but you also have very big programs for some of the basics at affordable price points. And how have your ASPs been trending over time? And what are your strategies around that and long-term goals? And do your channels give you the flexible to really drive prices higher through innovation?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think that we really have a -- I mean there's a lineup, frankly, of people inside the building, from the different product teams that are trying to say -- they're fighting for the dollars for which story are we going to tell. I made mention of something like Coal Black which to me, I use the quote when I define Under Armour is that -- someone said once, who ever reinvents the white T-shirt wins. And I feel like that's almost we did with first product, the style 39, the first compression T-shirt. And I think we keep finding ourselves looking for pinnacle products, of course, that can be defining things like the E39, that we think is going to be a great opportunity in the future, but what pays the rent for us here is also the simple innovations and reinventing the basics. Our $25 Charged Cotton T-shirt is something that took a t-shirt market and again, justifying why a consumer would spend $25 when, frankly, they can go to many partners instead. For $25 you can get 5 or 6 t-shirts for that price. So I think taking consumers up with simple innovation and things like the cotton t-shirt that dries 5x faster than anything else, is pretty defining of our brand. I also believe that our job is to be the thought leaders in this space. The consumer's looking for it from us, I think our retailers are looking for it from us, and that we need to keep driving that through storytelling. Storm product which hit the market just in the last month or so, we've seen a great reaction from the consumer and again, taking the hoodie market where -- you guys have been out of retail and the hoodie market a $20 or $25 hoodie typically. But when you can put the right story and more importantly the right performance behind it, I think we can drive $60, $70, $80 price points. So I think that our job all along, was deliver -- maintain margin is where we were typically valued from our retailers in the past. And we were the company that changed the apparel floor from their anticipation of low- to mid-40 maintain margins into maintaining margins that begin with a 5 handle. So I think we're going to do that through a number of different ways, innovation being the crux of it. But I think we've got a lot of stories in the pipeline and a lot of things coming and I think, again our 42% growth was demonstrative of our thought leadership within the space.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Parkhill from Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was just wondering quickly, on third quarter gross margin line. I don't think I heard any benefit from a shift towards direct to consumer. So I was wondering if that mix shift did not positively impact gross margins and if you could elaborate on why that might be the case.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Sure. To your point, direct-to-consumer didn't really provide an uplift year-over-year in the third quarter. Although the mix of direct-to-consumer was higher year-over-year, the margins were a bit lower in that business year-over-year, so that offset some of the benefits of mix in Q3.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And was that driven by less made-for sell-through or...", "Brad Dickerson", "I would say it was driven by an acceleration of the back half of the year, of excess inventory moving through Factory House, similar to what we talked about last quarter. So the made-for dollars in the back half of the year were consistent with what we planned, but there is some additional capacity in the Factory House in the back half of the year from what we've planned, which gave us the ability to move to some excess product through it, which has reduced the margins in the back half.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then just along the lines of retail. Do you have any updated thoughts on exploring specialty expansion or perhaps more on the combined outlet specialty store concept you spoken of about before?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. I think Brad covered it in his script as well, that our intend is to slow down our outlet expansion. And that, again the purpose and the reason that we opened up the outlet is pure and clear disposition of excess inventory. And so we obviously -- we've got excess inventory today and so we're fortunate to have the nearly 80 doors by year-end, but our goal isn't just using that as simply a retail driver for us. But I think you'll continue to see a test. I mean, the ultimate goal that we have is to serve our consumer and frankly, there's many markets that we're not doing that. But we're fortunate to have a great distribution today, a great relationship with the distribution that we have today. Are so our intent is never to cannibalize any of those sales but to find opportunities where we can be that last line of defense. And frankly, that's where our DTC and our e-commerce channel has served a great role for us in doing that to date.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Kevin, just a quick question and I have a couple of follow-ups. You guys have done a great job of innovating into this new category and really catching some market share in running. And when we look at some of the core categories and some of your oldest categories and frankly, ones that -- for all rights, you guys actually invented for the most part. Like compression, we've seen some market share losses there. I think we've talked, in the past about how some of that was planned, you didn't expect to have 90% of the market forever or whatever, you had when you came out. But it seems like a lot of people, like in the cold compression gear have innovated in to that category, everybody's got a cold gear compression at this point. As you look ahead to next Fall, is there any way to differentiate the product or move price points higher and stand out from what has become a crowded field at this point?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. When you look, from a market share standpoint particularly around compression, the fact is that you're right. We used to have a 100% market share. And so the declining nature of that has been on, basically the mass acceptance of growing this entire pie and more importantly, a pie that never existed before. So I want you to know, as we look at that, one of the indicators, frankly, in difficult markets that we use to judge our business is market share. And so first and foremost is that, number one, we continue to be the market leader in this category, and I want to be very clear about that. But we are hyper-aware of sort of the competition we have. And the one thing is that when you talk about our competition, the word you can't say is, boy these guys stink, we're better. The bar is very high, and we need to do a great job. And so the good news is, for the consumers, that we think we all continue to push one another and the consumer is getting a better result. At the same time, some innovations that I've seen in the pipeline and as you push, and you look, and you move, there's lots of places we continue to innovate. But I think what we keep our eye on is moving beyond just being a compression company. And again, the 40% plus growth in the quarter is something that we say we have our eye on a much bigger opportunity. And so we're taking the credibility that we've established in a market like compression and we're using it to leverage ourselves into things like fitted and into looser fitting products, and into outdoor, and into mountain categories, and into all these other categories that we've been able to expand to. So I want to be clear, number one, we're not taking our eye off the ball. But it's a tough place will be complete, and more importantly we've opened a lot of new categories that we're now competing in that are going to feed our growth today and frankly, be feeding our growth into the future, as we build a multi-billion dollar global platform.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Let me ask you a couple of quick ones on footwear here, if I could, for a second. In the past you've talked to us about where your gross margins on the footwear program are and the significant gap between where you're at versus industry-standards. As you look at -- we won't call it a launch, but the reenergized footwear program here. What are your thoughts, as we look ahead to 2012 with new products coming? And how the product is built before we even talk about whether it will need to be marked down, if it's accepted, anything like that. But as far as how the product is built -- I mean are you going in from an advantaged position versus where you were previously, on gross margins, from the build standpoint? And then maybe, I know when we talked at the analyst day, you didn't want to commit to guidance for the forward business, but maybe how we can just think about the range of potential outcomes on the top line for footwear in 2012. I know that's something that the analysts have had a very tough time forecasting for you guys, since it's such a volatile business.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Let me weigh in on sort of the margin question to begin with. The challenge that we've given our team and because we're a brand, it gives you the ability -- we're not competing at commodity levels here. So frankly, we have the ability to set and dictate price, and in order to do that though, you must be innovating. And so the challenge that we have for our team and in some of the margin compression that you've seen around us, we don't see that as being acceptable, we just see that as, we have a lot of things going on. And the challenge we have internally, is a roadmap to 50%. That we believe we're a company that frankly, should have a gross margin that begins with a 5, and we have the ability to do that through better product. And again, I'm not putting a timeline on when that can happen because we are entering things and frankly, a bit of the unknown with things like footwear. But what we're doing and where we're pressing on the footwear team for instance is put points on the board. We're frankly, not going at it. We haven't limited them with saying, we need this margin, we need to be here, we need to be there. What we're doing is we're driving ASP's up in our footwear business overall and, obviously that's going to give us the ability to put more innovation into the product. And frankly, tell a better story to our consumer of where the Under Armour brand should be positioned in footwear. So I don't think, again, as we look or we think about footwear, we really, we're trying to create the wind. And so, as I mentioned, we've got this layering now with -- call it a $70 shoe, a $90 shoe, a $120 shoe that are frankly, all still selling at full price as well. And as we look at those, there's going to be a lot more technology that we'll start layering in, in 2012. But it is a foundation that's been laid at this point and while I think we're doing okay with margin, we're certainly not optimizing from a factory based standpoint where -- again, when we launched in 2006, we had 1 factory. Today we have 9 or 10, I think the optimal level we should be is 14 or 15. And where we can really start pressing price and pressing some of the other things, but the most important thing we're driving on right now is build a great looking shoe that performs well, that a kid is going to like. And so starting with that and frankly, because of the luxury of the other growth drivers that we have, that are building and moving for us. It gives us the ability to be patient and thoughtful and frankly, not putting as much pressure about something like footwear.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So I just wanted to ask a question on Charged Cotton. So it seems like you've had some really nice early success with the product, good healthy sell-through. You've talked about the program being about a $60 million program this year, as you start to gauge consumer interests for this new product. How do you think about expanding that product into '12? Whether it's going deeper in your existing distribution or expanding just the number of doors that it's in. How should we kind of think about what kind of growth rate you can expect from Charged Cotton?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think, first of all, expansion can be one of the most dangerous things you do. I used in my script the mantra, focus and finish. And frankly, I'm not sure that we focused and finished, I'm just getting started on the original Charged Cotton T-shirt. Number one, just from a -- making sure that we're keeping the fixtures full. On the Men's side, I think there's a lot more opportunity for us to be broader in the range, in terms of again, an inventory replenishment. But on the women's side, we left some meat on the bone and it's something you'll see us come back and really focus on color and fit and style. We're going to get it right, we're going to get the core basics right. But you'll see us move from one t-shirt that sort of defines Charged Cotton into multiple ways. You'll see us move from short sleeve to long sleeve. You'll see us begin to layer in shorts and bottoms, and all the other things that go with it, in lightweight hoods. And I think that opening up and again, using that idea of moving from a $3 billion addressable market to nearly $12 billion market. It's pretty indicative of what we're sitting on, we think we've got a little bit of a tiger by the tail. We're taking our performance DNA and guardrails, and being able to apply them to a market like cotton which is getting the consumer. Because we sometimes limit ourselves with the fact that what a product needs to do to perform. But our mission statements says to make all athletes better and the way that we can do that -- it is as much through performance as it is through style, and fit, and design. So I think you'll see us take a much more designed, enhanced focus which will allow us to move beyond just sort of a item-driven company into a company that's allowed to hook with shoes, and with pants, and with the accessories, and the other pieces. So I think you'll probably see a more mature approach from Under Armour, beyond just a very simplistic one, sort of one t-shirt that's sitting on a fixture.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And that'll grow. That SKU count, if you will, will start to materialize. That growth you feel will materialize in Spring of '12?", "Kevin A. Plank", "It will. It's a big deal to grow a SKU count around here these days, and so Brad keeps a pretty good measure on exactly how we're doing it that. But obviously, we feel very good about what we have, the opportunity we have, and the entire cotton franchise for us. And so, yes, it'll absolutely be something that we'll look to grow in a pretty significant matter in 2012.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Got it, great. And then just had one other question for Brad, if you could. Brad, with respect to the gross margin discussion, specifically around the sales allowance and the negative mix comparison in the outlet channel. When should those start to abate? And if so, do they start to abate at the same time? And is it purely a function of improvement on the supply chain side or is there one piece of that, that will improve before the other?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. To go back to the last quarter, my conversations around those. Again, a lot of that comment from the last quarter was the change to the outlook to 2011 versus a comp over 2010, to some degree. So there might be some confusion there but on the sales allowance side, actually from a year-over-year comp perspective, we started seeing some sales allowance issues last year, so we are comping those this year. So there's not much of a year-over-year change on sales allowance, it was more of a change in the current year. Also on the mix side, same thing, it was more of a change in the last 6 months of mix as we saw the ability to move more excess product with extra capacity that we didn't quite know of and again, planning. So when you loot at, going forward and those two issues, I think both of them point to continued efforts in the supply chain and inventory management. So whether it's Janet Fox and her team on the sourcing side or Rich Rapuano on the planning side, the ability for us to forecast more accurately and get the supply flow of inventory coming in on a timely basis, that should help us reduce sales allowances going forward. Also on the other outlet mix side, the ability for us to more accurately plan the total capacity we have in outlet and plan accordingly from a made-for versus excess mix, and then how we give our guidance should help going forward too. So I think with Janet and Rich onboard, you should start to see some minor improvements to those as we get into Spring/Summer '12, more opportunity in Fall/Winter '12 forward on those 2 items.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So the first half of '12 pressure is going to be related to input cost pressures?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, if you look at that. Because we locked prices back in April for Spring/Summer '12 and commodity prices were pretty much at their peak at that point in time, as far as pressure for the most part. So Spring/Summer '12 is still going to be still challenging for us. As you look to Fall/Winter '12 we'll be locking those prices. We're kind of locking some prices right now, next 30 to 45 days, locking a lot more pricing for Fall/Winter '12. Obviously, commodity prices are heading in the right direction. So that goes for our comments around, we believe we have some opportunity in Fall/Winter '12. Not only because of commodity pricing but also the fact that Janet has a little more input into Fall/Winter '12 than she does Spring/Summer '12.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about sell-through throughout the quarter. If your retail partners and direct-to-consumer -- I think that there's a perception that there is some volatility. So maybe if you could talk about that in. And kind of the inventory levels, your retail partners, how you feel about that at this juncture going into the holidays?", "Brad Dickerson", "Well I can start Sharon, on some of the data you're talking about, on sell-through, retail and DTC. Obviously, if you look at the quarter growth rates, we saw strong sell-in and sell-through in Q3, both in the wholesale side and direct-to-consumer. Especially direct-to-consumer, obviously, with the 73% growth rate in the third quarter. From an inventory management perspective at retail, I think along the lines of the commentary you've heard in the market place, concerns around the back half of the year and consumer demand. I think we've seen a little bit more tightening of management of inventory at retail. Not extreme by any means, but we also we had a little bit more tightening, so that does impact, obviously, sell-in. But obviously, if you look at our growth rate in Q3 and our guidance going forward, raising top line guidance and raising bottom line guidance. That has been taken into account in our raise of guidance.", "Tom Shaw", "All right, thanks for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting to you our fourth quarter 2011 results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Thursday, January 26th, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. At Under Armour, we don't spend a great deal of time looking in the rearview mirror. We are the athletic brand of this generation and the next. Our consumer, like at no other point in our lifetime, is focused on the next great product, the next great athlete and the next great story from our brand. And to better understand how we will deliver our story to this generation of athletes, we think our 2011 results illustrate how we continue to resonate with our consumers through product, communication and relentless innovation that makes all athletes better.", "So this morning, I want to cover 2 specific objectives for Under Armour in 2012. First, how we will continue to move beyond our core compression heritage, while maintaining the most authentic and profitable position in that space. And secondly, how we are leveraging that premium brand position to greatly expand our addressable markets. ", "So first, a quick look at the 2011 scoreboard. We saw revenue growth for the year of 38%, our strongest growth since 2007. We added over $400 million in revenue in 2011, essentially doubling the size of our business since just 2007. And importantly, we leveraged that strong revenue growth despite gross margin pressure to deliver operating profit growth of 45%.", "Our apparel business remains a key growth driver for our brand. And 2011 is a shining example of our ability to consistently expand our reach in this most critical piece of our business. We grew apparel revenues 31% this past year after growing it 31% in 2010. But my focus this morning is not as much on those impressive numbers as much as it is on the makeup of that growth. We are a brand that was founded on compression, and we are the market leader there. Equally important is that we continue to maintain our premium position in compression, both from a performance and a pricing-integrity platform. But as we laid out in our Investor Day last June, we are now in a strong position to also focus our resources beyond the compression category. And I'm very proud to say that 2011 was a great illustration of our team taking a strong step outside the compression category and bringing our brand of innovation to a much broader audience of athletes.", "Our biggest and most successful initiatives in 2011 were not about tight-fitting baselayer products. Instead, they are about our ability to bring Under Armour's brand of innovation, the one that changes the way an athlete views a product, to that broader audience we've discussed. ", "Charged Cotton. No question, the compression market is our heritage. A category that we originated in '96 and has now become a staple in the athletic apparel business. It's not that we didn't like cotton, we just didn't like the way that it performed. So we did something about it. And in 2011, we redefined what athletes have come to expect from their apparel. We see Charged Cotton as a path to nearly quadrupling our addressable market to include the entire $12 billion active use market and help grow the lines of a much larger $58 billion activewear market over time.", "So while we have built a $1 billion apparel brand largely on synthetic compression products, the path forward will have a materially different feel to it. So knowing that our consumer is keenly focused on next, we quickly brought the next innovation in cotton to market with the introduction of our Storm product. Storm is truly the next generation of casual outerwear. We've taken the classic cotton sweatshirt with its heavyweight feel and made it water resistant, so water rolls right off. By reinventing the hoody, we again make our brand more accessible to a broader audience of athletes.", "A few more examples of us taking Under Armour innovation to new levels, like E39, the true star of the 2011 and upcoming 2012 NFL Combine. Yes, it's a compression garment, but the story was not just the fabric but how the electronics in the shirt measure your body in a new way, including horsepower and g-force, as well as heart and breathing rates, a product we will be bringing to market shortly. ", "And Charge RC, a lightweight running shoe with the true Under Armour DNA and a great statement about who we are as a footwear brand, with both its materials, fit and $120 price point. ", "In each of these examples, we are taking the Under Armour DNA and creating new avenues for growth and new access points for our brand. When we started Under Armour, it was with the simple goal of keeping athletes cool in the summer and warm in the winter. We are now building another level of foundation for our brand through initiatives like redefining the hoody and making cotton more functional for the athlete. This broadening of our reach not only enables us to round out our portfolio from the standpoint of both materials and silhouettes, but it puts us in position to consistently take a greater share of the athletes' closet.", "So our results speak for themselves in 2011. We successfully leveraged the heritage of our compression product to enter new markets and bring the brand to new consumers. In 2012, our innovation agenda will be equally robust, and we will continue to widen our access with continued investment in our direct consumer business and appropriate expansion of new channels that aligns with our broader assortment. ", "On the apparel innovation front. We will be launching in March our revolutionary ColdBlack technology that reflects the heat of the sun, so athletes feel cooler when they are training, competing or on the go. ColdBlack effectively moderates heat to make it feel like you're wearing a white tee even though it's a black tee. Its deepest impacts will be felt in our golf and run businesses in 2012 and will expand from there moving forward. You will also see an accelerated cadence around newness and innovation on both our Men's and Women's baselayer businesses, leveraging new fabrication, technology and design to drive this category to the next level. ", "In footwear, we will maintain the momentum we saw in 2011, with the debut of a new midsole technology that targets the lightweight category with an Under Armour point of view on structure. While the Charge RC was designed for faster, lighter athletes, this new shoe was built to support every athlete, at every size and at every level. It will incorporate visible, structural technology that makes our point of view clear and resonates with the consumer. We have yet to build our defining product. And we feel that there is good reason to believe that it may very well be this shoe.", "As we indicated on our Investor Day, growing our Underwear business is a major 2012 initiative for us. We will add over 500 Underwear doors throughout select department stores during the year, starting with 250 doors in Macy's this spring. We're focusing our initial distribution around metro centers. And to build brand awareness through this channel, the face of our campaign will be Heisman Trophy winner, NFL #1 draft pick, and now Pro Bowler, and my vote for Rookie of the Year, Mr. Cam Newton.", "Combined with our expanded product assortment and the growth we see in our existing channels, we believe this program will help bring new consumers into the brand and accelerate our growth in this category. And while we remain focused on bringing new innovations to market, we have other 2012 initiatives, including a bigger push into graphic tees through our cotton product, new cap [ph] fabrication for our entry-level tech tees and generally stepping up the cadence in innovation across our core apparel line. ", "But as I mentioned in discussing our Underwear initiative, we'll expand into appropriate new channels that align with this broader assortment and meet our consumer where they shop for that product. ", "In 2011, we added greatly to the presentation of our brand at retail through the expansion and improvements in our Direct Consumer business. And we'll continue to grow this channel in 2012. Both our e-commerce platform and our Factory House stores saw outstanding growth in 2011. We initiated a major upgrade to ua.com in the fourth quarter, and we'll see ongoing improvements to the site this year. We're able to merchandise the full breadth of the UA product line through our site, and we believe that it is critical as new consumers are introduced to the brand every day. ", "With our expanding brand presentation at key retail partners in our sporting goods, mall and specialty channels, we are able to tell a rich product story and communicate our performance position.", "So before I pass it over to Brad, I want to reiterate how we remain focused on what our consumer wants next and continue to bring it to them in unexpected ways. We did that in 2011 with the football uniforms we built for the University of Maryland. Our consumer wants what they've never seen before. And these uniforms are a great example of how our product and design innovation can bring attention to our brand beyond the football field and create awareness, not just on ESPN, but across the wide spectrum of medium where our consumer lives.", "Through social media and PR, we were able to amplify the original story and create that high level of awareness without spending huge advertising dollars. ", "We also began our dialogue with the basketball community through our \"Are You From Here?\" campaign, the one that basketball -- one basketball publication called the best ad campaign of 2011. Starring athletes like Brandon Jennings and rising NBA rookies Derrick Williams and Kemba Walker, we were able to tell the story of Under Armour basketball in a surgical and a viable way, and begin to build the authenticity that has helped power us in football and baseball. ", "We have built tremendous brand equity with the athlete and have truly begun building a foundation with new consumers and new technologies. That focus on new in 2011 resulted in top line growth of 38%.", "We are fortunate to be in position to control our own destiny as a brand. The categories and geographies that we enter, the distribution in which we choose to expand, the partnerships we form with great teams like Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League, and elite athletes like my vote for Super Bowl MVP, Mr. Tom Brady. These are all decisions we may make based on protecting and growing the premium nature of the Under Armour brand. We made great progress in 2011 in expanding our reach, and we're confident in taking that next step outside our core to drive growth in 2012. ", "And with that, I'll pass it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results, followed by our updated 2012 guidance. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 34% to $403 million. For the full year, net revenues increased 38% to $1,473,000,000, which compares to our most recent full year guidance of $1.46 billion to $1.47 billion. Apparel grew 27% to $323 million during the quarter. Similar to last quarter, our Fleece business led the way with strength across Men's, Women's and Youth. Our Charged Cotton platform also continued to drive growth during the quarter and contributed approximately $65 million in net revenue growth during the full year.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 50% for the quarter, representing approximately 38% of net revenues compared to 33% in the prior year period. For the full year, Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 62%, representing 27% of net revenues compared to 23% in 2010. On the retail side, we opened 4 new Factory House stores during the fourth quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 80, up nearly 50% from 54 locations at the end of 2010.", "We also opened our first mountain specialty store in Vail, Colorado, in November. And we'll look to test additional full-price concepts going forward. ", "On the e-commerce side, we launched our new website in November and registered our first $2 million day on this platform during the quarter. We will focus on optimizing our site during 2012 and expect e-commerce to grow at a faster rate than our Factory House business in 2012.", "Footwear net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 43% to $31 million from $22 million in the prior year, representing 8% of net revenues. This growth was primarily driven by the performance of our new 2011 running styles, including the Assert, the Split and the recently introduced Charge RC, which has performed well across Men's and Women's at a premium $120 price point. ", "Accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased nearly 150% to $37 million from $15 million in the prior year period, reflecting the addition of our Hats and Bags business, which we brought in-house in January 2011.", "International net revenues increased 16% to $26 million in the fourth quarter and represented approximately 6% of total net revenues, driven by strong growth with our Japanese licensing partner, Dome. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 10 basis points to 51.6% compared with 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. These results drove our full year gross margins down 160 basis points to 48.4%, which compares to our previous guidance of 2011 gross margins down 160 to 180 basis points. ", "Three factors primarily contribute to our fourth quarter gross margin performance. First, in North American wholesale apparel, less favorable product mix and higher input costs negatively impacted margins by 70 basis points. Second, a lower mix of licensing net revenues negatively impacted margins by approximately 30 basis points. And third, these factors were largely offset by favorable year-over-year impacts related to sales, returns and allowances.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 210 basis points to 37.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from 40% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing costs declined to 10.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.1% in the prior year period. For the full year, marketing spend was 11.4% of net revenues, slightly above our previous 11.2% to 11.3% guidance and compared to 12% in 2010. Even with this leverage, we spent $40 million more in marketing year-over-year. ", "Second, selling costs increased to 10.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.1% in the prior year period, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores and investments in our e-commerce business. ", "Third, product innovation and supply-chain costs declined to 8.2% of net revenues for the quarter from 9.1% in the prior year period, partially driven by leverage in personnel costs. ", "And finally, corporate services decreased to 7.9% of net revenues compared to 9.7% in the prior year period, primarily as we leveraged corporate personnel and facility costs.", "Operating income during the fourth quarter grew 57% to $55 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 45% to $163 million compared to our most recent full year guidance of $159 million to $162 million. Operating margin expanded to 200 basis points during the quarter to 13.7% and 50 basis points for the full year to 11.1%. ", "Below the operating line, net other expenses increased to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter from $700,000 in the prior year's period as a result of interest expense on the debt assumed for our acquisition of our corporate headquarters.", "Our fourth quarter tax rate of 39.6% was unfavorable to the 33.4% rate in last year's period, which included positive impacts from tax credits and tax claim strategies. For similar reasons, our full year effective rate of 38.2% was above the 37.1% effective rate in 2010.", "Our resulting net income in the fourth quarter increased 42% to $33 million compared with $23 million in the prior year period. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased 40% to $0.62 compared with $0.44 in the prior year period. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 38% to $1.85 compared to $1.34 in 2010.", "Now switching over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end decreased 14% to $175 million compared with $204 million at December 31, 2010. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $300 million revolving credit facility at quarter end. Long-term debt increased to $78 million at quarter end from $60 million at the end of 2010, reflecting debt on the acquisition of our corporate headquarters.", "Inventory at quarter end increased 51% year-over-year to $324 million compared to $215 million at December 31, 2010. A portion of this growth in inventory dollars is being driven by higher costs per unit, as the growth in inventory units at approximately 35% is more in line with our Q4 top line growth. This higher cost per unit is heightened in the current quarter as we flow products into our inventory to service our Spring/Summer 2012 season, which is the peak of our current input cost pressures. I will provide additional color around this and our anticipated 2012 gross margin and inventory position shortly.", "Our investment in operating capital expenditures was approximately $8 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $54 million for 2011. We are currently planning 2012 operating capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $65 million. As a reminder, in 2011, we also invested nearly $62 million related to the purchase of our corporate headquarters. ", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2012. Our prior preliminary outlook called for 2012 net revenues and operating income growth to be at the higher end of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%. We are now taking a more prudent view on our wholesale apparel revenue growth heading into 2012. The impact of unseasonably warm weather has led to elevated inventory levels at retail to start 2012. When we combine this with the overall, more conservative approach our retail partners are taking to manage their own inventories, we believe a more conservative expectation around revenue growth within our wholesale business is appropriate. Given these factors, we are now planning for 2012 net revenues to come in at the low end of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%.", "Looking at gross margins. We continue to see different first half and second half stories for the year. Our product costs for the first half of 2012 were locked in last spring when synthetic and cotton inflation hit peak levels. As a result, we continue to expect the net impact of product margins during the first half of 2012 to approximate the 2011 full year product margin impact of 110 basis points. We expect that dynamic to be the primary gross margin story during the first half of 2012. ", "In the second half of 2012, while we expect raw material headwinds to abate, we are still much more dependent on synthetic prices, which have not shown the same level of declines as cotton prices. We believe margin improvements in the second half of 2012 will be more dependent on the continued efforts of our improving sourcing and planning functions, as well as our efforts to rationalize our SKU base. We believe these efforts should yield second half gross margin improvement that will generally offset the pressure expected during the first half of 2012.", "Looking at SG&A.  We see the opportunity for moderate leverage, even while sustaining investments for our future growth. We currently expect to see a similar marketing spend rate in 2012 as in 2011 and expect the quarterly spending cadence to look comparable to 2011. Selling expenses should continue to deleverage throughout the year as we expect our Direct-to-Consumer growth rates to outpace our overall growth rate. We anticipate adding 15 to 20 new outlet doors in 2012, a growth rate of 20% to 25% over the 80 doors at the end of 2011. Additionally, we will continue our ongoing enhancements around our e-commerce business.", "The product innovation and supply-chain expense rate is expected to be at a relatively flat percentage of revenue compared to 2011, as we continue to make the right investments to support our future growth. ", "Finally, corporate expenses are expected to leverage, though to a much lesser degree than in 2011. Rolling gross margin and SG&A factors together, we continue to expect 2012 operating income growth to be at the higher end of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%. Below operating results, we anticipate higher year-over-year interest expense, given a full year of the additional long-term debt for our headquarters acquisition. In addition, we expect a full year effective tax rate of 37.5% to 38% given our ongoing tax planning strategies. We expect our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 53.2 million to 53.4 million.", "Before opening up to Q&A, we would also like to provide some additional color on inventory. As we mentioned, inventory ended 2011 up 51% year-over-year, a rate that was down 12% sequentially from the prior quarter. In 2012, we remain laser-focused on improving our inventory management, and we will build upon several initiatives developed in 2011. SKU rationalization has been a big focus for us, and we anticipate a reduction of our total assortment by 20% during 2012.", "This creates a filter to assist our forecasting and planning processes. But we are much more focused and disciplined, not only on how we will buy, but also how we will flow products into our warehouses. Our planning strategy also means that we will lean more on our Factory House outlet channels in 2012 to support these processes and ultimately optimize our inventory positioning. ", "Finally, we are seeing some encouraging signs with our sourcing strategy as we focus on supplementing our current supplier base and shortening our lead times. Combining these factors, we expect the inventory growth rates to contract further in the first half of 2012, though the gap with the net revenues growth rate will still exist. In the second half of 2012, we anticipate the inventory growth rate will come in below the net revenues growth rate.", "We'd now like to open the call to your questions, but we ask that you limit your questions to 2 per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I've got one for you, Brad, and one for Kevin. Brad, maybe you can give us some rough kind of perspective on how much of your change to the outlook reflects the impact of weather carrying into Q1 versus a more conservative approach to the business given the broader environment? And then, is there any impact at all from SKU rationalization on your top line plans? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Michelle. I think the impact of weather, it's kind of hard to clearly identify that, but you could probably say the impact is maybe a couple of percentage points of growth coming out of Q4 into 2012. So that's -- that obviously gave us kind of a look into 2012, of an impact there. From a SKU rationalization perspective, it's -- there's not really any kind of impact to top line revenue. That was really looking at unproductive SKUs and more unprofitable SKUs. So eliminating those really was not part of the equation of revenue. Because we were really looking actually to trade those lower productive SKUs into higher productive SKUs.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then -- and Kevin, there's skeptics out there who will clearly worry that this is indicative of more limited long-term growth opportunity in the core business for you going forward. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on that and maybe any specifics that can give comfort to people who are going to worry about that angle on the outlook?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Well, I think we've been pretty consistent since we went public now more than 6 years. And I think we continue to deliver quarter after quarter. And it begins with the 5 growth drivers that we have: Men's apparel, Women's apparel, footwear, international and direct consumer, and our ability to lean on each or any one of those levers at any given time. So our growth strategy of -- we were pretty clear in 2011, 2012, what we were going to do to lean on our apparel, which is up 31% again for the full year basis and our direct consumer channel, which is up 50% in the fourth quarter. And we see a lot of activity that's happening in the marketplace, as Brad was speaking to, that maybe gives us -- just taking a little bit more of a cautionary approach to where we see top line. One thing is certain is that we're not willing to buy our top line, is that we are building a premium brand. And I think that, that's evident in the fact that we're showing leverage as the way that we're -- our outlook for 2012. And that we're becoming a bigger or a better company as we mature, and we can start refining ourselves a little bit, too. So I think the goal that we have -- and I think we did walk the market. Because you didn't find -- Under Armour wasn't one of the brands that was 30 off. And so, in doing so, we still have a consumer out there that is willing to pay full price for our brand. And the fact and the reason for that, is because we continue to bring them innovation. And so what I can tell you is that there's an unbelievable commitment to innovation from our company. The line of \"we have yet to build our defining product\" of the brand is something that we think, and we have our product teams battling over each and every day, from an apparel and accessory, and yes, absolutely a footwear standpoint, too. So we've got some very exciting technologies we'll be bringing out in 2012. From an apparel standpoint, things like ColdBlack that I mentioned, as well as the new technology we'll have in the back half of the year around a new footwear technology also. So we've got unbelievable support from our wholesale partners out there, both in sporting goods and in the mall, that are really counting on us and really looking for us, in fact expecting us to deliver something great. So we have the team in place. I think that the brand has never been stronger, and we feel very good about our ability to accelerate this company and continue to drive and build that premium brand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.  ", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give any more detail around the Women's business, specifically during the fourth quarter and for your outlook for 2012. Did you see the same degree of success with your Storm Cotton product for Women's as you did with Men's? And any other things that you have planned for the year that may be game-changing versus last year.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, well, I think, first of all, I think we get a deservedly probably unfavorable view that people have on our Women's business. And just to get people in perspective on where we sit as a brand, when we did go public in 2005, Women's was less than 15% of our total mix. Since that time, we've added over $1 billion of revenue, and Women's today is over 28% of our total mix. So nearly 1/3 of our product offering is actually coming from Women's. Now a lot of this is basics, a lot of it's compression, a lot of it is our sport bras and compression shorts, and we've got some unbelievable new technologies coming out, like Armour Bra is a very big launch that we have coming this spring that we'll have on the Women's side. At the same time, I know that as I'm sitting here and I'm talking the talk, we, without question, need to continue to walk the walk. And that means that there is work for us to do. And more importantly, there's opportunity in the Women's business as we've seen it. Is that we have not found a reluctance to the Under Armour brand from female consumers. In fact, it's the exact opposite. They're waiting for us to have the right colors, the right fit, the right styling. And what I can tell you is that this doesn't happen at once, it doesn't happen with one hire, but it happens across the building. It's building out our product -- our teams across product, design, marketing, and yes, especially product distribution. We've been -- we've really taken very clear lines of trying to figure out what we can do to get to where women shop. And so I think we've done a good job of driving and creating a compelling product offering in our existing distribution. But now you are starting to see bigger presence at Nordstrom's and bigger presence in Bloomingdale's and places like that where I think we can really do some brand-defining things that -- frankly, it pushes us. As we think about our opportunities as a company, we have unbelievable thought in our upside of what our Footwear business can be. We have unbelievable thought that down the road our International business can be great for us. But probably the nearest, lowest-hanging fruit that this company has, is excelling our Women's product. And so you'll continue to see that effort.  You'll continue to see us come back. And you'll continue, frankly, to see, our Women's growth outpace the growth of -- across the company.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my next question's just on the supply chain and the search for the Head of the supply chain for Under Armour. I wondered if you could update us on how that search is going? Sounds like you are making some supply-chain decisions with some of the changes you've made to that management over the last 12 months. So I wondered if you just could give us a little bit more detail behind how it's going for the search of the Head of that part of your business?", "Brad Dickerson", "Kate, this is Brad. Yes, obviously, the search is ongoing, and obviously, we have many candidates that have come through here. So we're looking for that right candidate and that right fit for us, which is going to be very important. This is a very, very important decision for us. But to your point, a lot of good things have been happening over the last 12 to 18 months in our supply chain. A lot of good leadership additions onboard. Last year, with Janet Fox coming onboard to run our Sourcing group. And also with Rich Rapuano coming in to run the Planning and Inventory Management group. So a lot of the things that we're talking about here around SKU rationalization, which is from the product team's perspective, and around looking at how we plan our business, and with a more disciplined fashion around forecasting and also how we buy our inventory and flow it in, along with just our ability to work with our outlet teams and our liquidation strategies, and upfront  the season in planning also, really it's coming through the leadership that's come on board in the last 12 to 18 months. So a lot, a lot of good things going on there, which obviously, will show in the back half of '12 relative to margins and inventory, as I stated.", "Kevin A. Plank", "And one thing, Kate, just -- I think globally, in a growth company especially, we grew at 38% last year. And as we look at this year being in line with our long-term growth objective of a 20-plus percent grower, it really -- it sets the field that number one, any new position, anything we're doing, it's never about one person. And so while we've got an opening out there, I definitely want to make sure people are clear. The additions that we've had are a new Head and Lead in Sourcing, and the opportunities in gross margin that they've found for our brand as we look at the back half of 2012 as we professionalize the organization, what's happening in planning is that, winning is a culture. It's not a person. And it's not one person that you hire. And I think that's something that really is evident and come through at Under Armour especially, that we are building something great here, and there's a lot of foundational pieces. And so, what Brad and his team have done, what our supply chain has done, they've done a lot of heavy lifting, and there's certainly a lot more to do, which is -- it frankly just screams to opportunity. So we feel very good about the way that we're working and finding the right partners, bringing the right partners on board. And more importantly, beyond just $1 billion or $2 billion foundation but setting up for a multi-billion global platform.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide some color on what kind of conservatism is embedded in your guidance for the top line for 2012?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Christian. I think going back to the comments around the drivers of our revenue outlook, obviously, coming out of Q4, we are still in the middle of the winter season. So the impact of the unseasonably warm weather in Q4 is -- it's kind of still here with us in Q1, as it's still relatively warm for a winter season. So there'll be a definite impact in the beginning part of this year relative to that. I think again to my comments, in my prepared remarks, definitely seeing a much more conservative approach from our retail partners out there and how they look at managing inventory in their order banks and so forth. But just taking a look at that and just saying, \"We -- to be prudent, let's make sure we look at where we are today and how that will impact the rest of this year.\" So I can't really quantify to you how much conservatism. I think what we're doing is taking a snapshot of where we are today and kind of putting that forward for the rest of 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to dive into the cotton piece a little bit. And I know it's a really good start to that program, and maybe you could talk about the progression, what you learned from running that business this year and how it's going to -- how we should look for it to progress going forward, areas that were better than expected, areas that were worse than expected, given the -- ultimately, what you guys have defined as a very large opportunity.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, so, I think we learned a lot. First of all, as we've said repeatedly going from a $3 billion market to opening ourselves up to that $12 billion market, and more importantly, expanding ourselves to the -- the $58 billion market that sits out there as we move into different categories. Our brand, we're in an evolution where we've gone from on field, we've gone from, okay, in the gym, to and from the gym, and I think we're finding more places where the consumer wants to take us. And one of the things that you'll see, as we've been moving for quite some time, is being -- moving beyond just being a climate-based company into giving the consumer other reasons to buy. And so some of the success that we saw in the fourth quarter, even beyond cotton, was like our hooded Fleece program and some of our big logo hoodies, and things that have a little more detail to them than just this shirt will keep you warm and this shirt will keep you cool. So there's a, without question, a desire from the customer to have Under Armour take them to a different place. So the category that we have around Charged Cotton, is -- it was a medium-size category that we see will continue to be outpacing for us as we head into 2012. Men's performed very well on the T-shirt side. I think we did a really good job with the launch of Charged Cotton in the T-shirt side for Men. I don't think we did a great job in the launch of Charged Cotton for Women. So there's an enormous opportunity there. And it's because presenting a basic and reinventing basics in the Women's side is a much more difficult task. And so what you'll see is us come back with a new approach and with a new line, and frankly, a lot of variety, a lot of selection that we'll have in Women's, a lot of great colors, and most importantly, focusing on fit. So the fabrications, I think, is something that is almost a given when it comes to Under Armour and the consumers' expectation. But as we've learned and as we've grown, every single year we get better. And so what we need to continue to train, and hopefully retrain our account base and even sometimes our customers, is that it's not the same old Under Armour. Is that there is this constant look and belief that we can grow and that we can be more. So around the Storm Fleece that we had, I think, the reinvention we had in the fall, the sell-through that we saw, we were very pleased with it when it came out of the box. And I think that we were prudent with the way that we approached our business around the Storm Fleece. And also, as we looked in our Direct-Consumer, which is the place where we've got the best and the most visibility, we had great success there. But there are other places, I think, where -- our first year in cotton, I think, we're very pleased. I think it's a new category for us and something that we think has great upside long term.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just a quick question on International. Could you just address the change and the rate of growth there? Is there anything going on? Is there any transitioning happening?", "Kevin A. Plank", "You know what, let me take a second and sort of give you our approach as we look at International. As I mentioned, when Kate asked earlier, the growth drivers that we have for underwear -- for Under Armour, Apparel, Footwear, Direct-Consumer and International, and as we've talked about our growth being -- 2011 and 2012 really leaning on Apparel and Direct-Consumer, and that Footwear, we expect to kick in, in 2013, is something that will be important as it is today, but continue to grow in the level of importance for us. And then, International really becoming important for us in 2014, 2015. We're currently doing business in 61 countries. And our goal is to be a global company, which we define as more than half our revenues coming from outside of our home country. So our understanding of different cultures and translating the underlying message and our ability to attract great people that'll help us make that translation, is the key. We currently have a search going for a new Head of International. And I can tell definitively, we'll have a new Head of International in place in 2012. We believe that Under Armour translates, and we look for examples of what happened in Japan. As I mentioned, these things, though, they take time. And we've planted a lot of seeds, and those 61 countries, some of them have been in there as long as 5 and 6 years, and some of them as recent as the last 12 and 24 months. But Japan was -- from 1999 to 2007 was 0 to USD $35 million. From '07 to '08 something clicked and the tipping point occurred. And they went to $70-plus million. Then $84 million in 2009. $106 million in 2010. And most recently, this past year, in a tsunami year, Dome -- our Japanese partner there has grown to USD $147 million. When you look at that growth and that trajectory, it just takes time. It takes taking the time with the brand, to explain the brand, to getting the consumer acclimated with it and allowing it to build. The fact of the matter, though, is that our brand does translate. We believe that we have the ability to be global. And there's a lot of places that we can grow the brand in the future beyond just the United States.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Kevin or Brad, what scenario do you think -- or what scenario would need to unfold where you would feel comfortable taking your revenue guidance back up to that higher end of the 20% to 25% growth rate? Is this purely weather that needs to turn in the first quarter that would give you that confidence?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Camilo. I think there's a couple of things, I think -- again, weather is part of the impact, but Kevin talked a lot about this in his prepared remarks around the environment that's out there right now and the promotional environment, too. And looking at that today, is that a reflection of the weather? Or is that more the environment as it's going to be through 2012? And we're looking at that and just saying, \"Let's make sure we take a conservative and prudent approach on how we view the rest of 2012.\" So I would say if that environment changes a little bit as we get into Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter that, that could potentially be a positive for us. But right now, again, we're looking at where that environment is today. Obviously, weather always plays an important part to us. But I think our business over time as we evolve and look at broadening our SKU base on the Fall/Winter product line, we're becoming less and less dependent on that, hopefully. So obviously, our Fleece products are much more versatile than a ColdGear kind of more specific end-use product that we have that's more dependent on weather. So our goal is to be less dependent on weather. But obviously, with Q4, especially ColdGear product, if it is cold at the end of this year, colder than it has been, there is some potential upside. But I would look at that and temper that a little bit and say we are definitely being much more disciplined on the supply chain side on how we forecast, plan and buy inventory to our business. So -- and we've talked a lot about this in the past, about being less disciplined in the past had caused us to chase a lot more top line and buy a lot more inventory. With our more prudent approach right now, more disciplined approach on our inventory management, although we still want to put ourselves in a position to capture top line, it would be a little bit more tempered how we can do that compared to last year.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Got it. And then my next question relates actually to the supply-chain investments that you've been making in personnel. If you could give us an update on how that progress is coming along and if the efficiencies that you are expecting to see are happening at a quicker pace.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, no, that's the interesting thing, is we feel really good about where we are, but unfortunately, it's just a little hard for you guys to see it yet because it's data points that we see internally that will end up showing for you probably more towards the back half of 2012. So should [ph] kind of walk through a couple of components of this.  First and foremost, on the product side, really being led by Henry Stafford is really the SKU rationalization, which has been a very positive impact for us across the board, not only from a margin perspective but from a cost perspective, too, and eliminating unproductive, unprofitable SKUs. And as I said in my remarks, as we end 2012, we'll have 20 less -- 20% less SKUs than we started the year with. And that's a big factor in not only helping margins to some degree as we get in the back half of the year, but also as part of how we can leverage our SG&A a little bit. Beyond SKU productivity, when you get into the forecasting and planning process, again, with Rich on board, really focused on the disciplines around, let's make sure we forecast our business appropriately, demand, forecast demand, but also how we manage our supply chain and how we flow product in and how we control and be disciplined around our buys. Again, a lot of what Rich has been doing has really set ourselves up to be much more confident in the back half of '12. But him just being on board for the last 7 or 8 months, you wouldn't expect that impact to show until the back half of '12. On top of all that, much more disciplined in planning around and the coordinating with, not only the front end of our supply chain with the planning teams, but the back end, with our outlet teams and how we liquidate product, too. And being much coordinated with our wholesale business and our outlet business and how we liquidate product, will help tremendously, too, especially again, as we get into the back half of '12. So a lot of the things that we see here and we -- that give us much more confidence, just can't show visibly to all of you yet, but we feel really good about some small incremental steps that'll start to show in Spring/Summer '12 a little bit. But really, as we get back to the back half of 2012 with Janet Fox and the Sourcing team's ability to work on gross margins, and Rich's team to be more disciplined around how we grow inventory in and liquidate inventory, you'll start to see that impact positively to margins and inventory in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the guidance and how inventories were. Are you saying that the retailers are sitting on excess Under Armour inventory right now? Or is it a total situation with, I would say, brands that, let's say, are more seasonal than you are, that is affecting the way they're thinking about purchasing for later in the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sam, yes. It's clearly -- it's a total situation coming out of obviously, in the warm kind of winter season we're having. It's a total situation for the retailers, including some of our inventory, too.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And you've made the -- I think, the comment was made regarding that every -- that things are regular price. You did hit some of your more seasonal product. We've seen it on sale. But is this over and above right now? Is that part of the reasons for the margin issues with the reduction in the gross margins in the first half of the year? Part of that will be more clearance? Or is that all a mix issue and costing issues?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, the big driver in the front half of the year is the input cost pressures. Again, going back to -- we locked in our commodity prices with our suppliers for Spring/Summer '12 back in the spring when we were kind of at the peak of that commodity price pressure last year. So that'll flow through here in Spring/Summer '12. Most of our margin pressure is going to be from input costs. From a clearance perspective, again, going to Kevin's comments, our job is to protect that premium price position for us in our brand, and we're -- we very much hold that near and dear to our hearts. Where that -- we don't want that to be margin pressure for us. From a liquidation of our product perspective, and how we flow excess inventory and discontinued inventory through our outlet channels? I think what you will see is more of that, more towards the back half of 2012. We'll definitely be doing more of that in 2012 than we did in '11, as a ratio of the total sales for the outlet business, but more so on the back half of '12. That'll impact margins a little bit as we flow through more excess to our outlet channel. But again, that's a fractional part of the overall impact to the year.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And just one last follow-up on this. I was just out at a one of the -- at the Outdoor Retailer Show, and a good number of people from factories, and so on, were basically saying, \"The retailers are all waiting. They're writing their orders much later than they did a year ago because of the weather.\" Is that part -- is that also affecting the guidance right now? That a year ago, you had more orders looking forward in-hand that you do at this time this year?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Okay, Sam. Let me -- I'd like to sort of just give our thoughts right now as what we're seeing in the marketplace in a broader way. What we've seen in our own Direct-Consumer channels and with the growth that we've had there, our full price Direct-Consumer channels, is that we are not seeing the need or we're not promoting. And I think what we're finding is that being and building a premium brand in a growing promotional environment is becoming sort of a tale of the day. And so, we want to be clear that Under Armour remains a full-price brand. And we're allowed to do that because of our innovation, because of our thought leadership. But things like Charged Cotton and Storm Cotton, and new technologies we're bringing out like ColdBlack, it gives us, frankly, it gives us pricing power. And it gives us pricing power to consumer, and our job, number one, is to respect it and also appreciate just exactly how fragile that pricing power is. And so we need to protect it. But we do -- we like -- we'll get in line and we will promote from time to time as well. But we feel in a much more prudent way, and it is without question the exception for the Under Armour brand, much more than the rule for us. And it feels like it's becoming a rule in a broader way at retail. We are not willing to pay for that, we're not willing to buy that, which is why we want to be very prudent in the way that they're thinking about 2012. And if something turns in the market, or there's cold snaps or if there's just a general sense where people are not being trained in understanding [ph] for having 20% or 30% sales, to give them reason to go to retail. Because of our pricing power, we have great relationships with our retailers. And because of that, we do, for the most part, remain the full price brand in their stores. And we are the ones that are delivering premium gross margins and higher ASPs to our retailers. So we're very proud of that. And I think it makes us a little bit different, but it still has us -- we are still subject to some of the things where some of the caution that we're seeing or feeling out there from our broader wholesale distribution. And there's a lot of success and a lot of wins, and I don't if this wholesale commentary. But without question, it definitely characterizes what we're sensing and what we're feeling from our seat.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So just back on the -- I want to make sure I'm crystal clear on what -- how we should be thinking about our models for gross margin in the first quarter, which seems to be the point of turmoil that you guys want to be a little bit more conservative on considering the weather, considering a bit more inventory than you expected to have heading into the quarter. Maybe Brad, if you could clear up where you think we should be, how we should be thinking about our models on gross margins? And then what you're seeing right now as far as how trends are going as you're clearing through some of that inventory. Has that -- have things improved lately with the weather getting colder? Or is it still kind of coming in below what you were thinking in the quarter?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Michael. Look, again, to go through gross margin and kind of the seasonality of that in 2012. If you look at the impact -- if you go back to 2011 and kind of pull forward the 2011 story to the front half of 2012, is that the real story in 2011 for the most part was the impact of input costs going up year-over-year. And if you look at the full year impact of 2011, that item, it's going to be about 110 basis points for 2011. Now there were some others things in '11 like bringing hats and bags in-house and so forth, which will comp in '12. So the real story there from a trend perspective is that 110 basis-point negative impact for us in 2011. If you pull that 2011 story forward in '12, in my comments and what I'm saying, is you'll probably see a similar impact in the front half of '12 with that 110 basis points. And the reason being that we've been talking is that, that the commodity price pressures, the input pressures have been kind of building during the course of '11 and into '12 and continue into '12, where we start to see that abate more in the back half of '12. So front half of '12, input cost pressures lead to a gross margin impact in the front half similar to what you saw on that 110 basis-points product input cost in 2011. When you get to the back half of the year, again in my prepared remarks, through a lot of the sourcing efforts that have been put in place and a lot of the disciplines we have around inventory management, will help us offset that downfall in the front half of the year in gross margins in the back half. So you're talking about a relatively flat gross margin year-over-year. As far as some of the trends in clearing, I think the interesting thing is that you do look at our business and you look at parts of our business in categories that were very, very successful in the fourth quarter and continue to be successful, like our Fleece business. Going back to our comments around some of our products which are -- have a little bit more a versatile end use versus a more specific end use that ColdGear and baselayer may have, performed very, very well for us in the fourth quarter and continue to perform well. So it goes back to the comments, we do have products -- our expanding product offerings do help us even regardless of the weather. And obviously, weather itself will help us with our more end-use products around ColdGear and baselayer.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So -- and I have a follow-up but just to make sure that I'm clear, as we look at the first quarter, what you're telling me is that the majority of what we're talking about with gross margin here is related to some input costing. And not to really to be hyperanalyzing things we see go on sale in the middle of quarter or looking at weather and making guesses about your trends through the quarter. That's not really what you think would change your view on how we should be looking at gross margins in the very near [indiscernible]", "Brad Dickerson", "Input cost, input cost, input cost. Yes, Michael. It's all input cost. I mean, we're -- again, from a -- if you break wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer out on the wholesale side, again, we've talked about this a lot.  It's protecting that premium price position. So do not expect any kind of negative impact from a promotional environment for our brand in the front half of this year. And you're saying first quarter. I'd say look at it from the whole front-half perspective. Where we will lean a little bit more on our outlet team, from an excess inventory liquidation perspective, is really more in the back half of the year, as we kind of plan ahead. And again, that -- does that impact gross margin negatively? If we lean a little bit more on them, yes. But again, I think the impact is pretty fractional in the total of all the gross margin puts and takes.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Let me ask Kevin a quick question then. Kevin, as we headed into the holiday, I think one thing that we all learned was that it ended up being a little bit more of a promotional holiday for retail, in general, than what most investors were thinking. And I think you guys went in planning on it being more of a full-priced holiday for you. You saw some of your big competitors get very competitive on pricing in some of your core categories. And there's probably some market share trade that we'll see as the NPD data comes out, or whatever, in those key categories. So I'm just -- with that in mind, I'm just thinking about how you're looking at price increases, that you guys have talked about that you have planned for the year and how you're thinking about navigating price-to-volume equation going forward based on what we learned in the fourth quarter?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, well, I mean, I don't think there was a little bit of a promotion. I think it was like global promotion is that -- what we saw at retail. And everybody you looked at was 20- and 30-off.  And the retail environment is really -- I don't know if there's a solution out there, but we can control what we can control. So let me take a core category for us and when you bring up things like market share, baselayer is a great place for me to use it as an example. We remain the market leader in baselayer, but it's still -- it's a category that we used when we got here to help launch ourselves as a full-line sporting goods athletic brand. And there's ways, I think, that we're looking what the consumer counts on us that create what I said before about pricing power. The focus that we have on product leadership, it's what makes us #1 in the category and it's why the consumer chooses us. Because our product flat out is just better. Now there's a lot of things that now are coming on the market, and frankly, challenging us with pricing. When we're selling a $25 T-shirt at Dick's Sporting Goods, and you've got other versions that are $12 or $11 or $10 at Walmart, it creates some channel conflicts, but it means that the consumer is still is going to be driving and going to our key sporting goods partners because of the brand. And because of not only the product that we did last year but more importantly, it's the new innovation that's coming out. We're maintaining our premium pricing platform. Our average selling price is significantly higher when you look at the Under Armour brand than even our closest competitor. And it's because we're not promoting, because we are still driving in this area. And that we leave the discounting to, frankly, others in the category. And because of -- they have a different platform, they have a different model, others can do that. For ourselves, the discounting is not something that we're willing to get into. And that's why, I think, we're being very clear of -- we're fortunate to have the top line that we do. And so, we can have the ability to be much more selective about where do we want to be and how are we building this brand for the next 5, 10 and 20 years versus building it for the next 12 months. And our, frankly, our consumer has consistently showed a willingness to pay for that quality. And then most importantly, is just our ability to innovate. Just constant innovation within the category. Not unlike what we did with Storm, not unlike what we're doing with ColdBlack, not unlike what you'll see in Footwear, but really across the board is we want to create that mentality with the consumer of building just, Under Armour is a place of innovation, it's for the latest and for the greatest. And it's important to remember that our long-term goal is to be the #1 athletic brand in the world. And so in doing that, again, it's not going to happen overnight and it is going to take time. But as we've said before, things like categories like baselayer, are not pushing the panic button, not seeing how fast can we get sales or revs or top line out the door, but how are we constantly re-instilling the faith and the confidence in that consumer that the Under Armour brand is the destination for the premium consumer. We've used this, our entr\u00e9e with baselayer into the broader markets. So now we're here, and what are we going to do about it? With 38% growth in 2012, I feel like we're making the right decisions about where we're going as a 20-plus percent grower in 2011 and the 20-plus percent grower as we look to 2012. I think we're leveraging our brand in the right ways to, number one, protect what we've built, protect the market share where we've been, and grow and drive that as well, but most importantly, use it to leverage ourselves into the appropriate additional category that someday will help us realize that goal of being the #1 athletic brand in the world.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So no planned changes to the price increases that you guys had been mentioning to us last quarter, it sounds like.", "Kevin A. Plank", "We're innovating. If everybody else is discounting, I think it's -- somebody -- I don't believe in that. We are the contrarians. And so I think that there is an opportunity out there for full price, and I think that frankly, Under Armour is the perfect brand to deliver it.", "Tom Shaw", "All right, thanks. Operator, we'll now conclude. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to reporting to you our first quarter 2012 results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Friday, April 20 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of solid revenue growth in Q1 as we continue to lead our industry in bringing true innovation to athletes. All 3 of our product engines: apparel, footwear and accessories grew more than 20% with total revenues up 23%. That marked the eighth consecutive quarter where our top line has grown above 20%. Brad will provide more color on our results in a moment, but I want to focus my comments this morning on 2 broad themes that we believe are driving our results, and more importantly, setting us up for continued profitable growth in 2013 and beyond.", "The first point is a simple equation. When we innovate and add value for the athlete, we win. And importantly, when we do that, we do not see consumer resistance to price, a critical piece for us as we expand distribution while maintaining our premium brand status. ", "Second, we've done a very effective job over the past 2 years of balancing the need to improve our competencies in critical areas like supply chain, planning and design, while executing to deliver the 20-plus percent growth that we have accomplished. While our brand strength continues to drive our connection with consumers, we believe its ability to focus on investments in people and systems, while also delivering solid top and bottom line growth is a critical element to the Under Armour story.", "Let me cite a few examples of how investments we made in the past 2 years paid off in this quarter and how we continue to make new investments that we believe will help drive results 2 years out. While innovation for athletes will always be at the core of how we build products, over the past 2 years, we've begun to deliver a more Under Armour-specific design language throughout our assortments. We invested significantly in both our team and tools around design, bringing industry expertise to help bolster this dimension of the Under Armour brand. This focus has specifically helped drive improved results in our Women's business and the introduction in Q1 of the Armour Bra, Sports Bra, is a great example of the right blend between performance and style. ", "Our team talked extensively with our consumers to understand what was lacking with their existing sports bra. They also went into the lab to better understand how a sports bra could offer ultimate support and comfort. From that work, our design team reconstructed the sports bra and the results have been great. We've had a very successful launch with the Armour Bra with our wholesale partners and early sell-through on our e-commerce site was as strong as we've seen for new women's products.", "By increasing our investments and design over the past 2 years, we're now seeing stronger products across the Women's business with new items like the Perfect Pant, with soft, breathable fabric that has superior stretch with a great fit. Our sweat-wicking Moisture Transport System accelerates dry time as well. The true benefit is longer term as we're introducing our brand to a new Women's consumer who may have previously seen us as solely focused on team sports.", "As I mentioned upfront, when we innovate, we win. And we are able to drive higher price points with better products. We saw it last year at the introduction of Charged Cotton that dries faster than your old cotton T-shirt. On the Women's side, we focused on improving the fit of our Charged Cotton T-shirt in year 2, and the early results have been very strong sell-throughs. ", "We saw it first quarter with the Armour Bra introduced at that $58 price point. And we also saw strong consumer reaction to our new Tech tee, where we've brought a new fabrication making it softer, while keeping it extremely lightweight and taking the price up to $23 from just $20 a year ago. We believe these are all great indicators that the consumer continues to view us as a premium performance brand and reinforces the thought that as long as we continue to innovate, we will win.", "The other major apparel store that hit in Q1 was ColdBlack. This latest technology from Under Armour not only blocks the sun's UV rays, the ones that causes sunburn, but also reflects infrared heat keeping you more comfortable on a hot and sunny day. Our success here is enabling us to drive higher price points in our polos, and eventually, at other products as well. Hunter Mahan has been wearing ColdBlack to great success in the PGA Tour this year. Winning 2 tournaments so far this year and moving up to #5 in the world, his highest ranking ever. ColdBlack is a great example of Under Armour incorporating additive technology to a premium product, and we see consumers truly starting to embrace it as the weather heats up.", "In our Footwear business, the impact of our prior investments have been equally important. We preached patience on our Footwear business, and we continue to make the type of progress that will position us long term as a leader in this space. Our first and most important consumer is on field, and our baseball cleats business has been exceptional this spring. We've taken market share at the greatest rate since our introduction of baseball cleats over 5 years ago. We are now the official performance footwear supplier of Major League Baseball. We've got our cleats on many of the game's rising stars, like Buster Posey and Ryan Zimmerman. And our premium product is performing extremely well. ", "Next up, our premium product for the football field is coming with the introduction of the Highlight cleats, the super high and ridiculously light cleat that Cam Newton wore exclusively this past season. Visually, this $130 cleat will look different from any footwear you'll see in the NFL this season. But it provides additional support that reduces the need for taping ankles. The limited pairs we've made available on our e-commerce site were quickly sold out, but will be available next month at Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker's Eastbay catalog and website, as well as limited numbers with other select retailers.", "We've talked about establishing the right cadence in our Footwear business, building off our early success in our on-field product, improving it each year and taking those learnings to more acceptable categories like running. Our recent success with the Charge RC running shoe is evidence that we are establishing the right pace of innovation at the right price in the right distribution. We've seen continued strong sell-through on the $120 Charge RC running shoe. As we bring new colors to the assortment, we are seeing strong results for the Charge RC in both Men's and Women's in both specialty run and our direct consumer channels. And the Split II Running Shoe performing very well within our own sporting goods distribution. ", "So while we're in a very strong product cycle entering 2012, we think it's important to understand where that product came from. It came from investments. Ones that were made over the past 2 years and ones that were made as we simultaneously delivered 20-plus percent top line growth. We believe this illustrates not only the power of the Under Armour brand, but also the efficiency of our business model in harnessing that brand's strength. We believe this is a critical element in the understanding of the Under Armour investment story. ", "Simply put, this is what you're going to see from us over the next several years. Our growth will be driven by smart and early investments in people, systems and technologies and a high level of execution to ensure the best possible return on those investments. ", "As we have stepped up the pace of innovation on the product development side, we've also been making investments in our supply chain and planning functions. We're starting to see early benefits from the years of industry experience that we've brought to the organization in our supply chain and planning teams. While you're now just starting to see the early fruits of their labors, we believe more meaningful financial benefits will be seen later this year and into 2013.", "Equally important is that these business leaders are driving new competencies and improving our cross-functional communications that would be essential as our organization grows. We have consistently stressed the importance of building a great team and continue to add experience from outside Under Armour with the recent hires of senior leaders in both supply chain and Human Resources.", "As we begin to aggressively execute in places where we've made some initial investments, we're building the teams that will be contributing meaningfully to our growth in 2014 and beyond. This past quarter, we announced the hiring of Charlie Maurath as the new President of Under Armour International. Charlie has over 20 years of experience with athletic brands internationally. Most recently, as head of the Latin America business for Adidas. We believe that the best time to invest in our international business is when our core U.S. business is strong, so that new markets like China, South America and our business in Europe will bring an entire new population of consumers to the Under Armour brand.", "So in summary, our business this past quarter was very solid. We continue to lead the athletic apparel industry in the pace of meaningful innovation, thought leadership. And we're establishing the right cadence of product flow at premium price points in Footwear. ", "New technologies are helping us bring new levels of performance in style to our Women's business. In Men's apparel, we're reaching new consumers with Charged Cotton and our new underwear program and expanding the definition of performance with ColdBlack. We're successfully transitioning from a tight T-shirt company to a fully integrated athletic brand, capable of servicing the full needs of the athlete, men's and women's, head to toe globally. ", "But more important, we continue to invest to ensure the next Armour Bra, the next ColdBlack and the next innovation in Under Armour footwear are already somewhere in our product pipeline. And we are investing in a team that will be able to execute on these opportunities and continue to drive the type of growth that you've come to expect from Under Armour. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter financial results, followed by our updated 2012 outlook. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2012 increased 23% to $384 million. ", "Apparel grew 23% to $283 million during the quarter, and we experienced relatively balanced growth across our Men's, Women's and Youth categories. New Product Innovation was well received, including the reinvented Tech tee, ColdBlack apparel and our Women's Studio line and Armour Bra. Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 49% for the quarter, representing approximately 25% of net revenues compared to 20% in the prior-year period. In our retail business, we opened 4 new Factory House stores during the first quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 84, up 33% from 63 locations at the end of the first quarter of 2011.", "On the e-commerce side, we completed our first full quarter with our new platform. We will continue to add efficiency and functionality to the site throughout 2012. Footwear net revenues during the first quarter increased 24% to $64 million from $51 million the prior year, representing nearly 17% of net revenues. ", "Growth during the period was driven by the introductions in running footwear, including the Split II and Charge RC as well strong performance with our baseball cleats. As we have now fully lapped last year's transition of our hats and bags business in-house, our accessories' net revenues during the first quarter increased 26% to $30 million from $24 million in the prior-year period. International net revenues increased 32% to $22 million in the first quarter and represented approximately 6% of total net revenues. ", "Now looking at margins. First quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 45.6% compared with 46.4% in the prior year's quarter. While we had some small puts and takes during the quarter, the primary factor driving results was higher input cost in our North American apparel and accessories businesses, which negatively impacted margins by approximately 100 basis points. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 40 basis points to 39.2% in the first quarter of 2012 from 39.6% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: ", "First, marketing cost declined to 11.5% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.3% in the prior-year period. Expense leverage during the period was a function of strategic decisions to move certain media costs later in the year. I'll provide more details on full year marketing timing shortly.", "Second, selling costs increased to 9.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the continued expansion of our Factory House stores and e-commerce platform. ", "Third, product innovation and supply-chain cost increased to 9.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 9.3% in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher expenses related to our distribution facilities and accelerated spending around innovation. ", "Finally, corporate services remained unchanged from last year at 8.1% of net revenues.", "Operating income during the first quarter grew 15% to $24 million compared with $21 million in the prior-year period. Operating margin contracted 50 basis points during the quarter to 6.3%. Below the operating line, net other expenses increased to $1.3 million in the first quarter from $1.1 million in the prior year's period as a result of the debt assumed for our acquisition of our corporate headquarters. ", "Our first quarter tax rate of 36.6% was favorable to the 39.5% rate in last year's period as we received a state tax credit during the quarter benefiting our tax rate by 170 basis points.", "Our resulting net income in the first quarter increased 21% to $15 million compared with $12 million in the prior-year period. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $0.28 compared with $0.23 in the prior-year period. ", "Now switching over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end decreased 3% to $107 million compared with $111 million at March 31, 2011. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $300 million revolving credit facility at quarter end. Long-term debt increased to $76 million at quarter end from $14 million at March 31, 2011, reflecting the acquisition of our corporate headquarters. ", "Inventory at quarter end increased 30% year-over-year to $324 million compared to $249 million at March 31, 2011. A portion of this growth in inventory dollars is being driven by higher cost per unit as the growth rate in inventory units approximated our net revenues growth rate during the quarter.", "Our investment in operating capital expenditures was approximately $9 million for the first quarter. We continue to plan for 2012 operating capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $65 million. ", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2012. Our prior outlook called for 2012 net revenues growth at the low end of our 20% to 25% long-term growth target and operating income growth at the higher end of our 20%, 25% long-term growth target. Based on current visibility, we are updating our net revenues outlook to a range of $1.78 billion to $1.8 billion, representing growth of 21% to 22%. Also, we are raising our operating income outlook to a range of $203 million to $205 million, representing growth of 25% to 26%. With this updated outlook, I would like to provide additional color on several items for the year.", "First on gross margins. We continue to see first half margins, primarily impacted by higher product costs offset in the second half by our continued efforts to rationalize our SKU base, add discipline and processes to our planning functions and enhance our sourcing capabilities. We continue to expect our full year gross margins to remain relatively flat with year-ago levels.", "Switching to SG&A, we continue to see the opportunity for moderate leverage, while we sustain investments for our future growth. We now have better visibility on the timing of these investments and how they will impact the remaining quarters in 2012. ", "In marketing, we are planning a greater rating of our annual spend, primarily related to media and production costs to shift to the second and third quarters to better align and support our brand stories. We now see approximately 100 basis points of marketing deleverage year-over-year in the second quarter and approximately 200 basis points of marketing deleverage year-over-year in the third quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect a similar marketing spend rate as in 2011. ", "Across our other 3 SG&A buckets: selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services, we generally see sequential decelerations in year-over-year growth rates throughout the year. This deceleration largely reflects the lapping of incremental investments during 2011 in areas such as e-commerce. We relaunched the site last November and sourcing and planning where we enhanced our organizational structures. In aggregate, we continue to see moderate SG&A leverage as the driver of higher operating margins implied in our updated outlook.", "Below [ph] operating results, we reiterate our prior outlook, including higher year-over-year interest expense giving a full year of the additional long-term debt for our headquarters' acquisition, a full year effective tax rate of 37.5% to 38% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 53.2 million to 53.4 million. ", "Before opening up to Q&A, we would also like to reiterate our confidence in our inventory trajectory throughout 2012. While we expect the second quarter inventory growth rates to look similar to the first quarter growth rate, we anticipate the inventory growth rate will come in below the net revenues growth rate starting in the third quarter. ", "Our team continues to make great progress with our three-pronged approach of reducing our SKU count 20% by the end of the year, building discipline and collaboration in our forecasting and planning process and strengthening our global supply chain.", "We would now like to open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions. First question is just on the apparel business. I thought it was interesting that it was balanced between Men's, Youth and Women's. And I would have expected or was expecting Youth and Women's to be outpacing Men's kind of going forward here. And I was hoping that you could sort of remind us or elaborate on what happened in the quarter and if you expect core apparel to grow similarly across those or if we should expect that to change going forward? And then my second question is just under new leadership that you've hired for international, can you give us any more detail on what we should expect to see, what the steps we should expect to see over the next couple of years in Europe and Asia and Latin America?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Robbie, it's Kevin. So first and foremost, I'd start with that big statement in my script that said when we innovate, we win. And I think we're continuing to do that, specifically on the apparel side. So start with the basics. These core basics of HeatGear T-shirt, ColdGear mocks. And you're seeing us come back and reinvent these. Most specifically this past Spring, we're seeing it with the Tech tee. This isn't a million unit program. This is millions and millions of units program. And number one, going back and taking a program that's heritage to us, going back 4, 5, 6 years and reinventing it with the consumer first with a better product, softer hand, better fabric, better performance. And then also taking the price point up from $20 to $23. It's obviously -- it's a value add for our customers, meaning our distribution and then, of course, a huge value add for us, but especially great for the consumer. So they're voting with increased performance in sell-through, in some cases 1.5x to 2x of sell-through that we saw on the old products. So it means that, number one, in creating these heritage programs, which have these franchises, we need to keep reinventing and bringing them back. We see the ability to continue to augment our existing apparel business and the message that I talked about with ColdBlack of bringing technologies to basics like take our performance polo, and here is a product that's doing very well for us. But then we add a new a technology like ColdBlack, which effectively gives you the feeling of keeping yourself about 10 degrees cooler than wearing a shirt that doesn't have the ColdBlack technology in it. So it's constantly finding ways for us to innovate around that. And I'll get to the Footwear answer maybe a little later in the call. But I think what's you're seeing from us is this constant commitment to innovation and having it come through and having it really pour out in everything that we're doing. So on the youth side, I agree. We think there's huge opportunity there. One of the biggest struggles we have is really from a distribution standpoint. We'll continue to find the right stride within our existing distribution, so we've been talking to our partners, the big guys specifically and everybody wants the Youth business. Nobody's really sure exactly how to get at it. At the same time, though, we are leading the way there. We're the #1 Youth brand virtually everywhere we're doing business. And I think that we're the ones that are really carrying that lantern and really trying to blaze trails there. So I don't know if we have it perfected, but we are seeing great growth. We're seeing that youth kid continue to vote for our brand as well, and so we think there's a lot of opportunities. So there's more to come, we think, within our existing distribution, first and foremost, but we also think there's some ways for us to be creative there. On the leadership front, we're really excited first of all about the announcement we made with Charlie coming here. This is an executive who's been doing this for 20-plus years. They know the industry. They know the people, they know the players, they know the manufacturers. It's something, which we think we are perfectly positioned to take advantage of. So we're excited for Charlie to get here and get onboard and what that's going to mean to our global business. And so speaking about that for just a second, we've been in Europe now for -- coming up on 6 years. And again, Charlie is a German national. And so he'll bring great experience. He's spent time in Europe, as well working for the other brand. And so what he brings to the table, we think that there's ways [ph] for us at that tipping point. I think I said it on the last call, we believe it's getting closer and closer for us. And we're waiting for it to accelerate. But meanwhile, we've got a team of people in Amsterdam that are working for us in our European business just doing an amazing job. And we continue to look at the examples of some of the things we've done with success that we've found in Japan, which this year, we'll close on a USD $200 million business for us in Japan. So again, it was 7 years to $35 million, and then the business began to double. So as we sit here in our European business, we think there's great upside to come. And global, on a leadership standpoint, we made a couple of other really important hires, too, that will give the human resource and planning and supply chain functions a real kick that will give us a much better global perspective as well. So evolving from a pretty good North American wholesale apparel brand into a truly global brand, I think is something that you're seeing coming from us right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the process you're going through from a SKU rationalization. How the retailers are responding to this initiative and if you think it's having any impact at all in your sales growth in 2012?", "Brad Dickerson", "We obviously we talk about SKU rationalization in our last call, too, and it was all built into our guidance. To be honest with you, it being in the early stages of this, a lot of the rationalization we're doing has very, very little impact to the top line. And it has very little impact relative to our retail partners. So our goal, as we kind of stated, was to get to a 20% reduction in SKUs by the end of this year. And I'm happy to say that it looks like right now, that we'll probably be a little bit ahead of that, especially in the style side. But on the color side, be pretty much right on that target, maybe a little bit ahead. So that was a process that was started probably about 1.5 years ago. And on the product side, led by Henry Stafford, and we've done a great job there.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And also just operationally speaking, I know last year, you had some margin drag from sales allowances due to missing on-time deliveries. If you could give us any update on how on-time deliveries are trending this year, and should you get any gross margin benefit from that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, we always talk about turning that dial pretty slowly on the inventory management side. And as we have talked over the last year or so of inventory management improvements and our planning processes and how we're buying our inventory, always balancing that with the fill rates and how we're servicing our customers. And to your point, we called some issues out that we had last year. So the good news here is that both of those metrics are heading in the right direction. Obviously, as you've seen, the inventory growth rate coming down as we mentioned in the last call from growth rates last year. And our fill rates are pretty much coming in as expected, so they're improving. They're still not where we want them to be longer term, but the good news is, is they are improving as we expected. So from a benefit to the sales allowances and discounts, a lot of that was built into our original guidance we gave 3 months ago for the year. As we anticipate and have more confidence in our inventory management abilities, we put some of those benefits in our guidance. So a lot of those are already built into our future guidance and margins.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pam Quintiliano with Oppenheimer.", "Pamela Nagler Quintiliano - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I have a few things. Could you just remind us about the cadence of new product introductions for the rest of the year? And then also, I know this is a very broad question, Kevin, but just what are you most excited when you're looking ahead over the next year and why, in terms of new product that's coming out?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, I think I'd probably put them -- put those 2 products together, those 2 questions together. Cadence is very important. I think what you're seeing from the brand really across all functions is that we're growing up as a company. There's a lot less volatility. The company is becoming much more quiet in delivering a pretty consistent product. First of all, from an investment story with the 20-plus percent top line growth is something we're very proud of and now have 2 years of running consistency there. And I think you're seeing it on the product side especially. Again, I keep going back to this idea of when we innovate, we win. And just a couple, again, to underscore some of the points and the products that we've introduced so far this year in the last several months that are working for us. The consumer is telling us that if we put a better product out there, they're willing to pay more money. This is not -- it's not a chase to see who is the cheapest price. That's not where Under Armour plays. But we are a premium brand, and I think we bring a lot to our existing distribution with the ability to continue to elevate and raise price points. And it's doing it with things like the Tech tee example I used before. But we're seeing it with ColdBlack. I mean, that's a product of $60 and $70 polo shirt that we're bringing out there. We're seeing it with Armour Bra, which is a new technology on the Women's side, that we have and I spoke about in the script. And it's a $58 sport bra, which is head and shoulders above any other price point. And, frankly, we have some one-off examples where we're seeing great success up at Forzani, for instance, and one of their chains is a SportChek chain. They're seeing it as one of their top-selling styles that they're seeing in their entire store. So at $58, they're really breaking new ground with doing that. And again, it just goes back and underscores that message. If we bring great innovation to the table, we have a terrific platform that the consumer is comfortable with exposing. And again, we're the beneficiaries for that. We've had some conversation out there about what we're most excited about going forward. And I think footwear probably comes to mind, first and foremost. We've got a great new introduction that we'll have this summer with the new midsole technology that is yet to be introduced specifically. So more to come on that. But I think that our distribution is very excited about it. We have terrific buy-in from some of our key partners, like Hibbett Sports and obviously, all of our big partners from Dick\u2019s to Sports Authority and Foot Locker across the board. So we're winning there. We're beginning again. We're not declaring victory, but we're certainly in a much bigger and better position. And all that comes back to the team. I've used this 2-year cycle, and so when people see things, they sort of have immediate reaction to it. It literally takes us 2 years to react to that to put it in the market. And so a lot of these things, we were biting our lips on a couple of years ago. We're putting the team in place, we're putting the systems in place. We're putting the design in place for us to be able to have something that comes out and articulates for the consumer in a way that they're voting for us. So I think that our performance this quarter is pretty indicative of a lot of those things working. And more excitedly is that we've been constantly doubling down the investments that we've been making since the last 2 years as well. So as I mentioned earlier, our product pipeline is certainly full.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My two questions for you. One, focused on inventory. It was really encouraging to see the inventory level this quarter. And I wondered if you could walk us through how you were able to work through some of your inventory over the last quarter. Obviously, you have your built-out outlet chain, which helped. But are there any other channels you're using or saw more success over -- from reducing this inventory?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Kate. Really, Q1 for the most part probably came in a little bit better than we anticipated. But again, we were guiding towards the growth rate to come down from growth rates last year. I think when you look at -- probably the 2 metrics you'd look at is the excess inventory that we created during the first quarter and the excess that we sold during the first quarter. And both of those metrics came in a little more positively than we had originally planned. So we created a little bit less excess than we thought, and we sold a little bit more than we thought. But the big driver of the sales of that is really our Factory House store base. There's -- we do use some other channels, and we've talked about them in the past. They're relatively minor to our overall mix of our revenues. The Factory House base for us is the primary driver of excess sold. So as we talked about for the rest of this year, relative to inventory, even though we had some positive developments in Q1 with the sales of excess, we're going to be leaning a little bit heavier on the Factory House in the back half of the year relative to moving excess inventory. So even though we saw some positive developments, more of that's going to be in the back half of the year.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second question, it goes back to international discussion. And I know it's early days, but with Dick's investment in JJB Sports, I think you already have some representation there. Is there any indication of how this could impact your business over the longer term in the U.K.?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, let me use this opportunity just to give you a little more detail on the international business as a whole. So today, Under Armour is doing business in 61 countries. So today, as we think about what's our opportunity as we're looking at growth, and I cannot but start this with, we're so excited about our new leader that we have in Charlie joining our team. And what he is going to be able to bring to us, as, most importantly, to help us evolve our culture from a very U.S.-centric brand and continue to underscore the fact that our opportunity is global. And so we have a really good person we think that is, again, can do a great job for us. But as we think about the way we're prioritizing what we'd like Charlie to do for us is, it's first and foremost, it's to help us continue to build out our operational excellence and expertise. Secondly, we think that e-commerce is a huge opportunity for us because if you look at a brand 10 years ago, thinking about going international, the opportunities that exist today are far different than the opportunities that a brand had as recent as the last decade. And so we don't think that the book has been written on the way that we have to go global. So we're going to look at a lot of different opportunities. And of course, we're going to use some of the existing opportunities that others have done before, but I think there are some ways for us to be pretty creative and pretty innovative. The international experience or what we're doing in Europe, Dick's is our #1 partner here in the U.S. and JJB is our #1 partner in the U.K. And so obviously, it's a natural fit. We think that there's a -- it's not a great market in the U.K. today. It's extremely promotional. It's very discount driven. The brands are rarely full priced. And we think, frankly, that knowing the mindset of Dick's Sporting Goods and specifically Ed Stack, that the leadership and the point of view that they will bring to that business is only a major positive. So we're very excited. We're very excited of linking up and partnering with JJB and all the entities that, that will mean in the future. But they're good people, and we think there's a great market that's available there. It's just not a great market today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, wanted to ask you about the Olympics. I haven't heard you guys say much. I know in the Winter Games, Under Armour brand has been pretty prominent historically, especially in the last one. Anything up your sleeve for London this summer we should keep our eyes out for?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Well, first of all, the global events are going to continue to become a larger part of our mix as we grow internationally. But think about just 4 years ago, when Beijing took place, Under Armour was a $600 million company. Since that time, we've added nearly $900 million in revenues. And we did it without an Olympic presence. So all that being said, we'd love to be in the Olympics but these are things that take time. And so we've had our team add it, and as we continue to think about ourselves and project ourselves as a much bigger, broader or better brand in the future, the Olympics will continue to become added importance to us. This year though, we, of course, have great athletes with Michael Phelps going back to become the all-time leading medal winner in the Olympics. Chris McCormack, 2-time Ironman world champion will be participating for Australia in the Men's triathlon. Natasha Hastings who won in Beijing as well as American sprinter, Alicia Sacramone on the gymnastics team. Lauren Cheney in soccer. So we have athletes, and we'll have presence in London. But I think that we're staying away from that 3-week span and saying, there's other ways for us to invest our money, and we are looking forward to Brazil. And we're looking forward to the years to come in front of that. Also, it's timely that it happens in London, the announcement of our Tottenham Hotspur relationship is something that's a big deal. That deal commences July 1, and the team will be making a U.S. tour amongst other things. But more importantly, they have that huge presence in North London. And being in the EPL and what it means to be in and be a part of premiership is a very big deal for us. So I think you'll see, without tipping our hats too much, you'll see some exciting things about the launch around Tottenham and what we're doing, upgrading some pretty exciting storytelling, utilizing the assets that we have to talk about and explain our technological benefits that we have in our product and in the kit that you'll see there. So, we certainly won't be quiet, but we're not a ring sponsor yet either.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. That's helpful, Kevin. And then can I also ask about the Charged Cotton and the cotton programs? Last year was the first year, we're into year 2 now. I think it was mostly, there was a lot of basic products out there. How is that evolving? Are taking that kind of fabric technology to new categories and styles? I know you had some issues on the Women's side as well. For those of us who think it could be a big opportunity, really big opportunity. And I know you guys have talked about the closet and the T-shirts business, especially for Youth today and the graphics piece, but where are we in that evolution and how far have you come and how much more is there to do on that cotton business?", "Kevin A. Plank", "One of the things that has really driven our business, Omar, is these core basics. These franchise programs that we have. Again, a $25 HeatGear full T-shirt, $50 ColdGear mock. And so Charged Cotton had the exact same intent as that, what we've built with the $20 and now the $23 price point with Tech Tee. And so launching Charged Cotton at $25 is that we want to get in that key item and we wanted to demonstrate that we could build and make it. And so we are very simplistic and very basic in our first year out. And we did it on the Men's side and it came out, and it was a great success. And the Women's side, we learned a couple of lessons that I think we were probably a little bit too basic. And so we really, we took what I call the rules off. Rules are very dangerous in a business that's growing, is that when you start putting rules in as you get bigger. It's important to have guardrails. It's important to have the guiding principles of a brand. But you have to be careful that whether it's the length of a shirt or the depth of a V-neck or anything else, there's no written rule. It's just the thing that you put on the athlete for the intended end use and you say, \"What looks great?\" In the Women's case, you say what looks great, what looks sexy, what looks cute? And so we're really taking a much more keen eye to doing that. And I think you saw us recover in year 2 with the relaunch of our Women's Charged Cotton. And, frankly, the sell-through is proving out that, that actually works. So we're very happy about it. We've taken some of the rules. It doesn't mean that the Women's shirt needs to like the Men's shirt. We also started with it because it was a new manufacturing process for us with getting into cotton is that we didn't have the experience with many of the manufacturers. So now that we're in year 2, heading into year 3 of this product, we can become much more sophisticated. So we're going from just one basic weight into multiple weights. And so from just one T-shirt into multiple styles that you'll see about cotton. So we believe that cotton is a huge platform for our business, and one that we can probably have one of the biggest upsides for us. So we share your excitement, your enthusiasm. And I think the consumer's demonstrating that too. They're just saying give me something that looks great and when you tell me that it has the Under Armour seal of approval, the Under Armour guarantee that it will work and do something and will perform, and as well most importantly probably, it will look great and at the same time, we're going to win.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from a Dan Wewer with rate Raymond James.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "My, 2 questions. First, looking at the revenue guidance for 2012, it appears that you're expecting a rate of revenue growth to decelerate during the next 3 quarters compared to what you achieved in the first quarter. And then further digging in, it looks like your wholesale business is slowing [ph] to around a 15% rate year-over-year. Yet I would think that the inventory levels with your key retailers are probably a little better shape than they were 3 months ago. So just wanting to see if you could talk about why you would think that the rate, or that revenue growth would decelerate rather than improve?", "Brad Dickerson", "Let's go back a year and look at what year-over-year, some of the changes that we have talked about 3 months ago, too. Obviously, from an accessories perspective, obviously, coming in-house last year was part of our growth rate last year. That being the case, when you focus more just on the apparel side of the business. Remember from a Factory House growth perspective, there's a big data point there, too. As far as the percentage growth in doors year-over-year. So I believe we grew our doors about 50% last year in 2011 in increasing doors. And this year, our guidance with new doors is probably about a 20%, 25% growth rate in new Factory House doors. So that, obviously, has a play in the growth rates year-over-year, especially in the apparel side. And also Charged Cotton launched last year, I think, so you have that kind of, first, kind of input of Charged Cotton into the marketplace last year. And, obviously, as Kevin spoke about, we're taking that to a few different places and growing it this year. But there is an impact year-over-year of putting that marketplace as an introduction last year and growing that this year. So those are probably the biggest drivers of the difference in growth year-over-year, and they were all anticipated and planned for and we've been talking about those for a while.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "In your financial disclosures, you breakout the revenues from customers, A, B and C and assuming customer B is Sports Authority, there's been a fairly meaningful deceleration in your business from TSA. Do you think that's actually having a meaningful impact now on your wholesale growth?", "Brad Dickerson", "We had talked about, again, prior about the management at the retail level of inventory and so forth. And obviously, you do see some changes with some of our larger customers and how they're managing their business and going forward. That was built into our guidance, again, earlier in the year. So from a Sports Authority perspective, they're still a great partner of ours, and they're still, obviously, a very large partner of ours. And although they're going through some things right now in looking at their business, we are still growing our business with Sports Authority.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And just a final follow-up question. If you could on Footwear, talk about gross margin performance. I know that is an inherently lower margin business than apparel. Margins on Footwear probably even lower than where you would hope that they would like to be. But if you could talk about what kind of trends you're seeing in that category now that the sales trends are beginning to ramp better?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, probably the most positive thing on the Footwear side for us, and this is kind of built into -- I didn't want to get that into the little nitpicks of the puts and takes in the quarter and the puts and takes for the rest of the year because the major story around gross margin is really relatively the same, so we said before. But one maybe positive thing that was unplanned for in Q1 from a margin perspective was inventory reserves related to Footwear. And that really stems from the fact that our baseball cleats sell-through was so strong in the first quarter, above our expectations. And cleated footwear's been an area in the past we've had to take inventory reserves on just because of the more -- they're more challenging to liquidate. So that strong sell-through with baseball cleats enabled us to not have to put reserves on the books that we maybe had planned for relative to baseball cleats in Q1. So I think that's probably the most positive story around Footwear. Overall margins in Footwear, as we've said over the years, they will continue to get better as our volumes get better, in general. And as our mix shifts more and more towards non-cleated, they would continue to get better and absolutely you started to see in our business over the last couple of years as overall growth in the business. And non-cleated starting to take more and more bigger percentage of the overall mix. So if we keep doing that going forward, the margins will keep heading in the right direction for Footwear.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Dan, thanks for asking about Footwear actually. If you don't mind, let me jump on that because I'd like to just, I'd like to go a little deeper there, if we could. So -- topic as it gets. So our thinking about Footwear again, we preach this patience model about our Footwear business. And as I've said, we're not declaring victory. Our goal that we have is that Footwear will match the thought leadership that we continue to demonstrate on the apparel side of our business. Two years ago, we made a few changes here and moved some people around. And Kip Fulks took over our product function. And we sat down and we talked about -- Kip's my original partner. We said, \"What do we want to do?\" And we said, \"Plain and simple, let's put a dollar amount to it.\" We said, \"Let's sell shoes above $100,\" which means it's going to be innovative. It will be creative, it will be thoughtful. It will be something that the consumer hasn't seen or can't get from anyone else. And so in doing that, I think we're very proud of some of the successes that we've had. Launching the Charge RC on the running side of our business, what that means. The new midsole technology we'll have out this summer. It's a $100-plus product as well. On the cleated side, as Brad spoke about our baseball business and what's happened there, it's great and it's something, which is an indicator. Again, we grab significant market share again this year, continue to squeeze the smaller competitors out and continue to align ourselves up to make sure that we are going -- that we're beginning to go head-to-head and more importantly, we believe we can win when we take that head-to-head battle. So this fall, you'll see us do it. I mentioned the Highlight cleat, this is a $130 football cleat that we put out this past Tuesday or Wednesday, and within a couple hours, our website was sold out. You had people blowing up the blogs, asking where they could get more. Could they paid more money for them? It's the kind of hype and excitement that, frankly, we haven't seen around our Footwear business. And so while we can say \"well, that's just our cleated category\" or something else, cleated is a 6-year old, or football cleats specifically, are a 6-year old business for us. As we sit here, looking at running, which today is 3 or 3.5-year-old business, what we're telling you is that there are good things come on the running side, too. We're going to continue to create that momentum and create that excitement throughout all of our Footwear with things like visible Footwear technologies that are important. But finding that right cadence of product flow is something where, we're not putting it all out there at once. What you'll see is when we took that reset back in 2009 into 2010, that we moved positively forward in 2011 we're moving positively forward throughout 2012. And you'll continue to see us move positively forward into the near future as well. We've had some great partners that have been very supportive of what we're doing. I mentioned Hibbett Sports before. Academy has been a terrific partner for us, as well as, of course, the big guys have been great, from Dick's and Sports Authority to Foot Locker and Finish Line, of course, who's been a great partner for us. So we had some -- we really have a great opportunity. It's about us executing, about us putting the right products in the right place and giving the consumer a chance to vote. But this is not just us showing up with a shoe and putting an Under Armour logo on it and hoping the consumer likes it. This is us coming with innovative technology, things like the Highlight cleat that Cam Newton and many others in the NFL this year will be featured and will be wearing. It's going to be a very exciting product for us. So we think it's a lot of good things to come, but we'll do it the right way with the right cadence.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Taposh Bari with Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, I wanted to ask you a question about full priced retail. I know you guys have 4 stores, along with a mountain store in Vail and then the one out in China. But as you see the brand evolving, as you tell more of a story built more, even more on technology, raising that price envelope, catering more to that female customer, do you feel like Under Armour needs the full price retail store at some point to really get to that next level, whether that be with that female customer or internationally? Just wanted to get your thoughts on the vertical model at the full price level?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Sure. Well, our distribution has been terrific to us. And there's no lack of a wanting or willingness to put these big programs. It's things like E39 that we featured at the NFL Combine. And again, you'll see our partners skip behind and tell, but the challenge we always have is what's the depth of the storytelling that's available. And so that's always difficult through translation, but we're focused on utilizing, first and foremost, our existing distribution and leveraging them and allowing them to leverage us into great partnerships that will drive the traffic and sell some of our other not quite as big stories. So we've now, from a factory outlet standpoint, we've got 84 stores today. As we said, we expect 95 to 100 by the end of the year. So we're adding there, and again, unfortunately, in a lot of cases, that becomes the most comprehensive experience that a consumer is walking into an Under Armour outlet. And so we are working fast with our existing distribution to continue to build out these shops. I was just in Chicago a few weeks ago in the Dick's Lombard store, which is probably one of the most comprehensive Under Armour brand experience that you can find. Or up at Roosevelt Field in New York. So we are building out shops, but we're doing it at the right pace. We have a great -- we provide a great experience for our consumer, a consolidated Under Armour brand experience built on our website and what we're doing in stores. And so we have the 4 stores today. We just opened that new concept in Vail. Again, the stores are doing very well. The consumer's asking for more from us. But at this time, we'll continue to support, we'll continue to look for places. And frankly, this isn't -- there's no one hard answer here. The last thing we want to do is trade dollars. And so if anything, what we do will always be additive and always be supportive. And so where our distribution will give us the brand storytelling that we've acquired as a company, we think that we're going to win there. So we believe that there's more opportunity. We believe that we have a lot of different options, we have a lot of different levers that we can pull. But right now, we're driving 20-plus percent growth with the partners that we have and we're very happy about it and so are they.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. I appreciate that color. And the second question I had was, hearing a lot of focus or commentary on the call here on innovation and the customers' willingness to pay for a better product. So within, I don't know if you guys care to comment, but within that 23% revenue growth that you had in the quarter, do you care to comment on how much ASP contributed to that? And within that, assuming there's obviously a piece of new higher-priced introductions like ColdBlack and Under Bra versus just like-for-like increases from higher product cost, if you can comment on that?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Armour Bra. I just drew up on that data plan, ASPs in general. We had talked about raising some prices, MSRPs, in Spring/Summer '12 anyway, again, to kind of offset some commodity price pressures that were generated from last year. So I think in general, the ASPs are up in the low- to mid-single digits, in general, which is consistent level with what we've been saying for the last 6 or 9 months or so.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I'm hoping just to get a little more, Brad, hoping to get a little bit more color on just the sales guidance for the year. And then just starting to think about Q2. Q2's your toughest year-over-year quarterly comparison, but we've gotten off to a good start this spring season with warm weather. And I'm just wondering I was hoping you could comment on how important are reorders to you guys in the second quarter? Are you seeing retailers kind of lean on inventory because we've gotten off to this good start to spring? And kind of what does that mean in terms of the revenue opportunity in Q2 off of a tough comparison to last year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Mitch, it's again, in our business, the opportunity for upside comes from our auto replenishment business for the most part. So again, as long as we see some positive sell-throughs on our auto replenishment product during Q2 or any quarter for that matter going forward, that's where our upside is because our seasonal product is relatively booked and there's a lot less upside there for the most part. Our cadence of revenues is pretty much unchanged from our previous guidance relative to how it looks quarter-by-quarter compared to last year. So there shouldn't really be any surprises there relative to revenue top line growth. And again, the opportunity really is on auto replenishment sales and sell-through. Now, our auto replenishment business is a little more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year as we get into the ColdGear product, too. So Q2 and Q3 probably have a little bit less upside opportunity than Q4 does relative to ColdGear.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then speaking of the back half of the year, I mean can you talk about how the fall backlog has come in and maybe speak a little bit to the composition of that backlog? Are you seeing any real difference in terms of pre-booked orders between kind of the more cold-weather dependent part of your business versus the part that's less cold-weather dependent on fall orders?", "Brad Dickerson", "Well, that's one thing we've done a really good job over the last few years is we've become less basic, less dependent on weather. So even though everybody was talking about some of the challenges in November through February relative to weather and cold-weather product -- and we obviously saw some of those challenges, too, relative to our ColdGear product. The good news is we were able to offset that with some strong performance in some more [ph] versatile product like our fleece products and so forth. So the ability for our fleece to perform very well in the last few months of last year and early part of this year, enabled us to get probably better -- some better booking orders in the back half of this year than we'd originally anticipated, and that was built into our top line coming up a little bit in our guidance.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Let me squeeze one last one in, if I may. Just curious on the Tottenham opportunity, the partnership there. I mean it's a great partnership. Is that where you're seeing the marketing spike on Q3 is getting behind that partnership? And what do you think of that opportunity just from a revenue standpoint. I mean there's a commercial opportunity there as well in terms of selling jerseys once that kicks in, in July, right?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, that was -- we're not a licensed jersey-selling company. We're seeing that, and we had that opportunity, for instance, with the recent NFL deal. And we have a great partnership with the NFL. Actually, if you check out Sports Illustrated, you'll find out what we are doing with the NFL is outfitting the Combine. And actually, one of our athletes is on the cover, one of our Combine athletes is on the cover of Sports Illustrated wearing one of the shirts we did for the NFL Combine back in February, March. And so finding ways to leverage opportunities that way is that we weren't about the jersey sales, but we're more about how do we tell and use it as platform to sell great technological stories like our E39 that we use. The Combine will be a platform for us to help us tell that story. So Tottenham won't be very different. Yes, there are jersey sales that come with it, but that wasn't the driver behind why we did the deal. And so we want to help them optimize and maximize their jersey sales. And we think it's, again, they're still staring at a pretty good opportunity at finishing the top 4 this year, which would be a huge windfall for us. But the marketing effects -- one of the things we have to be careful about is getting into many of these long-term deals is that our competition is out there and they're signing these teams up for long-term licenses. And again, the idea of a kid driving around in a Ford Explorer and convincing teams to wear our logo out on fields just doesn't exist anymore. And so, these deals are now done with the presidents and the A.D.s and others. And so, fortunately, for Under Armour because of our growth, we're now in a position to be competitive there, and frankly, to win there. And so with some of the great collegiate properties we have here in the U.S, our relationships with the NFL, our outfitting of Major League Baseball, our recently announced deal with the NBA, our recent deal now with Tottenham Hotspur. And as I mentioned, you'll see us on the Olympics side, but we're not trying to keep up with anybody. Again, we can be the best Under Armour we can be by staying within ourselves and executing. And whether it's retail doors, whether it's new distribution from a sports marketing. We think we have a really great game plan. We think that the growth driver, the fastest of the growth drivers we've talked about all along since our IPO, Men's apparel, Women's apparel, Footwear, International, Direct-to-Consumer, we're lucky to have the ability to pull on each one of those levers when it makes sense. And I think that Q1 for us was another great example of our doing that. So I think you're seeing a more mature Under Armour. You're watching us grow up a little bit. And we're very proud of the company we have. We're very proud of the team of people that we have working toward it, and we're very proud of the performance that we continue to demonstrate for our shareholders.

Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us today's third quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 10 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent top line growth. 12 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent growth in Apparel. Third quarter revenues up 24% and EPS up 23%. Inventory is down 2% year-over-year. These numbers speak to the level of consistent execution that you'll come to expect from an industry leader like Under Armour.", "We are a growth company. One that in 7 years in the public markets has proven our ability to patiently unlock the power of the next great global athletic brand.", "So I will start with some commentary on how we achieved our strong third quarter results. I believe the most compelling piece of our growth story is our patience in developing our brand and the opportunity that provides us to continue to grow at this accelerated pace into 2013 and beyond.", "But first, the scoreboards. The external financial scoreboard is full of Ws, with balanced contributions on the revenue side from our 3 key Apparel drivers of Men's, Women's and Kids.", "When we spoke after our first quarter results earlier this year, we talked about 2 key themes that were critical to our success in 2012 and beyond.", "First, when we innovate and add value for the athlete, we win.", "And second, our success in balancing the need to improve operationally in critical areas like supply chain, planning and design while executing to deliver that 20-plus percent growth.", "So looking at our innovation and operational scoreboards, the results were equally strong.", "First on innovation. The strong acceptance we saw this past quarter for our Spine footwear technology and the fact that Cam Newton Highlight cleat was the single most compelling on-field product at retail in 2012 is great evidence that our thought leadership has raised consumers' expectations for Under Armour footwear.", "So what opportunities does this success provide us? We have talked extensively about getting the cadence right in our footwear business and these strong launches will be followed up with a UA Cam Highlight trainer, a $150 training shoe inspired by the iconic look of the game shoe. And our Spine platform will expand with more acceptable products that incorporates the same technology found in our premium running shoe.", "In our Women's business, our key spring introductions of the Armour Bra and our Studio line continue to track very strong at retail. Our \"Sweat Every Day. I WILL.\" campaign, the latest incarnation in our What's Beautiful marketing efforts and our team's heightened focus on fit and design is helping us bring new female consumers into the Under Armour brand everyday and expand our addressable market.", "As part of that goal, we are adding to our strong leadership team in Women's with the addition of Leanne Fremar who's joining us as Senior Vice President, Executive Creative Director for Women's. Leanne comes to Under Armour from Theory, where for 10 years she served as Creative Director. Leanne will be spearheading our new presence in New York City, where we will be able to benefit from not only of the cultural influence, but also the great talent pool that exists there for both Apparel and footwear.", "So with Women's, much like footwear, our ability to innovate provides the opportunity to expand beyond our core athletes with relevant products for a slightly different consumer. She demands the same level of functionality as the elite athletes and our innovation agenda is focused on bringing that level performance to a broader range of consumers.", "I mentioned our operational scoreboard earlier. And I believe our results in this area speak to the tremendous focus and investments we put into our supply chain.", "Growing at a 20-plus percent rate for the past 10 quarters has, of course, challenges. We've had to grow with our existing suppliers while adding new ones and quickly become experts as we innovate our way into new product categories.", "However, timely investments and strong leadership in our back end has helped us deliver this consistent growth. We've added to our apparel sourcing base and are making strides in our ability to balance inventories with demand.", "And now, in our 7th year in footwear, we've developed a solid footwear supply chain team in Asia and here in Baltimore that will allow us to keep up with the demand that we are generating.", "In addition, our growing presence in the category has enabled us to develop strong factory relationships critical to us reaching our long-term goals.", "So great quarterly and year-to-date results some big Ws on both the innovation and operational scoreboards, a lot for the Under Armour team to be proud of. But what excites us as a team is the opportunity ahead.", "Because when we look at all the components of our business, whether it's a product category, geography, a point of distribution, we believe we are consistently in the early stages of growth. That is the lens through which we view the opportunity and why we are confident about our ability to grow.", "I spoke earlier of our continued expansion in footwear, up almost 30% year-to-date. We are in our 7th year in the cleated business. And while our market share is very significant, it still continues to grow.", "Our share in Running is in the low single digits, but we're in the early stage of growth and just now finding the right cadence in this $6 billion category in the U.S. alone.", "So it's that opportunity, the chance to combine the power of the Under Armour brand with our endless pursuit of innovation that drives us as a company. And we are fortunate that those opportunities exist everywhere for us. They exit in nation category for our brand like Women's Studio, mountain, lacrosse, outdoor and soccer. We have the opportunity to be a meaningful brand in every sport category. So while we don't discuss these businesses on these calls, you should know that there is a team at Under Armour living and breathing these opportunities, ensuring that we are authentic and focused on the Under Armour consumer in each of them.", "They exist in new geographies, in markets where consumers are not yet aware that they must protect our house. They exist in markets like the U.K. where we do a large percentage of a fairly small European business. So we've planted the seed with our new relationship with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club in London and it's off to a great start as we again bring the Under Armour brand to a completely new range of consumers.", "We have a wide path to develop the Under Armour brand outside of North America and we have the additional benefit of reaching these new consumers through not only a physical retail presence, but a visual one as well.", "Our challenge internationally will be setting the right priorities, determining which markets are the best fits for our brand and investing to drive that growth. We are laying the foundation with steps like our Tottenham relationship and our first stores in China. But again, we are still in the early stage of growth outside of North America.", "Here in the U.S., we understand that a key element of our brand strength has come as a result of selling our products in authentic sports retail environments like Dick's Sporting Goods, the Sports Authority, Academy, Inhibit. So as the breadth of our products expand and our distribution continues to evolve here in the U.S. and globally, we will always be rooted in this authentic sporting goods distribution where our brand has been built.", "Our existing team has much to be proud of. Ten consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth is a testament to their work. As we prioritize around all the opportunities facing us, we are supplementing this team with new leadership in some critical areas. These new leaders, Charlie Maurath in, International; Jim Hardy in Supply Chain; and Leanne in Women's, bring numerous years of industry experience to their new positions. Beyond that experience, they also bring new thinking and a new dimension to how we approach these opportunities.", "So in summary, we remain a growth company. The right balance of aggressive execution and strategic patience has helped us deliver very strong financial results. But what brings all of us to work each and every day is the knowledge that, that opportunity for our brand remains vast and that we are in a unique position of being the next great global athletic brand. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our third quarter financial results, followed by our updated 2012 outlook. I will conclude with some initial thoughts on 2013.", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2012 increased 24% to $575 million. Apparel grew 22% to $445 million during the quarter, representing the 12th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category.", "We continue to see strong results across our Men's, Women's and Youth categories. Men's was led by training, hunting and underwear, with underwear driven by the category's introduction into over 500 department stores year-to-date.", "On the Women's side, we are experiencing strong results in our Studio line and Sports Bras to continue to deliver a better balance of performance and design.", "In Youth, we more than doubled our graphic business year-over-year while also expanding into more than 250 department stores.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 31% for the quarter, representing approximately 24% of net revenues compared to 22% in the prior-year period.", "In our retail business, we opened 4 new Factory House stores during the third quarter, increasing our Factory House store base to 96, up 26% from 76 locations at the end of the third quarter in 2011.", "We plan to open 5 additional Factory House stores in the fourth quarter, bringing our total Factory House store count by year end to 101.", "In e-commerce, we have seen improvements in site fee and functionality in the last quarter and the conversion GAAP year-over-year has narrowed.", "Third quarter footwear net revenues increased 21% to $63 million from $52 million in the prior year, representing approximately 11% of net revenues.", "As you will recall, we shipped nearly 5 million in introductory footwear product to our Japanese licensee, Dome, in last year's third quarter. Not counting this one-time shipment, our footwear growth was closer to 33% year-over-year. New 2012 running product led by UA Spine continued to be the largest contributor to category growth.", "Our Accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 37% to $54 million from $40 million in the prior year period, led by strong performance in headwear and bands.", "International net revenues were roughly flat in the third quarter at $32 million and represented approximately 6% of total net revenues. Adjusting for the previously mentioned footwear sales to Dome, international net revenues grew approximately 18%.", "Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins expanded to 48.7% compared with 48.4% in the prior year's quarter. Three factors primarily drove this performance during the quarter.", "First, as expected, we are starting to see some relief in input cost. Lower North American Apparel product cost, partially offset by higher North American footwear product cost, positively impacted gross margins by approximately 30 basis points.", "Second, more favorable year-over-year sales discounts and allowances also benefited our gross margins by approximately 20 basis points.", "And finally, following some delivery challenges we had to airfreight some product to service demand, which negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenues de-leveraged 60 basis points to 32.9% in the third quarter of 2012 from 32.3% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows.", "First, marketing cost increased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.4% to the prior-year period. Expense de-leveraged during the period was primarily a function of increased advertising in connection with our key media campaign for footwear and Women's.", "Second, selling costs held steady at 7.9% of net revenues.", "Third, product innovation and supply chain costs decreased to 7.5% of net revenues from 7.7% in the prior-year period, driven by an overall expense leverage in these areas given our top line growth.", "Finally, corporate services decreased to 6.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 6.3% in the prior-year period. Operating income during the third quarter grew 21% to $91 million compared with $75 million in the prior-year period. Operating margin contracted 30 basis points during the quarter to 15.8%.", "Our third quarter tax rate of 36.1% was slightly favorable to the 36.3% rate in last year's period.

Our prior outlook called for 2012 net revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.82 billion, representing growth of 22% to 24% and operating income of $205 million to $207 million, representing growth of 26% to 27%. Based on our current visibility, we are updating both our net revenues and operating income guidance to the high end of our prior guidance.", "Our updated net revenues outlook of $1.82 billion represents growth of approximately 24%, while our current operating income outlook of $207 million represents growth of 27%.", "With this updated outlook, I'd like to provide some additional color on several items.", "First on net revenues. The drivers of our net revenue guidance remain relatively unchanged from our prior guidance and assumes similar winter weather patterns as last year and more moderate expectations within our e-commerce business.", "Moving on to gross margins. We now expect full year gross margins to decline as much as 40 basis points off of last year's 48.4% level. This compares to our prior full year outlook of flat to down slightly year-over-year.", "We continue to see similar dynamics as outlined last quarter. Improved North American apparel product margins, primarily through easing [ph] product cost, offset by more aggressively moving through excess inventory at our Factory House stores and a less advantageous mix, giving our footwear growth and e-commerce assumptions.", "Regarding the gross margin guidance change, we have talked in the past about finding the right balance between inventory management and servicing customer demand. While demand for the Under Armour products remain strong as demonstrated by our year-to-date 24% net revenue increase, we continue to have some supply chain challenges fulfilling this demand. The near-term impact will come in the form of incremental airfreight cost. Despite these costs, we believe core improvements continue to be made across our supply chain and see no change to our longer-term opportunities from a gross margin perspective.", "Shifting to SG&A. We continue to see a consistent year-over-year expense rate in marketing and the greatest expense leverage in corporate services. In aggregate, for the year, we expect SG&A leverage will more than offset gross margin contraction and drive modest operating margin expansion off of last year's 11.1% rate.", "Below the operating line, the only change to our prior guidance is the full year effective tax rate, which we now see at approximately 37%, slightly down from our prior guidance at the lower end of a 37.5% to 38% range.", "Finally, on the balance sheet, we continue to make positive strides with inventory management, including better aligning our biases of forecast and reducing the creation of excess inventory. We expect inventory growth will remain below our net revenues growth during the fourth quarter.", "Before we turn over for Q&A, we would also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2013.", "Based on our current visibility, we anticipate 2013 net revenues to be at the lower end of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%, and operating income growth to be closer to the midpoint of our long-term growth target of 20% to 25%. We will provide additional details in our 2013 guidance in future calls after we gain a clearer picture of full year bookings, which to some degree are predicated on the consumer environment heading into the upcoming holidays.", "Several factors to consider for 2013 include the following: first, we anticipate opening approximately 10 Factory House stores in 2013, representing 10% door growth compared to 26% door growth expected to the close of 2012; second, we expect higher gross margins, given the continuation of the favorable product cost environment, particularly in the first half of the year; third, we expect gross margin gains we partially offset by continued SG&A investments in areas such as innovation and supply chain.", "Overall, we expect moderate full year operating margin improvement. We would now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad of the ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, you mentioned -- 2 questions. You mentioned on some of your prepared remarks the importance of the authenticity of the sporting goods channel and how critical that has been for the brand and will continue to be for the brand. Can you talk about the channel distribution options for you guys as you think about some of the new areas where you want to grow, International, Women's. Is that still the right channel especially International? Are there sporting goods, authentic sporting goods retailers, available that you guys can partner with? And also how does that make you feel about owning retail? Are you thinking about to the extent there isn't a great sporting goods channel in some of these opportunities? Are you guys revisiting the idea maybe doing a little bit more own retail outside of the factory channel?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, well I think it definitely forces our hands as we look outside the United States. Beginning here, I don't think we can reiterate enough the strong partners that we have, the relationship and partnership we have with Dick's Sporting Goods is really, is clearly our largest customer and has been a real advocate for our brand from the beginning. And so you'll continue to see large investments in their doors and what we're doing on a partnership level at that level. And it's not limited to just Dick's though either, throughout sporting goods as a channel for us. So we're very proud of our relationship there. And I think we're demonstrating with things like the 20-plus percent Apparel growth that we'll still continue to grow there too. More productive floor space, more compelling shops and better stories and then we'll continue to come back. And I think be a driver for those doors as well is demonstrating with innovation and winning. And then we're also leveraging again our core basics with the sporting goods guys with helping us with footwear in getting our market out there. And so what we, really, we reset in 2010 with the idea of selling product above $100, that's typically not where sporting goods is selling footwear either. So it's been challenged. But we found success beginning with our roots and things like the Highlight cleat at $130 this past football season with something that was great and that's leading over to the new Cam Highlight trainer that we have coming out in a few weeks. So we'll continue to set the mark of what we're doing at sporting goods. At the same time, you're watching the brand evolve. And again, I'm speaking domestically. But many of the players I'm talking about can help us overseas as well, at least one in particular. So as we move to the mall channel, that's been a new challenge for us as well on the footwear side but really a big opportunity. And I think the first thing you're seeing is the commitment that we have. And one of the things we're looking with a partner like a Foot Locker for instance is somebody who gives us the ability to find distribution outside of the United States. We haven't found the right court. Again, speaking outside the U.S., I think you're finding consistency again. We're in about 250 Foot Lockers today. We're at similar number of Champs today. So we're nowhere near the 4,000-plus stores that Foot Locker has capability to. But again, that's opportunity as you watch us become more appropriate with the consumer who's shopping there. And we're going to continue to make those kind of investments to find out how we can be important out of the United States also. Distribution, what you're seeing in, pick a category like Women's, where department stores have become important to us and we are expanding our distribution there. We're going into and we've added -- we're in about 300 Macy's right now, as well as going into about 150 Dilliards. And Women's is important for us in those stores. Women's is -- I'm sorry, underwear is a huge leader in defining for us in those doors as well. And then we're also doing -- footwear is important. The partnership that we have with Finish Line right now and what they're doing with taking over the Macy's format. Something is very exciting for us. Where I think it's going to give us the ability to really story-tell. So in short, where you have of a very core company that began with roots in sporting goods, I think we're finding ways to translate our story beyond sporting goods, but using and leaning on that authentic base. And so I think we're doing a pretty good job of streaming out towards doing that. As far as it goes with our own retail from that standpoint, I mean, without question, some of these markets -- it's sporting goods, it doesn't really exist as a channel or it's completely polluted as a channel. It's really difficult in some of the places that we've looked at. The U.K. is probably a great example of that with JJB recently going out of business also. So we have some ideas and our ideas basically believe with -- I don't know if there's one strategy or there's one channel we're looking at as much as I believe that Under Armour should be everywhere. And I'm not saying that discounting the brand and the other things that you've seen pervasive in some of these other markets, but we need a strategy in every place where the consumer is shopping and thinking about sweating. And so that's how we're approaching it. And I do believe that our own retail will play a role in that. And what we haven't established yet is the flagship mentality or idea of going in and trying to buy our way into high-street retail. But I do think there's a good compromise where we can create a physical presence in store, not unlike the way we've let ourselves into China that we now have 3 stores in the Shanghai area. We have a couple more opening in Beijing. And you're really seeing a nice base that begins with performance, but the consumer's beginning to get it. And probably, the last thing I'd end with is while we need those physical presence, I think that we have the unique opportunity to redefining the way that we take our product abroad and that digital is going to play such a critical role and that being there and maxed out on the e-commerce side is something where we think we can really be important. So I think it's really fairly balanced. And if I try to sum up my answer to you, Omar, I'd say it's going to begin with first of all, we're going to protect, we're going to defend, we're going to attack in our core sporting goods distribution. We're going to use that here in the U.S., continue to double down on the plays we've made, expanding to the mall with key important partners like Foot and Finish and the things we're going to do there. Letting them, as you watch them expand to department stores and what, again, Finish is doing with like a Macy's, as well as taking our own core products like underwear and some other things that we can do to expand the brand. So I think that we're playing. We've got a lot of cards out there. I don't feel like we're spread too thin though. I think like our message is consistent and I think that the chapters of our story makes sense right now. So I think we feel pretty good and we have a lot of upside in the math as we look to the future right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Citi Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was wondering if we could have a little bit more detail on inventories. Can you break out any areas in terms of what categories where inventories are maybe higher than the corporate average? What product are you finding you have to airfreight and how inventories are at your retail accounts?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Sure, Kate. And I think the first and foremost, the things -- the message to get across is obviously demand for our brand is very strong. Obviously, 20% growth in apparel kind of proves that out. With that growth, supply chain is always going to be challenging. Last few years, this year, even into next year, we know there's going to be challenges to support that strong demand for our brand. Our job is to execute and manage through these challenges and then our teams obviously have done that. The back half of this year though, we do have a little bit of some challenges on the apparel side of the business, really relative to the on-boarding of a couple of new factories and it persisted in Q3. It'll persist a little bit in Q4. And again, our team did a great job managing our way through some of those challenges to deliver the demand. One thing I think to notice though is in prior years, we've had similar challenges to support the growth of our brand that we're having this year. However, the change probably being is in prior years we've had a lot more inventory kind of as a backstop to offset some of those challenges. And obviously, we talked a lot about our inventory management initiatives over the last 12 to 18 months and we've seen a lot of success in those initiatives. And the one thing we've talked about is kind of the analogy of the pendulum and that we know that when we manage inventory that the pendulum will continue to swing. It's an imperfect science. Our job is to make sure that pendulum swings in a very, very narrow of range. Right now, when we look at our current inventory balance being down 2% year-over-year, a lot of that is due to some great successes we've had. An of example of that is the creation of excess inventory, where year-to-date, we've created 9 million units less of excess inventory and sold 2 million units more. So that's a great job by our teams in managing inventory. However, that does create some challenges when you have some delivery challenges on the supply chain side where you don't have that backstop of inventory to help you out through that. So because of that, the balance of inventory management initiatives and some delivery challenges really was more important for us to deliver the goods we are manufacturing for the current demand. That's what caused some airfreight in Q3. It'll persist a little bit in Q4 and that was kind of the call down of our gross margin a little bit as our job is to manage our way through this. Our job is to meet demand and we'll have to pay a little bit of a price to do that. Overall, though, I think the big message, big takeaway is longer-term progress is still on track even though we'll take a few small steps forward and backwards in a short period of time. It's really important to note that with the people we've brought on board, the leadership we've brought on board, the process improvements we're putting in place, the system enhancements we're putting in place, longer-term progress is still on track.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Brad, can you just help me really quickly walk through the math on how the supply chain challenges you point out in the third quarter resulted in higher airfreight, but that you did see favorable impact from allowances and discounts year-over-year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, really liking it Michael. So if you look at last year, if you remember what we're talking about last year, again, we've had supply chain challenges pretty much every year to support our growth. It's our team's job to manage through that. If you remember our conversation last year was some of those conversations where we were trying to sell some stuff to customers and get some customers to take some product, sometimes it was a little bit late. Sometimes it was exchange type product to deliver to them to keep the shelves full because of the demand for our brand. And that costs us sometimes a little bit on the discount side. Mostly around the areas where we weren't getting stuff maybe on time last year and we had to give them something else in exchange for that. So we called out those sales discounts and allowances last year again to meet demand. This year, the change being a little bit is that we don't have that backstop of a lot of excess inventory, so it's really important that we're delivering exactly what we plan to sell on the retail floor. So the need for sales and discounts is reduced this year because we're not selling, we're basically selling exactly what they wanted. The challenge for us though obviously without that backstop of inventory is to get that product there on time. Therefore, you're seeing more of an airfreight pressure this year to get that product from manufacturing on time. And that's really the difference year-over-year if you look at sales discounts and allowances versus airfreight.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Michael, too, I would just want to give I think a callout to our team as well is that good companies even in tough quarters, they do what they said they're going to do. And this is I think a really good case of really the way our team came together is that when we do see challenges is that we make things happen. And more importantly, we do it the right way. And we're very, very proud of that. And it always begins with leadership. I mean, this quarter, what Jim Hardy has done and meant to our supply chain and coming in now here and just a under a shade -- under 6 months, has really jumped in. First and foremost, bought into the Under Armour culture in a way that is unique and then more importantly, leading the team. So we saw that. That was evident this quarter in the things that our team did to ensure that we got the product to our customers they're looking for. And the good news is that they're still hungry for a lot more. So we'll make that happen. The things we've done as well just building out our supply chain from a systems standpoint. We continue to sophisticate there with a great partner like SAP and building that out in some of the systems we're adding to our ERP system, and our planning system as well. Physically, we've added a new warehouse in Rialto, California that's just come online, it'll be nearly more than 1 million square feet that will give us more capability and servicing and getting our product from the Far East into the U.S. as well as we just continue to become more sophisticated there. Our factory base, building new relationships. 2012, we found ourselves really in this kind of Tweener phase where we're good, smaller company or becoming a bigger company and realizing that we frankly started outgrowing many of our suppliers. And so we initiated a lot of new relationships in the last 12 and 18 months. And frankly, those  sometimes just take a little time. And factor that with a planning group that Brad has really championed and building out on our side. And with again, good senior leadership that we brought from Black & Decker and some other companies that really understand and are best-in-class at doing this. It just takes a little bit of time. That mantra of 7 years that I use, it's pretty defining for us celebrating our 7th year as a public company in November, 7 years in footwear and a few other things that you see a shift beginning to understand the cadence and becoming a little more professional. But first and foremost, we're going to have adversity. We're going have things where we get challenged. But I think we're very proud of our team that 10 straight quarters of 20-plus percent growth is demonstrative of the type of leadership we're putting in place. And the fact that we're getting -- we're not certainly -- we're not declaring victory. We don't have everything solved yet. But we sure are getting a lot better.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Kevin, can I ask you quick follow up? Just on the 2013 initial guidance, you pointed to the retailers ordering now and will have a better look at how that year will go next year as you get through your bookings for next year. But we've seen all year these guys went through a rough winter last year than the spring was warmer than expected early on. We've seen the retailers ordering pretty close to what they were actually seeing on the floor at this time. Obviously, the weather is off to a slow start this fall. I mean, what's your sense as to how the early orders that you've seen, how your strategic partners are feeling about the year ahead? Do you feel that they're still ordering, looking at it right now and follow off to the slow start or how much conservatism  do you feel like there is out there in the early orders that you are seeing at this point?", "Brad Dickerson", "So I think that begins with us being prudent the way that we approach the year in the same approach we took is we basically we weren't looking for any upside from a year ago. So I walked outside this morning. It's 65 degrees and you just watch people walking down the street in Bermuda shorts and you're going, \"What's going on? It's late October.\" So the good news is we've had a couple of cold pops. And we when we see that, traditionally, we've seen over the last 17 years in business, business screams when we get it's 30 or 40 degrees outside and kids are running through their local sporting goods store and buying their ColdGear Mocks. But frankly, we've evolved as a company where we're not dependent on that anymore. So the way that we're approaching 2013 in general, it's again I think when we started to see this last year, we made a decision actually -- fortunate for us, a couple of years ago, we decided we no longer wanted to be weather-dependent as a company, but we wanted to become innovation dependent where we can control, we could be, we could define our space and not waiting for mother nature to get cold or anything else. So innovation for us is going to continue to be a focus and I'll take a second to tell you about 2013. We're going to continue to grow in the core categories like Men's, Women's, Youth apparel and then our direct consumer channel will continue to be a force for us as well. You're also going to see a continued expansion of key platforms that we have. Things like Charge Cottons and Storm Cotton giving the consumer reason to buy is that whether it's a long sleeve shirt or sleeve shirt, depending upon the weather, we've got an answer for them which is a best-in-class product whether it's a T-shirt that dries 5x faster than any T-shirt out there or it's a sweatshirt that frankly you can wear in a rainstorm. Those types of things where -- and again the category of Cotton as a whole, it will be roughly a $200 million business for us as we look in 2013. It didn't exist in 2009 for us. So we'll continue to do that. Take again Storm, which is the Storm Cotton product as well, it's another franchise. And to be clear, there's some crossover between Storm Cotton and just Storm as a finish. It'll be in much of our outerwear and a few other things. But that will be nearly a $200 million franchise for us as well. So again, these are technologies that we didn't have in our vernacular as recent as 24, 30 months ago. And the good news is that we've got an innovation pipeline with these things that are filled. And so our job as a brand is to edit, to make sure that we're picking the right technologies that are going to have the breadth and the bandwidth to be able to go and expand with the size of and scale of the size of the brand I think that we can become. We've got some great things coming with our baselayer business. Sonic HeatGear  on the Women's side is something that's going to be great for us. And again, I can't emphasize enough  expand these franchises. ColdBlack is in there as well but Storm and Spine on the footwear side that you're seeing as something began as a running shoe that this week we're launching Spine footwear in basketball that will start hitting retail this week as well. Taking franchises that we have like the Highlight net aesthetic [ph] which is something that's iconic again on the footwear side and translating that over into a training shoe. So I think the heightened focus that we have on newness and innovation means that we're going to begin to exit some of the -- we have the ability to evolve and move on. 2013, we're going to continue to position footwear with the results international for 2014 and beyond. It's great having leadership here on that side and we're going to keep rolling.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So just going back to the inventory question. Do you feel that you guys have enough -- what's your ability to meet the auto-replenishment demand in the fourth quarter if weather does get colder? Given that your inventories are now down 2% and you had some supply chain challenges?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, Camilo. Obviously, again, we're going to see a little bit of those challenges into Q4 also and that's why again we're going to lean a little bit on airfreight to make sure we can meet that demand. So, especially around seasonal product, I think that is where the need will be to get that seasonal product in on time. Specifically, around some of the product that Kevin was talking about outside of maybe our ColdGear mock product. When you look at auto replenishment, we tend to lean a little bit heavier in Q4 on auto-replenishment. And some of those areas that you do lean on are some of those areas that maybe are a little more weather-dependent. And coming out of last year's warm winter, I think the retailers obviously had some stock of that very cold weather-dependent product and we do, too. So I see less risk in the auto-replenishment sides. I think we're well positioned from the inventory perspective to satisfy that demand, that need if the weather behaves for us.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So that outlook on the source of upside from that part of the business doesn't sound like it changed? Is that correct?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. From an outside perspective, I think you looked at the same thing that we talked about last quarter in Q4 and that, one, is weather; and two, is our e-commerce business. And we talked about taking a more moderate approach to our e-commerce business last quarter. We've seen some positive trends in the third quarter. But such a large volume of our e-commerce business is done the last 2 months of the year and we want to be careful how much we guide and anticipate the benefit to be much during the last 2 months. So we're still taking kind of a moderate view towards our e-commerce the last 2 months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Parkhill of Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about given the lower levels of excess inventories, how you're thinking about your outlet business next year. Will that impact sales at all? Are you planning to supplement that with more made-for-product and then maybe how that impacts your margins within this retail segment?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, good questions, Joseph. And obviously, the level of excess we have as a company, outlet's going to be a big part of the relief valve for that excess. So we talked this year a lot about leaning on our outlet business this year and that having obviously a negative impact to our gross margins. Because we're going to lean on them from an excess inventory perspective, especially in the back of the year, which we're doing right now. Obviously, creating a lot less excess units this year even more so than we had planned to create less. That does impact the business a little bit now with next year. So we've had to look at next year's business and know that we're going to lean a little bit more on the made-for side to fill in the gaps on outlet. There's good and bad to that. The good being obviously that gives us a good ability to control the products in the space and outlet. The challenge to that obviously is we have to make more products versus having the products here in the warehouse. So our teams are working on that right now. To your point, the result of that should be trying to get the right balance of made-for versus excess as we move throughout the year. The percentage of made-for should be higher next year versus this year and there should be a positive impact to gross margin next year on that also.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a big picture around footwear over the next several years. Do you think that footwear will outpace apparel growth in the next several years? And is there kind of a market share that you look for targeting or think that's achievable within the subcategories that you compete?", "Kevin A. Plank", "As Brad said the first one was a good question, that was a great question. So let me take a minute actually get into footwear for a second. Coming of the Spine, I think there's a lot of speculation of how do we feel about how we feel about our Spine launch. We made a big deal about its launch in New York City with Tom Brady and Lindsey Vonn, Kemba Walker. So we had I think a lot of excitement going into it. But we learned a lot too. This is really exciting for us because it's true, it's our first really commercial midsole technology that gives us a platform to build on. And so we want to be clear that where we're starting with Spine is not exactly where we're going to end up. And this isn't a -- we threw it against the wall and try it. But we're going to come back and we're going to commit and we're going to market and we're going to tell the story of what Spine is. And most importantly, you're going to watch the product evolve. You're going to watch the product evolve and continue to get sleeker, continue to do improved aesthetic, continue to become more conducive to what the athlete is looking for and we're starting to see that. So Spine 1 was a great learning experience for us. And what we have hitting retail so far is the update to that, which is actually Spine Storm playing into that Storm technology, of that water resistant capability frankly that makes any product Under Armour and that begins to hit retailers in December. It's something that's going to be really exciting for us. But you look at where we've come from going back to the 2009, 2010, when we said we are going to reset footwear. Our goal is to sell products above $100. So with Spine at that $100 price point, we're finding out what the consumer will pay for Under Armour footwear at $100 and coming back with Spine's [indiscernible] it will be $110 shoe as well. It plays into the Charge RC franchise. We really set the tone with at a $120 shoes. But having what we are -- what we have with Spine is something that gives us a great place to go. I want to reiterate that we are committed to the Spine platform. And again, what's exciting is that we also have Spine 2 is going to be coming in early spring of 2013 for us as well. There's an update to the upper and you'll see just again a few things refined in the midsole as well. But you'll see us continue to tell the story of giving the consumer something that they can expect in footwear from Under Armour to see on a consistent basis. I'm actually going to take liberty and I'm kind of going to go a little couple more aspects of footwear as well. But we're really pleased with where we are right now, particularly coming off the cleated side and I think I don't even give enough credit for our cleated business because everyone sort of relegates it to being a smaller category and not that large. But the fact is we're making great gains there and the authenticity and credibility that we're building there is something that we believe we can prove will help take us off court and into the large markets like running and training and other places where we can be successful. But we had  great success in 2012 and particularly around football and baseball the on-field to the tune of roughly depending on who you talk to if you look back maybe 18 months Under Armour was in the 20s to mid-20 range in terms of market share. And today, depending on who you look at, we're in the 25% to 30% range. So we've made gains in a big way. And more importantly, we're just starting to hear it from our consumers or athletes is that the specificities they're looking for is our in-line product and is something that is good and qualified enough to be on an NFL field to the likes of Tom Brady or any of the stars that we have playing for us right now. And I'll take a minute for this, but I don't know if anybody watched the World Series last night. But we actually had 8 players in the game between both sides playing last night. And most importantly, on the Giant's side behind home plate with Buster Posey, who was the comeback player of the year in the National League, and for a second we also had the American League comeback player of the year Fernando Rodney of the Tampa Bay Rays, but Buster I think is one of the favorites for MVP. And with the big Under Armour logo behind home plate is something that made us very proud. But probably last night, not as proud as Pablo Sandoval, the big panda, as they call him, who hit 3 home runs in the game in the World Series, which is a pretty extraordinary thing and something we're really excited about. On the football side, the Cam Highlight cleat I think it was the most exciting product at retail this year at $130 a look that no one has ever seen before. Really defining for us and the [ph] product Nike that sold basically out by the end of July there was no product left in the market. So we're coming back and we're going to build on that in December with a couple of key partners with the Cam Highlight trainer that's going to launch in December at $150 and it's a product I think that again is going to continue to add texture that will be one of those reach and statement products that, A; we think we can sell with the pairs we're going to put out there.\" But more importantly, it's going to continue to help position Under Armour footwear for something bigger. And beyond that, innovation, newness as we think about 2013, we're not done with Spine, we're not done with the Highlight. There's a pipeline of midsole technologies, innovation in footwear and the committed team that we have working on it is pretty extraordinary. We have lots of athletes wearing and authenticating Under Armour right now. We have iconic-looking, premium-priced performance product, i.e. things like Highlight, et cetera. And we're committed to the franchises, things like Spine, we're committed to it for the long haul and you'll continue to see us cross-pollinate with things like the Storm flat platform as well. The start of that Spine franchise is playing out in basketball and, of course, we're going to continue to expand it in the $6 billion category of running. But I'll tell you there's more footwear innovation to come in 2013 as well. So you're walked into  a loaded question with that one there so thank you for asking.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Zolidis of Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I was wondering if I can ask a little bit more about the department store launches. Can you talk about what products you put in the department stores, how it's gone so far? And in particular, if you think there's been any impact on either the DTC business or the traditional distribution channels with the sporting goods partners, and then kind of how do you see that evolving over time?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, we've entered a little more than 500 new points of distribution year-to-date so throughout 2012. And so we've been pretty thoughtful and strategic as I mentioned about 300 Macy's, about 150 Dillard's. And beyond that, there's a few other key partners that we've had in there. But really, the story that we've led with a majority of these has been our underwear story on the Men's side, you've had a limited or maybe a little more than a limited display on our Women's product because again, just finding out the appropriate distribution for where women shop is part of what our goal is there. But we're still in the introductory phase. Take Macy's for instance. We've learned that prints and colors perform better than basics in things like underwear for us there. We're testing a few things like our tech fleece in November and a few of our basics. But golf I think is something that at least stylizes. It's something that gives an opportunity there, but Youth is something where again we're constantly struggling for Youth distribution and so the department stores give us good access there. And on the Men's side, we are pretty limited I think with the display that we have in Men's. For Dillard's as well it's led by underwear and boy's, much smaller assortment than girls, Women's and Men's. So we're really I think we're biding our time. We're making sure that we have success and that we have wins. We're making sure that it's appropriate and that it works and that the brand is relevant there. To the answer to the tune of how it affects any of our own stores or our known DTC, we haven't seen any cannibalization there. Our DTC today from a bricks-and-mortar standpoint is defined as 96 outlet stores today so there's not a lot of crossover with that. And we haven't seen any cannibalization of our -- more importantly, our core distribution. So we feel very, very good about it and I think, what you'll notice, with 38% growth in 2011, with 24% growth this quarter and where we're trailing for the year, we feel like we've got the 5 growth engines we were talking about since our roadshow, Men's apparel, Women's apparel, footwear, International, Direct-Consumer, we're very fortunate to have the ability to lean on any one of those when we need to. But to generate or drive more growth, we're not desperate for distribution and it gives us the ability to be selective with not only the partners that we choose, but then the assortments that we actually put in those partners as well. So we want to protect our current partners first and foremost.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz of Robert W. Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Brad, you talked about earlier, you talked about how ColdGear replenishment is heavier in the fourth quarter or replenishments in general that's heavier in the fourth quarter. Can you give us some sense as to what type of percentages in terms of your overall apparel business in Q4 like cold year replenishment?", "Brad Dickerson", "Just to give you some context to that, overall for the year, it's probably in the 25% to 30% range on replenishment. When you get into the fourth quarter, you're probably more in the 35% range for replenishment. So in general, it's definitely higher, but it's not significantly higher.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And can you remind us how that business performed last year in Q4? I assume it was not very strong?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, again there's a balance there in auto-replenishment, so it's not all cold weather-dependent product. Obviously, our cold weather-dependent product is going to be heavy in Q4 and also early Q1. But there's also some more versatile product in auto-replenishment also that wouldn't be cold weather-dependent. So there's a little bit of a balance in those numbers. So obviously when you look at last year's numbers in a warm weather environment our versatile product, our fleece product did very, very. While obviously, our cold weather-dependent product did not perform as well. So again in this environment, this year  kind of the same balance. We're kind of forecasting and planning our business in the same weather environment as last year, so we would expect our versatile product, our less weather-dependent product to perform well and our cold weather-product would not perform well if the weather was warm.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Quickly, one last question. In terms of carryover inventory at retail,  I mean you alluded to it in your comments you've talked about it before. Can you tell us what impact that's having in terms of how you're deliveries are flowing in the back half of the year did that put a little pressure on Q3 that maybe helps you a little bit in Q4? Or how should we be thinking about that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think it's a good way to look at it. Obviously, when you see that cold weather kind of replenishment cycle start, that'll usually start in September. So from that perspective, if you carry inventory into this year from last year, you would expect the start of that cycle would be really servicing demand from that cycle would be from product you already have in stock. So to your point it definitely impacts the beginning of the cold weather auto-replenishment cycle, which that would be September, October time frame. For the most part, it's I think where you would see the most impact from the last year's weather and the inventory stock.", "Kevin A. Plank", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from John Kernan of Cowen.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to -- wondering what you're planning in terms of international growth into 2013. What's embedded in your assumptions? And what you're learning about that soccer and European consumer following the launch of the Hotspur partnership last in the summer?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, on the international front, Charlie's just getting here and what he's doing is, of course, doing a deep dive on what Under Armour is and what it looks like. With 90-plus percent of our business coming from North America today, first and foremost, we're going to protect that. We're going to drive it against that as well. But we see the opportunity abroad is extraordinary. It's led by the example of our business in Japan. First and foremost, those guys are going to do close to $200 million this year and we're looking at a business that'll grow of north of 30% to 40% as well looking at 2013. So we've got great upside and belief there. I talk about leadership because what we have in Japan is a guy named Shinji Kushiro [ph] who runs Dome Corporation, our partner there and he runs that company. There's 300 people or 400 people that they have at Dome today. They work for Shu [ph], they work for Under Armour and they believe in their mission. So we know how critical it is to get that right in the other regions that we have around the world. So finishing off Asia from what Shu's [ph] doing in Japan to appointing leadership in China as well will be the next thing is we're building out our office in Shanghai and really getting things going. So you'll see a little bit of shift in taking some people that understand the DNA and the way that things work at Under Armour here in Baltimore and how they can use that to their advantage of not feeling just an office in another city and halfway across the world. We've done frankly the same things in Europe. Charlie just got back and spent the last couple of weeks over in Europe and I met them actually last week and we went and saw the Spurs play Chelsea. And it didn't work out as well as we thought with the game. But I tell you having that partnership and being in that league and playing probably the best team in the world. And Chelsea is a really big deal. And I think we enjoyed it. And more importantly, they're good enough to win a game like that which just kind of the view and I guess a way to think about the way we look at Europe is that we believe we're good enough to win as well. It's just going to take a little bit of time and it's going to mean having the right leadership there. But the strength that we have in our growth drivers here it allows us to make these longer-term investments. I mean the Cotton deal is one that we are investing for the future is that we're exposing the Under Armour brand to a consumer that hasn't had any impact or hasn't seen us before. So being and just watching the activation around that stadium and people really getting to know and see Under Armour is pretty cool to happen. And more importantly, we realize it's still going to take a little bit of time. In Europe, we're still in investment mode. In Asia, I can say the success that we have in Japan is something that's profitable for us and  working. In China we're still in investment mode and we're building there. And then frankly on a global stage we've got a couple of other places that are some really nice opportunities for us that are our making a difference that you wouldn't think about such as Latin America and places we've been investing for 3 or 4 and 5 years that are beginning to come back for us. So we've always talked about international being more of a 2014, 2015 story for us. We feel really good about that.  Bringing in a pro who's seen the big movie like Charlie before is really going to help us. But of course, it's not one person. Charlie's also brought a team with him. And frankly we're giving him some of the best assets that we have in the company that will help him round out. We're doing it abroad as well. So I think it's going to start with logistically also. It's going to be important for us and so we need supply chain a few other things but we're going to use 2013 not as a reset, but we're going to drive, we think we can make great strides there but we're going to put ourselves in a position to be as we say the world's #1 athletic performance brand.", "John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Sounds great. And if you don't mind me squeezing one more question. The cash flow, performance this year is going to be up big given the improvements in working capital. Brad, how are you thinking about capital allocation next year CapEx and maybe additional uses of that cash?", "Brad Dickerson", "We're still rolling some ideas up around that right now, so we'll give you some more guidance on that as we get to our January earnings call. But obviously, cash flow for us is tied to inventory and the  management of inventory. So when you see us be successful in managing inventory the benefits of that flow to the free cash flow metric. When you see challenges in inventory you see vice versa for us so cash for us right now is all about inventory. Our job is to put ourselves in the position to have cash on the balance sheet. It's important for us. It's important for us from a competitive perspective to position ourselves to have that strength in our balance sheet. So we want to manage inventory efficiently the best we can without the pendulum swinging too far. That will benefit our cash. And we think at this point in time, it's important for us to keep that cash in the balance sheet and or use it for appropriate investments to continue to drive growth in our long-term brand.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks for joining us on the call today. We look forward to reporting you our fourth quarter fiscal results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Thursday, January 31 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was another outstanding year for Under Armour. And as we enter the new year, 2013 holds great promise. Because Under Armour has always been about a promise. What is it that we can do with the team to empower athletes to reach their full potential? How do we help make athletes perform better? Stay warmer, stay cooler, stay drier and stay lighter. This morning I want to talk about the promise of Under Armour, both the one we share with our consumers, and the one we have with our shareholders. Those promises have been connected since our inception and we believe that both our revenue and EPS CAGRs of 30-plus-percent since our IPO in 2005 is a great measure of our success.", "19 months ago, we hosted Investor Day here in our campus in Baltimore and promised that we would double our revenues to $2.13 billion by 2013. Given some of the noise that was going on around about the appetite of the U.S. consumer, we understood that was an aggressive number. But we had enough vision and an executional plan to get there. In our release this morning, we issued revenue guidance for 2013 in excess of the doubling of the business that we forecasted in 2011. Our ability to provide that guidance tells me 2 things: first, we're becoming much better company operationally. While our business has become more complex and multilevels we've grown, our operational financial planning teams have met the challenge; secondly, not only have we kept our promise to the athlete, who helped us reach our first billion in revenue, but our growth as a measure of how we've been able to reach out to a new consumer, one who understands that the promise of what Under Armour brings. Our growth has come through diversity of products as well. We've taken a number of logical next steps, moving into product categories like Charged Cotton and Storm Fleece, that were adjacent to our core Baselayer businesses. Developing these large-scale apparel platforms has not only enabled us to take a bigger share of closet with our core Men's consumer, but it has helped us grow an even faster rate in Women's and Youth. The results of this diversification are quite clear.", "In our IPO year of 2005, compression represented 64% of our apparel mix. This past year, that compression number was down to just 14%. But our diversification extends beyond apparel. In footwear, we've achieved meaningful market share in just one category to date, cleats. However, when we look at categories like Run and basketball, which are significantly larger, markets included, it's clear that the footwear opportunity for Under Armour extends well beyond the near quarter billion dollars in revenue we saw in 2012. The path for our continued growth in footwear is clear. Over the past 3 years, we have aggressively built a team of designers and developers, who can execute against the promise of Under Armour footwear. Under our new leadership with Kip Fulks, my original partner, and the person who has overseen all of our product development and innovation for the past 2 years, we are building a new wave Footwear culture that will ensure we are positioned to fight for market leadership in every athletic footwear category. Kip's primary focus in footwear will be to lead and continue to bring new talent into the team. Our success included is a great indicator of what happens when we execute in Footwear as effectively as we do in apparel. Kip's proven leadership skills will ensure our culture of innovation and anticipating the needs of the athlete as part of our footwear DNA for the long-term. By continually flowing new technologies to market, and growing our business, our existing distribution in key retailers like Foot Locker and Finish Line, we believe the future of Under Armour footwear holds great promise. The diversification of Under Armour extends beyond product categories though. Through the growth of our Direct-to-Consumer channel, we've learned much about how our consumer likes to shop. Our direct consumer business accounted for 29% of our revenues in 2012 compared to just 21% in 2010. We've also diversified our leadership, bringing experience from outside of Under Armour to lead our apparel, supply chain, Women's and international teams, and we are focused on our growth outside the U.S. in 2013, prioritizing the key markets where our brand is best suited for growth, and building the teams and infrastructure to execute. But our focus not only as a brand, but also as a public company is our next. What does the Under Armour promise hold in 2013 and what are we doing executionally to make that happen? Our growth drivers have not changed since our IPO in 2005. Men's, Women's, footwear, direct-to-consumer and international have been critical to achieving our promise and remain our focus in 2013. More importantly, the aggressive diversification of our business will continue. In fact, we will be even more aggressive in 2013. We will bring more innovation to our consumer. We will redefine the pinnacle of how we present our brand at retail. We will elevate the presentation of our brand and our wholesale distribution and most importantly, we will speak with a louder brand voice than at any point in our history. So first, on bringing more innovation to our consumer. At the NFL Combine in 2011, future NFL stars like Cam Newton and Julio Jones were the first to wear a performance monitoring system now known as Armour 39. Next month, that same state-of-the-art technology will be available to the high school freshman in Florida who's looking to improve enough to make his varsity baseball team this spring, and the college lacrosse player who wants to make her All Conference team in her senior year. The Armour 39 is the first of its kind, performance monitoring system for athletes that measures what matters most, willpower. Willpower is the score that tells you exactly how hard you've worked during a training session. Willpower combines a range of dynamic inputs, including body position, user profile and key heart rate measures. With willpower, athletes can, for the first time, objectively measure a hard day and a light day to ensure their training effectively to meet their goals. Armour 39 is the first system that detects and responds to every move athletes make. Any direction, any speed, any position, the Armour 39 wearable on body strap works with an accompanying watch or on your phone through a mobile app.", "So onto how we look at retail. In 2 weeks, we will debut our new specialty retail concept across the harbor from our campus here in Baltimore. It will be over 8,000 square feet of the ultimate expression of the Under Armour brand, delivering an unrivaled retail experience through specialization, localization, and of course, innovation. From a merchandising perspective, our new store will have 2 clear distinctions from how we look at wholesale. First, the footwear presentation will be a primary focus of the store, enabling us to tell our technology story across multiple categories. Secondly, the new store will carry as much Women's apparel as Men's, allowing us to tell a focused story on fit and style with product like the Armour Bra and the latest from our UA Studio line. We believe that when our consumer sees the cohesive story of our product merchandise the full power of our brand, we will be positioned to take our growth in both footwear and Women's to the next level. Elevating our retail presentation will be a focus for us in 2013 and not just in our own store. While we look to expand upon the learnings we gained from our Baltimore store, we're focused on improving how our brand is presented across our wholesale distribution.", "Within Dick's Sporting Goods, we are adding 15 new All-American and 20 blue-chip shopping shops, including our new prototype in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, which is the most complete presentation of Under Armour apparel at wholesale today. In addition, we are significantly expanding our Women's and youths assortment across key accounts like Academy and Hibbett Sports. Our focus on how our brand is presented at retail extends beyond our sporting goods partners. Within our growing department store distribution, we are gaining new doors and growing existing floor space with key partners like Macy's, Dillard's and Belk department stores, with our key initiatives in Women's, Youth and Underwear driving most of that growth. With all this happening, it's clear that we need to speak with a louder voice to our consumer because our product innovation demands it. We believe we have some of the most compelling product that has ever come from our design team and we plan to let people know about it starting this quarter.", "Our revenue growth in 2012 were strong, yet we believe there's a consumer who wants more from Under Armour, more Storm Fleece, more innovation like the Armour Bra, more thought leadership from footwear like the Highlight cleat. Our plan to talk to that consumer will be different this year and we will do so in multiple ways. We will show them who we are as both a Women's and footwear brand in our new store here in Baltimore. From immediate perspective, we will go harder, and we will talk to them in a concentrated and focused way. We will consolidate our spending for tighter, but louder message and ensure that we continue to reach that new consumer who's helped drive our billion dollars of growth over the past 3 years. We will tell the Under Armour innovation story this quarter with the first of several planned campaigns of what we are calling Holidays. We will create several brand holidays throughout this year, creating a call to action for our consumers to stand up and get the latest innovation from Under Armour. You'll be hearing the Under Armour brand voice in 2013, louder and better than ever. And the first of those holidays will happen in just the next few weeks.", "In summary, I want to remind you of the Under Armour promise. We have lived it and delivered it for our shareholders since our IPO more than 7 years ago. And we, of course, do it by understanding our consumer and bringing them new products that they didn't realize they wanted or needed. We will view that even more aggressively in 2013, bringing new dimension to our brand than what the world has seen in the first 17 years of our journey. With that, I'll turn it over to Brad Dickerson, our CFO. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 financial results and our updated 2013 outlook. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 25% to $506 million. For the full year, net revenues also increased 25% to $1.835 billion, which compares to our most recent full-year guidance of $1.82 billion. Apparel grew 25% to $405 million during the quarter, representing the 13th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category. Our big story is driving growth across genders for Fleece and Storm. We were able to significantly expand the Storm platform beyond just the Charged cotton line last year to now encompass the broader Armour Fleece line. That advice to this product to the consumer was key as consumers look for more versatility from our store base. In Women's, we continue to raise our consumers' expectations with new product categories like Studio and Armour Bra. Youth products led the way from a growth rate perspective in Q4 as we gain shelf space at both existing and new distribution and continue to broaden into areas like graphics, which more than tripled during the quarter.", "Our direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 29% for the quarter, representing approximately 39% of net revenues compared to approximately 38% in the prior-year period. For the full year, direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 34%, representing 29% of net revenues compared to 27% in 2011. In our retail business, we opened 5 new Factory House stores during the fourth quarter, increasing our domestic Factory House store base to 101, up 26% from 80 locations at the end of 2011. In e-commerce, we achieved a growth rate in line with our overall net revenues growth during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 43% to $45 million from $31 million in the prior year, representing approximately 9% of net revenues.", "New running products led by the UA Spine platform continues to be the largest contributor to category growth. We also experienced a strong initial selling of our 2013 line of baseball cleats. Our accessories' net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 16% to $43 million from $37 million in the prior-year period. International net revenues increased 30% to $34 million in the fourth quarter and represented approximately 7% of total net revenues, highlighted by solid growth in Latin America, Asia and our Europe regions.", "Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted to 50.3% compared with 51.6% in the prior year's quarter. The 3 primary factors driving this performance were consistent with our expectations outlined last quarter. First, our sales mix is adversely impacted by moving through a higher rate of excess inventory at our Factory House stores as well as a higher mix of Footwear, which carries lower margins than other product categories. Combined, these factors negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 80 basis points. Second, given our previously outlined supply chain challenges, we had to airfreight some product, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. Third, we relied to lower North American apparel product costs, partially offset by higher North American footwear product cost, which benefited gross margins by approximately 35 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue leveraged 370 basis points to 34.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 37.9% in the prior year's period. Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing cost decreased to 9.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.9% in the prior-year period. As we have previously outlined, our 2012 marketing budget was more related to the second and third quarters to better align with brand initiatives; second, selling cost decreased 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.9% in the prior period; third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 7.6% of net revenues from 8.2% in the prior-year period driven by overall expense leverage in these areas given our topline growth; finally, corporate services decreased to 6.2% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.9% of net revenues, primarily driven by leverage in corporate personnel, incentive compensation and administrative costs. Operating income during the fourth quarter grew 48% to $82 million compared with $55 million in the prior-year period. For the full year, operating income increased 28% to $209 million, compared to our most recent full-year guidance of $207 million. Operating margin expanded 240 basis points during the quarter to 16.1% and 30 basis points for the full year to 11.4%. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 37.1% was favorable to the 39.6% rate in last year's period. Our full year effective tax rate of 36.7% was below the 38.2% effective tax rate for 2011, primarily due to state tax credits received in 2012. Our resulting net income in the fourth quarter increased 54% to $50 million compared with $33 million in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.47, compared to $0.31 in the year-ago period. Full year, diluted earnings per share increased 31%, to $1.21, compared to $0.92 in 2011.", "Now moving over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 95% to $342 million, compared with $175 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term debt, including current maturities decreased to $62 million at quarter end, from $78 million at the end of 2011. Inventory at quarter end decreased 2% year-over-year to $319 million compared to $324 million at December 31, 2011. The modest decrease of our inventory levels, relative to our 25% topline growth during the quarter, was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our inventory management initiatives. Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $23 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $63 million for 2012. We are currently planning 2013 capital expenditures in the range of $80 million to $85 million.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2013. Based on current visibility, we expect 2013 net revenues of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion, representing growth of 20% to 21% and 2013 operating income of $255 million to $257 million, representing growth of 22% to 23%. Below operating results, we anticipated comparable level of total interest and other expense in 2013, a full year effective tax rate of 39% to 39.5%, and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $108 million to $109 million. Of note on the expected tax rate in 2013, we have not assumed a benefit from any state tax credit, which we anticipate pursuing.", "Looking further into our operating expectations for 2013, I'd like to provide additional color on expected quarterly timing throughout the year. First on net revenues. As Kevin mentioned, our growth drivers from 2013 are consistent with recent years. We anticipate that most of our dollar growth for the year will continue to come from apparel, with strong growth across Men's, Women's and Youth.", "Looking at Footwear, the growth is expected to be slightly above our overall net revenues growth for the year. In Direct-to-Consumer, we expect these channel to grow modestly higher than our overall business as we open 10 Factory House stores and up to 2 specialty doors, focused on larger footprint within our existing Factory House fleet, and invest in more targeted traffic drivers in e-commerce. Finally, we expect our International businesses to outpace overall growth both still at the small base.", "Moving on to gross margin. We continue to anticipate stronger growth margin expansion in the first half of the year relative to the second half, primarily driven by favorable year-over-year product cost expected during the first half. However, we expect several factors to limit the overall progress in the first quarter relative to the second quarter. First, as we continue to work through recent supply chain challenges, we expect to incur higher year-over-year airfreight costs during the first quarter. Second, we expect strong quarterly growth in our Latin American region, which is currently distributor base business carrying a lower gross margin. Third, the mix of excess and made-for products in our Factory House outlet channel is expected to remain relatively consistent year-over-year during the first quarter. We anticipate a shift back towards more profitable made-for product commencing in the second quarter. Given these factors, we foresee year-over-year gross margin rate as relatively unchanged in the first quarter followed by over 100-basis-point expansion during the second quarter.", "In the second half of this year, we will be lapping last year's excess disposition strategy at our outlet stores and incremental airfreight. These positive factors are expected to be partially offset by certain changes to our supply base, especially in Fleece. While these changes give us better confidence in measures, such as delivery performance and future capacity, the mood will ultimately result in higher North American apparel product costs. As a result for the full year, we expect modest gross margin expansion from 47.9% level in 2012, primarily driven by the first half of the year. Next, on SG&A. As Kevin outlined, we are planning to be more targeted in some of our marketing expenses this year, which we anticipate will create some significant year-over-year timing shift. The first quarter in particular is expected to see nearly 350 basis points of deleverage, primarily as we launch a major a brand campaign focusing on innovation and incur costs around our Tottenham sponsorship which commenced in July of 2012. We also expect meaningful leverage of marketing expenses in both the second and third quarter, followed by a more consistent year-over-year rate of spending in the fourth quarter. Despite these expected ship, we plan to hold total 2013 marketing and spending relatively flat as a percentage of revenues compared to 2012, 11.2% level.", "Beyond marketing, we expect heightened deleverage in our other 3 SG&A buckets in the first quarter, driven in part by incremental expenses, tied to the expansion of our California distribution center, the opening of our Harbor East specialty door in Baltimore and higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense. These combined factors are expected to drive a total SG&A expense rate for the first quarter to a range of 44% to 45% of net revenues. During the remainder of the year, we expect meaningful SG&A leverage in the second and third quarters and a relatively consistent rate of spending in the fourth quarter. With our overall focus on investments in product creation, international, and innovation, we expect a relatively consistent rate of overall SG&A spending for the full year. In summary, we anticipate the strategic marketing decisions plan will result in some significant quarter-to-quarter shift in SG&A. With these shifts, we expect year-over-year operating income growth to be slightly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, yielding modest full-year operating margin expansion from 11.4% achieved in 2012.", "Before Q&A, I want to also -- I like to provide some details around our inventory position. We made some solids strides in our inventory management efforts in 2012, with inventory below our plan the past 3 quarters. During 2013, we expect the inventory growth rate will remain below net revenues growth rate in the first quarter, and then be generally in line with our topline trends through the duration of the year. We would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to 2 per person, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions. The first question would be, Kevin, can you give us a little more detail on exactly what a louder brand voice means, maybe paint more picture for us what the big change could be in the approach to marketing for 2013? And then just the second question would just be on international that you're talking a lot more about, Latin America and maybe Asia, and I'm just curious where Europe fits into the international growth strategy going forward?", "Kevin A. Plank", "So let me take a second and tell you about what we want to do from a marketing standpoint. What we did -- I guess, starting so, so 17 years in the business now, it gives us a tremendous amount of perspective. And looking over the areas in the years where we've been really effective and the years that we still moved forward, but maybe we haven't been just quite as loud. So we what we want to do is we want to go back to this concept around cluster marketing, and the idea there is to create holidays. So holidays are places where basically the entire brand meets at once. What we want to do is consolidate our spend to tighter, but louder messaging, and so we're planning on several brand holidays this year. So to give you probably the best descriptive idea of what we're doing, it's about to happen in a few weeks here, and within the span of about 4 or 5 days, you'll see several things coming from the brand. First of all, we're going to kick it off at the PR event in New York in the second week of February. That will be announcing some of the innovations we're bringing to market. Things like our new Spine Venom running shoe that's coming out, we're very excited about on the footwear side, as well as probably the marquee product that we have which is our Armour 39, our biometric measurement device that I went into a bit of detail in my script on. So this is something we think is going to finally apply some data and take away the subjective into the type of workout I had by -- that was typically judged by the size of sweat stain in my gray T-shirt, to actually giving some hard facts as to how did I work out and giving you a score around this thing called willpower. In addition to that, we're opening a brand-new retail concept down here at Baltimore, that again, the primary focus of that store is giving us the ability to showcase things that maybe don't get the opportunity to see as big or as loud and proud as we believe where we are as a brand, in some of our wholesale distribution. And it's things like what we're doing with Footwear and when people walk into our stores, they'll say, \"My gosh, I had no idea you made all these styles and colors and you were so broad.\" It's because a lot of this has been -- people living with a footwear brand, we were maybe 2 or 3 or 4 years ago. And so we see the ability to really accelerate that as well as to our consumers, and frankly, to our wholesale partners as well and demonstrate to them what our brand has the ability to look like at retail. And then capturing and sort of timing the whole thing together we've got this new \"I will\" campaign that will be kicking off, which is our brand-new creative, you'll see it in 30 sec -- 60 and long form, 90 and 2 minute versions of it, but effectively telling you what our brand is. It's explaining to you what does the idea of \"I will\", and this is not just a local or domestic, because as I get into the answer to your next question about international, we were pleased with the strides that we're making and the foundation that we're building in global, but it's important that we begin to tie the success we have here in the states around the world and so \"I will\" will be a global campaign. It will be something that a voice will be heard in all 61 countries that we currently do business in today. So when you hear from us, you may see us quiet at points during the year, but when we're loud, you're going to really hear us. And so I guess that's where you'll see from -- where in the past, and maybe helping Brad out with his answer, had been a more smoothed out approach the way that we approach marketing. We're going to take those dollars over what was 12 weeks and you'll probably see them condense in about 2 or 3 weeks. As I take on international, we continue to believe it's a true opportunity for us, and still thinking about our business as a global business. Global companies define their growth by -- or their success by -- where more than half of our revenues should come from outside of our home country. That's still remains to be the way that we think about our international opportunity. But when we think about where we'll start seeing meaningful impacts that maybe you guys would see in a bigger way, it's 2015 and 2016. Now along the way, we're not asking you to wait that long either. Because we're laying additional foundation and resources and putting points on the Board. So just a couple of things, Europe, you heard us talk about Europe and we've been there since 2006, I -- we generally believe that we are close to the tipping point of what's happening in Europe. We're doing more than USD 60 million today, and it's taking us awhile to get to that number, but we feel very good about it. We're leveraging things and what you see like our relationship with Tottenham who's currently sitting in fourth place in English premiership right now. We've got new distribution. We just opened up a new concept shop inside of Harrods, that is doing terrific to date. So it's establishing that presence of people asking a question of how can we be successful and we're seeing that the consumer wants us, it's just a matter of us really meeting that demand with appropriate distribution of course with the right product mix. Looking at around the world and shifting over to Japan for a second. It's our oldest market, our most mature market, and frankly, it's our most successful market as well. We've been in Japan for 13 years now. And we did nearly USD 200 million in 2012. Now, they continue to be on a growth trajectory that is in excess of what we are even doing here in the States. So the limit or the size of how big that market to be, I think we're still waiting to see, but they're growing in again, our partner there, Dome Corporation, [indiscernible] are doing an unbelievable job for us, and it is truly, it's not a company doing business in Japan, it is Under Armour of Japan. They've got 23 doors open in Japan right now of wholly owned stores because they have such a large wholesale business, 18 of which are Outland. They have 5 specialty stores as well. And you'll see them increasing a number of specialty doors that are there. Probably most importantly, when I talk about international is leadership. Bringing Charlie Maurath on to our organization and again, it's still inside of 6 months, 6 months, but his impact has been extraordinary. Charlie joined us in September 2012 from Adidas, where he's been for 22 years and ran nearly -- took a business of running all of Latin America for them from just under $300 million in 2003 to more than $1.7 billion for them. Charlie is in the process of building out his teams in key markets in Europe and Latin America and China. And we're leveraging his expertise in Latin America and prioritizing the strategies that we have in each of those markets. So there's a lot of things where we're coming in and a lot of the things that Charlie learned from his past experience that are really going to pay dividends and save us a lot of time. So within that, some of the early moves that Charlie made was taking somebody from our outdoor business in Kevin Eskridge, he was a guy who's a real killer for us here and took our outdoor business from under $30 million to more than $150 million and Kevin and his family moved over to China this year. And so getting on the ground and more importantly, getting local with the team that we're building underneath Kevin, someone who understands the UA, DNA and understands our culture, as well as combining that with local knowledge, is something that's been a real opportunity. We've got 4 stores open in China right now, 2 of which are Under Armour owned, the other 2 of which are a partner that we have in Beijing, and our e-commerce site just launched in December. So we feel pretty good about it. As I mentioned, I think global for us, as we -- we're very fortunate to have the 20-plus-percent growth numbers we're putting up in our apparel business, moving our DTC to nearly 1/3 of our total business, as well, and so between those 2 markets, it allows us to make these longer-term investments of things like -- we're seeing the progress coming in footwear and more importantly, what you see in the international. So I use that 2015, 2016 as a bogey. It's pretty consistent with what we've talked about, international will come on in a meaningful way. But I tell you with leadership like Charlie and some of the team he has from the leadership and next year  that we have in Europe and what we have in China, we feel very good about that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on the specialty store you're opening up in Baltimore. Can you talk about how -- and I think Brad alluded there might be 2 openings this year. Can you talk about how that's different from your last efforts in the specialty retail department? Obviously in the more of an urban location as opposed to a mall, but can you talk about the product mix and merchandising strategy for the store and what you hope to accomplish with it?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, Omar. Well, I think we want to learn. We went at -- when we looked at specialty retail, 3 or 4 years ago, I don't think -- I think we still have a long way to go in terms of putting our infrastructure in place. And more importantly, we had so much work to do in our wholesale distribution. Now, I'd tell you, there's still a tremendous amount of work with our wholesale partners because first and foremost, we love our wholesale distribution and hopefully, I think you see from some of the presence we have there, that they feel pretty good about us as well. We're going to start casting -- February 16, we open our new Harbor East store, and most importantly, we're going to learn a lot, and we're going to learn a lot about the consumer, and I think as we grow as the brand, it's important that we have this closer relationship with the consumer, the same way that we learned in our e-commerce channel. There's a way that we can learn watching a consumer walk in and seeing what products are compelling. The primary goal here is for us get closer to that consumer and again, a place that we can tell the full Under Armour story in this environment. I mentioned those 2 product categories of, a, our Women's and having a larger and a more important presence because I don't believe that our Women's gets enough credit for the size of the company that we built there. We're nearly a $400 million Women's business in 2012, and it's still on an amazing trajectory of growth right now, and that's $400 million at wholesale mind you, and it's close to $800 million at retail. And we think that the idea of how we can show products and showcase products like Armour Bra, but more importantly, our new Studio line is having rave reviews and something that's coming across very, very well. So what we've done and our team has done to build out our Women's team is paying great dividend for us. I mentioned Women\u2019s and Footwear because that will be the focus and what will be unique about the store also is that footwear will actually be in the center of the store. And so it'll be a real primary focus when the consumer walks in, of not people walking and saying, \"Oh my gosh, you sell shoes, too?\" versus, \"Wow, this is a footwear brand.\" Because we believe that we're the ones that need to take the lead in making that bold statement of being a footwear brand. You're also going to have an innovation area, you're going to have clear messaging of features and benefits, lay out flexibility, and there'll be this real simplicity, it almost feels like a personal shopper for the consumer. So it'll be a way to really make buying Under Armour easy and get us away from being so item driven where it's a cold gear mock or maybe a heat gear tee, and a very much more collection driven. And again, if we had a goal from the store, it's saying that, as we evolve and you heard us -- and you talk about in my script too, the emphasis we have in our wholesale presentation of moving us away from being frankly just quite so item driven to adding and driving more collections there. So we want to be prescriptive in how we teach athletes how to dress, and we'll have people in our stores that are specialists and experts and allows us to showcase new products like Armour 39, where you can really get the product and the explanation out there. So again, this is a store in our backyard. We're very conservative with declaring what this is going to be other than we think it's going to help us learn a lot, it'll be a place that I can stop on my way home from work and we can see how consumers are shopping and really get a sense of understanding retail.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. It sounds like it's a brand messaging store. But it's also aimed to be -- with the hopes of being profitable and replicable on a larger scale, is that correct?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, first and foremost, we specifically did not use the word flagship, and I don't believe in the idea of leading with marketing or flagship where, oh, it's a loss leader for us. We should make money in everything that we do. And so our approach to this store is no different than that, and that's why we say 8,000 square feet is maybe bigger than you'd say a 5,000 or 6,000 may feel right. So we want enough room to tell a brand presence, but 100% we believe that our intent is to make money in the store.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then real quick on the Armour 39, is that an offshoot of the Es, Under Armour's E39 product innovation that you guys had on some of your athlete least last year? Is it embedded in the apparel? Is it some sort of arm band, a wrist band or is it related to the Footwear? Any insights you can give there?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, it's the evolution of the same products and this is the -- there's attorneys in the room, but I'm going to tell you the attorneys got the better of me. We had to come down to the naming of this thing. But it's a perfect product. It's the same product, and again, we've had this product in the market for 2.5 years. And so we've been testing it, refining it, now we're finally ready to go to retail with this product. And so it's something that what you saw, again, Cam Newton and Julio Jones, 2 of the stars of the NFL that you'll see today, when they went through the NFL combine more than 2 years ago, the same product they were wearing. And so we've evolved that into something that has commercial application. And as I said, it'll give the consumer at home the ability to finally measure themselves beyond being on a lift core or a treadmill, but what happens from the full-time that you're in the gym, the full-time that you're exercising and taking the subjective away, as I said earlier, the size of the sweat stain on your T-shirt into actually what is my willpower score? And that's something given on one-to-ten basis and allows an athlete to measure and say, well today, I was a little better than yesterday, and tomorrow I'm going to be a little better than today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So thanks for all the help today on the components that are going to be contributing to the revenue growth in 2013, and as I think about that, it was kind of the detail you gave to us, seems like might be a good time to ask about how you think about the long-term gross margin potential of the business. Back in 2011, I think you were targeting 50% gross margins, Kevin as you look at the places you're going to be taking the brand over the next few years, how are you thinking about gross margins today?", "Brad Dickerson", "Michael, I can jump on that one to start with here -- I mean, our vision of long term gross margin hasn't changed. We do believe that, over the long run, that our gross margin should start with a 5. That being driven by continued innovations in the marketplace, which would justify the price points and justify the margins for the product to get there, first of all. Second of all, obviously, direct-to-consumer is a help in the mix equation for gross margins also. So nothing has changed relative to our vision of, over the long run, getting up to that kind of 50% plus gross margin goal.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then this one might be for Kevin, with -- Kevin, with footwear, there's obviously been some changes on the team there. So do you think as new leadership moves in, we'll see the footwear program take change of direction over the next year or 2 or your approach to that market? Or do you look at the platforms you have now like Spine and the new basketball shoes and will be more of an evolution of those platforms that you've already launched?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think we -- look, we've very pleased, I think, with the direction in how we've been moving as a footwear organization, and we're especially pleased with the team that we have a place in footwear. The thing is that, since we've added $1 billion in revenues in the last 3 years, we've added new skill sets and the evolution of the team of what makes the most sense with us. At the end of the day, we've had to make a lot of these decisions over the last 7 years, since being public, but it's also come out to netting us 31% CAGR top and bottom line in that same period of time. So as our business evolves, so does the need to consistently build and recalibrate our leadership, and so what we're doing is we're taking my original partner, Kip Fulks, who is a guy who, first and foremost, he's a product guy. And I want to make sure of the assumption that people understand and know about Kip as -- he runs supply chain because he's a great leader. He's running footwear because he's a great leader. But he also understands product at the same time. And we'll -- again, his primary focus is to get in -- to help us continue to build out our footwear team, because even where we are crossing the quarter billion dollar mark, we feel there's a tremendous opportunity in front of -- and a long way to go. When I say a product guy, it means Footwear's reported to Kip for the past 2 years, in addition to innovation. So he understands the things that are in the pipeline and really the way that we're going to pull the trigger there. And the reason we're able to do that is because we've done such a good job hiring within Kip between Jim Hardy coming onboard on the supply chain side, he was doing an excellent job for us. And what Henry Stafford has been able to do on the product side for us. We're able to focus Kip more on the footwear side. With shoes as a whole though, I don't want to stop the message at sort of where we've been as much as where we're going. First of all, with some of our track record, we've been in shoes for 7 years, and our first category there was football cleats. But frankly, it took us 7 years to get to this place where we are now where we're making -- telling product from the consumer, things like that Highlight cleats that we point out at $130 price point, the pair is -- wasn't a ton of pair, but it was the fastest selling speed shoe that you saw at sporting goods this year to our retailers who carry the product. And more importantly, the level of the lift that, that provided us was we went from a market share of a -- that started with a 2 to a market share that started with a 3. So it comes back in driving home the point when we innovate, we will win, beyond just 1 particular product, but we sold more $50 to $100 product because we are selling that $130 product as well. So you'll see us continue to push there and things like running -- our pipeline is full, Spine Venom as I mentioned, kicks off in the middle of February. Our new Charged 2 products, we've got a new product called Toxic 6, which is launching. We've also got a another, you'll see another running concept from us this year. In basketball, we've had success on court with many of our players are playing very well from Brandon Jennings from the Bucks, and Kemba Walker and the Bobcats, and Greivis Vasquez, and Ray Felton from the Knicks as well, DeAndre Jordan with the Clippers. Plus we've got another 8 or so players that are also wearing our brand, they aren't being paid money. They're wearing it because it's good product. So many of these things just take a little bit of time. And the good news is, that we have a very young athlete base, including people like -- if you all saw it in the Australian Open, you watched Sloane Stephens who is definitely one of our next athletes at 19 years old, who is the first teenager to ever beat Serena, and move on to the semifinals at the Australian, so -- and her first comment I think from the announcers was, how cute her shoes were. But more importantly than being cute, was the fact that they actually worked. So we're very proud of that, and we're also moving to a place where, yes, it does matter if shoes look great too. So we feel like we're making great progress and we feel very comfortable that Kip is going to do a great job for us and we'll continue to build out and evolve that team.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney capital.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I guess if I could, Brad for you focus a little bit more on the supply chain, perhaps the learnings, you said Jim McCarthy and the team have come on. I understand the cadence still sort of a bit of a constraint in the first quarter, but maybe just talk about sort of the upside opportunities in the back half, and as we enter into '14, sort of what these opportunities to drive further gross margin expansion from the supply chain?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Eric, we've talked a lot about the supply chain challenges over the last few quarters and the impact to our results in the back half of 2012 relative to having to airfreight some product in, to get product in on time to meet demand. Some of that -- some of those challenges are going to be consistent as we get into the front half of this year, especially in Q1. Some more heightened airfreight than usual again, just to kind of make sure we're meeting  demand on time. And it's the same type of issues we had from last year. It's relative to a few factories that we onboarded during the course of last year. And some challenges around the onboarding of a few factories. So that will be consistent to the front half of this year. As we start moving through the year, the thought there, in the supply chain side, and the short run here is to move some of the supplies, especially on the fleece categories where we had some of -- most of our challenges last year, to move that to more consistent historically reliable suppliers of ours. That will help with obviously delivering on time, but in the short run, that will come at a little bit of a cost especially in the back half of the year when some of that moving of products starts to hit the market. Lessons learned really to get to 2014 and forward and Jim has done a really good job looking at this and his team is -- capacity in general, planning longer term capacity and where we need to be, not just in the next year or 2, but further out years 3 and 4, and making sure that we can onboard factories in the right -- at the right pace and at the right time. And that will be the important part of our long-term strategy in the supply chain. So we do kind of see this, kind of air freight issue at the back half of last year, first part of this year. And then kind of the switching of the factory base the back half of this year to be more of a short term need to meet demand, longer term doing a much better job of planning out capacity and onboarding new factories at the right pace.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, maybe Kevin for you. Again apparel is holding up really, really well. I think there's probably misinterpretation of being saturated domestically, that goes without saying. In terms of the distribution expansion beyond the core, particularly on the Men's side of the business, how do you balance continuing that expansion in support of the apparel growth without potentially sort of diluting or getting maybe cannibalization within that cold channel?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think it begins by having and continue to drive great growth within our existing base. So if you did your check, I think the expectation that we believe our existing distribution has from us is that, we're the company that continues to deliver double-digit comp growth in their stores. And so finding ways to do that is, it isn't putting the same things in there, but finding newness, frankly showcasing innovation, and it's not always -- and they can be simple innovation too. It's -- the charge from the Storm platforms, they'll each be $200 million businesses for us this year that frankly it didn't exist in 2010. When you look at, again, some of that simpler innovation, it's things like fleece, our Fleece businesses this year was on fire, not literally, but up 50% for us. So you imagine taking a simple category like Fleece and driving that kind of growth, that is a  wheelhouse product: Our Charged Cotton business, plus 90%; our Storm platform, plus 300%. So when you look at apparel, we're still not servicing the appetite of our consumer, within and through our core base. So when I mention we like our distribution, they like us very much, we understand where our bread and butter, and we'll continue to make sure we take care and that we build out things in taking time as you heard me hopefully very thoughtfully talked about the retail presentation expansion will have in our wholesale distribution. And at the same time, we do see opportunities, so you'll continue to see more and we could spend a lot of time talking about Dick and I think some of the headway that we have there as they continue to be a headline for our brand as we are presented in the marketplace, but you also have great things happening with Academy inhibit. There's over 30% growth there, driven by space expansion in Women's and youth that we have there. Our youth business is unbelievably healthy, particularly as we move into things -- Sports Authority has done very well. The new management team is really getting settled in there. And we're cleaning up the business. It's becoming more profitable. And we expect to see double-digit growth from Sports Authority in 2013 as well. So as you look at sort of where you'd expect to see us to some of the new places you are seeing us. Last year, we told you that we are going to spend 2012 and we were going to be exploring the department store channel. So fixing up some best in class partners that we have there: Macy's, Dillards, Nordstrom, Belk, Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdale's, Meyer, it was the business that we primary focused on underwear and youth, and we put that in about 700 doors throughout 2012. We like the doors we're in, we think there's about another 200 doors potentially we could go on in 2013 as well as we look. But we're going to start doubling down and becoming better in the stores that we're already doing business in. For instance with Macy's, we're doing shop-in shops in some of the obvious place with place you'd expect like Herald Square, Union Square, State Street in Chicago, so we'll be -- we want to increase that presence and we want to make sure most importantly that it's not just a couple of shirts hanging on a rack, but that our presentation is important. I think it's one thing you'll hear from us. So what we want to demonstrate again, going back for a second to what we're looking to come from the specialty store model, it's that, when you walk in that store, you'll see that the Under Armour brand is important. Our products are important, our innovation is important, that the presentation is important. And we want people to walk in and we want them to say, wow, I see it what the vision can look like of how you could look in my store and I want them to think like that as well. Is that our goal for that is not cannibalizing existing stores or distribution. Our goal for that is going to be strategic, because we still believe there's a large need for -- or want or desire for Under Armour that it's currently going unmet. And so we'll continue to find distribution that fits that idea. And that fits our brand, and you'll continue to see frankly our brand open the aperture of where consumer has come to expect us as well. But we're not going to jump from chapter 1 to chapter 30. So hopefully you'll see patient growth, and I think we're demonstrating that growth the whole time while continuing to put points in the board. That statistic of 31% CAGR top and bottom line since our IPO is something we're proud of and especially doing it again in 2012 where there's a lot of wind or noise out there about difficulties, we still put 25% on the Board. So I think that's what frankly you've come to expect from us and we're very proud of that type of performance.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "With regards to the warm weather, which has been on everyone's mind the last 2 winters. I wondered if there was any insight into any possible strategy change with regards to the change in flow of product or the change in mix for next winter or subsequent winters.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, Kate, let me jump on that first. First of all, our inventories is in really good shape right now. We've had some great cold weather, obviously as you felt last several weeks, and that's really had things moving at retail. It doesn't have a big effect to us. It's been helping our partners out in getting things cleaned out as they start looking forward to 2013. We've been doing several things from repositioning. I mentioned that growth that we had in baselayer. We made a decision, I think we were in this position in the fourth quarter particularly, and we all had our fingers crossed sitting, around waiting for it to get cold. And we realized that, that probably wasn't the best model or way for us to be thinking about our business. And so we made a conscious decision to stop being so weather reliant. And for a company whose 2 basic categories of business were something called HeatGear and something called ColdGear, that was a pretty big shift. So keeping that DNA and that explanation to our consumer of how they shop our brand, intact, we started adding things like a lighter fleece product. Something that isn't just as much about keeping warm as much as it has more style, it has more relevance to it. So I think you've seen us take that. Our apparel business in the fourth quarter was up 25%. But moving away from weather reliant is something that allowed us to keep that in what was probably the most challenging fourth quarter that anyone has seen in a very long time. We are more, and I think that's, hopefully, what comes across, we are more than just figure on apparel side, a cold-weather compression brand. Compression is, I mentioned that stat in my script, and think about that, in 7 years when we went public, compression was 64% of our business being just 14% today. So we continue to ebb and flow with the market as it makes its demands above, and I think more important, we continue to tell the market what we think was our point of view. When we add newness and innovation in the assortments, we're going to win. Again, as I mentioned about not just being a cold gear mock, $50 company, we have that and we've enhanced it. And we've come to our Evo cold gear. But that's not a product that's in high demand, when it is, 65 degrees outside in December. So that's where the Storm cotton and the Charged cotton, the platforms have really been helpful for us. And again, continuous flow where, what we've done I think on our merchandising side and Henry and his teams and -- up and down the line have really done a great job, is getting to where we've got more product flow. That's not 2 shipments a year, but we're really answering the needs of the consumer as the weather change. So with that, we'll continue to emphasize more versatility in our assortment with weatherproof items like fleece, which, again, I said grew 50% in 2012, and you'll see us continue to push that, but our partners are doing a great job for us, I think, anticipating the market and product and I think we feel pretty good about the flow that we have from an innovation standpoint in apparel. And I can tell you, we did good things, but between Sonic baselayer and -- we've got a new technology people have been talking about at the outdoor show we unveiled last week as well, that we'll be unveiling soon. We've got a lot of great things in the pipeline and it's a competition. It's a competition to be a featured product from Under Armour. So it's our job to edit, it's our job to make that decision for the consumer. And hopefully we'll build and continue to build that trust with the consumer, that it's great product at a fair value. More importantly it's something that works.", "Brad Dickerson", "And Kate, just relative to -- on the dollar side of how we're planning the flow through the year, and it kind of ties in what Kevin is talking about here. You should be -- if you look at kind of the quarterly revenue growth, relatively consistent across the quarter as far as revenue growth, but a little bit more heightened growth in Q2 and Q3 versus Q1 and Q4, again, not a significant difference, but just how we're planning the business right now. A little bit of a timing difference. Q1, Q2 it's just more timing in general. Q4, is kind of going to your point of coming out of 2 warm winters still trying to get our arms around what that means. As Kevin mentioned, obviously, our product has expanded and it's much more versatile right now, even with warm winters, but still trying to get our arms around what these two warm winters mean, also, have not -- had bookings for Q4 come in yet. So that's kind of the timing difference there in Q3 and Q4 relative to revenue growth.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And if I could just sneak in one more question. I think you mentioned, Brad the incremental cost of footwear during the quarter. I just wondered, what that was from and how many more quarters we can expect to see that pressure?", "Brad Dickerson", "Well, as we've talked historically, Kate, footwear gross margins are well below our apparel margins right now. And as footwear grows quarter by quarter, that could have an impact to our gross margins. In Q4, technically Q4 really isn't a big footwear quarter for us in general. But we do see in the fourth quarter sometimes is, the sell-in of some of the spring product for the next year. Specifically this fourth quarter was around our baseball cleats. If you remember last year, we had a very, very strong baseball season. Had very strong sell-in and sell-through of baseball cleats. A lot of our customers on the wholesale side wanted to make sure we got product on the floor in times set coming off that success last year, so we had some shipments of baseball cleats in December.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to reporting to you our first quarter 2013 results, which tentatively have been scheduled for Friday, April 19, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.", "Kevin A.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks, Ally, and good morning to everyone joining us today at our first quarter conference call.", "During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in our Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the first quarter, followed by an update for our 2013 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Q1 2013 was another great quarter of growth for the Under Armour brand -- one that increases our confidence that the new products and initiatives we'll discuss today have us well positioned for another outstanding year in 2013 and beyond.", "But first the scoreboard. Total revenues up 23%, apparel revenues up 22% and Footwear revenues up 27%. In apparel, there are a number of great things to talk about: Our continued strength in Fleece and Women's; the strong performance of our Youth business, which is a great indicator of the breadth of our brand equity and the success of our new partnership with Marvel Entertainment and DC Comics, our Alter Ego superhero product. But first, I want to talk about the fundamentals in our ability to continue to grow our business at a market-leading pace while reaching new consumers with great new products and new distributions.", "This is essential element of our growth strategy and one that we continue to execute extremely well, driving 20-plus percent top line growth for the 12th consecutive quarter in total revenues and the 14th consecutive quarter in Apparel.", "In Q1, the best illustration of this strategy was our success in bringing newness to the market with our new Apparel product. It's safe to say that we've never had the breadth of new products in the markets as we do right now. Even in our most basic business like Tech Tees, we've brought stripes and more colors into the line and are flowing them into the market faster. This focus enables us to build multiple expressions for the athletes and make it available faster and in more ways than ever before.", "At the time of our IPO in 2005, we were predominantly a compression brand known for 2 things, moisture wicking and cold weather protection. As we've grown to where compression was only 14% of our business in 2012, we've continued to move away from dependence on cold weather with more focus on providing a broad range of fabrication, and we even decided that cotton didn't have to be the enemy.", "Coming out of the cold weather season, we came back to our partners with an entirely new line of product differentiated from the more seasonal cold-weather apparel. We essentially extended this theme with a lighter weight, more versatile assortment to help create traffic in stores during what is traditionally a slower traffic time of the year. We've seen great success with this program at retail so far and believe there are other opportunities throughout the year for this type of transitional product.", "When we combine this improved ability to execute the fundamentals with a consumer-focused product innovation, the results can create a lot of attention in the market and that's what we've accomplished with our Alter Ego product. One of the most talked about programs at retail right now, our Alter Ego line takes some of our core SKUs and embellishes them with classic superhero characters like Superman, Ironman and the Batman among others.", "It was the most successful product launch ever in our e-commerce site and we just started shipping it late in the quarter to our wholesale accounts. With Alter Ego, we're not talking about the volume of Storm and Charged Cotton but it does keep us at the forefront of our consumer's mind and helps create traffic in our partner stores. And while we are selling some of the product in Youth sizes, the overwhelming majority of it is being sold in our Men's business.", "Our Youth business continues to perform above expectations and most importantly, provides us great confidence that our brand is resonating, not only with the high school athlete but with the next generation of athletes as well. Our growth in Youth is broad-based. We're seeing strong numbers across genders, channels and product categories. Our girls business, our department store business and our baseball and basketball businesses all performed strongly in Youth in the quarter as we continue to gain traction beyond our core.", "In Women's, we are seeing the return on investment we've been making in the business as we continue to add talent across the organization. Driven by strong Q1 performance across our Studio line, our new capri pants offering and extended ArmourBra line, our growth in Women's is great proof of how well our brand resonates with the female consumer beyond the high school and collegiate playing field.", "With our New York office opening later this year, we'll be better positioned to bring additional design talent and new thinking into the Women's organization. We'll be talking more about our plans for UA women at our Investor Day in June and believe we're in great position to reach new consumers in Women's in the balance of 2013 and beyond.", "Our Fleece story was a highlight in Q1 just as it was in Q4 of 2012 with revenues doubling this past quarter. This is a great example of how we've been able to draft off our core Baselayer business and take a market leadership position in the adjacent category of Fleece. We've built up great equity with our consumer by providing cold-weather protection with lighter weight fabrications, and we believe that's helped drive our growth in Fleece.", "So next on to Footwear. Our strength and capabilities continue to grow in Footwear and we continue to make solid gains across all aspects of our business. We are gaining authenticity with a more technical running consumer with our Spine technology platform. This is a great example of delivering innovative product stories and telling them around multi-seasoned platforms as opposed to one-off introduction. We've gained market share in performance running and are gaining credibility with our retail partners as we continue to see improved sell-throughs at accounts like Dick's Sporting Goods, Hibbett Sports, Finish Line and Foot Locker, where we can tell the Under Armour performance story.", "So while large opportunities like performance running remains a focus for our team, we've also kept our attention on categories that help authenticate us with athletes like baseball and football cleats. In football, we're building on the equity we gained in 2012 with innovative products like our Highlight cleat that is already off to a solid start this year.", "We have expanded the Highlight cleat to a 32-color assortment to serve teams and athletes at every level and it'll be the featured innovation story for UA football this season in places that athletes shop like Eastbay. Innovative products like this and our great roster of UA athletes across both football and baseball enable us to be authentic and be the market leader at retail as well.", "In a category like basketball, our strategy is simpler. Be authentic on the court and build a relationship with the young consumer. That strategy is on display when UA team's like La Salle make a run in the NCAA tournament, or when the Clippers' DeAndre Jordan dunks and takes over YouTube, or when point guards like Raymond Felton of the Knicks and Brandon Jennings of the Bucks help lead their teams to the NBA playoffs. But what you don't see is the relationship we are building with the younger consumer on the court, not because of marketing but because we are making a real headway in building product that they respect. And that authenticity is where we are focused. Making the best product for players at the NBA, collegiate, high school, grassroot and AAU levels. Once that authentic, on-court relationship is well established, it will enable us to bring a much wider range of product to market in this category.", "I talked earlier about our Q1 Brand Holiday and how effective it was in driving traffic to our site and our retail partners. The strategy behind these holidays is pretty simple. Cluster our marketing and communications at specific times of the year across all our platforms and drive our consumers into retail.", "Maybe a little old-fashioned in today's modern world of reaching consumers, but in Q1, our strategy worked. Our Direct-to-Consumer business grew 31% in the quarter, accounting for 26% of total revenues. Our Factory House business was strong and we saw a solid uptick in our e-commerce business in both our average order value and our traffic on the site, driven without question by our I WILL Brand Holiday campaign.", "When we opened the UA Brand House in Baltimore this February, our goal was to provide the widest breadth of Under Armour products in one retail experience. As part of that, we specifically saw the opportunity to create greater awareness for our Women's and Footwear business specifically. And while it's still a very early read, that's exactly what we've seen to date.", "As we expand the breadth of our product -- Women's, Footwear, Youth, Accessories and Outdoor -- we continue to look for opportunities to broaden the access points to new consumers. We believe the way we're able to showcase the full Under Armour experience at our Brand House in Baltimore is an integral step in helping us tell our story. And our existing retail partners will benefit as well as we learn more about our consumer and what they want from our brand.", "I talked earlier about how the pace of our product development is helping us grow our business at a market-leading rate while reaching new consumers with great new product and new distribution. Our Q1 results are a great example of our ability to execute this from a distribution perspective as well.", "Our wholesale business, with our long-established retail partners like Dick's Sporting Goods, Sports Authority, Academy and Hibbett Sports, is very healthy and accounted for the bulk of our growth in the quarter. On the department store side, partners like Macy's, Nordstrom, Dillard's and Belk saw growth with new initiatives like Women's, Youth and Underwear. So our distribution equation continues to work well, grow our share and drive traffic in our wheelhouse distribution of sporting goods while at the same time, strategically growing in the department store channel to reach a broader range of new consumers.", "We talked a lot about continuing to grow our share with the core UA consumer while introducing the brand to a new audience. And we see the 3 Brand Holidays planned for 2013 as a key driver of that strategy.", "The first Brand Holiday was highlighted by our television campaign which focuses on innovation and the next generation of athletes. The spot features Sloane Stephens, the #2-ranked American in women's tennis; Bryce Harper, who's off to a great start for the Nationals in Major League Baseball; Canelo Alvarez, who's fighting tomorrow night for 3 super welterweight titles; and Armour39, our new biometric performance monitoring system for athletes.", "We are extending the campaign into the current quarter, amplifying elements of the spot that resonated strongly with our consumer. As I mentioned earlier, we are really excited about how the campaign has driven traffic to both our retail partners and our e-commerce site, and we feel this regular cadence will help do that on a consistent basis going forward.", "And lastly, we signed on to be the official supplier for the U.S. women's and men's gymnastics teams this year, enabling us to take a prominent place with a global audience at the next 2 Summer Olympic games. I reference the global audience because reaching that consumer outside the U.S. market is a key piece of our growth strategy going forward.", "I'm just back from a trip to Asia of 5 markets in 6 days and came away emboldened by the size of the opportunity for the Under Armour brand outside of the United States. Our strategy is to grow these markets is straightforward: set priorities, grow where the opportunities are most evident and invest in new markets to seed future growth.", "With new leadership in our international business plus new talent in place in Europe and emerging markets like China and Brazil, we are establishing that pathway for growth internationally. We'll be discussing our international priorities at our Investor Day in June, so it's important to understand that our 2013 product portfolio gives us confidence that we enter this next phase of growth with the product muscle to match the power of our brand.", "So in summary, another great quarter for Under Armour, one where we've seen a good return on the investments we've made in businesses like Women's, Footwear and Retail. Our track record in this area is well established. We have continuously invested as we've continued to grow, and we look forward to giving you more color on those investments and strategies at our Investor Day on June 5.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter financial results and our updated 2013 outlook. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2013 increased 23% to $472 million. Apparel grew 22% to $346 million during the quarter, from $283 million in the prior year, representing the 14th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category.", "Two of the largest contributors to our Apparel growth during the first quarter were our new HeatGear Sonic Baselayer line and our expanded Fleece assortment, with Fleece revenues for the quarter nearly doubling year-over-year. We saw additional gains in Women's with new introductions in Studio, ArmourBra and running. Growth in our Youth business also continued to be impressive.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 31% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues compared to approximately 25% in the prior year period. In our retail business, we opened 1 new Factory House store during the first quarter increasing our domestic Factory House store base to 102, up 21% from 84 locations at the end of last year's first quarter.", "We remain on pace to open 10 Factory House stores during 2013. As Kevin mentioned, we also introduced our first UA Brand House store in Baltimore during the first quarter.", "In e-commerce, we achieved the highest growth rate in the past 4 quarters as our Brand Holiday helped generate improved traffic and average order value.", "First quarter Footwear net revenues increased 27% to $81 million from $64 million the prior year, representing approximately 17% of net revenues. New running products led by UA Spine Venom continues to be the largest contributor to category growth.", "Our Accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 22% to $36 million from $30 million in the prior year period. We experienced strong results in headwear and headbands, which helped offset the planned wind-down of our current inventory of bags as we begin to relaunch the category toward the end of second quarter.", "International net revenues increased 41% to $31 million in the first quarter and represented over 6% of total net revenues, highlighted by strong growth with our Latin American distributors.", "Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 45.9% compared with 45.6% in the prior year's quarter. Three primary factors drove this performance during the quarter. First, we continued to realize lower price input cost primarily driven by North American Apparel, which positively impacted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points. Second, our overall sales mix was less favorable year-over-year, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 35 basis points. Third, we continued to work through some of our recent supply chain challenges resulting in higher air freight, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 35 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 390 basis points to 43.1% in the first quarter of 2013 from 39.2% in the prior year's period. The SG&A expense rate fell below our initial guidance of 44% to 45%, largely driven by a partial shift in certain marketing costs to the second quarter and overall top line performance.", "Details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: first, marketing costs increased to 13.3% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.5% in the prior year period, primarily driven by our new I WILL global marketing campaign; second, selling costs increased to 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 9.8% in the prior year period, primarily driven by the growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business; third, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 10.5% of net revenues from 9.8% in the prior year period, largely related to our expanded West Coast distribution facility and higher incentive compensation expenses; finally, corporate services increased to 8.6% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.1% in the prior year period, primarily given higher incentive compensation expense.", "Operating income during the first quarter declined 45% to $13 million compared with $24 million in the prior year period. Operating margin contracted 350 basis points during the quarter to 2.9%. Our first quarter tax rate of 39.9% was unfavorable to the 36.6% rate in last year's period when we received the state tax credit.", "As a result of our higher planned SG&A expenses during the first quarter, our net income decreased 47% to $8 million compared with $15 million in the prior year period. First quarter diluted earnings per share declined 47% to $0.07 compared to $0.14 last year.", "Now moving over to our balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 140% to $256 million compared with $107 million at March 31, 2012. Long-term debt, including current maturities, decreased to $60 million at quarter end from $76 million at March 31, 2012. Inventory at quarter end was unchanged year-over-year at $324 million.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $11 million for the first quarter. We currently expect 2013 capital expenditures at the high end of our initial guidance range of $80 million to $85 million.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2013. Our prior outlook called for 2013 net revenues of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion, representing growth of 20% to 21% and 2013 operating income of $255 million to $257 million, representing growth of 22% to 23%. Based on our current visibility, we are raising our net revenues outlook to a range of $2.21 billion to $2.23 billion, representing growth of 21% to 22%. We are also raising our operating income outlook to a range of $256 million to $258 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%.", "Along with operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of 39% to 39.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 108 million to 109 million. With our first quarter results in the books, we have several updates to 2013 quarterly timings. First net revenue. We currently see slightly stronger net revenues' growth in the third quarter relative to the second and fourth quarter growth rates. Part of this third quarter growth rate reflects a modest shift of our back-to-school Footwear ship dates from June to July. We also see the greatest sell and impact from our new bag program during the third quarter. Second, gross margin. While first quarter gross margins came in slightly better than expected, we anticipate the remainder of the year to be relatively consistent with our prior guidance. We expect approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the second quarter driven primarily by favorable year-over-year product costs. In the second half of the year, we continue to expect favorability from lapping last year's incremental air freight and the excess disposition strategy at our outlet stores. These second half gains are expected to be offset by sourcing of key product to suppliers with better expected delivery performance but at a higher cost. This sourcing impact will be more pronounced during the third quarter, as last year's sourcing changes and related costs commence during the fourth quarter. Combining these factors for the full year, we continue to expect modest 2013 gross margin expansion from the 47.9% level in 2012.", "As for SG&A, as we have discussed, our marketing strategy in 2013 is predicated around 3 Brand Holidays, which consist of consolidated spending at 3 key junctures during the year. While we deleveraged marketing expenses by 180 basis points during the first quarter, expenditures were less than anticipated given the decision to extend a portion of the first quarter campaign spend into the second quarter.", "Based on this action, approximately $5 million in marketing shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter. This does not change our spending plans for the duration of the year and we still expect meaningful leverage of marketing expenses in both the second and third quarter followed by a more consistent year-over-year rate of spending in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the marketing expense rate is planned relatively flat with last year's 11.2% level.", "Combining our other 3 SG&A buckets for the duration of the year, we expect expense leverage to occur in both the second and third quarters with expense deleverage planned in the fourth quarter. In all, we continue to expect a relatively-consistent rate of overall SG&A spending for the full year and modest full year operating margin expansion from the 11.4% achieved in 2012.", "Finally, a few thoughts on inventory. Inventory growth has come in below sales growth for the past 4 quarters and we have noted that we would continue to balance our inventory management efforts with our ability to service our customers and drive improved fill rates. As we lap last year's supply chain challenges, we expect inventory growth will outpace revenue growth during the second and third quarters before closing the year slightly ahead of sales growth.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Not to -- Kevin, not to completely firmer [ph] on the analyst day, but could you give us an early look on what direction international is taking now that Charlie's been there for about 6 months. What markets are you going to be focusing on first? Perhaps what sports will you leverage to penetrate those markets?", "Kevin A. Plank", "It will -- you're going to get a really great dive on Investor Day on June 5, so we're looking forward to that. And, I think, really introducing Charlie to the investor community and getting, I think, the same confidence that we have internally with what -- externally -- with what he's brought to the team here. So first of all, at a very high level, evolving the Under Armour business from being a North American company who's simply selling product in other countries to truly embracing being a global company. It's an initiative that we took on back in 2005 and 2006 when we first launched into Europe and over the last 7 or 8 years continue to make that evolution. Today I think that our goal is to be a global company that truly has 3 components where we're doing business, which would be the Americas, Asia and Europe. So checking off the list, we've seen success in international. We've had confidence that our brand will translate. But if you look across where we've been successful, it's time for us to make, I think, longer-term investments. I think we always talked about our growth being -- we're very fortunate to have a successful Apparel business, with the growth that you've seen of 14 consecutive quarters of growth there, north of 20%, as well as our Direct-to-Consumer business. And then we're starting to look for Footwear and then you'll see international come on and become important for us. So Latin America for us, for one, Mexico as these -- these markets, I don't think we'd really considered part of the conversation when we talked about things like Europe and China -- places like Mexico, places like Brazil, places like Chile, Argentina, Peru are places where we believe that we can be successful. Latin America is something that is really seeing some of the biggest profits that we're looking at from an international basis right now and really beginning to drive. We recently announced hiring a new MD as a consultant right now that we anticipate moving into a full time role in the near future as well, and heading up our Brazilian business. And we'll look for sort of market entry there at the appropriate time. Europe, we're in our 7th year. We've got a -- we really are encouraged by the signs that we see. We feel like we're at the tipping point. When you look at sort of that 7-, 8-year time frame, it's the point where things start to really begin to work for you. Leveraging some of those assets that we've signed on the European side that we think play really on a global basis, whether it's Tottenham who's sitting in the top 4 or 5 or 6 in the league at any point of time in the English premiership and again something that plays globally, or the Welsh Rugby Union, which just recently won the Six Nations Championship for the second year in a row. So we feel like we've got assets and you'll continue to see us sign global assets. And that's something which is -- again, part of the evolution of the company is moving away from just signing collegiate teams and things here domestically but really taking those dollars and having the discipline to spend on a marketing basis ahead of where we're seeing it fail. So I think we've been encouraged by what we've seen, by that happening. Asia, I mentioned in my script that I just got back from a 5-city tour over 6 days, which was -- it was a lot of work but it was something -- I think it was really eye-opening too. And coming back encouraged and emboldened by the opportunity that we have there. Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- while it's a mixture between some of our manufacturing partners as well as some of the distribution opportunities we have, extremely encouraged. And begin with Japan, which -- now it is our 13th year of doing business together, a business that approached USD 200 million in 2012, and we see on a current currency basis, growing north of 30% and 40%. So really a very powerful partner for us and somebody that is well positioned. And frankly, we -- that's what probably gives us the greatest confidence that we can continue to grow. So all these things though, they pale and I'm giving you a sort of long-winded version or answer on our growth strategy, but a lot of it's about our evolution to being truly a global company. And so supply chain is one of the first things that Charlie has really dug into while being here and getting ourselves the capability to be fast and be able to deliver and make sure that we can keep our -- and service our retailers at the expectation levels that they have but probably, more importantly, that we have of ourselves. So we are investing globally. The ROI on it is something that -- what we saw in Japan is something that's paying back for us. We've seen what we've done in Europe. We believe it's beginning to pay back for us. And that's both in terms of the revenues that come in as well as just some of the brand equity investment. So we understand that International's going to be a long-term play. We feel like we're in probably year 7 or 8 of that commitment and understanding that it's something that's not going to happen overnight, but we feel very good about our leadership and frankly the way we're positioned.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Sounds great. And Brad, moving on to just touching on the supply chain, something that Kevin mentioned. How are the improvements in the planning process of supply chain helping to drive improvements in the gross margin part of the equation? And can this be a source of upside as fill rates improve throughout the year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Camilo. And I think it's a couple of things there from a short-term and a longer-term view. So obviously, from a short-term view, we've talked at length over the last few calls about some of the near-term challenges we had, especially relative to Fleece and servicing of our Fleece business that -- and some of the challenges we had last year and because of that, some air freight that we've had to incur towards the end of last year and early this year, also along with resourcing some of that Fleece product as we get into the back half of this year, and then obviously, that resourcing coming at a higher cost to us as we move into countries that are maybe -- have some more high duty attached to them. So there is some near-term challenges that we talked about at length the last few quarters that we'll see in the back half the year. And that's included obviously in our margin guidance for the back half of the year. As far as longer term goes though, a lot of positive things on the supply chain side. I kind of put it in the people, process, technology type, 3 buckets. From a people perspective, probably the most important as far as the first step, a lot of new leadership in the building the last 18 months or so. I think we have about 5 new VPs in the last 18 months just in the supply chain side. And 3 of them are on -- are on the planning side. So a lot of great leadership there, which turns into much better processes and more disciplines and how we forecast our business, how we order our business and how we flow inventory. And the last thing, I think it's systems, too. And I think we've talked the last few quarters again of some investments we're making in systems on the demand side and supply planning side of our business, which will help to give us a lot more visibility not only to ourselves but give a more clear visibility to our suppliers, which enables us to make better commitments out going forward. So although we see some near-term challenges here, I think some of these things that we've been working on in people, process and technology going forward should be a catalyst for us and start to see -- not only continue to improve our inventory management going forward in 2014 and beyond, but absolutely that should play a part in what we had hoped to be some gross margin gains as we get into the outer years. And obviously that's another topic in Investor Day we'll go into a little more detail on also.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just 2 questions if I could. I guess first on the updated revenue guidance. Obviously, 23% revenue growth on the first quarter, I think you raised to 21% to 22% for the full year. So is there anything that's kind of giving you caution as you look forward to the rest of the year? And then secondly, on the Brand House in Baltimore. I mean, it sounds like you're learning a lot there and it's pretty exciting. Do you see the opportunity for that kind of presence in other markets either domestically or internationally? And when you mentioned kind of leveraging that with your wholesale partners, could you give us some more detail of that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Sharon, I'll take the revenue question first. Not really changing too much as far as our outlook for the year goes. I think you can look at Q1 and say that it came in a little bit better than anticipated. I think maybe the weather helped a little bit in Q1 as far as the little bit of an upside for us in our business as we had some good traditional product out of Q4 last year into the first few months of this year, which put some freshness on the floor, and obviously, we had the ability to service that colder weather business the first few months. In addition, our e-commerce business came in a little bit better than we anticipated in the first quarter, which was good. That obviously helped on the gross margin side a little bit, too. So looking forward, as we look past Q1, we don't see a lot of change in our -- from our initial guidance back in January for the rest of the year. We still have to look at the back half of the year and play a part in how, not only we but our customers, our retail customers, are managing their Q3 and Q4 inventory levels for fall/winter, obviously, coming out of 2 warmer winters. So there's probably an impact to that relative to some view towards the back half the year. But other than that, I think really a lot more of a consistent view for the rest of the year than we -- that -- as we had back in January.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Sharon, let me jump on the Brand House question that you asked about. First of all, I think we're really pleased with what we've seen so far. We're certainly not declaring victory at any level. Again, this is the type of store that we would typically open in a warehouse or someplace and make it more of a lab store. Having the ability to have real live bodies walk through and get a read on how the consumer reacts to it is something that's been eye-opening, it's been very telling and produced a tremendous amount of learning for us at the same time. So just some of the specific learnings we've had is that localized product has been really important to it. So I think there's something that people really personalized, with Under Armour about being that local hometown hero. And so when we play on that, whether it's graphic programs and other things, that really make the product feel like it's part of the community is very important. Doing that on a broad base is something that is why we have been a wholesale distributor for a long time because our partners do it very, very well. However, 2 of the big priorities we had was successfully elevating Women's and Footwear. That's 2 areas that we've seen really great growth, actually trending pretty far in front of what we've done and what we're doing currently in our wholesale business. Footwear, for instance, as a category, we're doing nearly 2x the volume that we're doing in the -- with our wholesale accounts. So I think really highlighting, getting the breadth of product, the ability for us to create an unedited merchandising assortment is something that really plays well for us and finding out the opportunities that we have with the consumer. Again, the primary goal of even having these stores to begin with was to be able to get closer to our consumer and learn and use this, frankly, as a tool to enhance our wholesale relationships. As I say that though, and international becomes more and more important, and the needs that Charlie has across markets. And whether it's in Mexico, whether just coming back from the trip in Asia, particularly through China where we've got 4 stores open today, we've got several more planned to open before the end of the year and some are wholly-owned shops and some are shop in shops as well, but in all of them, it's about ourselves controlling our retail presentation and the way that we look. And so becoming expert at that is something we really want to keep close to home and ensure that we have that capability on a global basis. And then we'll be thoughtful and strategic here in the U.S., not where we're cannibalizing any of our existing partners but frankly where we can find new consumers. So we are committed to having one additional store before the -- we will open before the end of the year and again, continue the learnings going on. But in order for us to be the global brand that we expect to be, having and being proficient in specialty retail, we think is extremely important, in part for our performance here in the States, but probably more importantly as we look to go abroad and become the world's #1 performance athletic brand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Brad, you mentioned in the script, mix was a drag to gross margin. Can you talk a little bit more about which were the categories that mixed up to work against the margin?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Jim. For Q1, for the first quarter, again most of these mixes were somewhat anticipated coming into the quarter. Factory House was a little bit of a drag as far as our excess versus made-for mix. That was more of overhang from last year's excess product that carried into the first quarter, so that came in a little bit more on excess side than we anticipated in the first quarter. And also on the Latin America side, we talked about good growth in our revenue in Latin America. Most of that is distributor-based business, which comes at a little bit lower gross margin, so that also impacted. That was anticipated and impacted the mix of our Q1 margins.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then you're having good success with the Spine platform. Can you speak to any updates on where you are with Footwear gross margin and opportunities for improvement there over the balance of the year and looking forward?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. On the Footwear margin side, we've been talking -- the Footwear gross margin's being kind of in the low-30s for us as an overall company. We're seeing relative consistency there right now year-over-year in Footwear gross margins. Again, I'd go back to my comments earlier on the supply chain side about short-term versus long-term. I think in the near-term, we'll see relative consistency in Footwear margins overall as we get through the year. But in general, longer-term, not -- pretty consistent with my overall comments in supply chain. A lot of things going on relative to how we plan our business, how we buy and flow our inventory, which should help, which obviously helps us manage excess inventory. And then obviously, just on the Footwear side especially, the ability for us working with our vendors and our suppliers and obviously getting talent in-house to be much more efficient and effective around cost management on the Footwear side should give us some ability longer-term.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just had a couple of questions. First of all, on the direct side can you sort of part how e-commerce was versus your stores? And then within stores, how comps were versus maybe some of the new store productivity?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. Lindsay, we don't really break out in our DTC numbers retail versus web for the most part. But what I can tell you is with the 31% growth in DTC, the web had a higher growth rate than our retail stores. That's pretty much all I can tell you. We don't really get into the differences and quantify the differences between the 2. And also we really don't talk about comps. For the most part, you have to remember that we have a lot of changes going on with some high growth in a lot of our doors and Factory House over the last couple of years, plus we're also upsizing a lot of doors, increasing square footage and so forth, too. So the comp number's a little bit challenging and difficult and I think a little less meaningful for us right now in our evolution.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Are we fully past some of the conversion issues and other problems that you guys had experienced on your website several months ago when we're looking towards a better operating platform?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. I'd love to say we're totally past it, I think we have some good signs in Q1. I think we still have some work to do. Probably the biggest positive impact we saw was just really aligning that Brand Holiday Kevin was talking about with our business on the e-commerce side. And that -- really making sure that we're driving the right traffic and we saw increase in traffic relative to when we were spending during the Brand Holiday and also saw our average order values increase, which I think is a combination again of the Brand Holiday and also some better fill rates in our overall supply chain side of our business still, especially on the e-commerce side. So I think there's some positive signs there. We like the direction we're heading in. I don't think we're ever satisfied relative to where we are, we still see some room for improvement. But definitely with our growth rate -- with our growth rate really kind of approaching last year's growth rate relative to where we were in Q1 with the web, we feel like we're heading back in the right direction again.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly just pretty favorable spread between your inventory and sales growth. Just curious if you had any comments on that and how we should think about the implications for gross margins for next quarter.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. Again, if you look at the rest of the quarters, if you go back to last year, and we talked about some challenges in getting product in on time and so delivery was kind of a challenge last year especially as we got into Q3 and Q4 last year. So I think some of this with inventory, we're guiding through heavy inventory growth ahead of revenue growth. Part of it is just kind of lapping some challenges we had last year, so we definitely anticipate flowing product much more efficiently this year, especially our Fleece product. And that'll cause some quarter end growth over last year. And by the fourth quarter, again, we're just kind of guiding slightly ahead of revenue growth. Again, I think some of the supply chain challenges lasted through Q4 into Q1 of this year. So again, a little bit more of a comp issue to where we were last year more than anything. As we've stated in the past, right now we're really focused on kind of that 3 turn in inventory. We were probably a little bit of ahead of that last year in the back half of the year especially, so we're focusing more on that 3 turn right now, which just means that you'll have inventory grow a little bit ahead of revenue. We're really focused right now on just more supply chain efficiencies, fill rate, servicing our customers and staying around that 3 inventory turns.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad of ISI Group.", "Samuel Lee - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Sam Lee in for Omar. My first question is on Footwear. It sounds like you guys have a lot of success in running with the charge in Spine platforms, but can you talk a little bit more about your plans for basketball and the opportunity there? I mean, when do you see this moving from building an authentic brand on court to more accelerating the pace of product introductions? And what will be the sign that you're there?", "Kevin A. Plank", "So I -- as we entered year 7 in Footwear and, again, just a little bit of history for anybody that isn't familiar with it, but 2006, we introduced football cleats; 2007, baseball cleats; 2008, training shoes; 2009, running shoes; and 2010 was basketball. So I think some of the success that we're seeing on the cleated side, particularly in football and baseball, has taken us 6, 7, 8 years to get there and really have breakthrough innovation with things like the Highlight cleat that is -- it's -- a, it's driving volumes on a unit basis, it's important, it's certainly not mass but it really is driving at 100 -- last year $130 and this year you'll see us price similarly. And so driving consumers at that $100-plus price point will be very important. But it's also going to do a tremendous amount to drive a lot of that volume in that $60, $70, $80 sporting goods wheelhouse, so continue to take advantage of that. I think basketball and, frankly, all of our categories are no different. We mentioned some of the success that we're seeing in running right now. I don't think that we're declaring victory by any stretch, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. The new Spine Venom is selling really well and really where we focus within our key sporting goods distribution, in places where we own 20%, 25%, 30% of the apparel floorspace, and making sure that we have a Footwear presentation that matches that. So we're excited I think about the commitment and, frankly, the recommitment we're getting from many of our accounts, of giving us the presentation that we think is that we're earning. So that will take time to happen. But all those categories -- I think, from cleated, we know it's very small, but it leads us to the larger categories of running and, of course, what we think we can do in basketball. So as we're heading into playoff season here, a lot of good things, I think, particularly around what basketball can be and can mean for us. We've had a couple of shoes. One thing we know is that playability on court is very important. The consumer, particularly where we're very strong, in sporting goods, that consumer is very much a team athlete, who's looking for product that they can wear, that they can play with. And so our strategy is really about winning that athlete. We've got great partners between Foot Locker and Finish Line that have really given us commitment. And obviously, they really own, I think the -- they own the basketball consumer at least. But on more of the performance basis is something where we want to make sure that we authenticate ourselves and we win. And so it's going to be time. And I think that we've demonstrated our ability and our patience to have that. I think we're very proud of the product that we have. I think we're proud of the growth that we've made in the product, where as I mentioned in my script, just the playability that we have from the professional ranks with -- I think, we've got 7 or 8 players under contract and we've got 15 or 20 more that wear our shoes because they like them, are very encouraging signs that go down to our -- the impact we've made at the collegiate level both on the Men's and Women's side through AAU, straight at the grassroots level. So I think we're telling people that we're in this fight for a long time. I think that we can win here and we can be successful. And I think the signs we have are very encouraging. So our Footwear business as a whole, we went through that phase and -- I began this answer with listing, over the years, the categories we've launched into. We're not launching any new categories anytime soon. Our commitment and our focus is becoming excellent in the categories that we're in today. My original partner, Kip Fulks, is driving that business for us. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen. And I think we've got a good team and we're going to continue to bring talent to our team and bring the resources that we need to become a market leader in that -- in Footwear as a whole.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Svezia of Susquehanna Financial.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Brad, a question for you. I'm just curious on the gross margin trajectory. Any color you can add about the back half? Are things, particularly in the third quarter from a sourcing perspective, going to mitigate any opportunity to show any gross margin growth? And then maybe in the fourth quarter, is there are an incremental opportunity maybe driven by Direct-to-Consumer? Just any color you can add about the cadence as you think about gross margin in the back half?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure. So as we've been guiding, the front half of the year definitely has the gross margin upside versus the back half of the year. Again as consistent with our comments during the last earnings call back in January. Again, front half of the year, we're comping a pretty tough cost environment last spring, spring/summer '12 relative to cotton product that was being sold at that point in time and some of the cost challenges there. So the front half of this year comping that, we have some upside benefit year-over-year. So that's the biggest driver in the benefit. As we get to the back half of the year, we're talking about a modest full year gross margin benefit with the benefit in the front half, what that kind of guides to is maybe a slight decrease in the back half of the year in gross margin. What you have going on there is some things working in our favor like air freight would work in our favor as we are more efficient on the supply chain side. But we have talked about resourcing a lot of our fall/winter products, specifically our Fleece product, resourcing that from where it was last year to where it's going to be this year. It'll help service our business better but it'll come at a little bit higher cost. So unfortunately, that resourcing in the near-term is probably going to more than offset some of the benefits we've had in air freight in the back half the year. Most of that's going to be pronounced, really if you look at the timing of that in the back half the year, if you imagine what we were going through last year as we talked about the challenges delivering Fleece specifically in Q3, so we were delivering Fleece last year in Q3 from some lower cost suppliers but we were having some challenges getting it here on time. And we had talked about commencing the resourcing of some of that Fleece really in Q4 last year. So we started to see some of the costs of this Fleece escalate a little bit in Q4 last year. So we just talk about kind of year-over-year comps and year-over-year view. Q3 will be a much tougher comp as we're comping this lower cost Fleece last year that wasn't really delivering on time. As we get into Q4, we're comping a little bit better in the current year versus last year because we have already -- really started to move some of that Fleece supply, if that makes sense. Also on the Factory House side, we talked about last year moving a lot of excess products to our Factory House stores and that had a negative impact to our margins. We talked about that being a little bit of a benefit this year in the back half of the year. We still see a little bit of a benefit there, but again that's just going to be slight benefit versus last year and will not help offset some of those resourcing of products in the back half of the year.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just quickly on the -- can you remind us again how much of your business now in the outlet side is made-for as we go into the back half versus last year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. On the made-for side on -- for retail, we are probably in the -- for the back half of the year, probably in the high 50s or so, close to 60% made-for last year. This year we'd probably see that maybe more than in maybe closer to 70%, upper 60s, so a little bit of a lift in made-for year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Faye Landes of Cowen and Company.", "Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was hoping you could -- 2 things actually. First of all, as you know, we've seen very strong growth from other suppliers of athletic footwear. Do you think -- is the market as a whole growing so dramatically or is something else going on?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I'd say I'm not sure that -- we're pretty focused on our own business and so we've got a dog fight that we go out to every day. And obviously we understand our competition is pretty good on the footwear side. And so breaking into that is something that we're digging in the trenches and follow -- a rising tide raises all ships and, of course, that's a great scenario, I'm not sure that we're banking on that either. We're viewing this as we need to, a, take share from others, so we're identifying places where we can win to do that. And then more importantly, we're also identifying places where we can create new share and create new opportunities. I think, again, what we've done in cleated with 7 or 8 years of expertise under our belt, creating silhouettes and styles and, most importantly, innovation that the market hasn't seen before. So we're happy to be a part of a rising tide, but I think we're not -- we're certainly not banking on it. But with 27% growth in the quarter, we're very happy for our team. I think we're making good progress. I think we see continued much brighter days ahead. And we are absolutely committed to Footwear.", "Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But our -- on Apparel though, there is where everything seems to be growing. Correct, right now?", "Kevin A. Plank", "On the Apparel side? Yes. I think...", "Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, that's what I'm talking about. It's just that you've -- Nike had great apparel numbers. Also C9, for instance, it just seems like there's this tremendous robustness on the athletic apparel category in general? Is that a fair read?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I don't read the paper that much, Faye. So I focus on -- I read the end of [indiscernible]  -- I know. We're aware of what's happening out there, so I think there's a good trend obviously. I think sporting goods, sports apparel, athletic wear in general, there obviously seems to be a bit of a trend toward it, a lot of factors pointing in toward that. The way we're positioned I think, again, we're beneficiaries. But I don't think that -- we're not playing our business to be part of some short-term or midterm trend as much as we're building ourselves for the long-term. It's what keeps us rooted in authenticity in sport but it also sees us expanding, particularly on things like the Women's side where I spoke a lot about just our commitment to expanding our distribution there as well as extending our product line and, frankly, selling product for Women's shop as well as having a point of view with product that women want to buy. And so with new leadership in place, our commitment to some of the things we're doing with our New York office, having Leanne onboard, you'll have a chance to meet Leanne at Investor Day as well. And I think here, from the broader vision we have on the Women's side as well as -- I think a lot of the growth, as the market leader in Men's apparel, as very close to that as we continue to drive on the Women's side too, we understand that we dictate the tempo for much of the trends that happen in the market. And so we believe that with the innovation we're bringing with things on the Men's side like Sonic Baselayer, from an innovation standpoint with exciting new stories we have like Alter Ego, with some of the things we're doing on the Women's side from our capris, our bottoms bar and also what we're doing just with color in becoming, frankly, a better company. We've been at it 17 years now, and at some point, you're going to start figuring it out. So we're very proud of the team, first and foremost, as that I think we're getting better, I think we're working together for a longer period of time and we believe that we can be the market leader and best in class. And so we expect to be the ones that are setting that tempo and dictating those trends.", "Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right, terrific. One quick cleanup -- one quick housekeeping. And I may have missed this and so I apologize. On Footwear, did you break out -- or give some sense of how much of the Footwear in the quarter was cleats -- cleated and non-cleated?", "Brad Dickerson", "No, Faye, we did not. But what I'll tell you is, by far, from a volume perspective and from a growth perspective in Q1 by far, running was the leader of that.", "Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So, running was bigger than cleated?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks everybody very much, and our hearts and prayers with Boston. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn [ph] today's conference call to Mr. Tom Shaw. You may begin, sir.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us for the -- on today's second quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the day on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us for today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the second quarter, followed by an update to our 2013 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Q2 marked the 15th consecutive quarter where Under Armour Apparel grew at least 20% and the 13th straight where total revenues grew at 20%-plus. We look at these results and 3 key themes jump out at us. First, our long-term strategy for growth is clearly working. At our Investor Day here in Baltimore last month, we laid out our plan to once again double the size of our company, targeting $4 billion in revenues by 2016. Today's results reinforce how our brand continues to resonate with both our core and new consumers in both established and new channels of distribution in North America. Second, these continued strong top line results are great evidence that there is still significant runway for our brand in North America, not just in the areas where we see accelerated growth opportunities like Women's and Youth Apparel, but in our core Men's Apparel business as well. And third, the significant opportunities to grow our Apparel business in North America provide a great foundation for the investments we are undertaking to make Under Armour a truly international athletic brand with Apparel and Footwear platforms being built to reach a global consumer. These investments in our Footwear and global infrastructure will cost money, but we are confident that the return on them will enable us to continue leveraging our brand equity as we expand into new categories and geographies.", "So let's start with our U.S. Apparel business and the multiple ways we continue to resonate with our customers here in the States. We continue to take share in multiple categories and genders through a combination of increased floor space and greater productivity from our existing retail partners, expanding our presence within our relatively new department store distribution and that ultimate driver of retail traffic, building great product.", "So first, on our wholesale partners. Our ability to resonate with our consumer, combined with the strengths of our long-standing relationships with our key sporting goods partners, is the foundation of our U.S. business. This foundation is exceptionally strong as our wholesale partners continue to give our brand more space in their floors and invest along with us to bolster the presentation of UA at the point of purchase. A great example of this focus is our partnership with Dick's Sporting Goods, where in Q4 last year, we had shop-in-shop at just over 20% of Dick's stores. By the fourth quarter of this year, that number will be well over 40% of their stores, representing more than the 240 doors.", "Our department store distribution, while still a small percentage of our wholesale business, is growing very quickly. While we're still very early in the growth curve, we are learning a lot about which assortments work best in this channel with categories like Golf and Women's running driving traffic. We're also outperforming at both Boys' and Girls' in department stores with polos and hoodies.", "Our Brand House retail store in Baltimore continues to see great results, and we continue to learn valuable lessons on how localized product helps drive traffic. For example, in this past quarter, we had a large-scale test of our Golf product in our Baltimore Brand House. We saw very strong results that not only help us plan our assortments in our next store opening this fall in Tysons Corner, but also inform our wholesale partners what they can expect from making larger investments in emerging categories and the Under Armour brand as a whole.", "We're also growing our North American business because the equity we have built with consumers on the playing field enables us to be a premium brand not just with our most technical innovations but in our core business as well. We look at our average selling price as a key metric of our ability to innovate. And in the second quarter, we saw strong increases in our ASPs across Apparel, Footwear and Accessories. That's a big deal.", "On the product innovation front, we continue to bring newness and excitement to our core business. First and foremost and certainly the most entertaining is Alter Ego, our new partnership with Marvel Entertainment and DC Comics, which brings super heroes like Superman, Spiderman, Ironman and The Batman on to the field through our compression apparel. With baseball in midseason and football practices under way, this is the statement apparel for athletes on-field in 2013, and we continue to have a tough time keeping it in stock.", "We are resonating with the UA Women's consumer with our growth this quarter driven by strong sales of capris as well as our Studio line, the ArmourBra recollection and our redesigned tank tops. We're also resonating especially well in Youth, our fastest-growing apparel segment in Q2, with our Big Logo hoodies and tees driving growth at our sporting goods partners and establishing a strong foundation in department stores.", "And the pipeline of innovation, which we shared in-depth at Investor Day, is not letting up in the balance of 2013 either. We'll continue to resonate through technical innovation like ColdGear Infrared that was inspired by the stealth bomber and utilizes ceramic insulation to create the best thermal regulator in the industry. From long-sleeved t-shirt to our most technical snowboard jackets, the addition of this technology provides warmth without the weight and will be hitting shelves this quarter.", "Our relentless flow of true innovation that works for all athletes is critical to our continued success. From a brand perspective, it's equally critical that we evolve our brand message as well. We started telling the UA innovation story with our first Brand Holiday earlier this year. The strategy behind these holidays is pretty simple: Cluster our marketing and communications at specific times of the year across all our platforms and drive our consumers into retail.", "The next evolution of our brand message hit earlier this month with the debut of Ready for August. For our U.S. consumer, the story is about American football, our heritage, where we were founded as a company. For the consumers outside the U.S. we're creating a separate commercial, where we will tell our training stories through the lens of global football. Either way, the message will resonate as it speaks the universal language of getting ready for the season.", "Much like our first Brand Holiday message around innovation, the message around training in the second campaign works for athletes of all ages globally. This brand position is one we believe we can own around the world, especially given the strength of our brand among younger consumers. Because whether it's prepping for the start of high school football here in Baltimore, Arian Foster at the Texas training camp in Houston, the South Carolina Gamecocks football team in Columbia, or the first match of the English Premier League next month, athletes know that it's the work they do now that will make the difference at the end of the season.", "And we'd also like to give a little shout out to Ray Lewis who is our Executive Producer on this spot. We did think about having Ray start today's call with a little pregame motivational speech but weren't sure you all would be ready for that, especially you on the West Coast where it's about 5:30 in the morning right now.", "One way we continue to build on our connection with young consumers is with our focus on next. We stay authentic by being connected to that next generation of stars no matter what the sport. In golf, Jordan Spieth, our newest golfer to the Under Armour family, is making noise in the tour with 5 top 10 finishes on the PGA Tour so far this year and year-to-date earnings over $1 million, a little better than what most 19 year olds are pulling down for their summer jobs. He won the John Deere Classic 2 weeks ago, becoming the first teenager to win a PGA event in 82 years. That qualified him for the British Open, so he hopped a flight to Scotland and was 4 shots off the lead entering the weekend.", "In baseball, we've definitely got now and we've got next. We had 12 UA players in this year's All-Star game, including Bryce Harper, who is in our first Brand Holiday spot; Buster Posey; Clayton Kershaw; and Manny Machado among others. And we also had 27 of 61 players in the Futures Game, where teams select the best players in a minor league system to represent them. Given that Manny Machado played in a Futures Game last year and the Major League All-Star game this year, we think it's a pretty good indicator that we've got a great group of athletes representing us on the baseball field for years to come.", "That first Brand Holiday spot also introduced the U.S. to Canelo Alvarez, who's about to fight for the junior middleweight championship of the world. Well, he won that fight. And on September 14, he's fighting Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas. To give you some perspective on Canelo's popularity in Mexico, this fight has already broken the all-time gate record with tickets selling out within 24 hours, already surpassing the take in the 2007 Mayweather-De La Hoya fight.", "And last but certainly not least, Sloane Stephens, the last American woman standing at Wimbledon and ready to do some damage at the U.S. Open in Queens when it starts a month from now.", "So let me sum up where I think we're headed with our U.S. Apparel business. We believe that with our continued flow of great products, our ability to reach new consumers through expanded distribution and by bringing new dimensions to our brand communications, that the runway for our U.S. Apparel business is long and that we're still in the early stages of where our brand can go within our largest and most established businesses.", "So with that, on to Footwear. Given our success with the Highlight franchise in baseball and football cleats, the solid performance of our Spine running platform and the outstanding early reception we've seen with our SpeedForm technology, I think it's safe to say that we've never been in a better position to gain share and become a meaningful player in the U.S. Footwear market.", "So let's start with a feel of the Highlight. We have said that when we innovate, we win. And the Highlight cleat, which we introduced last year, is great evidence. In football, the Highlight cleat at $110 has been the #1 football cleat at Eastbay, our partner with Foot Locker, for more than 12 straight weeks. It's also leading the way for us in baseball, selling through solidly at $110 and helping us take solid market share this season.", "Now in year 2 on our Spine running platform, we had a great launch in our key accounts for the Spine Venom shoe. We continue to have great support from our key retail partners, and we'll increase the cadence of new products in the Spine platform through this fall and the spring of 2014.", "The third product piece around what's happening in Under Armour Footwear is SpeedForm, our most compelling Footwear innovation story to-date. SpeedForm elevates Under Armour Footwear to what consumers have come to expect from our Apparel: innovation around fit. And we're bringing that innovation to the world of footwear by not making these shoes in traditional footwear factories. Instead, they're being made in a bra factory by partners who've built entire businesses around the concept of a perfect fit. New processes in non-traditional footwear construction allow us to streamline both the production and the amount of pieces in a shoe, better efficiency with more precision. This year, we're talking about small numbers. With focused distribution, we've already seen a strong reaction to this $120 shoe. Our goal is to be well set up to tell a great story about it in 2014 and start creating a legacy of Under Armour Footwear in running, as we've done on the field with baseball and football.", "I haven't left myself a lot of time to talk about our international business, but we fully understand that it's the biggest growth opportunity for the Under Armour brand. More importantly, we believe that much like we now stand with Footwear, we've put ourselves in position where our strategy is aligned with the size of that opportunity. That strategy for global growth is relatively simple: set priorities, grow where the opportunities are most evident and invest in new markets to seed future growth. One critical part of that strategy is getting Under Armour on the ground as a local brand in these key markets. Over the next year, we'll be opening 10 more offices. And by the end of this year, we'll have more offices outside the United States than here in the U.S. Earlier this month, we opened our new office in Manchester in U.K., and we're opening new offices in Australia and Germany later this year.", "The part of Under Armour's world undergoing the most change is Latin America. We believe there are great growth opportunities for our brand in the region, and we're taking steps to quickly capitalize on them. Our office in Panama, where our head of International, Charlie Maurath, will be based, opened in May. We'll use that base for entering the key markets in the other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, including Brazil where we'll be launching the Under Armour brand in 2014. Our new team in Brazil brings more than 50 years of industry experience to the table. With both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics being held in the country, there will be a tremendous amount of the sports world's attention focused there in the next few years.", "In Mexico, our distributor will transition to a wholly owned Under Armour subsidiary in the first quarter of 2014. Ahead of creating that new structure, we plan to open our first owned specialty retail store in Mexico City in September of this year.", "We will continue to build brand equity in the short term while ensuring we are investing for the long term. For example, as we bring Under Armour to the market in Chile, we are entering into a relationship with Colo-Colo, the most popular soccer club in the country. Our partnership with them will help us get immediate traction for our brand at retail. In markets like Chile and others around the world, we will keep Under Armour true to our core and connect with athletes through an authentic position around training that is distinct from our global competitors'.", "There's a great deal of excitement inside Under Armour around the International growth opportunities in front of us. And while there's a great flurry of activity going on in Latin America, we believe we are well-positioned in Western Europe and China to make those very large markets in the global Under Armour story.", "So lots of activity happening for Under Armour outside the U.S. I spent a lot of time recently seeing how our brand looks outside the U.S., and I keep coming back to Baltimore incredibly enthusiastic about what we can do in these new markets. When you look at Under Armour today, you see a North American company with more than 90% of our business here in the States. But when you look at how our brand has grown in places like Japan, where our partners, Dome, approached $200 million in wholesale revenues last year and plan to grow another 30% this year and operates 24 dedicated Under Armour doors, I think you start to appreciate why we're moving quickly to capture some of the existing consumer demand for our brand: because the Under Armour brand does translate.", "We said in our Investor Day that we see International accounting for 12% of our business by 2015, a doubling of the 6% that it currently represents. But much as we said about our U.S. Apparel business, our U.S. Footwear business, our U.S. accessory business and the U.S. retail business, we are just scratching the surface of what our brand can be internationally.", "When you watch the launch of our new Tottenham kit in London or see Gareth Bale wearing it on a huge billboard towering over Times Square or watch Hunter Mahan playing in the final pairing Sunday at the British Open or Canelo Alvarez taking on Floyd Mayweather next month in Vegas, you begin to appreciate how we are just starting to make our way outside of North America.", "We believe international will be our fastest-growing business in 2014. When you combine that with the runway for growth we see in our U.S. Apparel business and the strides we've made in Footwear, the possibilities for the Under Armour brand are abundant, and we believe we have never been in a better position to execute against those opportunities", "And with that, I'll turn things over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson, Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time discussing our second quarter financial results followed by our updated outlook for 2013.", "Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2013 increased 23% to $455 million. Apparel grew 23% to $310 million during the quarter from $253 million in the prior year, representing the 15th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category. Increased newness remains a key factor in our Apparel strength here to-date, highlighted in the second quarter by our new HeatGear Sonic Baselayer line as well as our expanded Storm and Charged Cotton platforms. Additional success in Women's was driven by our expanded sports bras assortment, new designs in tanks, heightened color in capris. We are also seeing tremendous traction in Youth, both Boys' and Girls', where we are seeing strong growth in both new and existing distribution led by graphic tees.", "Our Direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 29% for the quarter, representing approximately 30% of net revenues compared to approximately 29% in the prior year period. In our retail business, we opened 3 new Factory House stores during the second quarter, increasing our domestic Factory House store base to 105, up 14% from 92 locations at the end of last year's second quarter. As we provided at last month's Investor Day, we expect to open approximately 13 total Factory House stores during 2013, closing the year with 114 domestic locations. On the specialty store side, we continue to test and learn at our first UA Brand House store in Baltimore and remain on track to open our second location at Tysons Corner this November.", "In e-commerce, we achieved another quarter of strong growth highlighted by ongoing positive trends in average order value, which benefited from an improvement in our inventory positioning across the channel. Second quarter Footwear net revenues increased 21% to $82 million from $67 million in the prior year, representing approximately 18% of net revenues. As Kevin mentioned, our football cleats business, led by our expanded Highlight offering, is off to a great start as we head into the heart of the buying season, and we continue to see traction in running led by our expanded UA Spine platform.", "Our Accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 30% to $51 million from $39 million in the prior year period. We continue to see strong results across our headwear line and are well positioned for back-to-school with our recent Tags [ph] relaunch.", "International net revenues increased 25% to $26 million in the second quarter and represented 6% of total net revenues highlighted by strong growth with our Latin American and European businesses.", "Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margins expanded 240 basis points to 48.3% compared with 45.9% in the prior year's quarter. Two primary factors drove this performance during the quarter: First, we continued to realize lower product input costs, primarily driven by North American Apparel and Accessories, which positively impacted gross margins by approximately 140 basis points.", "Second, our sales mix was more favorable year-over-year, including a lower mix of excess products sold through our Factory House channel and a lower proportion of wholesale Footwear sales. These factors helped contribute approximately 110 basis points to gross margin during the quarter.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 150 basis points to 41.2% in the second quarter of 2013 from 42.7% in the prior year's period. Details around the 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing costs decreased to 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter and 12.6% in the prior year period primarily driven by the timing of our first global marketing campaign for 2013, which was more concentrated during the first quarter. Second, selling costs increased to 11.3% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.5% in the prior year period primarily driven by the growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business. Third, product innovation and supply chain costs decreased to 10.2% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.7% in the prior year period primarily driven by leveraging personnel costs during the period. And finally, corporate services increased slightly to 9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior year period as we made incremental investments to support our International expansion efforts.", "Operating income during the second quarter increased to $32 million compared with $12 million in the prior year period. Operating margin expanded 390 basis points during the quarter to 7.1%.", "Our second quarter tax rate of 43% was unfavorable to the 38.9% rate in last year's period, primarily driven by the lapping of the state tax credit last year. In addition, reduced profitability overseas due to incremental investments in our International business and lower-than-planned contribution from our existing International businesses, due primarily to currency headwinds, adversely impacted our tax rate.", "Our net income increased to $18 million compared with $7 million in the prior year period. Second quarter diluted earnings per share increased to $0.16 compared to $0.06 last year.", "Now moving over to the balance sheet.", "Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 57% to $224 million compared with $143 million at June 30, 2012. Long-term debt, including current maturities, decreased to $55 million at quarter end from $74 million at June 30, 2012. Inventory at quarter end increased 29% year-over-year to $491 million compared to $381 million at June 30, 2012.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $22 million in the second quarter. We currently expect 2013 capital expenditures in the range of $85 million to $90 million, ahead of our prior guidance of the high end of $80 million to $85 million, with the increase reflecting a combination of incremental in-store shop-in-shop investments with key wholesale partners and a slightly higher-than-originally-planned Factory House store count.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2013. Our prior outlook called for 2013 net revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.23 billion, representing growth of 21% to 22%, and 2013 operating income of $256 million to $258 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. Based on our current visibility, we are raising our net revenues outlook to a range of $2.23 billion to $2.25 billion, representing growth of 22% to 23%. We are also raising our operating income outlook to a range of $258 million to $260 million, representing growth of 24% to 25%.", "Below operating results, we now expect a full year expected tax rate of 40% to 41% compared to our previous guidance range of 39% to 39.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding are still expected in the range of 108 million to 109 million.", "With our first half results in the books, we had several additional updates to how we see the back half of the year playing out. First, net revenues. Based on our prior guidance, we expected a slightly stronger net revenues growth rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter driven by the timing of back-to-school Footwear shipments and the sell-in from our new bag accessory line. Given current visibility, which includes bookings we have received for the fourth quarter, we now expect relatively similar net revenues growth rates in the third and fourth quarters.", "Second, gross margin. As we enter the back half of the year, we have 4 themes that we continue to see playing out. The product cost benefit from the first half of the year is not expected to continue in the back half of the year. We will lap last year's incremental air freight expenses, we will also lap last year's excess disposition strategy at our outlet stores and we are resourcing key products to more expensive but more reliable suppliers.", "In addition to these consistent themes, we have a few new factors that have recently come into play that impact the balance of the year. First, as a result of an ongoing customs audit, we are having discussions with Canadian officials regarding changes to the importation value methodology for goods imported into Canada. We are challenging many of the audit findings and there is uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and timing. However, changes in our existing methodology are expected to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit.", "Second, we are factoring into our plan the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, most notably with the weaker Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. These businesses are weighted to the back half of the year, particularly within our licensing relationship in Japan where approximately 2/3 of our royalty revenues in 2012 were generated in the second half of the year.", "We expect these new factors to offset some of the early-stage supply chain improvements that came in better than anticipated during the second quarter. Therefore, we still expect the full year gross margin rate to improve only modestly from the 47.9% level in 2012. Regarding the balance of the year, we now expect fairly consistent year-over-year gross margin declines in both the third and fourth quarters.", "Now our SG&A buckets. In marketing, we continue to see leverage in the third quarter, followed by a more consistent year-over-year rate of spending in the fourth quarter. We currently expect the full year marketing expense rate will be relatively comparable to the 11.2% rate in 2012.", "Combining our other 3 SG&A buckets, we expect expense leverage to occur in both the third and fourth quarters. Overall, we continue to expect a relatively consistent rate of consolidated SG&A spending for the full year, which will drive only modest operating margin expansion this year from the 11.4% level achieved in 2012.", "One final note on SG&A. Last month, at our Investor Day, we discussed our growth plans for 2015 and the pace of investments needed to support this growth. As such, we would expect to be opportunistic with any additional net revenues or gross margin upside to our plan during the duration of this year by reinvesting in SG&A to help support these growth initiatives in future years. For instance, we are taking advantage of some opportunities to enter new markets ahead of plan, including opening new subsidiaries in places like Brazil and Chile.", "Regarding our tax rate. As previously mentioned, we expect reduced profitability overseas due to incremental investments in our International business, and lower-than-planned contribution from our existing International business, due primarily to currency, will continue to adversely impact our tax rate. Thus, we now anticipate a full year effective tax rate in the range of 40% and 41%, ahead of our previous guidance of 39% to 39.5%.", "Finally, a few thoughts on inventory. We expect the inventory growth rate will peak in the third quarter primarily given the normalization of our fleet levels after last year's delivery challenges. By year end, we expect the inventory growth rate will be more in line with our net revenue growth rate.", "We would now like to open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "You talked a lot about international in your prepared remarks. I wanted to get your thoughts in terms of how those channels are developing. And if you see kind of the partners out there, at least on the wholesale side, that you can work with in some of these new markets? Or is DTC going to be a key factor there? And then also in the tax rate, does that play into the International piece? It came in a little bit higher, kind of you raised the tax rate guidance as well.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, well, I'll let Brad jump on the tax rate. But let me start with International. As you can hear, we're really excited about it. We think there's -- as I said, it's going to be our largest growth category next year, which will be somewhere north of 40% as we see it as a company. And again, it's off of a small base right now. It's only been 6%, 7% of our total revenues to-date, but it's something where we continue to get -- be involved in and gain confidence in the fact of what International can be. The way we evaluate the opportunities as a whole begins with the opportunities. So we're currently doing business in 61 markets today. When I say doing business really well, it means that a lot of times, we just have a rack of clothes and maybe a distributor. And so, we're really trying to professionalize that and really grab markets that we can make an impact in. So beginning, a, with the opportunity of where should we go based off GDP, things like that. Then we're looking at the return because we're not looking to make 15-year investments, although we have the ability to do that and we are, in some cases, but we understand that we also want to invest in markets that can return to us quickly. And then we're also looking at the market expertise. And that basically comes down to do we have the leader. It's the thing that took us to Japan back in 1999 or '98, and it's what is leading us and getting us so excited about markets like Brazil that I mentioned where we have nearly 50 years of experience. So what we're finding when we go to these markets, as we mentioned in Japan, we'll have 24 wholly owned stores there this year. So we like controlling our destiny because we're not in such an advantaged position. Sporting goods doesn't exist as cleanly as it does here in the States in the majority of the rest of the world. So we're having to be a lot more thoughtful and a lot more creative. And it means we're not taking one playbook into the new markets that we're attacking or going into. I mentioned Latin America. Charlie's expertise -- Charlie Maurath, our head of International, he understands that world and has it inside and out, which is why we're transitioning our Mexican distributor is a wholly owned subsidiary, in the first part of '14. It's the reason why we're getting behind and looking at markets like Chile, Argentina, Peru and making investments with things like the Colo-Colo football club that we have down there now and being really excited. And then also, places that you -- we're not talking as much about, things like Australia that we think is a great sport market for us and a place we can be really impactful. We're send -- we just sent a good, young leader down there to head up Australia for another wholly owned subsidiary for us. And then we also have some of our heritage businesses like Europe. We really believe that, A, we've got leadership in place. We believe that we've got momentum in Europe coming off the British Open. So forget some of the exposure that we saw there, forget we just launched our new kit with Tottenham, but we're really, I think, beginning a brand and beginning a relationship with the continent. And as you know, that takes one market at a time. If I can touch on China really quickly also. We've got 5 stores opened today. We'll have more than 8 by the end of 2013. We've got great leadership there in place and, again, just building that culture. So as we sit here in year 12 doing business in China, in year 3 selling things in China, we feel like we're finding our way. Now we just announced this morning also a new partnership with Gigasport that opened product -- and the early read on product in -- we weren't selling product in Hong Kong. We've had a sourcing office there, a liaison office there for nearly a decade. And the product is doing very well in the early reads that we're seeing. And more importantly, it's a very balanced approach between Apparel and Footwear, which is some of other advantages that we get of introducing ourselves to consumer not just as an apparel company but as a true head-to-toe athletic brand. And then finally, if I can, just on Japan. Our partners, as I mentioned, they continue to do a great job. It begins with leadership. And our partner, [indiscernible], who runs our business there with Dome Corporation, and they continue to drive Under Armour. Again, we see their business up closing on 30% this year. And that's a -- it's a challenging market, but it's one, I think, where Under Armour has continued to separate itself from the fashion side as well as from the -- with this true sport authentic piece. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Omar, on the tax side, obviously the U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world, which is unfortunate in general but especially for us, where approximately 90% of our revenues are generated at this point. The opportunity for us to have a lower tax rate is really to increase our global footprint. And the good news here is we've invested a lot of time and money over the last 5-or-so years implementing a really sound international tax structure. The good news is the structure is in place, it's ready to go. That's behind us. So there's really 2 ways for Under Armour to generate profits overseas going forward, which inherently would be taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S. One is the sourcing structure we have. And we have physical presence overseas and substance overseas that provides a lot of crucial product development and supply chain support to deliver our products to our customers. We do have some of the structure in place, and we have already seen some of the benefits of that structure in our current tax rates. But the bigger piece probably is just profitable International business from top to bottom overseas. Again, roughly 90% U.S. based, we really don't have this yet. And this is really the longer-term opportunity is for us. A larger proportion of not only revenues but a larger proportion of profits overseas will be the ability for us to see a more favorable tax rate. Since we're clearly in investment mode right now in the International front, the profitable piece of this business is longer term, and that's why you're seeing a tax rate benefit also to be longer term for us relative to that. So basically, if you look at the tax rate for us, as our profits overseas increase, our tax rate should benefit, being taxed in lower-rate jurisdictions. And on the flip side, if our overseas profits decline, this would hurt our tax rate as a higher proportion of our income would be taxed in the U.S. This is kind of evident this year when we talked about in prepared remarks of the recent acceleration of investments in Latin America and our FX exposure to our Japanese licensing business, both reducing near-term profits overseas, was the reason why we saw our tax rate kind of uptick this year. But longer term, again, as we expand our International business and become more profitable longer term, that should have an obvious benefit to our tax rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions, first for Brad. I don't recall you talking about discounts and allowances for a while in your gross margin discussion. Could you just remind us where fill rates have been trending through the first half of the year maybe compared to last year and sort of what your expectation is there as we go forward into the back half?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Mitch, on the fill rate side, the trends have been pretty positive. Still not where we want to see them be, but they're trending very positively compared to last year. So we had fill rates in the back half of last year, especially by customer request date as low as in the 60s, in the low 60s at some point in the back half of last year. And even by cancellation date, that improved maybe into those low 80s as a percentage for fill rates for kind of our seasonal product. Our AR items last year were probably bolstered to a 90% fill rate, especially in the back half of the year. What we've seen with the trending so far in the front half of this year is much better fill rates. Still again not where we want them to be, but right now, as we look at the second quarter of '13, our fill rates on -- by cancellation are kind of more closer to 80%. So up from the low 60s last year to closer to 80% this year. And then, by cancellation date, we're in the 90s on seasonal product, which, again, we were in the low 80s last year. And on the AR side of our business, a lot of the replenishment side of our business, we're into the mid-90s now. So definitely seen the positive trends from last year to this year. Still have a little bit of work to do there to get where we want to get, which the goal is to kind of have the overall both those metrics kind of in that 90% to 95% range by customer request date. And so we've got some work to go. As far as discounts and allowances go, we've talked a little bit about that in the past. And then obviously, we're seeing less of an impact on that right now with fill rates trending in the positive direction. We're not really seeing any negative impact to discounts and allowances. And positive impact, for the most part, is in our numbers and in our guidance and it's relatively small at this point in time.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And second question, can you just -- as far as your guidance for the back half of the year, your sales guidance, is there a sort of underlying weather assumption that, that is based on? I mean, are you expecting sort of similar weather to a year ago or better weather or normal winter? And then kind of with that as a backdrop, how are you thinking about reorders and maybe your -- the comp on your own stores in terms of kind of what's embedded in your back half outlook?", "Brad Dickerson", "Back half outlook, for the most part, if you look at kind of our Q3 and Q4, not really seeing a lot of changes in our Q3 outlook in revenue relative to our previous guidance. What we have seen is a little bit of more favorability to our bookings on the wholesale side in the back half of the year, especially as we get into Q4. And some of that also -- that Q4 strength is being driven by the fact that we are making some additional investments in shop-in-shops at especially Dick's Sporting Goods, which will have -- most of those will be in place by the fourth quarter and therefore have some impact to the fourth quarter. And this higher outlet store count we talked about will really come into play in the fourth quarter and not the third quarter also. So some of what you're seeing is kind of the nuances of the Q3, Q4. Q3 story is pretty much the same as our previous guidance. Q4 is a little bit higher because of some of the visibility we have around our bookings and also some of the things we've done in the investment side in, in-store shops-in-shops and outlets -- and the outlet side. As far as the weather goes, we really kind of take a point to look at last year's weather and use that as a predictor for this year's weather. So for the most part in our businesses, I believe, whether it's wholesale, retail, e-commerce, we are reflecting in our guidance a similar weather pattern in the end of Q3, Q4 this year that we saw last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually just one question. I was hoping that maybe, Kevin, you could talk a little bit more about the 4 business. So the Spine is -- has done well, Speed is being well received. How should we think about the timing of a more significant ramp-up in Under Armour's sneaker business? And what are the puts and takes on that happening faster or slower? And then remind us how you're seeing gross margins in the 4 business being impacted by the growth of sneakers and whether that's coming through as expected or better than expected.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. I think if we take a second on Footwear. I want to be clear, we're certainly not declaring victory by any stretch. But we certainly have a lot of things that are moving in the right direction, which give us an incredible amount of confidence that we can be as important in Footwear as we are in Apparel. And so it begins -- you mentioned Spine. I agree. It was a $100 platform we began with and we've worked that price point now to where -- somewhere between $90 to $110 depending on the style and where we are with the product. But it's been very well received. More importantly, we're beginning to build some legacy, where the consumer knows what to expect. They can start asking and having an anticipation of what the Spine product is going to be. And these are things that just take time, so we're very fortunate to start figuring it out. And I think all this groundwork is very laid as we look at our 7-year heritage that we have in the cleated business. So the reason that we point -- we make such a big deal about Highlight and the success that we're seeing there, our partners at Eastbay through Foot Locker and between Ken and Dick and the leadership they have there and taking the best that they have on us in cleated footwear as well as the way that, that's translated in some of the running products that we have through their doors, I think we're really encouraged by the signs that we're seeing. I think we've been thoughtful about the size of the allotments that we're giving and the allocation that we're giving to consumers, and I think we're rightsizing it as well. There's 3 big stories that we have. So Spine is obviously a big story. It's doing really well. It's a good, solid shoe for us that's out there and something that we're going to come back in through the balance of '13 and into '14. The Highlight cleat is something which is really -- it's innovative, it's different looking. It's working for the athlete. And it's something which is a real differentiator for our brand. And it fits with our brand and it is a great product at $100-plus price point. It is something which is unique for us. The last is SpeedForm, and SpeedForm, for us, it puts us on a completely different level. We've talked about our success in football and baseball and gaining massive market share in baseball this year. I think we're -- we'll see where things shake out with football, but we see really strong gains in football market share as well. But SpeedForm is something where, when we target and we put a 0 on what running can be for us, we need to be impactful and we need to be differentiated. And SpeedForm really gives us that. I mean, it's a product that's -- it's built in a bra factory. And what that means is that it's a group of people that have been on this product throughout the last 3 years that really understand fit and really taking a different approach to the way that the shoe has been made. We went through a lot of detail at Investor Day here to take you through SpeedForm, and it's fun watching it hit the market, again, in very small pairs, but something that gives a great indication of what '14 is going to bring when we roll it out in a much bigger way. But there's a lot of things for us to consider here, from making product in a new factory and capacity issues and a few other things. So we're going to be smart. We're going to be prudent. We're not going to try to do -- accomplish everything in just the next 12 months, but we think that we have a real platform, a real franchise business that we'll be able to build off of for a long time and we'll be able to take this in a lot of different directions as well.", "Brad Dickerson", "And Robbie, on the gross margin side, I guess Footwear for us kind of globally right now, our Footwear margins are at -- say, they're in the low 30s. And obviously, our ability to get to where we think we should be, probably closer to 40, maybe low 40s in the longer term, is really going to be driven by a couple of things: one being the mix of our Footwear between cleated and not cleated; and two, our ability to continue to innovate, like Kevin has spoken of, and also to produce footwear efficiently. If you look at our mix, first on the mix side, our mix today still is heavily weighted towards cleated versus non-cleated relative to a lot of other players out there. Obviously, that cleated side of our business is really, really important to our overall Footwear business from an authenticity perspective and credibility perspective, but it does come at the lowest of low margins in Footwear. So with our mix being more weighted towards cleated, that obviously impacts our overall Footwear gross margins. Over time, though, as we are able to grow our non-cleated Footwear business, specifically things like running, which we've been recently doing, we have the ability -- those are -- those commit better margins, and that should help our mix going forward, gross margins in Footwear as we sell more non-cleated footwear. And every indication is things like the Spine platform that we have and also SpeedForm that Kevin spoke of are all things that are heading in the right direction for us relative to margins that could impact mix. And obviously, just how we produce efficiently, too, the ability for us to keep gaining competencies and capabilities in the sourcing side, the product development side will internally help us do things better and produce things in a much better fashion and have an impact towards margins, too. So again, low 30s right now. We do see ourselves over the long term working our way towards more of that 40-ish to low 40s gross margin in Footwear. That will take up the ability to -- first to scale well in the non-cleated side to do that, produce things more efficiently internally. Also, I want to make sure we keep going back to the fact that even though gross margins in Footwear in the 40% to low 40s will still be below our Apparel, that when you look at the whole business model of Footwear longer term, even though you have lower gross margins with those higher price points, Footwear does give you the ability to scale and leverage in SG&A in a better fashion and that operating margin business model in the longer term should look pretty similar on the Footwear and Apparel side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I just want to understand the gross margin comment, Brad, a little bit in the back half. It sounds like the guidance is pointing to about 40 basis points of compression and I'd like to make sure and directionally thinking about it correctly and then understand what's changed in your thinking a little bit here. And maybe to start with, can you talk -- maybe you can just talk a little bit about second quarter gross margins, and what are all the input costs, the product cost leverage came from the quarter. If I look back to last year, it was a slight headwind in the second quarter. But certainly, the 140 basis point upside you pointed is well ahead of what we're expecting. So maybe a little bit on the components there?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, mix didn't really play a part there. So we had some positive and some negative mix. So that really wasn't a play as much as far as channel mix goes that is. When you look at the 2 components that really drove Q2, it's pretty split between what I'd say is some better-than-expected supply chain efficiencies relative to freight, and that's both freight in from a -- the ability for us to reduce our exposure to air freight in Q2 and also freight out to customers on some early wins we've had there. So I'd say about half of what I would say is the upside benefit we saw in Q2 versus expectation was just from those types of things in the supply chain side. And the other half, I would say, is more on the product cost side in general. A couple things there. One is there was a -- the need from the customers to -- on the bag side of our business, which we were -- I've been talking about relaunching this year for back-to-school. A lot of our customers really wanted to get those bags on the floor early because it was a relaunch as we get into Q3, and those come at much better margins year-over-year. So there was a little bit of an earlier shipment on the bag side a little bit that had a good positive impact on margins. And also, just on the costing side, truthfully costing is an area that kind of worked against us from a product mix perspective, not necessarily a channel mix. But from a product mix, it has tended to be a little unfavorable for us over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters. So we've been pretty careful in how we forecast that impact in our plan for Q2 and go forward. And we saw a little bit of a positive impact in Q2 that helped us, too, just from a product mix perspective. So some higher-margin product selling versus lower-margin product. So those are really the impacts on the second quarter, as far as you go -- going forward into the second half of the year, again what we talked about here was some impact, some things that are consistent. We are going to be resourcing some product, especially on the Fleece side. We talked about this over the few quarters. That resourcing will come at a little bit of a worse gross margin for us. But obviously, it gives us a lot more confidence in delivery and delivering to the top line. And that will have a pretty significant impact year-over-year in the back half of the year in the product cost side. So those benefits you see in the product cost side in the front half won't be there in the back half. In fact, it might flip around on you a little bit in the back half of because of that resourcing. Still do see some upside year-over-year in airfreight, which we saw in Q2. We will continue to see that in the back half of the year. And we do still see that Factory House mix working in our favor year-over-year, where we pushed a lot of excess through last year. So this year, especially in the fourth quarter, so you have a little more upside there from the Factory House mix perspective. And then obviously, we talked about some of these new things, the impact of the yen currency, which is, for us, a pure licensing profit business. So that does impact gross margin if that reduces our revenues in the licensing side. And obviously there's a little bit of an uncertainty on the Canadian duty side, factoring that into our guidance, that uncertainty. And that'll offset some of the other upsides we talked about.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just directionally, as the -- you said airfreight will be a positive. Is it -- will airfreight, to the magnitude that it -- you thought it will be, will it still be about the same tailwind for you in the back half of the year as -- is what you're planning when we talked to you last time, Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, it is. So I think we pretty much anticipated the airfreight and the supply chain initiatives to start kicking in, in the back half of the year. The reality is they kicked in about a quarter early on us. So it was a Q2 upside, but we had anticipated some of these initiatives have been benefiting the back half of the year already, so that's not a change really.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "But if we add it all up, it doesn't seem like some of the supply chain efficiencies that you talked about in the second quarter are flowing through into the back half. Is that -- or am I missing something on that?", "Brad Dickerson", "They're definitely flowing through. So again, the impact in the back half of the year for especially airfreight is where most of these supply chain issues show up. It is very similar benefit as we talked about earlier in the last earnings call. It's that resourcing piece, I think, you got to look at and say, the resourcing of cleats, which is a very big product line for us in the back half of the year, obviously, resourcing that's going to have a negative impact.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pamela Quintiliano with SunTrust.", "Pamela Nagler Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, just want to follow up on International. Understandably, you're tremendously excited about it. If you could just talk us through the brand awareness within some of the larger regions and where you think there is the most opportunity with what Under Armour represents to the local customer versus what you think the product can be for them and then where you potentially have the biggest hurdles?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think we're still establishing ourselves. The one thing about International and probably lessons learned over the last 17 or 18 years was that any of these things just take time. And I think a longer view is the way that we need to approach any of these markets. I use the story of Japan a lot in sort of articulating how long it takes to -- 8 years from 0 to $35 million, and then it was year 9 that they went from $35 million to $72 million and I think the tipping point really occurred. So I don't know if that model -- even with larger scale, larger size, more resources, things that we have today going for us, it still comes back to an investment, and it's a prudent model. So I don't see where we just want to pour money in and really looking for losses. We can't really afford to do that either. So either drive with brand messaging, but we need to do it at a local and a grassroots level where -- letting people find about us. Opening Brazil, for instance, is probably a -- it's a great example where we're walking into a market that's got a tremendous amount of hype and excitement around it -- what we're looking at is the World Cup. And we played with the idea of how big do we need in China to keep up with the Joneses, but that's not what you're going to find from us. And our approach to Brazil has been -- let's attack World Cup in '14 and we need to be ready for Olympics in '16. And of course, we've got a great team over there on the ground literally with a pro running the office in Marcelo and the team that we have there. Who have done this and been in our industry and our business before, but we need to make sure that they've got the time and the resources to really be impactful, is that we don't want to be here today and gone tomorrow. So we want to start with the grassroots, the local approach. And not doing things too differently. And so each market will have its own nuance, but I think you'll see us recognize where we are, is that people have maybe heard of our brand or they've seen us before or maybe they've seen it online, but it also gives us the ability to take a different approach where e-commerce can play a much different role as we look to bring ourself and enter into these new markets. And so we're not just looking for traditional bricks and mortar, but we understand that we need to establish and we really need to do a lot of explaining as to who our brand is. A great story for this is actually a concept we're opening up in Shanghai next month -- or, I'm sorry, in September. And it's called the Under Armour experience. And it basically is -- it's not only just saying we're going to open a store so we can sell product to the Chinese market, but we really want to bring something to China. And the gift that we want to give them is what does it feel like and what is it like to be an athlete. And so this store is about 80% experience of what does it feel like to be in the middle of the pitch at White Hart Lane with Tottenham or what does it mean to feel like you're in the ring with Canelo Alvarez and what does it mean to feel like being on a court with Brandon Jennings and Kemba Walker and DeAndre in our basketball assets. And so there's a lot of education that goes on with it. The philosophy that we've taken as a company is that we've got a great U.S. business, a great North American business that is driving and creating profit for us, and we understand that there's a balance between our ability to utilize, I think, our North American growth and cash creation, of making prudent investments in a longer-term strategy of being a global brand. As I've mentioned all along, our definition of global is when more than half of our revenues will come from outside of the United States, and there's a lot of reasons for that. Number one, the opportunity. Our brand translates. The consumer is asking for it in other markets. And so we need to do a good job of making sure that we do that in a prudent way that's very Under Armour. And then also, as Brad said, there's a lot of strategic reasons for it as well. And we're not going to make decisions based on tax rates, but the fact is that there's a lot of things that can help us by being a more impactful and bigger global brand. So the challenge is there, the second half of your question. You're starting a brand-new conversation. You're building a brand-new relationship. And so these things again. The best news that I can say, hopefully, from a more prudent, maybe a little more seasoned company, and it spring [ph] certainly from my perspective, is that we recognize it's not going to happen in 2 or 3 years. And if we get lucky in a market and it catches fire, great, but it's going to take 6, 8 and 10 years and we're sitting here telling you that we expect to be around for that much time and more. And we're going to make the investments that'll help us be great and be a global brand.", "Pamela Nagler Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up. The Shanghai store, is that something, if it works out well, you would anticipate doing in other regions? Does it...", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, completely. Now it's expensive, and so there's definitely -- I'm getting eyes over here. But it's going to be the first experience that we have. So again, it's 80% experience and the last 20% is a very focused assortment of this is the world's greatest shoe and you'll have the SpeedForm product. This is the world's greatest t-shirt, you'll see, one of our Tech Tees or Charged Cottons. So we want to be very focused because a lot of people come in and they can get overwhelmed by a brand. So I think the key to any great brand is having a point of view. So we're going to sell with a point of view that when someone walks in and says, well [ph], I really understand, a, what it's like to be an athlete; and b, Under Armour's interpretation of what being an athlete is like and that these are the products that they endorse, this is the world's greatest t-shirt, this is the world's greatest shoe. So we're going to keep it very simplistic and very easy for the consumer to understand. And then we're going to be driving people to our e-commerce website in China as well, as well as back to our other full-line retail stores that we have in the market. So we're going to learn a lot. Look, I think -- the most important thing to International is that we're going to test a lot of different things, of having good, smart, thoughtful people on the ground, which we have in China, which we have in Brazil, which we have in Australia, which we have in Europe, which we have across the globe. And so we're fortunate -- which we have in Mexico. So we're very fortunate to have those. We're going to focus on those key markets, that, again, with having the right leader in the chair. And then we're going to invest behind them, and we think we can generate some heat and a lot of energy. So a lot of exciting things to come from us on a global front for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My questions are for Brad this morning. Brad, with your SG&A comments today around 2016, I just wanted to make sure that, that wasn't different than what you had said at the Investor Day. Or was it just further clarification that you're going to be using upside to revenues to put towards SG&A?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Kate, further clarification really. So I think in Investor Day, we were pretty articulate around the pace of operating margin improvement between last year and 2016 basically, and why that pace and the importance of us to invest to support the growth that we talked about at Investor Day. So I think part of it, yes, was just reiterating what we said at Investor Day was the fact that we're going to look and be opportunistic with any upside we see in our business to either accelerate or support all those growth initiatives we talked about at Investor Day. And this is, I think, another example of what we're doing here in the back half of this year, the ability to enter the markets in Brazil and Chile and Latin America, a little bit of a quicker pace than we originally planned, the ability for us to do that because we're seeing some upside in revenue in the back half of this year. So we're going to do that.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second question, just to follow up on the revenue growth question from earlier, with the improved visibility with the wholesale ordering, is that coming from incremental distribution or the new incremental distribution to the department stores and how much they contribute to the revenue growth?", "Brad Dickerson", "No, we're seeing it across-the-board, really. It's not really a distribution strength as much as it is just in general across the board. Bookings are coming in a little better than we anticipated. Again, I don't want to also downplay some of the things that we've done and we've controlled here by investing some -- into extra [ph] shop-in-shop, also with Dick's Sporting Goods and also higher [indiscernible] store counts. So those are investment decisions we made that are also impacting the back half and their revenues, too.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "All right, thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting to you our third quarter 2013 results, which tentatively have been scheduled for Thursday, October 24, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us today's third quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the event on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us for today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter, provide an update to our 2013 outlook and introduce a preliminary 2014 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. From our very first day of existence, Under Armour has been about making athletes better. Executing against that promise in 1996 had its own set of challenges, but they're dwarfed by the complexity of running a global brand with over $2 billion of revenues. Our consumers' expectations shift constantly higher and they count on their favorite brands to consistently take them some place new. The company that we are building to deliver on that promise is in constant evolution. We are a different company every 6 months. Our consumer moves quickly and fortunately, so does Under Armour.", "Today, I want to discuss that evolution. How it's manifesting itself in product innovations like SpeedForm and ColdGear Infrared with emerging athletes like Stephen Curry and Jordan Spieth, and new retail experiences in Shanghai and New York City. All key elements of our growth story, yet all of them have already become important Under Armour stories in the past few months.", "So while this evolution is taking place throughout our organization, I want to talk today about 4 areas of our business where our focus is helping generate growth in 2013 and beyond. First, I will cover how we will be more integrated than ever when it comes to telling our brand stories. We will have our product communications and retail presentation aligned unlike anything we've done in the past, aggressively bringing our consumers into retail at key points during the year.", "The second area is around innovation and how will we innovate, not only do we win with consumers, but we drive an industry-leading pricing model. Because wherever we show up in regional sporting goods, urban department stores or our new retail experience in Shanghai, we are a premium brand. That premium status comes from our ability to innovate and that innovation enables us to drive that pricing power.", "Third, we are winning with America's Youth as we continue to resonate at the highest level with our youngest consumer. Apparel continues to drive our youth numbers, but we have had solid momentum in Footwear as well, a great indicator of a long-term equity we are building in our brand.", "And fourth, our team is constantly evolving as well. I will talk to you today about some new additions to our senior leadership and some other moves we are making to become a more globally focused organization.", "And most importantly, we are doing this as we grow our business at an industry-leading pace. This was our 14th consecutive quarter with net revenue growth of 20-plus percent and our 16th consecutive quarter with Apparel growth of 20%-plus. Our core is strong and that gives us the firepower to grow in new geographies with new categories and new consumers.", "So the first topic. How could we better integrate our products, communications, in the presentation of our brand to consumers. Clearly, it starts with product. And as I said in our last call, the pipeline of innovation at Under Armour has never been more robust. Our ColdGear Infrared just hit retail in Q3 and it's off to a great start. This latest innovation utilizes ceramic thermo-conductive inner coating to absorb and retain body heat. This industry-leading technology provides warmth without the weight and enables us to bring our consumer apparel that exceeds their expectations around cold-weather protection.", "In Footwear, our big story for 2014 is SpeedForm. We are bringing the Under Armour Footwear when customers have come to expect from our Apparel. Innovation around fit, and we're bringing that innovation to the world of Footwear by not making these shoes in traditional Footwear factories, but in bra factories that understand the importance of fit.", "With innovations like these, our challenge is to align our communications and how we show up at retail for maximum impact with our consumer. We started that effort this year with our 3 Brand Holidays, the third of which will hit next month with athletes like Olympian, Lindsey Vonn; Freeskier, Bobby Brown; and the lock for PGA Rookie of the Year, Jordan Spieth, who will help us tell a great story around ColdGear Infrared. And no story that Under Armour in the outdoors would be complete without an appearance by our friends from Duck Dynasty.", "In 2014, we will take an even more integrated approach to our brand holidays with greater focus on key products and a more extensive effort with our retail partners designed to drive traffic in to their stores at key points throughout the year. That greater integration will also be on display at our Brand House here in Baltimore, at our newest store in Tysons Corner that we announced earlier this week and the next evolution of Under Armour retail, our store in Manhattan that we will open in spring of 2014.", "Combined with our New York office that is opening early next year, this new retail space in SoHo will give us a meaningful presence in the city and enable us to bring a local Under Armour story to New Yorkers and the millions of tourists that make their way there as well.", "Just a week ago, I was in Shanghai for the opening of the Under Armour experience. A first-of-its-kind retail theater featuring an immersed multi-dimensional video experience that combines the high energy of our brand with our commitment to telling authentic athlete stories.", "The experience in Shanghai's brand new Jing An Kerry Center on Nanjing road is connected to our branded store with curated assortment of Under Armour's best Apparel and Footwear technologies.", "One of our big goals with this new retail experience is to help educate our Chinese consumer on what it's like to be an athlete. In order to do that, we had to break the traditional model a bit. While most retailers more like 80% product and 20% storytelling, we flipped that and are really concentrating on storytelling as a primary focus of the store. You enter to a red carpet, through an illuminated hallway and are greeted by a video image of Michael Phelps, who's your host and guest trainer. He leads you through a series of vignettes that define the will of an athlete, including a training session with NBA star Brandon Jennings, rooftop yoga in Shanghai, and the exhilaration of running out on the pitch before a match at White Hart Lane, the home of Tottenham Hotspur.", "The second piece I wanted to cover was how our innovation agenda enables us to win with consumers and drive a powerful pricing model. Our strategy is fairly simple. Wherever it is that we show up as a brand, our goal is to be best-in-class. Whether it's at our national sporting goods partners or regional ones like Scheels and Dunham's Sports. Our innovation agenda is what enables us to be the premium brand at that retail destination.", "So when we have success with the ColdGear Infrared long sleeves at $50 or woven stretch capri at $55, it reinforces our promise to deliver that best-in-class innovation to our consumer. We saw great evidence of that in Q3 where our average selling price grew by 5% in Apparel alone. We believe our ability to continually innovate for our consumer and the pricing power that comes along with it is a key element of our growth story and one that helps separate Under Armour from our competitors.", "The third thing I wanted to cover was our success with the Youth athlete, where as we refer to them, Next. Our continued strong growth in Youth is prime evidence of our ability to make that emotional connection with the young athlete, both on and off the field of play. We are winning with Youth in both Boys' and Girls' and it's not just in our core Apparel where we would expect to be strong.", "Our Youth Footwear business is extremely strong, and we anticipate that strength continuing in 2014. One great indicator is that in categories like basketball where we are performing very well in authentic distribution with a slightly older consumer and we are making great strides in the category with our Youth consumer as well.", "And like we laid out in our Investor Day this past June, our focus when it comes to Under Armour athletes is all about Next. So we partner with a great up and coming athletes like Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, we're connecting with the hardcore athlete who knows he set the NBA record for 3-pointers made this past season and a 12-year old kid in New York who remembers him dropping 50 on the Kicks on his last visit to the garden.", "It's athletes like Stephen, Jordan Spieth, Bryce Harper, Cam Newton and Sloane Stephens, none of them over 25 years old that help us connect with our young consumers and challenge us to raise our product development game up to their level.", "So fourth and final piece for me today is about our team. A team that is evolving from within but also adding a new dimension to our leadership with experience from the outside. First, the internal piece. Kip Fulks, currently our COO, is adding the new title President of Product. In his extended role, he will now directly oversee the design and development of all product, including Apparel, as well as our supply chain and information technology areas.", "Henry Stafford who has served as Senior Vice President Apparel since joining Under Armour will take on the role of President of North America. In his newly created position, Henry will be responsible for our North American wholesale business, retail marketing, global retail and global E-Commerce.", "Working together, Kip and Henry will drive an integrated product and merchandising strategy that will ensure we remain focused on growing our core business here in North America while providing a foundation for the product merchandising and retail development to help Charlie Maurath drive our business outside of North America.", "In addition to Kip's and Henry's new responsibilities, we've elevated Matt Mirchin for the new position of Executive Vice President of Global Marketing. Matt, Kip and Henry all embody the Under Armour culture and I'm confident in their proven ability to lead.", "In addition to these appointments from within, we are adding 2 new members to our senior leadership team. Susie McCabe is joining Under Armour as Senior Vice President of Global Retail. She comes to us from Ralph Lauren with extensive retail management experience. Also joining the team is Jason LaRose as Senior Vice President of Global E-Commerce. Jason joins Under Armour from Express and will oversee our online consumer experience and drive our web business strategy. In their new positions, both Susie and Jason will report to Henry.", "So I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Brad Dickerson, but I want you to know that there are multiple other areas of our business where we are working with just as much intensity as the 4 areas I focused on today. We will continue to be a growth company in constant evolution on all fronts. We will use our brand momentum here in the U.S. to fuel our global ambition. We will stake out a new position with today's athletic female, and we will become a more digitally relevant brand for our consumer in the next 12 months, and there will be much more. As I said earlier, we are a growth company, and one that is focused on our future but delivering results now.", "With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I now like to spend some time discussing our third quarter financial results followed by our updated outlooks for 2013 and preliminary thoughts on 2014.", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2013 increased 26% to $723 million. Apparel grew 26% to $561 million during the quarter from $445 million the prior year, representing our 16th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category.", "In Apparel, we continue to perform best when we deliver newness and innovation to the consumer, a powerful dynamic that helped drive average selling prices of approximately 5% higher during the quarter. Apparel results benefited from new innovations like the recently introduced ColdGear Infrared technology, expanded platforms in areas such as Storm and Charged Cotton and enhanced design across both legacy and new offerings.", "From a product category standpoint, while training remains our largest category and drove majority of the dollar growth, we experienced strong growth rates in our running, hunting and mountain categories across genders. We also continue to see momentum in our Women's Studio line, as well as significant growth across our Youth business.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 34% for the quarter, representing approximately 25% of net revenues compared to approximately 24% in the prior year period. In our retail business, we opened 6 new Factory House stores during the third quarter, increasing our North American Factory House store base to 112, up 17% from 96 locations at the end of last year's third quarter.", "We currently expect to open 4 additional Factory House stores during the remainder of the year, bringing our total door count to 116. We're also on track to expand 9 existing locations in 2013 as part of our efforts to better service demand with our broader assortment in areas such as Footwear and Women's.", "Looking at our full price Brand House stores, we continue to see positive results in our store in Baltimore and we'll open our second location at Tysons Corner near Washington, D.C. in early November.", "Our story in our E-Commerce business remains consistent year-to-date. Strong results driven in part by positive trends in average order value given our improved inventory positioning across the channel.", "Third quarter Footwear net revenues increased 28% to $81 million from $63 million in the prior year, representing just over 11% of net revenues. Running Footwear remains the largest contributor to growth with continued expansion of UA Spine and improved penetration across wholesale. We also concluded successful football season with Fleece led by our expanded highlight lines where we continue to take market share.", "Our Accessories net revenue during the third quarter increased 18% to $64 million from $54 million in the prior year period led by strong year-over-year gains in both headwear and bags. International net revenues increased 38% to $44 million in the third quarter and represented 6% of total net revenues headed by strong growth in our Europe and Asia regions.", "Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins contracted 30 basis points to 48.4% compared with 48.7% in the prior year quarter. Two primary factors contributed to this decline during the quarter. First, we experienced a higher U.S. import duty exposure on certain products imported in prior periods, which will identify and reserved for during the quarter, negatively impacting gross margins by approximately 90 basis points.", "In addition, as expected, product costs were also impacted by the resourcing of fleece to more reliable but higher cost suppliers negatively impacting gross margin to be approximately 30 basis points. Partially offsetting these growth margin headwinds, ongoing supply chain enhancements contributes a lower Apparel sales discount, and allowances and air freight expenses, benefiting gross margins by approximately 70 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues levers 120 basis points to 31.7% in the third quarter of 2013 from 32.9% in the prior year's period. Details are on the 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: First, marketing costs decreased to 10.3% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.4% in the prior year period primarily driven by the planned timing of our global marketing campaign this year, as well as overall expense leverage given our top line performance; second, selling costs increased to 8.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.9% in the prior year period primarily driven by the growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business; third, product innovation and supply chain costs decreased to 7.3% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.5% in the prior year period, primarily driven by a shift from a third party distribution facility in California last year to a consolidated in-house facility this year; and finally, corporate services decreased modestly to 6% of net revenues for the quarter from 6.1% in the prior year period.", "Operating income during the third quarter increased 33% to $121 million compared with $91 million in the prior year period. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points during the quarter to 16.7%. Our third quarter tax rate of 39.4% was unfavorable to 36.1% rate in last year's period primarily driven by a lapping of state tax credit last year and a higher levels of investments -- international investment this year.", "Our net income increased 27% to $73 million compared with $57 million in the prior year period. Third quarter diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $0.58 compared to $0.54 last year.", "Now moving over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter end increased 19% to $186 million compared to $157 million at September 30, 2012. Long-term debt, including current maturities decreased to $54 million at quarter end from $72 million at September 30, 2012.", "Inventory at quarter end increased 59% year-over-year to $497 million compared to $312 million at September 30, 2012. As previously discussed, the normalization of our fleece levels following last year's delivery challenges was a significant driver of a higher inventory growth rate during the third quarter. In addition, we have moved some capacity back to certain suppliers after last year's challenges. In effort to help move capacity with our suppliers we have brought in some products earlier than otherwise planned.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $23 million for the third quarter. We currently expect 2013 capital expenditures of approximately $95 million ahead of our prior guidance at the high end of $85 million to $90 million, with the incremental investments driven by international supply chain initiatives and domestic retail.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2013. Our prior outlook called for 2013 net revenues of $2.23 billion to $2.25 billion representing growth of 22% to 23%, and 2013 operating income of $258 million to $260 million, representing growth of 24% to 25%. Based on our current visibility, we are raising our net revenues outlook to approximately $2.26 billion, representing growth of 23%. We are also updating our operating income outlook to approximately $260 million representing growth of 25%.", "Total operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of 40% to 41%, while our full year fully diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 108 million, which is at the low end of our prior range of 108 million to 109 million. We have several additional updates pertaining to guidance for the balance of the year. First, on net revenue. As we have previously outlined we continue to plan our business assuming comparable weather year-over-year. Due to a significant shift in the timing of shipments, we also expect minimal growth in both Footwear and International during the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to gross margin. We expect the year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter of approximately 50 basis points with the factors driving this decline consistent with those outlined in the last quarter's call. The positive factors include ongoing supply chain improvements following last year's delivery challenges and lapping last year's excess disposition strategy at our outlet stores. The negative factors include more expensive resourcing of key products and FX impact on our licensing revenue stream from Japan and the impact in the previously discussed change in our Canadian import duty methodology. While we have a lot of moving parts for the quarter, we still expect the full year gross margin rate to improve modestly from the 47.9% level in 2012.", "Switching over to SG&A. In marketing, based on the year-to-date spending trends and leverage from higher revenues, we now expect the full year marketing expense rate will be closer to 10.8% compared to last year's 11.2% rate. Looking at the other 3 SG&A buckets in aggregate, we expect expense de-leverage during the fourth quarter given higher incentive compensation levels and ongoing investments to support our global growth initiatives. Overall, although we now expect a slight increase in consolidated SG&A spending rates for the full year, we still expect to achieve a modest operating margin expansion from the 11.4% level achieved in 2012.", "As we indicated last quarter, we remain opportunistic with any additional net revenues or gross margin upside to our plan during the fourth quarter by reinvesting in SG&A to help support our growth initiatives in future years. That's why we expect more ability to improve our operating dollars in the event of better than planned results and not operating margin.", "Finally, a little more color on inventory. The same factors that impacted the third quarter are expected to persist in the fourth quarter. However, we expect the inventory growth rate will ease sequentially in the fourth quarter but remain higher than sales growth.", "Before we turn over for Q&A, we'd also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2014. Based on our current visibility, we anticipate 2014 net revenues and operating income to be at the lower end of our long-term growth targets of 20% to 25%. I would emphasize that our focus remain to drive higher operating income dollar growth, balanced with making the right investments to drive our long term global success.", "We wanted to outlined 2 preliminary factors to consider for 2014. For net revenues, we expect accelerated growth rates for Footwear and International with most significant growth impact for each expected to incur in the first and fourth quarters. For gross margins, we expect modest full year gain driven by ongoing supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable sales mix. As has been our custom, as we finish up the current year and get more clarity on next year, we will provide more color on 2014 during our fourth quarter earnings call in January.", "We'd now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Matt McClintock of Barclays.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So, Kevin, I was just wondering if you could drill down more into the Women's business. The improvements of the product that you've made in the fall, what you're seeing there specifically? And then if we could actually extrapolate that into what you're doing with the Studio shop-in-shop, and how you think about using that to potentially transform what -- traditionally hasn't been a place for women to shop, the sporting goods channel to actually draw women to that channel?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Great. So I want to say this remains a tremendous opportunity we think for the brand. And as we stated all along, we believe that Women's has the potential to be larger than Men's. In fact it will be larger than Men's some day in the future. Women's today is nearly 30% of our Apparel business versus less than 16% when we were a public company that we'll celebrate here in just another week or 2, more than 8 years ago. So in addition, we've also added more than $2 billion in revenues during that time, and so we're very pleased I think with the trajectory that Women's have is outpacing our overall growth of the company. Our Women's business, as we stated in Investor Day as well, it's something we anticipate to be nearly $1 billion business for us by 2016 and we're highlighting that with the emphasis around opening our New York office some time the end of this year, early part of next year, led by Leanne Fremar who joined us from Theory within the past year. And we're seeing the team that Leanne is building out, and again, in addition to the other brand experts that we already had here. From a momentum we have and the ownership we believe we have in that female athletes, I'm frankly making more beautiful product for her. Taking her from beyond just on the athletic field and taking her to places that I don't think they'd expect the Under Armour consumer to be in the past. We're also I think putting our money where our mouth is around Women's. You mentioned the shop-in-shop, so you'll see a big emphasis on that. One thing that we've done differently in 2013, we think they paid a very good dividend for us was our use of the Brand Holidays. And we've had 3 of them as I mentioned in my script, the first 2 that have already taken place. The third of which will happen in the next couple of weeks. And we're planning to commit at least one of those brand holidays exclusively to Women's in 2014 also. So we want to make a big statement that we believe that Under Armour Women's has really arrived and something that is extremely important for us. Now probably one of the best vehicles we've seen are Women's product come to life has been the idea of Women's Studio. And I think it's really our commitment with, number one, any of you that are here at Investor Day, you see us highlighted particularly in our own Brand House store, but really, from the excitement we have in some of our key partners like Dick's Sporting Goods but we built out this new Studio presence and I think we've all got extremely excited about what it can mean, and what it's done, I think the dimension that's been added to the brand. But also showing a different side of Under Armour than the female consumer has seen us before, is that we're much more than compressor short and Sports Bra and I think we've demonstrated that with the range that we have as a product. And I can tell you it only gets better and better. We're also from a distribution standpoint, we talked about the department stores, again, that's something important to us. We're in roughly 1,000 department stores today. The majority of that assortment I want to be clear, these are not full assortment we have there. The majority of that is Youth, underwear and there's a Women's products. So we believe there's a lot of growth available for us there and frankly it's a way for us to reach the female consumer where she shops. And so we're going to hit at all levels. First and foremost in our core sporting goods partners, we want to become more comprehensive in the way that we present ourselves there. We also have some initiatives that we stated at building out things like the Women's Studio shop, like the Luxe shop that we have at Dick's for instance and then we also are going to continue to emphasize I think the places where she's shopping. And again, as I mentioned Department Store business. So Women's for us remains a tremendous opportunity and it continues to outpace our overall growth to the company as well.", "Operator", "And next question is from Eric Tracy of Janney Capital.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Really want to dig in on the Footwear piece here a bit. Maybe if you could just talk about some of the evolution of Spine as we go into spring next year. The introduction of SpeedForm, sort of the cadence and how we should think about the distribution strategy there. It seems to be again we're in an inflection point and an acceleration but I just want to sort of gauge your thoughts a bit on Footwear?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, I think -- keep level setting I think with the expectation we laid out back in June at Investor Day. But a lot of the things we talked about was being a top 3 Footwear brand in sporting goods. And we look at where we're successful and where we're winning. And obviously the Apparel floorspace in any given sporting goods stores, Under Armour has a significant impression. And unfortunately, we haven't represented that way on the Footwear side. And so we've got a couple of things. When Kip first took over the Footwear business several years ago, one of the initiatives we had was building shoes that cost $100. And I think we saw a success for things like Charge RC, seeing success with the first price point introduced spine with. RC was that $120, Spine was at $100 and I think we came to realize is that just picking some number isn't necessarily the right place for us to be, particularly in sporting goods where you're really winning there is at $70, $80, $90. And so we've changed that mindset a bit that we're very pleased I think with the premium product that we have and things like Charge RC and things like Spine and products that we have like SpeedForm and I'll get to that in a second. But we also have some products we're really excited about heading into the year with some real house price points like the $80 product that we have called engage coming out. So we really want to emphasize and focus on winning where we're already being successful in the Apparel side, which is in sporting goods. We also believe that there's tremendous opportunity in the mall. Our key partners in Finish Line, Foot Locker that have been incredible partners for us and continue to give us great runway. So SpeedForm is going to be a critical component of what that means. So let me backup for a second and just talk about Spine. Spine continues to sell very well for us. The latest iteration that we have is called Vice [ph] and we're about to launch a new even lighter, sleeker and faster version in early 2014. I've mentioned Charge RCs, you'll see us coming back with new styles and colors and updates for that style that ranges somewhere between $110 and $120. And then what we have with SpeedForm that we introduced in a very small way just to get taste of what we thought the product could do at $120 this year in Specialty and the product has been incredibly -- we're incredibly pleased with it at this point. For instance we made the cover of competitor magazine being labeled the best innovation in 2013. We're coming back from a bit of a more commercial product that we have, we're going to call Speedform, Apollo, which will launch at $100 in a lot more volume in many more of the places where you would expect to find Under Armour. The feedback we're seeing on the product is really, really been good though and something that we believe that we're in a position to do well. All of this that we say running and I think we've been clear that we need to win in running. So we are -- it's great not to just be talking about 1 style heading into a season but being able to talk about $120 Charge RC, $100 SpeedForm, a $90 Spine and $80 Engage. You're seeing as beginning to add a dimension to the brand, but at the same time it's all underpinned by the authenticity that we're driving on field. Football for us in cleated -- I think people roll their eyes a little bit, but I can tell you the authenticity that we get from being as good as we are in grabbing market share in places like cleated has been extraordinary for us. Football for us as a whole, we're up 28% in units and 42% in dollars with the Highlight Cleat leading the way. And we enter a market with that type of innovation, we're seeing it cascade into many other products and we're selling it the Highlight Cleat at $100, $110 or $120. With that does for us in some of our $70 and $80 price points as well, it really drives business and it moves markets for us. We're also seeing, I think really nice progress in things like basketball. We recently announced Stephen Curry joining our roster of athletes and something we're really excited about again. He broke the record in the NBA for 3-pointers last year. And I think tremendous competitor and something really fits well with the character of our brand and frankly, somebody, like the DNA of all of our athletes, some of them really want to be with us. And so I think we're getting more presence on court, but I think we're doing it in a prudent way. We're not trying to buy loyalty. I think we're demonstrating, we're earning it, whether it's on the football field or it's on the basketball court, some of the moves you're seeing us do in soccer with Tottenham Hotspur, Colo-Colo and others, you're seeing us show up I think in more relevant ways with our brand. And again all these things underpin the success that we've had in the Apparel, but I think you're beginning to watch it move towards area like Footwear too.", "Brad Dickerson", "And, Eric, I just want to tie in to Kevin's comments and clarify my prepared remarks around that Q4 growth rate in Footwear. And again, just emphasize this is the timing issue. The fourth quarter actually is our lowest volume quarter for Footwear. And this is really more around the timing of our baseball cleat shipment and again it's our lowest volume quarter, so our year-to-date 2013 growth rate in Footwear is around 25% and again, we called out the fact that Footwear is going to be above the company growth rate in 2014. So the Q4 growth is just the timing issue.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "That's fair. And then I guess, Brad, to follow on that, the Footwear acceleration next year understand that dynamic in terms of laying on gross margin. But the early sort of color on gross margin next year of modest gains, given supply chain enhancements, given -- now pricing seems to be again, whether it's within Footwear or even Apparel, a nice tailwind. Some of these onetime sort of upfront costs should go away. Can you just maybe walk through again the gross margin dynamic next year, where the potential is for upside or is it purely just the mix on the Footwear that should be the drag?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure. And to be honest with you right now on the gross margin side, looking at the data we have and the data that we don't have yet, we have pretty clear visibility into spring, summer '14 and don't have all the data points in fall and winter '14 yet, so we're kind of using spring, summer '14 as a proxy for our guidance for the full year '14. And if you did kind of look at the front half of the year and the things that you have. You have a couple of things working in your favor, a lot of the things you mentioned some supply chain enhancements that we've been making along the way we would continue to expect to see some benefits from those going into next year and for the full year. From the things working against us is the mix piece, so obviously we're calling out things like Footwear and International, those are 2 parts of our business that from a gross margin perspective, although both improving year-over-year within themselves, they're still a drag on gross margins overall for the company, so that would be a big part of offsetting some of those supply chain enhancements that we'd make during the front half of the year. So again, positives, supply chain side, again, positive there working for us. The negatives on the gross margin side would be the businesses that are growing above the company growth rate for Footwear and International.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.", "Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I wanted to ask on the inventory, maybe thinking both the inventory on your growth and also thinking about the channel. Excluding the Fleece and timing compare issue you mentioned, how do you feel about it, about the content of it? And thinking that the second have interrelated question is how the sell-through performance in the channel, in the quarters maybe, was there difference in sporting goods versus department stores versus other in the wholesale channels?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Our inventory in general and then sell through -- from an inventory perspective, like I said, there are a couple of big issues that are really driving that and the year-over-year growth rate. We are absolutely comping a challenging service level of last year, that we talked about last year especially in the Fleece business, so more normalization of our inventory levels on the Fleece side. If you remember our inventory growth last year in the Q3 with a minus 2%. Just kind of going back to some of the challenges we're having last year at this time. In addition to that, we kind of are in this kind of middle of a period here towards improvement relative to the some supply chains, thanks, specifically on the inventory side. We talked a lot in our Investor Day upon our 3-year planning process and the benefits that's going to have specifically in the supply chain longer term. Those really probably the benefits of getting better visibility out there further from a capacity perspective, probably it won't start really coming in to play for us until I think until we hit 2015 maybe the end of '14 into 2015. So in the meantime, we've talked about kind of resourcing some of our products to our existing suppliers and in putting more capacity to our existing suppliers. So part of the byproduct of that was making sure with them, really working with them and managing their capacity and their level loading of inventory, and manufacturing the ability to smooth that out and take some inventory at earlier too. So the impact of that has been a little bit more than we anticipated coming into the back half of this year on top of, again, the comp issue that we're absolutely having the back half of last year too, relative to the service levels. So those are really the 2 big things that are driving inventory. As you look again into Q4, into early next year, I would assume pretty similar stories. Again, I think if you look at our growth rates in inventory, in Q4 last year was minus 2%, in Q1 this year was flat year-over-year. So if you look at some of those challenges we were having on the supply chain side, we're definitely -- all the back half of last year and into the beginning of this year, so we'll continue to have some of those comp issues and we'll continue to have those issue of level loading with our vendors too from a capacity perspective until the benefit for 3YP start to kick in a 3-year planning process. On the sell-through side, obviously, we're posting really strong results here in the quarter. We've seen really good results in our Direct-to-Consumer business, obviously as I stated in my prepared remarks. On the wholesale side of business we've absolutely had another strong quarter and anticipate the strong quarter in the fourth quarter. Have we seen some impact to the much-publicized softness at retail? Absolutely. I think everybody sees some impact to that. We've seen a little bit of that as we got towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. But again all that kind of built into our guidance and we're working through that. It has impacted our business a little bit, but I again, I think much, much less than it has probably other people in this space.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Kevin, I wanted to just touch on Youth and in particularly Alter Ego, since like that's been a runaway success for you. I'm just curious to hearing your thoughts on how you plan to expand the distribution? I know that you started going into your wholesale partners with the product this quarter. How do you see that broadening unfold? Do you think about shop-in-shop's dedicated to the Youth category?", "Kevin A. Plank", "So first of all, Alter Ego for us has been a really great success in 2013. It's a business that in June of 2012 didn't exist. We ideated it, tested it, built a product and had it in store this year. We primarily were in market with just a couple of our key partners, only may be 2 or 3 for partners, so we're just starting to get in front of the production side where we can get the product out there. So within our existing distribution, there's a lot of runway, I think for Alter Ego. At the same time, as good a partner as Marvel and D.C. Comics have been for us with this process. We'll also go after this cautiously optimistic about how many Batman and how many Superman t-shirts. First of all, there's a whole slate of characters that they have and so we're already sure we spread that, and we don't want to get caught holding the bag as trends move up and trends go down. However, we believe in it, we think there's a plenty of runway there. What we discovered I think as a company though is that not as much about just any one particular. Character, as it is about the want, the desire, the need for newness and for novelty. And so we believe that we've invented this new category of novelty. And so whether it is Batman, Superman, Ironman or whoever else to use or whether it's a slogan, we know the consumers are not looking for a basic white T-shirt in Under Armour logo, a black Under Armour logo on the left chest, that we need to provide a little bit more and that frankly across the board what we've seen with our -- all of our styles is that, particularly on our Direct-to-Consumer business, when the consumer comes to us they're not looking for the basics but they're looking for the things that have a little surface texture, have a little more interest, a little more technology, at frankly higher price points too. So Under Armour is really getting de-commoditized, I believe, to some extent and while we play with big volumes and big programs and we can make some pretty wheel house programs and products, we think that the consumers continue to push us to ask for more innovation, and luckily we've got innovation pipeline that's really full. Youth as you mentioned, Camilo, it's been really just on a tear for us. Our Youth business as a whole continues to lead the market as best we've seen. Our product alone on the Youth side is up. It's outpacing by almost 2x our total company growth. We haven't find -- found the top, the biggest challenge we have is finding appropriate distribution. Our own key partners have never exactly emphasized youth departments and youth sessions in their stores and I think because of the success we've seen, we're testing that more and more and we're looking to be creative I think with some of their own floor space and some categories that are more a drag to them and saying how can we build out bigger youth sections. So that's I think you'll come from us. And as I mentioned in my own script where -- this is not the Youth Apparel conversation either. I think I've made the statement of challenging somebody and go ahead and take a dozen 12 and under year olds and give them $100 and tell them to walk into it, sporting goods store, buy 1 piece of apparel, 1 pair of shoes. And I think there's a really good chance that they'll walk out with a piece of Under Armour apparel on the top. And based on what we're seeing in the last 6 and 12 months in Footwear, there's about as good of as a chance these days as them walking out with a pair of Under Armour shoes too. So we're really resonating with that kid and we're looking to doing great job for them and growing up and growing old with them too, so I think it has this position us very, very well.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Great. And then, Brad, just quickly, you talked about assuming a similar weather pattern as last year. How do you view your ability to meet at once orders should weather become more favorable? And have you think of that as a source of upside? And then just finally on gross margin, have you begun to realize the mix benefits in your Direct-to-Consumer business as you skew more towards made-for versus excess?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, first on the weather side. Yes, absolutely if weather is in our favor, there'll be upside for us but again, the part of AR business and the part of our business that's extremely weather dependent is much less than maybe was 5 or 6 years ago. So a lot of our Q4 product is going to be in the Fleece side, which is more versatile and maybe less dependent on weather then may be with how we look 5 or 6 years ago. So would there be an upside for us if weather was cold? Yes, but let's just make sure we're prudent on how much upside there would be relative to that. From an AR perspective, absolutely, our AR fill rates are much better year-over-year. We're in the high 80s last year in AR fill rates and now we're in the mid-90s where we probably should be. So again, if the weather gets cold and somebody has looking for that product is an AR style, we should be able to service that demand in the fourth quarter. Our relative to the gross margin and then the realization of benefit per mix. Yes, we're still seeing some of that benefit on the made for mix. It was definitely there in the third quarter also. It was being offset by some other mix issues specifically with the growth in Footwear for us in the third quarter also. So yes, we're seeing consistent benefit in the made-for mix in the margin upside of that. It's just a little bit muted in the third quarter because there's some other things going on in mix.", "Operator", "And next question is from Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So, Brad, since you mentioned it earlier on, on the International investment in the quarter, that was a big point of the conversation at the Analyst Day you guys had at the headquarters this summer. Maybe you guys could talk a little bit about the plan for International as you look just into 2014 in the context of what you guys talked about at the Analyst Day in the headquarter, what some of the investments may look like, that was -- it was obviously a material components of how you guys guided operating margins as well as well. So maybe just a little bit more about how the near term looks on that?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Michael, let me take this to sort of a big overall, spend a minute on International for us. So first of all, I think we laid it out very well. And it was great to have the ability to introduce Charlie to I think the investment community and get you to see the type of leadership that we have there. So would have a couple basic rules here at Under Armour and one of them is that great ideas get funded, but only great ideas with great leaders get funded. And So we're putting our money where our mouth is on that side as well in addition to that Women's. And what we see is that International has great dividend for us but we know it's going to an investment, it's going to take time. And part of our restructuring was really built around that. The movement that we did with Kip and with Henry was really to put some of our better leaders on our cash generators. And the philosophy that we're driving I think our corporate strategy these days is the principle that I have in my script. Our North American growth and castration are going to be the engine that feeds our global ambition. Because we have the success in North America, it allows us to make just longer-term investments. And so we're going to be investing appropriately internationally. But we're going -- we believe we've got some really good ideas, we believe they have some really good leadership. So let me work my way around the world and start with Latin America, which Charlie has been working on prior to coming to Under Armour's, particularly for the last 8 years but not exclusively, of course. Mexico, we're in the process of bringing back in our Mexican -- and making them -- Mexican distributor into a subsidiary by the first quarter of '14. We just opened of our first specialty store in Mexico City on the middle first week of October, and it's doing very well. I think we're seeing that we're resonating with that consumer. Brazil is obviously a big hot topic of conversation for everyone. The team that Charlie has assembled there is literally second to none. Unbelievable amount of experience with the 50-year of experience we held. That office is open now and will be beginning to probably looked to move our product, we'll be in there by -- in time for World Cup in 2014, but not a huge presence, but again it'll give us traction and I think you'll see a bigger presence as we build up to the Olympics in '16 also. Chile is another office that just opened in the past month. We announced the deal that we did with Colo-Colo, who's one of the largest soccer clubs in Chile as well and again with just a proven professional running our business there. Moving across the pond to Europe. It's a place where we've been in Europe really since 2006. We just opened a new office in Manchester, the focus on the U.K. specifically. Our business with Tottenham Hotspur is something that it I think demonstrates our commitment to being a global brand and obviously showing up in the global stage of EPL it's something that we've been doing very well. And our Kip is doing extremely well in that market also. That being said, we still have -- we have work to do in the Europe. We're still resonating with that consumer and we believe we like our leadership, we like our team. We have good momentum but we need to capitalize on it. We need to make Europe an absolute win and a positive for the company. And we see it. We believe that, that tipping point as we sit here in the year 7 or 8 of our existence there is something that is very, very close for us. Moving to the other side of the globe. Asia, beginning in China, I talked about last week having been over there and did a tour from visiting our partners in Japan who are doing extremely well, growing close to 30% on a meaningful business there. Again, nearly crossed $200 million last year. And continue to grow China for us where I spent time. We've got 6 stores opened right now, 3 of them are exclusively Under Armour stores. The Under Armour experience that we opened in Shanghai is just really cool environment. And again, I believe the first thing that we need to convince the consumer in any market but, particularly in China is why walk by -- how do I compel you to walk by the 4 or 5 global brands you've heard of and the 7 or 8 local brands and commit you to walk into an Under Armour or participate with our brand. And we believe that we're doing that with this new retail experience. So something very exciting and we think there's a lot more things to come. In other places, Taiwan and Hong Kong, opened our first store with a new partner in Taiwan recently. In Hong Kong, we opened with a distributor there called Giga Sports, retail chain there and again the product is doing extremely well. We just launched both websites recently. So we're balanced, it sounds like we're doing a lot, we really are, but we believe we have it in can control, I think part of our shift is again this reorganization we just announced, has as much to do with Under Armour transforming from being a North American companies selling stuff in other parts of the world that truly be a global brand that's doing business in North America and Latin America and Asia and then Europe. So we're very focused on making that happen and I think we're taking really good progress steps towards that direction.", "Brad Dickerson", "And, Mike, just on the magnitude of the investment both will be growing SG&A in Europe to Kevin's point. I think most of the additional investment we're looking at from '13 to '14 and even starting in '13 is just building up the foundation of the international business globally so making sure that we have the right people, process and systems from an information technology perspective. Supply chain and leadership as Kevin mentioned is part of the additional investment this year and into next year and probably the other big piece of the additional investment is going to be the Latin American region as we bring Mexico in as a fully-owned subsidiary and we opened up fully-owned subsidiaries in Brazil and Chile. So when you're looking at kind of year-over-year incremental investments, it's that International corporate group and it's Latin America that really is driving the investment in International for the most part.", "Operator", "And next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you can just help us with the preliminary 2014 outlook. I know that on your fourth quarter call, you'll have a lot more detail. But if what is that you're seeing happening in the environment that would suggest that the lower end of your targets are the right place to be for next year? And if there's any additional color you could offer on that, that would be fantastic.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure. I think if you just kind of look where we're guiding this year compared to our guidance next year relative to revenue growth rate. Two things that we did call out. International and Footwear being accelerated growth next year, so you would look at those 2 things seeing positives from our growth rate perspective. But the one thing I think that clearly we look at year-over-year, where we are this year versus next year, that the largest piece of our Direct-to-Consumer business is our outlet business. And we have talked about slower growth indoors, new doors on the outlet side although we're focusing on growing and expanding some existing doors. Our outlet business will grow at a slower pace than this year as we start the transition also into putting more effort into the Brand House side of our business on top of the outlet business. So that DTC business is obviously a much bigger business than International and Footwear combined. And again outlet is the biggest part of that DTC business, so you have 2 businesses growing at a faster pace that are off a smaller base than the outlet business, which will grow a little bit slower pace.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And then in terms of your wholesale. Should we assume that wholesale who also be nearing the lower end of that range as well?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, usually since wholesale is the biggest part of our business you would expect it to be pretty much close to the range we're guiding to for the most part.", "Operator", "Okay, and then the last question is from Sam Poser of Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Brad, I was just wondering, can you give us some detail on how you're thinking about the SG&A next year? Will it be this constant reinvestments or do you expect that to open up a little bit towards the back of the year? If sales come in above where you're going?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Sam. A couple of things just to call out on SG&A next year. We do see some items like marketing as an instance, it probably would have been, if I was look at it directionally for marketing right now, I'd say, probably going to be a little bit of a de-leverage for us next year. Based on where we're going to end up this year. Again, we haven't really figured out the exact timing of that yet, so we'll give more information on timing in the next earnings call. And something we're calling this year will also be a little bit of an investment overall for the company next year and that's in incentive compensation next year, which is kind of across all 4 of our SG&A buckets that will be a de-leverage item next year. Consistent stories relative to again some of the investment needs -- both is innovation is an area, that directionally, we would look to be increase our investments. So on the product side, specifically innovation, supply chain is an area again an investment for us as we are looking to expand our capabilities globally and obviously, a continued expansion of our global business itself as we just talked about specifically in the Latin America will be investment areas for us. Relative to your question about how the investments play out versus our top line and performance. And I think the one thing that we're going to constantly balance is we are focused on driving operating income dollars and operating income dollar growth just like we talked about in our Investor Day over the long term. We will always look for opportunities to help ensure successful business in a subsequent year or do things in the current year that could benefit the current year also from an SG&A or investment perspective. So if numbers would come in better than we are planning for 2014 and the timing of that would happen differently, we would definitely look to where we can reinvest those dollars and be opportunistic to benefit '14 or probably more specifically as they get towards the end of '14, what could we do to accelerate or ensure our success for 2015?", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then you've talked about the mix -- in the fourth quarter you talked about gross margin being down, but the mix of retail's going up and the mix of Footwear is going down in the fourth quarter, so why would that drive lower gross margins?", "Brad Dickerson", "Probably the only -- the couple of things that are going to be happen in Q4 that maybe were a little bit more impactful than Q3. First and foremost, if you remember the Canadian duty issue we called out in the last call, we talked about some uncertainty around the impact of margins for that in the back half of the year. That's still an ongoing issue. We have not resolved that issue, it's still kind of in the audit mode right now. So we didn't really have an impact in the third quarter relative to that issue. We do fully anticipate that, that issue is going to be resolved in the very, very near term here, so there will be a fourth quarter impact to that issue as we finish up this year. So that would be a little bit of a difference from Q3 to Q4 and also on the FX side, our business in Japan where this really impacts us the change in the yen rate year-over-year will be a little more elevated in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter also. So those are 2 things -- 2 unique things, I think, that are going to be more elevated in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter specifically.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And just any word on tax rate for next year and that's it.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Tax rate for next year come again, that's something we have to really kind of roll together, the all the numbers in especially the back half the year. But I would anticipate the 2 big drivers of tax rate for us right now is our ability to have comparable tax credits year-over-year. Would be one thing, we're able to get tax credits next year that we would have this year would be one way to look at the direction of our tax rate and the second thing would be obviously pointing to incremental international investments and we need international profits to drive the lower tax rate and when we are in an investment mode that will work against us from a tax rate perspective. So my part would be our tax rate last -- next year will probably be a little bit higher than this year, but as we get more information we'll guide to that obviously in January.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "All right. Thanks, everyone for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting you our fourth quarter 2013 results, which tentatively have been scheduled for Thursday, January 30 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Shaw", "Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's fourth quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we will be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement was made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, followed by an update to our 2014 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern time today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone, from the brand-new Under Armour office here at New York City that just opened earlier this month. It's great to have a presence here at our new space in Chelsea, and we're looking forward to the opening of our first store in Soho later this spring.", "So Under Armour is a growth company, and with growth comes change. We like to say that Under Armour is a different company every 6 months, so we thought we'd start today by listing a few game changers that took place since we last spoke. First, despite starting the season unranked, Auburn University had 2 of the greatest comebacks in college football history, on its way to playing in the BCS National Championship Game. Then, we announced partnerships to outfit 2 of the most prestigious collegiate sports programs in the United States, the University of Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy. As someone here characterized it, we now have both God and country covered. Thirdly, we signed agreements to outfit 2 leading soccer clubs, Colo Colo in Chile and Cruz Azul in Mexico, as we lay the foundation for growth outside the United States in the world's biggest sports. Next, we signed our first ballerina. I can safely say those are 5 words I didn't picture myself saying on an earnings call when I started the business in '96. Misty Copeland of the American Ballet Theatre is a great illustration of how we will bring new dimensions to the Under Armour brand in 2014, as she helps us redefine what it means to be an athletic female. And finally, we made what we believe is a compelling first acquisition, MapMyFitness, which firmly positions us at the forefront of the exploding connected fitness movement. So a quarter with major new developments across our categories, geographies and business units. But fortunately, Q4 had a lot in common with the quarters that preceded it. It was our 15th consecutive quarter with net revenue growth of 20-plus percent and our 17th consecutive quarter with Apparel growth of 20-plus percent.", "As we said on our last call, our core North American Apparel business is strong, and that gives us the firepower to invest in growing new geographies with new categories and new consumers.", "So I just want to spend a minute this morning talking about an outstanding Q4 that capped an exceptional 2013, because it reinforces our strategy of investing in our growth drivers for the long term. I promised Brad I'd let him deliver most of the good news of the quarter, but I want to stress that the 35% top line growth we saw in Q4 was driven by strength across the board in all of our businesses. We certainly saw some benefit to our Fleece and ColdGear in the quarter from the weather, and Brad can talk to that in a bit, but the sales momentum was evident in both our wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer business with Apparel growing 35%; Footwear, 24%; and Accessories, 52%. That continued momentum in our North American Apparel business is a great testament to our ability to develop large-scale platforms around our relentless flow of innovation.", "For example, in the third quarter, we introduced our latest Apparel innovation, ColdGear Infrared, our industry-leading technology that provides warmth without the weight and enables us to exceed our consumers' expectations around cold weather protection. With a strong launch in 2013, including solid holiday sales across Men's and Women's wearing pieces, we will start to see even more meaningful volume for ColdGear Infrared in 2014.", "Our ability to expand platforms is a critical piece of how we are driving growth. In year 2, we'll bring the ColdGear Infrared into new categories much as we did with both Charged and Storm Cotton, which last year, in just year 3, topped $300 million in combined revenues. This category of Charged and Storm Cotton did not even exist before 2011, just 3 years ago.", "I mentioned the strength of our Apparel business was across-the-board, and I want to quickly cover Women's and Youth. Coming off of a year of outstanding results in Women's, we are extremely excited about what we planned for 2014. In addition to the great product that is in the pipeline and our improved presentation at retail, including our New York store that opens this spring here in Soho, we will be focusing our second Brand Holiday this year on Women's. One of the reasons we are so bullish on our Women's business is that there has been a quiet shift going on, where women are increasingly wearing \"athletic product\" outside of the gym. We think the reality is this shift is more permanent than some may expect, as our female consumer continues to embrace our technology innovation and increase focus on style. We are in a great position to continue to grow this business as we build a loyal base of athletes and are growing with her as she moves into new categories and end-users for Under Armour product.", "We had an extremely strong 2013 in Youth, or as we refer to them, Next. Our Youth business has exceeded all of our expectations, and we continue to see momentum across not just Apparel, but also Footwear and Accessories as well. For the year, Youth doubled the growth rate we saw in our Men's and Women's Apparel businesses. This broad-based strength gives us great confidence in our long-term future as we remain laser-focused on maintaining the strong relationship with our consumer as he and she move into new sports and new wearing opportunities as they grow up.", "All in all, it was an exceptionally strong year for our Apparel business in North America. We created a lot of excitement in the market with our Alter Ego and ColdGear Infrared innovations, and have unprecedented momentum in our core Apparel business as we enter 2014.", "On the Footwear side of the business, we also enter the new year with great momentum as we start telling the story of SpeedForm to consumers today with a presence some of you may have seen on your TV [ph] this morning. We will launch holiday 1 and tell the SpeedForm story with our largest events marketing execution to date, taking over Grand Central Station's Vanderbilt Hall starting today and lasting through Super Bowl Sunday night. The SpeedForm Apollo running shoe is the latest innovation from Under Armour Footwear, and it destroys the rules of footwear construction. We craft each of these lightweight shoes in a clothing factory to create the precision, feel, fit and comfort consumers have come to expect from our Apparel. And when the March issue of Runner's World magazine hits next week, the SpeedForm Apollo will be recognized by their editors as best debut in its spring shoe guide. The TV campaign starts February 22 but available on YouTube this afternoon, and we're incredibly excited to bring the level of innovation we've already brought to cleated to the running community starting with the SpeedForm Apollo. That focus on exceeding our consumers' expectations was part of the driving force behind our decision to purchase MapMyFitness in December. We have a very simple mission here at Under Armour, and it's to make all athletes better. The amount of information now available to athletes to help them achieve that has never been greater and also never more complex. With our acquisition of MapMyFitness and the leadership of its founder, Robin Thurston, we are now in great position to design open digital products to the athlete of tomorrow and provide solutions that will help people across the world lead healthier lifestyles.", "Because we think connected fitness is about more than a bracelet that enables you to tell your social media friends that you walk 1.2 miles today. It's about the opportunity to innovate technology in a seamless way that empowers the athlete individually benefit from the wealth of information that is going to be available to them. It's about waking up and knowing that even though you were thinking of running 3 miles this morning, your quality of sleep and other biometric measures suggest you'd get more benefit from running 4. We know that this world is still in a very early stage of development, and we believe the addition of Robin and his team of more than 60-plus engineers and developers meaningfully accelerates our profile in the digital space. We have been learning every single day since the acquisition in December. I don't want to get into the operational details at this point, but I can tell you the integration between our team in Baltimore and the MapMyFitness team in Austin has been rapid and productive, and each day brings new ideas and possibilities to what connected fitness will mean to Under Armour.", "So let me give you some scope on the size of the opportunity. MapMyFitness has built a community of over 21 million registered users. And during just the first week of January, we added more than 400,000 new users from the 1st to the 7th. Equally important is that this acquisition immediately brings us the talent we need to leapfrog into a leadership position in the world of connected fitness. We're incredibly excited to join forces with Robin and his team and believe we will drive the future performance innovation for the world's athletes.", "So what to watch for, for Under Armour in 2014 because, like I said at the top, we are a different company every 6 months. In the short term, you will continue to find us on the world stage of sport. For example, in golf this past weekend, at The Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines, there were 3 different leaders at the end of rounds 2, 3 and 4, and each of them, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland and Scott Stallings were outfitted in Under Armour. And next week, when the Olympics open in Sochi, we'll unveil the culmination of our partnership with Lockheed Martin, the world's fastest speed skating suit, that will be worn by Shani Davis and other members of the U.S. speed skating team. We will also be on stage outfitting U.S. bobsled and the Canadian snowboard team, amongst others.", "In the longer term, our goal is to continue doing what we do, investing to ensure we are building the foundation for long-term growth while delivering results now. MapMyFitness, Notre Dame and Navy and partnerships with companies like Lockheed Martin are all part of that plan. We are well on track to meet the goals we set out at Investor Day in June 2013. But our ambition extends well beyond $4 billion in revenue by 2016, and our ambition is fueled by investments. Some large and immediately relevant, like Notre Dame, and others that are small now but could potentially ignite our business down the road, because for every Notre Dame or Navy deal, there's a much smaller investment we're making somewhere else in the business. It may be a logistics tool that you'll never hear about, a retail store in Mexico or an up-and-coming athlete who may one day become the next Stephen Curry or Tom Brady. When we invest well, we win. We believe our 2013 results are a great reflection of sound investments and solid execution. We are a growth company, one that's focused on our future but delivering results right now.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Brad. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2014.", "Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 35% to $683 million, representing our fastest growth rate in the past 9 quarters. For the full year, net revenues increased 27% to $2.33 billion, which compares to our most recent full year guidance of $2.26 billion.", "Apparel grew 35% to $546 million during the quarter from $405 million in the prior year, representing the 17th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category. As a reminder, we grew Apparel 25% in the fourth quarter of 2012 despite facing the headwinds of warm seasonal weather and poor service levels in key areas like Fleece. This year, we came into the quarter with a compelling lineup of product, including expanded Fleece and UA Tech offering, as well as our new ColdGear Infrared technology. This new product position -- positioning, combined with the tailwinds of cold weather and our ability to better service the business with higher fill rates, allowed us to more fully capitalize on the strong demand from our consumers.", "From a product category standpoint, training continues to drive much of our overall Apparel dollar growth. We also saw strong growth during the period in our running, hunting and mountain categories, in our Women's Studio line and across our Youth business.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 36% for the quarter, representing approximately 39% of net revenue, which was the same mix as the prior-year period. In our retail business, we opened 5 new Factory House stores during the fourth quarter, increasing our North America Factory House store base to 117, up 15% from 102 locations at the end of last year's fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded 9 of our existing locations during the year, in part, to offer a broader product assortment in areas such as Footwear and Women's.", "Looking at our full-priced brand house stores, we opened our second location at Tysons Corner near Washington, D.C. in November. In E-Commerce, we believe many of the same factors that contributed to our strong Apparel growth also drove better-than-planned results in this channel.", "Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 24% to $55 million from $45 million in the prior year, representing approximately 8% of net revenues for the period. Results for the quarter include the timing of Footwear liquidations, which were higher than planned. Given this action, we believe we are entering 2014 better positioned in the market for our new product offerings this spring.", "Our Accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 52% to $65 million from $43 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by headwear and gloves. International net revenues increased 9% to $37 million in the fourth quarter and represented 5% of total net revenues.", "Moving on to margin. Fourth quarter gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points to 51.3% compared to 50.3% in the prior year's quarter. We previously guided fourth quarter gross margins to decline year-over-year. On the positive side, we expected lower airfreight and a lower mix of excess at our Factory House channel. We expected these to be more than offset by the negative impacts of resourcing Fleece [ph], higher Canadian duties and currency impacts on our Japanese business. As the quarter concluded, we experienced minimal impact from both resourcing and Canadian duties. In addition, we drove improved profitability through higher service levels and better-than-planned performance across our Direct-to-Consumer channels.", "Looking at the year-over-year gross margin picture, the following factors contributed to the improvement during the quarter. First, our sales mix was favorable, partially offset by the higher Footwear liquidations in the quarter. These factors contributed to approximately 90 basis points of gross margin improvement. Second, the favorable airfreight expenses benefited gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these gains, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue deleveraged 270 basis points to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 34.2% in the prior year's period. With our strong results for the quarter, we had higher-than-planned incentive compensation expenses. This includes approximately $11 million in equity incentive compensation, which we had forecasted in 2014. These higher incentive compensation expenses were a significant driver of the overall SG&A deleverage for the quarter. Further details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows. First, marketing costs decreased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 9.7% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by overall expense leverage given our strong top line performance. Second, selling costs increased to 11.6% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.7% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business. Third, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.6% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expenses and innovation investments. Finally, corporate services decreased (sic) [increased] to 7.5% of net revenues for the quarter from 6.2% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expenses and approximately $2.5 million in closing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition.", "Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $98 million compared with $82 million in the prior-year period. For the full year, operating income increased 27% to $265 million compared to our most recent full year guidance of $260 million. Operating margin contracted 170 basis points during the quarter to 14.4%, while holding flat for the full year at 11.4%.", "Our fourth quarter tax rate of 34% is favorable to the 37.1% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of state tax credits, which were received in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our full year effective tax rate of 37.8% was higher than the 36.7% effective rate for 2012, primarily due to increased international investments driving reduced profitability overseas.", "Our net income in the fourth quarter increased 28% to $64 million compared with $50 million in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.59 compared to $0.47 last year. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 24% to $1.50 compared to $1.21 in 2012.", "Now moving over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 2% to $347 million compared with $342 million at December 31, 2012. We funded the $150 million purchase of MapMyFitness in the fourth quarter with $50 million of cash and a $100 million draw from our $300 million revolving credit facility. Inventory at year-end increased 47% to $469 million compared to $319 million at December 31, 2012, reflecting the same factors we outlined during our third quarter conference call related to comparisons to our prior year supply chain delivery challenges. Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $36 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $92 million for 2013. We are currently planning 2014 capital expenditures in the range of $140 million to $150 million, primarily driven by incremental investments to support our Direct-to-Consumer and International businesses as we further develop and expand our global office footprint.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2014. Based on current visibility, we expect 2014 net revenues of $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion, representing growth of 22% to 23%, and 2014 operating income of $326 million to $329 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. This expected growth is in line with the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last June. Below [ph] operating results, we anticipate higher interest expense in 2014, given the financing of the MapMyFitness acquisition, the full year effective tax rate of 39% and fully diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the range of 109 million to 110 million.", "Given these full year parameters, we'd like to provide a few more details on how we currently see the quarterly change playing out.", "First, with net revenues. We currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. Factors driving this include our expected ability to continue servicing our business with higher fill rates, as well as accelerated Footwear growth. For the second half of the year, we will start to comp the improved service levels experienced in the second half of 2013. In addition, over the next few months, we will gain more visibility on fall-winter orders and our ability to execute on the planned international growth in the back half of the year. We will provide updates on our progress on future calls.", "Next on gross margins, where we expect modest gains throughout each quarter in 2014, inclusive of lapping onetime factors in 2013 such as the third quarter import duty impact. While we see numerous puts and takes in individual quarters, 4 factors are expected to be the common themes during the year. First, we expect ongoing supply chain efficiencies to be the primary driver to higher gross margins. Second, we expect minimal margin impact from our Direct-to-Consumer business given lower Factory House square footage growth year-over-year, as well as a similar mix of made-for product in our Factory House stores year-over-year. Third, our sales mix will be adversely impacted by our expected international growth, which includes a mix of lower margin distributor businesses. Finally, Footwear growth is expected to have a minimal impact to consolidated gross margins as the expected sales mix impact is now planned to be offset by improved Footwear product margin.", "Shifting to SG&A. As we mentioned, we recognized approximately $11 million in incentive compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2013 that was originally forecasted in 2014. As a result, we are reallocating investments in 3 primary areas for 2014: marketing, international and MapMyFitness. In marketing, we expect to deleverage expenditures to approximately 11% of net revenues for the full year given some of the initiatives Kevin laid out before. From a timing perspective, we expect over 100 basis points of deleverage in the first quarter, primarily given our overall plans around activating our first Brand Holiday of the year. The marketing expense rate is planned to remain elevated in the second quarter before normalizing from a rate perspective during the second half of the year. International remains an important opportunity and priority, and we will continue to make the right level of investments to help realize our global potential, especially in Latin American markets that we are entering in 2014. MapMyFitness will also be a key area of investment as we look to build and further engage this community.", "As we have been emphasizing, our bottom line focus will remain on driving operating income dollar growth balanced with making the right investments to drive our long-term global success.", "Finally, some additional color on our inventory positioning. We expect the inventory growth rate to remain above the net revenues growth rate at the end of the first quarter given some of the same factors we outlined during this past quarter and including our positioning for elevated first half growth expectations. We do expect the spread between the inventory growth rate and the net revenues growth rate to narrow somewhat during the first quarter before returning to more in-line levels during the duration of the year. We remain encouraged with some of the early traction we are seeing from the recent investments across our supply chain organization.", "In conclusion, we had a great finish to 2013, with strong signs of continued brand momentum, improving supply chain efforts to better service this demand and improved foundations to support long-term global success. These factors give us the confidence in raising our 2014 top line outlook by over $100 million from our preliminary outlook last quarter, while also raising our 2014 operating income outlook by over $10 million.", "We'd now like to open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Saad of ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. Firstly, real quick, do you guys have a sense for how much the cold weather contributed to that really big sales acceleration in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up on DTC.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, Omar. On the cold weather question, we had talked last year, last year, we had a warm winter in the fourth quarter and we still grew 25%. And we've been talking about that the impact of weather is less and less in our organization as our product line evolves. So 5, 6, 7 years ago, cold weather would have had a significant impact, either upside or downside, in our business. But our products have evolved so much, and it's much more diversified now, especially with our Fleece offering, that cold weather has a little bit less of an impact than it did 6, 7 years ago. So just as a warm winter in Q4 last year didn't have a huge downside to us because we grew 25%, it didn't have a huge upside to us in our 35% either. That being the case though, we definitely realize that there's some tailwind to weather, and it makes our results a little bit better across our channels, wholesale and DTC. So there was definitely an upside. Quantifying the upside to the fourth quarter is a little tough to do when you're growing 35%, but you could easily say maybe a couple of percentage points of was due to cold weather.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Brad, that's really helpful. And then, Kevin, DTC, it looks like it approached 40% on the business in the fourth quarter. That's pretty amazing from where you were 5, 6 years ago. Can you talk about what you're learning, maybe from the Tysons Corner store, the Baltimore store? You're in New York, you're coming into the New York downtown. Is the product different than what you're offering at wholesale? Is it more premium? And the way you flow in product to generate more newness and innovation, can you maybe talk about some of the strategies around the new full-price stores?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, well, we're celebrating our 1-year anniversary of opening the brand house in Baltimore, and we opened it in a place that wasn't exactly a retail destination and just see what we could learn. We -- I think the learnings of the last 12 months have told us a few things. Number one, that we got a premium brand that there is a position that the consumer is looking for. There is product that we offer in the brand that maybe they haven't found in an easier basis at retail. I think the #1 goal that we have with this was making it a more compelling experience for our customer base and having our wholesale distribution as well recognized, that we could be much bigger and broader than maybe they positioned us and sort of putting us in a bit of a box in some of the retails that we've had before. Great examples of that, I think, is the way we've been able to obviously expand Men's, but Women's is probably the biggest thing, the openness of color. Things like our StudioLux line is where customers are coming from all over the country, in fact [ph], all over the world, and saying, \"Wow, this is a full-line brand\" versus maybe just seeing a few items, which is I think we've gotten pinned into that in the past. So Tysons is something where we then said, it was just something in our backyard. We expanded at Tysons. We're seeing similar results there. We're outpacing the way that perform at the stores. And so it's doing incredibly well. And we're going to learn a lot when we come up to New York City. And I think it will be refreshing because there's not [ph] a people in this market that I don't believe have gotten a great Under Armour experience walking into some of our stores here. So I'd say that as a challenge to our wholesale partners and also as an opportunity for ourselves. And so having retail gives us the ability to be strategic and be thoughtful, and I think we're learning. There's no plan in place right now to say we're looking to roll out 25 or 50 or 100 units. I think we're going to take them one store at a time. We're going to look for key markets where we can be strategic, places that we want to enter, and we're going to continue to learn. So I think we have the ability to change the model as to how people have done it in the past, a, not being just a retailer, not just being a wholesaler but there's a great balance in the middle, and ideally, we're inspiring our wholesale distribution to take on more comprehensive Under Armour presentation in their own stores.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "International maybe for one of these new stores?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. No, it's the same thing. You look at markets that we have around the globe and just take China for instance. We've got 13 stores total in 2013. We'll be growing over 50 stores by the end of 2014 as well. We're adding over 40 stores globally outside the United States as well. So we -- this really has served as much a sort of a brand marker and not something that's just domestic. It absolutely has as much to do with our global footprint and our global growth as anything. So ideally, what you'll see is consistency. You'll see a consistent message from what you find in Baltimore to Tysons to New York, and then what you find in Mexico City or in Shanghai or any place else where we're opening an Under Armour brand now.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy of Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, people really seem to like your brand.", "Kevin A. Plank", "We'll take it.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm intrigued by your Women's Brand Holiday. Are you willing to share a preview of the direction and timing for that? Then I have a follow-up on MapMyFitness.", "Kevin A. Plank", "We're just getting going with launching Holiday One this afternoon, so we're pretty focused on what Footwear is going to be. So if you don't mind, I'm going to turn that into, I think, more of a Footwear approach than anything. The answer, though, briefly, I think Women's deserves it. We don't give a lot of credit for our Women's business today. Even still, yet it's approaching over $500 million. We crossed $500 million in 2013, and our Women's business is really beginning to take hold with us as a company. We find out again that when we do innovate, we win. And our Women's business is no different than that. And so, I think it's earned the right and it's earned the focus that you're going to see of a committed organization that has 3 massive events a year, and Women's is going to have a second event during the back-to-school campaign. So that's going to be a big deal for us.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great, look forward to that. MapMyFitness, a great category. Heretofore, they've had a device-agnostic approach. Looking forward, how are you and Robin thinking about evolving that Switzerland position? Will there be a more brand-exclusive approach at some point in the future?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. No, I don't see that. If I could, let me take a minute and just tell you about MapMyFitness and the way that we've approached the category. We haven't had a chance, I think, to speak to the market about what our mindset was when we made the acquisition back in December. So first of all, as a great brand, which I think we're continuing to underscore, [indiscernible] mentioned at the top of the Q&A as well, again, is that we've got a chance to go in a lot of different directions and a lot of different categories. And so, the most difficult thing we have is editing where do we want to go. A while ago, we identified Connected Fitness as the future of sport, a place where frankly, Under Armour has to be because we see the commitment from our consumer to want to be there also. Measurement and information, it's critical to making athletes better, which is our core mission statement. So it was important enough [ph], and we looked at the space and we spent some time looking at the categories. But I'll be honest, I was a user of the MapMyFitness app for more than 2 years, so I was incredibly familiar with it. And Robin and I have had a few conversations just about entering the space, and I just gave them feedback and comments mostly just as a consumer, but then also putting my Under Armour hat and thinking, \"Wow, what would this mean for us?\" We looked at 3 basic criteria when we decided, are we going to pick a partner here? Are we going to make an acquisition or are we going to try to go it alone? And frankly, we've almost been doing that with our Armour39 product that we launched back in January of 2011 at the NFL Combine. What was important to us was community size, the openness, the platform. To reference specifically your questions, so absolutely not. We want to be agnostic, and we want to be open to all. And then third and most importantly to us is leadership. With 21 million registered users today, MapMyFitness is an incredible asset, MapMyRun, MapMyRide. And more importantly, I mentioned that stat during my script, in the first week of January, they added an additional 400,000 users, which is up -- really, I think was up over 80% to 100% from the prior year. So we're beginning to see this accelerator that's happening. Secondly, being a platform that works with more than 400 different devices, I'm not sure that Under Armour wants to bet on the hardware side of this world. I think there's too much innovation, there's too many players. I'm not sure who's going to win, and we're not willing to throw our hat in the ring there either. And we've done it with Armour39. We think we can -- we think we have the best product there. We think we can be incredibly competitive. But from a wearables standpoint, we'd rather sit back, and we'd rather find out who the winners are going to be, and then we'll -- we could partner with them. And more importantly, we can get the trust from our consumer to make the appropriate recommendations about whoever best in class without having a jilted interest of it being ourselves. And third and most importantly, bringing Robert on. We've struggled with this, Gary [ph]. I don't think [ph] struggling would have to be a fair word, but we've looked at how can we become more relevant in digital as a whole. And going, frankly, from the word digital to the world's connected fitness is an area that now we have a leader in Robin Thurston, who's one of the founders of this industry, who's going to be driving the digital Connected Fitness space for Under Armour as a whole and bringing with him a team of more than 60 now, just with the hirings in the last 2 months, more than 70 different engineers and developers that we have on the team down in Austin, we're going to keep that headquarters there. We're going to build that technology base for us, and it's something that we think gives us great legs to grow on. Understanding the athlete of -- we've got a user base now of more than 20 million people that understands the habits, the routine. It's amazing when you balance the fact that when someone goes for a run, some people go for 2 miles and some people go for 4 miles. But when you aggregate 20 million people and find out the average run is 3.1 miles, it's one of those things that's saying how can we learn information from that. And probably the last thing I'd say about this space, globally, this thing is only in English today. And so, one of the approaches that Robin and the team have -- and I was doing a tour through Latin America, actually, as we're going and finishing the acquisition. And it was amazing just sitting in Brazil and dropping Robin an email and saying, \"How many in Brazil?\" And it's 100,000 in Brazil.\" And the site's not even translated into Portuguese, let alone Spanish. 2 million in U.K, 600,000 in Australia of all places, 50,000 in Mexico. So we're quickly going down the road of translation, quickly going to use this to help us with our international growth and footprint also. So we're incredibly excited about the deal, everything. And first blush [ph] and again [ph], we're are still on honeymoon stage, but everything's going incredibly well, and we're really optimistic at what this is gaining [ph] for Under Armour in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have one question. I was hoping that we could get you to sort of elaborate on Under Armour's dot-com strategy and maybe start with I think with the fourth quarter of last year, you guys had a few website transition issues, some weak conversion rates. Can you maybe start by talking about how your website business has been in the fourth quarter and then how you foresee it in 2014? And also, maybe help us understand maybe a little bit more how Under Armour thinks as a brand about the growth of its website versus the growth of Under Armour on other websites like the dot-com-only players like Amazon as well as some of your key partners like Dick's Sporting Goods. I think it'd be helpful for all of us.", "Brad Dickerson", "Robbie, this is Brad. I'll jump on the front half of that question, if you don't mind, on the dot-com kind of numbers in Q4 and how it relates to '14. So yes, you're right, we had some challenges last year on conversion and all that kind of common metrics on the E-Commerce side last year versus this year. We saw some pretty significant improvements. So that's really a testament to the E-Commerce team during the course of the year getting the site where it needs to be, getting ready for obviously the heavy traffic we expect in Q4. Q4, obviously, is a huge part of the year for us in the E-Commerce side. So we saw pretty much across-the-board that key metrics around traffic, conversion, average order value are really looking in our favor in Q4 year-over-year. That was part of the obvious upside to the fourth quarter. Again, going back to my comment before, we -- a couple of comments before, we serviced our business much better year-over-year. There's no doubt the E-Commerce business benefited from that. We talked a little bit about the tailwind of weather, which we think obviously helped a little bit also. And then I think just in general for our brand, this is an E-Commerce statement, it's also a statement for overall brand, is looking back 90 days, we performed much better in the fourth quarter in a full price -- at full price for our brand compared to what was a very heavily promotional environment, too. So coming out of that, beyond our expectations, that also helped the E-Commerce side in the fourth quarter. Looking at 2014, this is also, I've got to comment, E-Commerce also the rest of our business, as we roll out of this great fourth quarter we just had, looking at it, and we're really a couple of weeks into this kind of gathering of data, looking at it and saying what does it mean for Q4 next year and the back half of the year. Again, E-Commerce is heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, so our teams are still kind of working through that, what's the right level of expectation in the fourth quarter for us coming off this great fourth quarter this year. But the good news here is that the metrics, again, conversion, traffic conversion, average order value, all seem to be working in the right direction for us year-over-year. But with Jason LaRose on board now, our new leader, we are really focused not just on the good results we're having right now but what do we do in 2015 and beyond to keep this momentum going. And maybe I'll let Kevin jump on top of that one.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, I think the best place to start with this, and Brad just hit on it, is leadership, plain and simple. The addition -- it's unfortunate that I think we've gotten a bit of a reputation about executives in our team, but we don't get [ph] the press release 2 times, the ones that are doing so well for us. So we made 2 key additions last year. We had several but 2 I'll highlight is on the Direct-to-Consumer side. Number one, Susie McCabe running our retail division, who came to us from Polo, Ralph Lauren; And then Jason LaRose, who's heading up E-Commerce. And so, again, while they're both in that 120-, 160-day opening window, I think the leadership changes are something that's been incredibly significant. And you're going to see that as we begin to, I think, grasp the fact that this community is growing in an amazingly fast way. Mobile for us today is 40% of our business, to ua.com, and I think if go back 2 or 3 years, it was like 3%. So we're quickly, I think, modifying and adjusting ourselves to a mobile world and what that means. And also, what Jason is doing is building out our International E-Commerce team. He's taken some of our best and brightest talent that we have in the company and focusing them on our International E-Commerce and doing that for Charlie Maurath and what we're doing on a global basis. I don't know if the model's been written as to how we're supposed to go about being a global company. And so, getting translation, becoming local in markets. And again, this is much bigger than just putting a site up in German. I mean, the supply chain, the logistics, all the components, we -- the system side of it. Another thing to call out on the leadership side, we just hired a new CIO, a gentleman named Chris Gates, who joins us from GE Lighting, and Chris is one of those guys who's going to help us understand the global footprint because when I -- again, when I say website, it's so much more than just having a site that translates in a local language. And so, we feel like we're just getting started here. We feel that E-Com, it's not earth shattering by any stretch. It, obviously, is the future. And it means that we don't feel that we have to go to a market and open 3,000 stores in order to be relevant there, it's that we can use the Web as something to be thoughtful and strategic with it and also to test grounds and to find out how developed we are. And so, we're going to have a little bit of balance. It's something that consumers can walk into stores and feel and touch. And then we're also going to understand that Black Friday wasn't about jumping into a crowded mall as much this year. There were a lot of people who stayed home and shopped on their laptops this year. So I think we're open to all those things. I think our partners, at the same time, Robbie, to sort of address that, are looking at it the same way. We've got a few key partners. I think this space is still evolving in a really fast way when you think about the pure players that are out there also. Our partners and Dick's is -- were looking for ways, particularly the MapMyFitness acquisition also, is Robin and his team are looking and how can we help the category and what can we do for Dick's Sporting Goods, how can we drive Foot Locker and Macy's and how can we help our key partners, some of the traffic that we can drive and some of the use that we'll be seeing from traffic coming through ua.com or the MapMyFitness platform.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Brad, I wanted to ask you just a couple of questions. Number one, if you could help maybe put some numbers around the improvement in fill rates, when that started to happen, how much better you guys have gotten and whether you think there's more to go? And then secondly, if you could talk just a little bit about more broadly on the supply chain where you talked about strides that you've made and how encouraged you feel about the go-forward, just some of the specific areas where you've see an improvement in metrics that they have?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure. On the fill rates side, yes, definitely saw improvements coming into the back half of the year, especially, as we worked through some of the issues that we had last year in the back half of the year. So fill rates in general were improving as we worked through the back half of the year. In the fourth quarter, in general, if you looked at kind of our normal fill rate by cancel date, we were probably in about the mid-80s in the fourth quarter last year, and this year we're much closer to the mid-90s. So like I said in my prepared remarks, definitely a tailwind there and help from our supply chain side of servicing the business much better year over year. We do see those fill rates stabilizing here as we get into the front half of the year. As I've always said, the supply chain is a very complex area. There's always going to be challenges here and there. But in general, we see fill rates stabilizing in the front half of the year and again comping -- again, we were improving our fill rates last year in the front half of the year. But really, more towards the back half of the year is where they kicked in. So we'll see a little bit of a benefit from that in the front half of the year, too, as we work through the first 6 months of 2014. In general, supply chain, a lot of things here. It's people, it's process, it's systems. A lot of additional leadership coming on board. Since Jim Hardy came on board 2 years ago, he's bringing additional leaders, putting people in the right places. That helps, again, getting more discipline and processes around how we buy inventory and how we demand -- how we forecast the demand of revenues going forward. We talked a lot about in our Investor Day and in previous earnings calls around the 3-year planning process and the huge benefit that should have to our supply chain longer term as we can get out ahead of our design development time frame and we'll be able to predict capacity more efficiently and the timing of the need of demand also. So those will be things that -- the 3-year planning process is rolling into its second year right now. You should start to see some benefit of that as we probably start working towards the back half of this year but even more so in 2015. We did talk about some system changes we've done on the supply planning side last year, the demand planning side this year and with the regional [ph] agility planning systems. We're seeing some of the benefits of the supply system we put in place last year. We're still working through implementation on the demand side this year. So again, we should start to see more benefit to get to the back half of this year and into '15. So overall, I'd say a little ahead of schedule. Still have some challenges to work through, and Jim would be the first one to admit that, I'm sure. But we're really pleased with where we are right now compared to where we were about 18 months ago and definitely on track to be ahead of where we thought we'd be over the course of the next couple of years.", "Kevin A. Plank", "And also, just jumping on the end of that, and look we had a banner quarter, and hats off really to our entire team. But I think it's important as we call out things, and Jim Hardy is now 2 years in the job and Chris Gates, who just got here 5 minutes ago, and the foundation that was laid by the balance of our team and guys like Jody Giles and Mike Fafaul that really laid the foundation for our organization to run forward like this. So any way, I just want to give a great shout out to those guys and the entire supply chain team, who has built and put this -- made this kind of opportunity available to us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon of Canaccord.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Kevin, you talked about some pretty great innovations over the last year, SpeedForm Apollo, ColdGear Infrared. I wanted to hear your thoughts on zippers.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Right. You must have been out at the outdoor retail event.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "I was, yes.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Look, I think it's -- speaking about product, one thing that we found is that when we innovate, that we win. You're seeing it happen on the Apparel side. You're not beginning, but you're continuing to see it happen on the Footwear side, but that's the kind of volumes that we've approached on Apparel. What we found out from 2013 was that things like introducing ColdGear Infrared, and we thought that we'd see really large gains in that product coming in 2014 and that has big plans and had a lot to do with the growth that we saw in 2013, and beginning with the fact the product just works. And it's -- this ceramic print that we have, and there's a lot more technical that goes into it than just that, but it's a terrific product that is great. Charged and Storm Cotton I mentioned on the -- in my script earlier. It didn't exist before 2011. Today, it will be over $300 million business. The things like Alter Ego that we got up and down just inside of a year, so introducing this new category of novelty for us where it's not just going to be how many Batman and Superman shirts we sell this year. We still see a growing and good business there, but introducing this idea that the consumer wants a new story from us and a way to introduce these technical products in new ways that's beyond just the fit, fabric and function, but it's doing it in a fun way. And so I think it's important that the brands have fun, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do that. As you mentioned as well, Camilo, it's going into things like MagZip. It's the simplest innovations that we have. And you got to go -- there's a great quote that's out there that says, \"Whoever invents the next white t-shirt wins.\" I felt like that's what was did in 1996. Was it earth shattering? Was it groundbreaking? It was so simple and so subtle. And so we're doing that every place where we can find innovation. Several years ago, we set a challenge for our innovation team, our commercialization team to build a better zipper. And no more the zippers, when you sit down, the bottom pops and you can't find, when you're wearing a big pair of gloves, you can't zip it because the male and female are too small. So we made something called MagZip, which is the first one-arm zipper. And it came from an innovation from someone that we found up living in the Northeast whose father had lost use of an arm and all of a sudden recognized that -- and he lived by himself and so is there a better way to make a zipper. And so we're putting that innovation, and into more than 400,000 jackets. And so a couple of stories you learn there is great. First of all, our consumer wins because you've got a better zipper and nobody has ever thought about innovating that. And that's what Under Armour's doing. There is no level. So we'll be innovating at the high end with things like Armour39 and MapMyFitness and at the simple end [ph] with things like -- with MagZip. And also, the partner, the entrepreneur wins. And we're setting an example for every entrepreneur out there in the world to know if you have a great idea, bring it to Under Armour because we're humble enough to know that we don't have all the great ideas, and we want to encourage that to be this open place, this open source where people are bringing them. And we do a great job as editors of curating for the general population of what should be out there. I'll probably -- if you don't mind, I'll take a minute on the Footwear side as we're running out of time here. But I believe we're innovating. When we innovate, we win. You're seeing that happen with SpeedForm Apollo. As I mentioned, we've got a large media event this afternoon at Grand Central Station where did a takeover. And we're seeing the same thing. We did it with Highlight Cleat, and I think really a breakthrough product for us. It showed us that we could be the #1 item of footwear in the market when it comes to something as close to our backyard as the sport of football. But then we also have products that we're updating and getting better. The Anatomix Spawn, which is something we're the fourth leading vote getter for the NBA All-Star team with Stephen Curry who wore that specific basketball shoe on the court this year. So this isn't some code that we're not capable of cracking, it's just a matter of time. And it's happening, and we see the brand moving in the right direction. Finally [ph], Evo is another great product we have right now. And then, of course, the Cadillac that we're really excited about is the SpeedForm Evo. And you've heard me say before that Under Armour hasn't built its defining product yet. This may very well be our next defining product. And I'm not ready to claim that it is, but it has that type of potential. The first shoe built completely in a clothing factory made with that idea and focused on fit, form and function. And it's something that we've got the kudos from people like Competitor magazine rating it best innovation, to Runner's World having that as its best introduction as well, so -- or as the best debut product that they'll have. So we feel like we're really beginning to balance our brand out, apparel, Footwear, and bringing the pieces together. And we know it's going to take time, but we're very encouraged by what we saw in 2013 and the results that we were able to post, that the brand has ever been in better position. We've never been better positioned with kids, which is something we haven't talked about on the call. But there is a -- it seems like there's a real accelerator behind the brand right now. It's something that gives us tremendous excitement and momentum leading in 2014.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "That's great. And then just my follow-up for Brad. Just more on the numbers and on ASP front. With all this innovation, we'll take the MagZip as an example, what kind of price increases would you expect to see on a ColdGear Infrared jacket and just generally on ASPs into next year with all of this innovation coming into the product line?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, it's tough to say in general. But I think ASPs, we've seen pretty consistently over the last few quarters be a couple of percentage points, kind of mid-single-digits up overall. In general, I think that's, again, being driven a lot by innovation and products like ColdGear Infrared. Obviously, our growth story is unit growth, but ASPs are definitely helping us a little bit, too, again more defined towards the innovation and new products we're putting out there in the marketplace. So as far as ColdGear next -- ColdGear Infrared next year, sure we'll look at the price points as we grow that product line. We're still working on final price points for fall/winter to some degree, but you could definitely see an increase in price points of around 10% or so maybe on the ColdGear Infrared side.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Best of luck. And Kevin, I love the Colo-Colo jerseys.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy of Janney Capital.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great quarter, great year. Kevin, I guess if I could for you, maybe just tee you up a little bit more on the international front, provide sort of a learning from Charlie and his team, where we sort of stand. I know it's not going to inflect materially here over the next 12 months, but any update on the international front would be great.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, thanks very much, Eric. First of all, we're learning a lot. I think we had a great quarter but there are still a lot of things that we are just beginning to get going in. And especially when you look at the international front. We're in different stages of growth in really all parts of the world, from the U.S., to Japan, to Europe, to China. But we're incredibly encouraged, I think. We're confident that the brand does translate. And as long as we execute and we do the things that we're supposed to do, we've got a real chance to live and fulfill that mission of being a true global brand where someday, more than half of our revenues will come from outside of our home country. So first of all, from a leadership standpoint, Charlie's doing really well for us and building out his team. And I think as we're as at about the 18-month mark with Charlie being on board, he might have broken the record and he's definitely, a Chairman [ph] flyer for United or anybody else. So he's been running all over the world, I think doing a great job there. And basically, though, we're in a position to do all of this, though, because of the strength of the core business, obviously. We use that statement that what's happening in North America for us, that our North American growth and cash creation are going to be the engines that feed our global ambitions for us as a company. If you look across the globe, though, let's just start with Latin America, which is where Charlie really came from, and we really put an emphasis on in his first chapter here at Under Armour. Under Armour Mexico [ph] was an acquisition that we just transitioned successfully beginning in 2014 and really highlighted by the new specialty store that we opened in Mexico City. And again, it's exceeding all the expectations that we had, but again another learning for us of what could be in the Mexican market for us. Brazil, probably top of mind for everyone, but we have a March launch planned for Brazil. We're really going into the [indiscernible] market in time for World Cup and in time, obviously, for the Olympics in '16. But we have an incredibly professional team there. We're starting a premium distribution with Centauro [ph] in places like [indiscernible]. More than 70 shop-in-shops that we'll have at the time of -- by the middle of 2014. Chile as well, Camilo just mentioned the Colo-Colo launch that we had, probably the largest -- one of the largest soccer teams in Chile and really, I think, puts us on the map as we'll continue to attract and go after big assets, big important assets all over the globe. But Latin America, obviously, where global football is something that we can double down. Europe, if I could, it really feels like a tipping point is close. We're really proud of the team, what they've done and the work that's happened in Europe. We'll be crossing $100 million this year for the first time, which is a massive, massive undertaking. And so, as we sit here 8 years in, we're very proud of that team. And more importantly, we're just as believer in what the opportunity in the future looks like. Tottenham, our EPL club there, also is doing well, sitting in fifth place. Tough loss yesterday, but they'll be back to fight another day. And then finally, rounding out in Asia, our partners in Japan are continuing to do incredibly well. The currency exchange hurt us a little bit there from a -- showing up on a growth standpoint. But the brand is getting stronger and our leadership team there is just terrific. Moving down is -- into China. As I mentioned earlier, 13 total stores in '13, growing to more than 50 stores by the end of '14 as well, primarily utilizing a franchise model for that. And then we also did this big experience store in China, which just goes to say is that when we invest there and we invest in the right things and smart things, that we have a chance to win. And so, not a lot of update on the international front, but we feel really good about our Investor Day targets of moving from 6% to 7% of business to more than 12% by 2016. So we'll continue to hold strong and live up to that.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Really helpful. And let me just -- a second question here. A bit more structural for -- Kevin, for you, and for Brad, in terms of the top line. It seems like cold weather didn't really have a major catalyst in 4Q. Fill rates are moving meaningfully higher. The strength in the core Apparel in North America, layering in Footwear, DTC is still strong. What am I missing? Or what is the potential kind of roadblock in terms of really inflecting to a higher growth rate over the next 12, 24 months? I'm just trying to reconcile the 35% there versus kind of pulling back. I understand you guys want to be conservative, but is there something that's sort of prohibiting from that growth rate to inflect a little bit more aggressively?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. Let me -- and I know -- I'm going to let Brad answer this, but I just want to be clear as well, is that no question, a great quarter. I heard years ago was that when the weather gets cold, I think we all get a little bit smarter in our industry. So it definitely had an effect. But I think, to Brad's point, there's a lot more to it. So I'm going to let Brad dig deeper on that.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Eric, if you look at the front half versus back half, so we've talked about some of the things working in our favor in the front half, again comping some -- a little bit tougher supply chain challenges last year and feeling better about that this year. We also talked about, obviously, our Footwear business and a lot of that growth coming out of the first half of the year. We feel pretty good about that. Obviously, visibility for the front half of the year for us is very, very strong at this point, obviously. The back half of the year, the visibility gets a little bit more tougher for us, especially in the fourth quarter. Again, we're just coming out of this really strong fourth quarter of 35% growth, and what does that mean to our Q4 forecast for next year in our DTC business and our wholesale business. So teams are working through that right now. So there's -- but we'll get more visibility to orders in the fourth quarter. As we work through the first quarter of this year, that'll also be a great data point for us on the next earnings call. So we should have a better idea of what that back half of the year looks like, specifically in our DTC and the wholesale businesses in the fourth quarter. Also, we talked about International growth expansion. It's weighted towards the back half of the year for a lot of the reasons Kevin talked about and the markets we're entering towards the back half of the year. And the realization is, is that we obviously are planning to execute flawlessly in going into these markets, but we want to be cautious because we are entering some new markets for us. So just give ourselves a little bit of room here in the back half of the year, if there's any execution challenges on launching some markets, which is always a very, very complex process in itself. So that's kind of what you're seeing, good visibility front half, a little less visibility in the back half. We have to work through Q4 orders with our customers during the first quarter. And now DTC teams need to work through just what is the cold weather impact from Q4 this year, how much of that do we want to build into next year's forecast, again what is the overall strength of the fourth quarter this year relate to the fourth quarter of next year. So as I said in my prepared remarks, as we get towards the next earnings call, we should have a lot more visibility into the back half of the year.", "Kevin A. Plank", "All right, Operator, given the time, we're going to conclude the call. But we really want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to reporting to you our first quarter 2014 results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Thursday, April 24, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Thanks again, and goodbye.", "Brad Dickerson", "We have one final [indiscernible], we've got a tradition with this, but this year the prediction will be Broncos 38, Seahawks 28. All right. We'll see who'll win. But have a great holiday, everybody. Thanks very much. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Thanks and good morning to everyone joining us in today's third quarter conference call.", "During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO, followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the third quarter, provide an update to our 2014 outlook and introduce our preliminary 2015 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m.", "Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. On our last earnings call in July, I spoke to the diversity of Under Armour, the diversity in having our revenues spread more evenly across product categories and geographies, the diversity in whom our brand is now reaching and the diversity in how we reach both our existing and new consumers across the globe.", "With revenues up 30%, Q3 marks our fourth consecutive quarter of total revenue growth of 30% or higher and our 18th consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20%. This consistent outperformance speaks to the continued strength of the athletic cycle that we have significantly helped drive over the past few years. But more importantly, it illustrates the Under Armour brand's ability to thrive beyond our core North American Apparel business and help feed our diversification.", "The best evidence of that is in the performance of our Footwear and International businesses over the first 9 months of 2014. We've detailed how we've continually invested in both of these growth drivers over the past few years, building the infrastructure needed to grow and adding talent to supplement the team. So we provided some detail that confirms return on the investments we've made in these 2 key growth drivers.", "Let's begin with Footwear. As we said in our release earlier this morning, our Footwear business grew 50% in Q3, while our International business was up 94%. In terms of the contribution to the overall revenue growth, Footwear and International have added nearly $200 million to our growth through the first 9 months of this year and together accounted for 35% of our total growth year-to-date. What's more encouraging than the actual numbers is the strength of the platforms we are building in these businesses that will lay the foundation for sustainable growth in 2015 and beyond.", "Let me talk first about our growth globally and the investments we are making in all corners of the globe. To reinforce our focus on building that global organization, I am dialing into this call today from our office in Hong Kong on 1 of 5 stops I'm making throughout Asia as part of our continued focus on bringing the Under Armour brand to that global audience.", "Whether it's visits to our newest retail doors in Chengdu, China, Tokyo and Singapore, or conversations with potential partners about next-generation technology, visiting these markets reinforces the opportunity that we have to grow the Under Armour brand.", "Ensuring we bring the right balance of Under Armour culture and international experience to our global leadership team has been a major focus for me over the past 24 months. We've done a great job of using our own team to build and establish the Under Armour culture in any market we do business in, especially Europe and China. We believe this process enables us to appropriately establish the Under Armour culture outside the U.S., then transition in a level of industry experience that will help accelerate our growth in these critical markets.", "So first, in Europe, where we began doing business back in 2006, our business faced challenges reaching scale. So we placed Matt Shearer, who is running our business in Canada in market and he has helped stabilize and get our brand and business headed in the right direction. We are making great progress in key markets in Europe and we will surpass $100 million in revenue for the first time this year.", "With this stability in place, we were able to recently recruit industry vet Chris Bate, who brings significant on-the-ground expertise to our team in Europe, while Matt will continue to offer his leadership with the business back here in North America.", "And while the markets of China and Europe could not be more distinct, our strategy of balancing Under Armour culture and industry experience is consistent in these 2 geographies.", "In China, Kevin Eskridge, who originally helped drive our successful Outdoor business in the United States, has done a tremendous job overseeing the growth of our brand and retail presence in China. Our plan is for 2015 to bring Kevin and his experience in running our China business back to Baltimore where he can then influence our global perspective.", "As we transition homegrown talent like Kevin back to the U.S., we are bringing in Erick Haskell, who comes to UA with a strong sporting goods track record in Asia, especially China.", "Seeing how well our brand is being presented in these fast-growing markets outside the U.S. and knowing we are staying true to the culture of who we are as a brand gives me great confidence that we are building the foundation for a much larger version of what you see from us today. But to do so, we need to continually attract talent that brings experience and dimension to the organization.", "What I've learned in building Under Armour is that there is no substitution for grade-A people, and that bringing fresh yet experienced talent into the Under Armour brand is what will continue to drive our growth and goal of being the #1 athletic brand in the world.", "I mentioned our new leadership in Europe and China, but beyond that we've just added Kerry Chandler as our Chief Human Resources Officer, who brings 20-plus years of global experience from places like Christie's International, the NBA and ESPN. In her role, Kerry will help us continue to attract and develop our top talent.", "Additionally, at the board level, Karen Katz, the CEO of Neiman Marcus Group, has joined our Board of Directors. We look forward to Karen's perspective and experience as we continue to navigate our path in both global and omni-channel retail.", "So I'm incredibly excited about the terrific new additions to our team and very proud of the efforts that our current stable has made to help create what we've built to date.", "So turning to Footwear. We saw our third consecutive quarter of 30-plus percent revenue growth and expect to finish the year with a business over $400 million. We continue to gain traction in the large categories of running and basketball. And much like where we stand in our International growth curve, we are just getting started in Footwear.", "With the great reaction to our SpeedForm launch earlier this year, we are broadening the platform significantly in 2015. Next spring, we will see the launch of the SpeedForm Gemini with charged cushioning at $130 retail and SpeedForm Vent at $100 retail that features a super-lightweight and breathable material in the upper that was originally developed for our Apparel line. We are taking the SpeedForm technology developed for a single shoe into a broader platform that will enable us to reach a broader range of consumers and gain share on the shoe wall as well.", "In basketball, where we entered the business just 4 years ago, we're seeing double-digit sell-throughs with the $130 ClutchFit Drive Stephen Curry wore during the FIBA Basketball World Cup. Stephen will transition into his first signature shoe later this season, but you'll see us start to work the ClutchFit technology across our basketball assets, whether it's college programs like Notre Dame, St. John's or Maryland, and also over in China with the newest member of the Under Armour basketball team, Emmanuel Mudiay, who'll be playing in the Chinese Basketball Association this season and most likely the NBA starting the next.", "I love talking about our successes in Footwear, given the steep learning curve we know exists in the business. We are successfully making that transition from a company learning how to make great shoes into a truly disruptive voice in the global footwear market. We did it last year with the Highlight Cleat for football and came back this season selling almost 50% more at a retail price $20 higher than last year.", "With the mission of being #1 in every footwear category where we compete, we know we have a lot of work ahead as we surpass $400 million this year. We ultimately believe Footwear should be as big, if not bigger, than our Apparel business, and our momentum is helping attract the talent and develop the team that will help make that statement a reality.", "So we talked in our last call about the growth potential we have in the Women's category and the opportunity to reach a new consumer. We focused our second Brand Holiday this year starting in late July on Women's, and we realized within 1 day or 2 days after the launch of the Misty Copeland commercial that we had a game-changing campaign on our hands.", "The I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign, initially with Misty and later on with Gisele B\u00fcndchen, immediately struck a chord with women, with the 2 commercials generating over 13 million views across YouTube and Under Armour sites. It was difficult to turn on a TV or open a magazine in the United States without seeing the overwhelmingly positive coverage of the campaign.", "The campaign also gained traction outside the U.S., with Misty's appearance in Paris and Gisele driving interest in her home country of Brazil. The campaign drove tremendous traffic to our E-Commerce site, primarily women, 70% of which were new consumers to Under Armour. These consumers engaged with our brand and more than 350,000 of them downloaded the brand new I WILL WHAT I WANT app, our first effort into bringing the MapMyFitness technology into our brand communications.", "And while the reaction to the campaign was rewarding, more importantly, it struck a chord with women, resonating with her beyond the field, the pitch or the court. The success of the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign positions us extremely well as we continue to build out the product and distribution to expand our reach from the female athlete to the athletic female.", "But even as we expand the reach of our brand to new consumers and geographies, we remain extremely focused on the continued development of our North American wholesale business. Under Armour is a brand built in America, no question. We will reach the $3 billion mark this year and still have more than 90% of our revenues coming from the United States.", "Our core Apparel business, the majority of which is sold through our wholesale partners, grew more than 20% for the 20th consecutive quarter. That's 5 years of consistent growth. So we clearly understand the value of protecting and growing that asset. And to that end, we're focused on continuing that growth streak by being better partners with our wholesale accounts in 2015.", "For Under Armour, that has and always will start with product, whether it's introducing our best base layer ever next spring, appropriately named Armour; or a more focused training assortment; or even expanding our lifestyle offerings, we will continue to bring innovation and relevance to these categories in exciting ways in 2015, as well as improve our speed to market.", "Beyond these steps, we are also laser-focused on improving our merchandising expertise, specifically as it relates to our wholesale partners. We've seen the benefit of this effort within our own Direct-to-Consumer and International channels. And we will enable our North American wholesale partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports, Sports Authority, Hibbett Sports, Cabela's, Foot Locker and the Finish Line, as well as all of our key wholesale partners around the globe, to present distinct points of view on Under Armour within all their doors.", "It was almost a year ago that we announced our acquisition of MapMyFitness and the changes in landscape in the Connected Fitness space have been significant, with new entrants, new platforms and new technologies getting a lot of the press.", "Since the acquisition, we've focused our energy on 2 areas: Building the user base by making our platform the most accessible and productive in the space; and better understanding what consumers want and need in this next generation of Connected Fitness.", "On the first piece, we have grown our global Connected Fitness community from 20 million at the time of the acquisition to more than 30 million users today. That means we are averaging upwards of 30,000 people a day, with that number surging on peak days to over 50,000 joining the site. And with the progress we've had adding languages and product enhancement, our goal is to have over 100 million users in the next several years. These numbers clearly illustrate the opportunity digital provides Under Armour to reach our consumer in a fitness-focused environment.", "What's truly compelling to us is what that platform provides in terms of helping our users proactively manage their own health and fitness. We understand the opportunity is massive, and we will share our point of view on how UA plans to drive thought leadership to the entire Connected Fitness category starting in early 2015 at CES in Las Vegas.", "So to wrap it up, I want to talk about UA reaching the $3 billion mark this year and what that means for us going forward. Are we proud of the 30% CAGR, both top and bottom line that we delivered since going public 9 years ago? No question. But milestones just leave us thinking about what's coming and how we need to organize to become an even bigger and stronger brand.", "We believe that our brand is so much greater than the $3 billion we are projecting this year. Our International business will still be less than 10% of our total revenues for 2014 and we foresee a day where it is at least half our business.", "Footwear will be less than 15% of the business in 2014 and we can envision it can be larger than our Apparel business someday. Our Women's business, which is over $500 million today, is still less than half the size of our Men\u2019s business, and we still believe it should be as big or bigger than our Men's category.", "The opportunity and appetite around the world for Under Armour is abundant, as I'm seeing firsthand on this trip, and we understand that great execution will be critical to our path to becoming the #1 athletic brand in the world. We will not stop investing in the talent, the infrastructure, the innovation or the product that will enable us to achieve that goal. We are very proud of our performance; however, we are just getting started.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our third quarter 2014 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2014 and our preliminary thoughts on 2015.", "Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2014 increased 30% to $938 million. Similar to last quarter, we saw tremendous traction during the third quarter in areas such as Direct-to-Consumer, International and Footwear.", "Looking at the details of the third quarter. We grew the Apparel category 26% to $705 million compared to $561 million in the prior year's quarter. This marks the 20th consecutive quarter of at least 20% year-over-year growth for our largest product category.", "One of the keys to our Apparel growth in recent quarters comes from our ability to develop platform innovations and expand the reach of those -- these innovations across product categories. This has driven sustained growth in our 2 large platforms launched in 2011, Charged Cotton and Storm, and it is evident in ColdGear Infrared, which was launched just last year and has expanded within Apparel to areas like golf and running.", "Within Apparel, our Men\u2019s business was led by continued strength in Golf and Outdoor. In Women's, we saw solid gains in studio, sports bras and outdoor. And in Youth, we experienced broad-based strength across both training and sports-specific categories.", "Third quarter Footwear net revenues increased 50% to $122 million from $81 million in the prior year, representing approximately 13% of net revenues for the period. Expanded running silhouettes were the primary growth driver as we continued our focus on more balanced price points across our sporting goods distribution, while also beginning to broaden offerings across our SpeedForm platform. While off a small base, we also experienced strong growth in our basketball business during the quarter, led by the new ClutchFit Drive.", "Our Accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 32% to $85 million from $64 million last year. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by headwear offerings and gloves.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 35% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues. Square footage in our North America Factory House channel grew 18% year-over-year. This growth reflects a total of 102 -- 122 Factory House stores at the end of the quarter, up 9% from the third quarter of 2013, as well as the upsizing of some existing locations. On the full price side, we remained at 5 Brand House stores in North America.", "We continue to see strong momentum in our E-Commerce channel, where we are driving strong traffic gains through efforts such I WILL WHAT I WANT Women's campaign. During the quarter, we also updated our domestic ua.com platform to better optimize the mobile experience, while also launching new local sites in the U.K., Germany and France.", "International net revenues increased 94% to $86 million in the third quarter and represented 9% of total net revenues. In Europe, our strong results throughout the year have been driven by a combination of higher brand awareness and a more focused in-country strategy around our 3 key markets of the U.K., Germany and France.", "In Asia Pacific, we continue to build both wholesale and distributor relationships, including accelerated partner store openings throughout Greater China and Southeast Asia.", "Finally, in Latin America, our business benefited from the conversion of our Mexico distributor to an Under Armour subsidiary at the beginning of 2014, as well as our recent market entries into Brazil and Chile.", "Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins expanded approximately 120 basis points to 49.6% compared with 48.4% in the prior year's quarter. Three primary factors contributed to this performance during the quarter: first, we lapped higher U.S. import duties from the year ago period, contributing approximately 90 basis points for the quarter; second, we experienced a favorable sales mix during the period, primarily driven by a more profitable product mix across our Factory House channel, contributing approximately 70 basis points for the quarter; finally, liquidations negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 40 basis points, driven by the shift in Footwear liquidations into the third quarter that we highlighted on our last call.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 230 basis points to 34% in the third quarter of 2014 from 31.7% in the prior year's period. Specific details around our 4 SG&A buckets are as follows: first, marketing costs increased to 10.6% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.3% in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher year-over-year sports marketing sponsorships across our International businesses; second, selling costs increased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.1% in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher variable costs tied to the growth in our North America Direct-to-Consumer business, as well as increased investments to support our global retail store strategies; third, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 8.5% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.3% in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product innovation costs, including our Connected Fitness efforts, as well as higher personnel costs in Footwear and International; finally, corporate services held steady year-over-year at 6% of net revenues.", "Operating income for the third quarter increased 21% to $146 million compared with $121 million in the prior year period. Operating margin contracted 110 basis points during the quarter to 15.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year period.", "Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased to $5 million compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency.", "Our third quarter tax rate of 36.9% was favorable to the 39.4% rate last year, primarily driven by lower year-over-year losses across international markets in aggregate.", "Our third quarter net income increased 22% to $89 million compared to $73 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $0.41 compared to $0.34 in the prior year period.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter increased 34% to $249 million compared with $186 million at September 30, 2013.", "Long-term debt increased to $192 million from $54 million at September 30, 2013. Inventory increased 28% year-over-year to $637 million compared to $497 million at September 30, 2013, below our net revenue growth rate for the period.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $26 million for the third quarter compared with $23 million in the prior year period. We continue to plan 2014 capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, primarily driven by incremental investments to support our Direct-to-Consumer and International businesses, further develop and expand our global office footprint and increase capacity at our distribution centers.", "Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2014. Based on current visibility, we expect 2014 net revenues of approximately $3.03 billion, representing growth of 30%; and 2014 operating income of approximately $348 million, representing growth of 31%. Both expected growth rates are outpacing the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day in June 2013.", "Below operating results, we continue to anticipate moderately higher interest expense in 2014, primarily reflecting the $150 million term loan closed in May. We expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 40%, ahead of last year's 37.8% rate, given investments to support our International expansion and the inclusion of a state tax credit in 2013.", "Given these updated full year parameters, there are several factors to consider for the fourth quarter. First, on net revenues. We continue to make -- to take a more balanced approach in planning the business around weather expectations for the fourth quarter as compared to last year, especially in our Direct-to-Consumer business, which represented approximately 40% of our total business during the fourth quarter last year.", "Our gross margin rate is expected to decline approximately 100 basis points year-over-year, given a higher mix impact of our International business, which is more weighted toward lower-margin distributor businesses during the period and also reflecting some currency headwinds given the strength in the U.S. dollar. As we have mentioned, our approach to planning our fourth quarter business also factors into the gross margin outlook for the period.", "In SG&A, we continue to expect significant leverage during the fourth quarter, particularly in corporate services, given prior year higher incentive compensation expenses and MapMyFitness deal-related costs. As we have previously indicated, we remain opportunistic in investing incremental dollars during the fourth quarter in the event of more favorable than planned net revenues or gross margin rate.", "Finally, on the balance sheet, we continue to expect inventory growth will remain relatively in line with net revenue growth during the fourth quarter.", "Before we turn it over for Q&A, we'd also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2015. Based on our current visibility, we are planning 2015 net revenues and operating income to each grow approximately 22%, in the range of our long-term growth rates established at our 2013 Investor Day.", "Based on these numbers, we wanted to outline several preliminary factors to consider for 2015. First, similar to 2014, the net revenue growth rate for each of our International, Direct-to-Consumer and Footwear businesses is planned to outpace the growth rate of our overall business.", "Second, within the operating income line, we are planning for gross margin gains relatively consistent with 2014, balanced with SG&A investments to support both near- and long-term global growth opportunities, including International, Retail and Connected Fitness.", "Finally, we expect elevated capital expenditures during the year. On top of a normalized capital expenditures growth rate, we plan to invest approximately $90 million more in 2 key projects to support our future growth: a new Southeast distribution center in North America and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore. We will provide further color on 2015 during our earnings call in January.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Kevin, I actually just have one question. I was hoping -- you guys touched I think even more than ever on International and you mentioned being in Hong Kong and everything. Could you just sort of lay out for us which markets are the greatest focus for Under Armour right now and, say, over the next 3 years? Is it China that's the biggest opportunity or is it still LatAm? Or is Europe coming on stronger? And could you move beyond those 3 key European markets you mentioned? Maybe if you could just sort of give us a big picture how we should be thinking about International for Under Armour over the next 3 years.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes, great. So let me take a minute and actually go a little bit deeper here. And I think it's that important and obviously wanted to make a statement with, was actually trying to balance my travel schedule with this call and just thinking, it's part of what we're doing as a company, so we might as well just embrace the office that we've had for a number of years. So I think there's 3 real components, the first of which is leadership. Since bringing Charlie Maurath on the team, he's really done a terrific job, I think, driving for Under Armour. Number one, laying out our strategy with -- most importantly, the ability to implement behind it, but also, just as importantly, is building out our team. As we mentioned in my script, I spoke about the addition of Chris Bate, who's now in full control and running our European business. And again, with the trajectory there of that business heading over $100 million, very important for us. Our new Head of China, Erick Haskell, who's actually going to start for us probably around the second quarter of 2015, with the transition will take place in China. But again, bringing in an industry pro with over 20 years experience that can really hit the ground running for us and building off of the momentum that was built by Kevin there prior to his landing. And then thirdly, the addition of a guy named Fernando Pina, who joins us, again, with a 20-year experience in growing and building out a European fleet of stores as well within our industry. So we're really bringing, I think, the talent together. And ending with Fernando, I think it's a good way just to talk about the stores that we have coming up. So let me give you some perspective. We've got roughly -- by the end of '14, we'll have roughly 80 global Brand House stores. And you may be thinking about what it looks like in SoHo in New York City with 14,000 square feet, but globally, it's a bit of a different story. Our stores can range anywhere from 1,000 to, call it, 6,000 square feet, of course, without ruling out larger flagship opportunities. With the culture of Under Armour, that would be profitable and make money, but things that can be more statement retail. Where we are today is building out a philosophy because the majority of those stores, the 80 stores we'll have outside the United States, the majority of them actually will be in Greater China. So to give you a little perspective on that, as we think about -- just my trip, and let me just tell you where I've been through Asia so far. Going into Tokyo and seeing really the flagship stores we have in Shibuya station and Harajuku as well. I just left -- we were in Chengdu and we've built -- We've got 2 stores there existing and then we're opening up a third store, a 3,300- square foot store at a new mall called Taikoo Li that surrounds the Daci Temple, a 1,500-year-old Buddhist temple. And the store we have there, I think, is really the statement and really the prototype of what we expect to take our mentality looking around Asia and frankly, around the world. In Hong Kong, earlier today, we visited our new store in Causeway Bay, as well as looked at a few new locations. And tomorrow, we're heading to Singapore to take a look at what we have happening there. So the combination of the 80 stores that we have of our Brand Houses, the majority of them our partner-owned stores. Some are through a licensed partner like Dome, about 9 of those, and we've got about a dozen or so that are Under Armour brand-owned stores. We've got stores existing today in Mexico City, Panama City. The Philippines, I spoke about on the last call, the energy there, where we sold our first unit by opening our first store in the Philippines and had 700 people waiting in line. And frankly, the trajectory that we're seeing in Singapore is right in line with that as well. So the momentum for Under Armour is great. As we look at what we have in '14, when we look out to 2015, we see getting -- in our first 19 years in business to the first 80 stores, we'll add over 100 stores outside of North America in 2015. That will help us cover the 62 countries that we're doing -- currently doing business in today. So we have great momentum and, frankly, what that means. In a lot of instances, not unlike I used that Philippine example, but we're using this to help build our brand awareness with the store openings. You know a lot of the global assets we have like Tottenham, Colo-Colo, Cruz Azul, Toluca, the Welsh Rugby Union, et cetera and we'll continue to add assets at that level. And -- but we remain committed to our discipline of 11% of our marketing is that 11% number from our revenues. However, we are overinvesting to the tune of 15% to 16% when we think about our International spend. So we expect to -- we think it's enough money. We think it's the right model. We think we're doing it the right way. This is, obviously, this is not a 1- or 3- or 5-year plan, this is a 10- and 20-year plan that we have really on that trajectory to be the #1 global brand in the world. So I like our progress and I like where we are. And frankly, being in the middle of one of these trips, it gets me incredibly excited about the opportunity that is to come.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Kevin, that sounds great. A group of us are going to be visiting that Causeway Bay store in a few weeks.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Great. Thank you, Robbie.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy of Janney Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Kevin, if I could for you, just to follow up on International, maybe a little bit switching gears to Footwear, and it seems to be inflecting really nicely here. You finally got permission from both retailers and the consumer to grow that business. Talk me through -- do you feel like you've got the supply chain, the infrastructure in place to really scale kind of materially here? Are there still kind of significant investments that need to be made? And then maybe talk a little bit more just about the pipeline refresh as you look into '15. You mentioned some of the SpeedForm, but maybe highlight some other things that we should be thinking about.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Sure. Well, first of all, I mean, we're 10 years in making footwear, we're 8 years having sold footwear. And when you look at -- I mean, just take that long road. So like everything, it begins with leadership. So my original partner in the business, Kip Fulks, who's been driving Footwear for us and doing an excellent job. And as we say that, we've been adding talent really across the organization. One of the highlights we announced most recently was Fritz Taylor joining the organization, heading up Running for us. So we're continuing to build there, and frankly, we are. The goal is not for Kip to be running Footwear 2 years from now and where he reports in the org. But we are in the market looking for that Global Head of Footwear. But the good news is that we've got great leadership in place today that's running and doing a great job for us. That's an open call as we continue to look and let the world know that we're out looking for that next head. Secondly is from a product standpoint. We began in 2006 with football cleats. And the one thing I like to remind people is that '06 was football cleats, '07 baseball, '08 was training, '09 running and '10 was basketball. And it's taken us really 8 years to get to the leadership position, I believe, that we're seeing in cleated. And we anticipate, in time, we'll reach that leadership position in every category we're doing business. But as we sit here, I mentioned the Highlight Cleat, the $130 Highlight Cleat, that in 2013 was $110 shoe for us. This year, it was $130 cleat. And so not only was it the #1 football cleat in the market this season, but it was also the #6 shoe overall for back-to-school according to our good friend, Matt Powell. So we believe that when we have time and we're in market and you ask about supply chain, and those are all the right things because the lead times are so long, the supply chain is so long, it just takes time to be excellent. And so we feel very confident that we've met that bar that we set for ourselves in cleated. And frankly, we're marching that down in other categories. Secondly, I'll speak about running. We've been in running, as I mentioned, just since 2009 and we're incredibly proud of the groundbreaking product that we brought in 2014. And as we saw with the Highlight Cleat that we really brought out around Cam Newton, what we're bringing with the $130 SpeedForm Gemini is a product that we think really has a chance to be a beautiful product for us, too, that this is the product of not an individual athlete, but really a product for the true hard-core runner. And the platform that we launched with SpeedForm is something that we think we can build on. And so that $100 SpeedForm Vent that I mentioned in my script is something that is going to be really exciting with colors and again, the upper is something that is taken right from the heritage of our Apparel expertise. And then coming back with the SpeedForm Gemini, which is actually the official shoe of my trip through Asia and one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my foot. So we believe that running is something where we can win. But frankly, we also look at it and say, as we add a new technology once a year, we think over the long haul, we're really going to pay dividends for ourselves. Basketball is another area. Speaking of top athletes, Stephen Curry, who is our marquee as it relates to basketball, has been playing in the $130 ClutchFit Drive for us. And the special exclusive product that we've made for Stephen, as well as having a signature shoe coming out for him at the end of this year, are things that demonstrate for us that with the right athlete, with the right product, that we can absolutely win there. And I think the market has been looking for someone else that can compete or contend, and I think the Under Armour brand is definitely the one that can do it. Lastly, from just a product category standpoint, is our Youth business. Our Youth business is absolutely on fire. Year-to-date, we've got -- we're the #2 youth shoe in all of sporting goods. And frankly, we're doubling down our investment. We've done this really with limited resources and haven't really put as much effort behind it as the momentum and the success has really called for. So what you're going to see is renewed investment and that's why what's exciting, I think, is seeing the 50% growth number that we achieved this quarter in Footwear. And frankly, just bringing up to my last question, the long-term investment we made in International at 94% growth. When we make these long-term investments and we're behind them and we demonstrate that continuity of leadership and vision, I think the results really speak for themselves. Thirdly, from a distribution standpoint in Footwear, we've got terrific partners in sporting goods. And frankly, you're going to see our partners continue to get more innovative with the way that they're trying to present our products, both from a cleated standpoint, as well as running, as well as basketball and frankly, training. We're going to be testing some new Footwear concepts with some of our key partners, and there's more to come on that, as well as we also look at the terrific partners that we have in the mall channel. And frankly, we're looking for a business as good as our relationships are with the likes of Foot Locker and Finish Line. So 2015 is going to be a great come-out year for us in Footwear. We're excited to get behind the SpeedForm platform in year 2 as we really start to hype up that product and really get it rolling, as well as doubling down on what we see in basketball, youth, cleated and across the board. So lastly, if I just may make a side note to it, is just from a facility standpoint. We've got a new Footwear building opening up in Baltimore in the spring of 2015, as well as expanding our office in Portland is something else we'll do. So reiterating that fact that we believe that Footwear has the ability to be as big or bigger than Apparel is something that really, I think, underscores the message and the confidence and, frankly, the opportunity that exists in our channels of distribution.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I would like if you could just speak a little bit more about the Women's opportunity. I mean, you've obviously had some great campaigns this fall. Any further detail, first, from a near-term perspective, what was the Women's apparel growth rate in the quarter? And then as we think about it longer term, how are you thinking really about the distribution matrix for Women's? Are there new wholesale opportunities you can kind of think about on the horizon that will really maybe perhaps over-index to the more female shopper?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. Thank you, Erinn, great question, and obviously something top of mind with us coming off of the campaign we just went through. So first and foremost, it's really become sort of the topic of the day is getting behind this huge athletic trend that's going on. And frankly, we've been positioning ourselves here to lead that market momentum, and frankly, we see ourselves as one of the ones really driving that momentum. We've been making Women's products since 2003 that we don't get a tremendous amount of credit for. But it really is a testament to the team that we've built, putting a $500 million core business together that in the past had really spoke to -- we've been speaking on these calls about going from both that athletic women and women who are athletes, that they have evolving needs and are going to play a huge part in creating beautiful products, performance products for each and every one of them. The Holiday 2 that we launched was something that I think really spoke and ignited an awareness and conversation with our whole I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. To the point where we're not just making the calls anymore, but the calls are really coming in from us from a distribution standpoint, for instance. I'll speak more on that in just a moment. It was obviously one of our largest campaigns. It was only 1 of 3 Brand Holidays we do for the year. And committing that, frankly, in back-to-school/football season was something, I think, probably took a lot of people by surprise. But I think it really underscores the commitment that we have and the belief that we have in our ability to be successful in this category. As I mention always, it comes down to leadership, and Leanne Fremar continues to drive for us and be a creative force for Under Armour. So we're -- incredibly important to stand behind Leanne. And frankly, as I mentioned the word force, is that the role that we're going to play is a long-term force in Women's as a whole. We've seen tremendous success basically coming off the campaign. Misty Copeland, as I think everyone would agree, is an absolute inspiration to anybody who saw the commercial, but more importantly, the reality behind that story that is Misty's life. And then, frankly, dimensionalizing that by responding with adding Gisele to the roster is something which is really a bit of a pinch-me moment, I think, also for the brand, of just demonstrating the breadth that we have of telling that story and speaking to not only the traditional athlete, but someone who's committed to living an active and healthy life. And that speaks to so many people, again, underscoring that message of not only the female athlete, but moving toward the athletic female. We've seen, again, coming off of the campaign, tremendous success with the product that we featured, particularly through our Direct-to-Consumer channels, but we also saw that in our own accounts. And I'd like to end sort of the Women's part of the discussion today really about distribution. We mentioned the female athlete and frankly, we think that we have, from a distribution standpoint, covered incredibly well where she shops. One thing I will say about our current distribution is that they are hyper-aware of this trend that's happening also. And you can see in many of our sporting goods partners, our key sporting goods partners, that they are working to make enhancements within their own shop displays and layouts as well to be more compelling and more appealing in a more intimate sort of shop experience than I think sporting goods is given credit. So we're very proud, from a distribution standpoint, of the strides that our existing distribution is going to make. But frankly, we're also looking for places where we can reach and we can speak and we can have a conversation with that female consumer in a way that's appropriate and where she's used to shopping. So we're looking for appropriate doors where women shop today that frankly look a lot like our New York City Brand House with the full display of the Women's product line. So I think we've been incredibly proud of what we put up. But I think to underscore the one message it says is that we believe that our Women's business has every right and ability to be as large as our Men\u2019s business. And so we've got a long way to go and we're going to keep working toward that.", "Brad Dickerson", "And Erinn, this is Brad. Just to add on to the growth rate question you asked. All the categories in Apparel grew at a very healthy rate in the quarter, so we don't really break out the different -- the genders and so forth. Obviously, Apparel grew 26% in the quarter and again, all Men's, Women's and Youth were very strong. It's been pretty consistent over the last few quarters. Youth kind of leads the way from a growth rate perspective and that's been consistent here in Q3. But Men's and Women's were also very, very strong.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad of ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "The -- I wanted to ask a question about the Apparel business, maybe has a little bit slower growth than we expected, although still a great number. And we kind of heard you, Kevin, in your prepared remarks talk about -- sounded like some incremental focus on the wholesale channel next year. Can you talk about -- give us some more color around that, what's going on in that business, changes going on there, where you think the opportunities are? Are there areas where you think you can improve in the kind of wholesale apparel piece?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks, Omar. That's -- it's a good lead-in. But let me begin with -- first of all, we're not going to apologize for 26% growth in our Apparel revenues and marking our 20th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth in Apparel. So like anything, there's ebbs and flows in any business, but I think we're incredibly proud of the number and what our team has put forth. At the same time, though, I think it speaks to the overall environment that's happening out there, the trends that you're seeing, particularly in some of the specialty retail shops in general, where it's not an easy marketplace. And while we were hesitant to quote or comment about the broader market, we're absolutely -- consider ourselves expert in talking about what we're seeing. So I've mentioned in my last comment about sort of this huge athletic trend and the fact that we are a driving force within that trend. We're seeing a lot of good things out in the market, but frankly, to your point, there's plenty of places where we can do better. Women's is a great place for us to start. On the heels of that second Brand Holiday featuring Misty and then Gisele, we still have ample opportunity to be hyper-focused on delivering the best product to our wholesale partners and wherever she shops. Today, I think we're proud of that incredible marketing story we put out there. And I think it sets the bar for the level that our product team needs to deliver as well. And we recognize we've got good competitors in this space and this is not a one-horse race by any stretch, so we've got to earn it each and every day. And I think what you'll see from us is continuing to tell incredibly compelling marketing stories that resonate with women in a deep way, but also having product that supports that as well. So you'll see, I think, renewed vigor and adjustments and modifications that we'll be making within our line and some of our key distribution channels now, as well as some of the channels we'll be going toward. But what that commercial did really, Omar, it really inspired us to make better product. And I think you'll see better, more compelling, more timely, and things we're doing with that like shortening lead times and being more proactive from a style standpoint are things that are very important to us. If I went down the list of a few places where I think we can get better, and moving even beyond Apparel, but Footwear, for instance, we posted 50% growth. But frankly, we look at that number and we say we think we can be much better. We have tremendous opportunity not only within our, as I mentioned before, our key wholesale channels and partners, but even bigger opportunities with our mall partners like Finish Line and Foot Locker. So -- and when we look at things like the International growth number is 94% growth, it shows that our brand translates. But we still have some pretty significant on-time delivery issues. And so as good as a lot of the numbers are, we recognize that we can be better and there's more efficiency that can come. But we do see merchandising, building out our merchandising function is a new initiative that we have in the company as well. And I think one thing that definitely is certain is that our strong quarter shows that when we invest in initiatives or growth drivers, good things happen, i.e., Footwear and International. So we're going to end this year above the $3 billion mark. And while we're incredibly proud of that accomplishment, I think it goes without saying that we are just getting started and see ample runway within not only our existing doors, but we also see the new opportunities for growth drivers for many, many years to come. So work to come, but there's a lot of great innovation. I think that's one thing that is certain is that there is an effect that's happening out there with companies that innovate and companies that are trusted brands. And companies that innovate that don't know how to communicate with the consumer are probably going to be lost. And companies that communicate with the consumer but don't know how to innovate, they, too, will probably be lost. So we see ourselves as really at the vortex of those 2 things and we'll continue to execute on that for -- within all of our product categories.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can I ask a quick follow-up on the DTC channel plans, how the new Brand Houses are doing and plans maybe to open new stores over the next few quarters?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Yes. I went through it in depth, I think, from a global basis, but we've made the announcement of our upcoming flagship in Chicago. And I think you'll see a couple more here in the United States. But again, one thing I didn't mention is that the most recent store that we're actually opening this week is actually our own lab store in Baltimore. Our sales meeting is coming up in 10 days, and we're bringing in all of our partners from all over the globe and really to have the ability to start standardizing our processes. I mean, that's one thing where -- continuity is a very important word in business, and I think that we're finally really getting to the ability to find stride with the businesses that we build in building that continuity and building an expectation that there's a consistent message in the store, there's consistent merchandising in store. We went through periods where we were launching our product for international markets 6 months, 1 year behind we were launching here in the states. So same thing with marketing. So getting to being a truly global company is something very important. And we talk about new retail stores that we do here. Frankly, it really -- we're not looking to cannibalize any of the great partners we have here in the States. But where we don't have great opportunities for distribution partners outside the U.S., it really allows us to galvanize our team here and articulate a point of view of how we expect to show up everywhere consistently around the globe. So we'll continue to do that more and more and get better and better at it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So if I reflect back on the Analyst Day last year, you pointed to 12% operating margins over 3 years as a target with -- and laid out a lot of the investment opportunities ahead. Your guidance for 2015 implies the margins will be flat next year. That seems to imply that margins will begin to expand pretty rapidly after 2015. Can we just talk for a minute about your longer-term thinking on those targets, given the updates you helped us with today?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Michael. Our June 13 Investor Day guidance really was a dollar amount, so we were looking at a $4 billion revenue guidance and a $480 million operating income guidance. Obviously, that implies a 12% operating margin, but I think the more important number was the operating income number. And that's really the way we've been talking about our business over the last couple of years and obviously, as we're guiding too, is that we're really focused on making the right investments to continue to sustain this great top line growth rate going forward. And we're less focused on the operating margin percentage as we are making sure that we're having a good, healthy growth rate in operating income dollars. So that's something we wanted to point out is that the Investor Day guidance really was a dollar number, not necessarily a rate that a lot of people are implying. So as we look forward, again, guidance was a flat operating margin. It's a consistent theory, same story of we have to make sure that we balance the desire for us to continue to grow our top and bottom lines, but also balance that with the investments we need to sustain our growth. So there's things like International, Connected Fitness and Retail that we're talking about continuing to invest more in. It's important for us to continue to sustain that growth through those investments. We've also talked about if results come in better than we planned, either the fourth quarter of this year or in 2015, that we'll be opportunistic in areas of SG&A and look to invest more to either give us more confidence in our near-term growth or help us in longer-term growth potentially also. So I would be less focused on the operating margin percentage than the growth rate. Obviously, the growth rate in operating income is a much bigger percentage for us than the operating margin percentage and that's what we're focused on.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up, Brad. Could you clarify that -- for 2015, you're thinking that gross margins, will it be flat year-over-year or the gross margin improvement will be similar to 2014? And then if you could just talk about some of the push and pull on that number for the next year. We've heard some competitors talk about input costs, material costs lower. You've got a number of pricing and mix initiatives, but a lot of noise around the business mix with the structures internationally, maybe just a few of the broad brush strokes we can think about for the model next year.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, sure. So this is a little tough when you're at this time of the year because we're guiding to 5 quarters out basically right now. We have some good visibility to the front half of the year. We still have a lot of work to do in gaining visibility in the back half of the year. But in general, we think that the full year gross margin rate for '15 will improve over '14, similar to the improvement we're seeing in '14 over '13. At a very high level, the puts and takes of gross margin, similar story. I think what you're hearing is that there's going to be definitely some favorability just in general margins overall through our supply chain efforts, through whatever might -- help that might be out there in input costs. But we'll also have some things working against us. FX has been starting to work against us a little bit here as we move to the back half of the year, and we expect that might work against us a little bit next year, too. Although not a huge factor in working against us, it definitely is a factor relative to our size of our business overseas. We also have the International business, which will continue to grow at a healthy rate next year. And again, a lot of that being distributor-type businesses, comes at a little bit of a less gross margin than the wholesale business. So that will have a little bit of a negative impact, too. Those are probably the big broad-based strokes. But again, that overall improvement in '15 should look similar to the improvement you've seen year-over-year in '14.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Sam Poser of Sterne Agee.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I just have a couple of questions about 2015. Given what I would expect to be the continued growth in your International business, accelerated growth there, how do you view that 22% from -- as for North America versus International? And how should we think about the tax rate next year?", "Brad Dickerson", "Sam, on the growth rate. So a couple of things to consider here and again, going back to my comment from Michael's question on we're guiding out 5 quarters here. So as we get further out in that guidance, the visibility is still a little tougher. But when you look at the growth rate of 22% next year, a couple of things to take into consideration. On the International piece, obviously, we're still going to have a very, very healthy growth rate next year. But comparing that growth rate to 2014's growth rate, you got to take into account the fact that we launched a lot of markets this year in 2014, some distributors in places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, along with bringing our Mexico distributor in-house to a wholly-owned subsidiary and obviously, also launching markets like Brazil and Chile. So we'll be obviously comparing against those launches in 2015 versus '14. But to your point, we are absolutely planning it to be a very, very healthy growth rate in International, just not quite at the growth rate of 2014. Also, when you take into consideration -- the other piece, I think, to take into consideration, I would say, is probably more the North America DTC business, a little bit of the wholesale business too, but more of the DTC business. And again, this goes back to the fact that a very, very important data point for us in Q4 2015, especially in our DTC business, is how we do in Q4 '14, and we're not through the quarter yet this year. So we talked about our approach to how we're planning 2014's fourth quarter relative to coming off of the weather help last year and the supply chain improvements last year also. So when we look at that, let's see how we get through the fourth quarter of this year, get to the January earnings call, that will be a really big important data point that will help us determine how we think Q4 '15 looks. So I think those are the 2 areas that if you ask what are probably the most -- the biggest questions around what's changing in your growth model in 2015, those will be the 2 areas I'd point to the most and also probably the 2 areas that I'd point to relative to, if things can work in our favor, could you see upside, those would be the areas that I would expect if we did see upside, we'd probably see them in those 2 areas, more or less.", "Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And the ta -- are you considering to stick with the 40% tax rate? Or I mean, would it be a little bit less just because the International business is going to grow -- outpace the growth of the U.S. business?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. Yes, you're right. I think what you'll start to see as we move forward here is some of these international markets, in places like Europe and in China, we expect to be closer to breakeven as we head into 2015. We'll still be having some losses in some of the newer markets like Latin America. But the benefit of starting to get towards profitability and achieve profitability in these markets will help our tax rate absolutely. So we're still, again, trying to roll up the numbers for next year but the anticipation would be, because of that International business and improving on the bottom line of the International business, that you would expect the tax rate to come down. Don't have the exact number yet, but you should expect it to come down from 40%.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "All right. Thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting our fourth quarter 2014 results, which tentatively had been scheduled for Thursday, January 29, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Thanks again.

Our execution never better, and our ambition never stronger. We also announced the formation of the world\u2019s largest Digital Health and Fitness Community with the acquisitions of Endomando and MyFitnessPal, to supplement our existing MapMyFitness and Under Armour record platforms to create Under Armour Connected Fitness.", "We believe this positioned Under Armour to meaningfully benefit as the world of technology and health and fitness intersect, creating new ways of connecting with athletes, building equity for our brand and additional levels of trust with our consumers.", "So first, I want to spend a few moments, covering how our performance this past year will inform how we will grow our business in 2015 and beyond. And then spend some time on the future state of Under Armour, and how the acquisitions we announced earlier this afternoon will help ensure two things. That we reach our consumer in a manner they expect now and in the future and that we continue to grow our business in the manner our shareholders expect as well.", "Crossing the $3 billion revenue mark in 2014 was an important milestone for our brand, and we did so with the most balanced growth in our history. And while a lot of today\u2019s conversation will be about new growth drivers. We had a tremendous year in our core apparel business, growing total apparel revenues by more than half a billion dollars. The growth was across all categories and genders across our wholesale and direct businesses, and new categories and established ones, and also across geographies.", "We brought a new dimension to our brand in 2014 and laid the foundation for continued growth in women\u2019s with our, I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. We continue to drive innovation in premium pricing throughout our North American Apparel business with large platforms like ColdGear Infrared, Charged Cotton and Storm, and in key categories like training, outdoor, golf, and women\u2019s studio. We are focused on gaining additional floors base in these categories with our key wholesale sporting goods partners through improved merchandising and key initiatives, like reinvigorating our core performance training apparel with the introduction of Armour. Our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation.", "In addition, we see growth with our partners in department store channel as we build out broader businesses there in women\u2019s and kids. There are multiple parts to our apparel growth story for 2015, but they are consistent with what we\u2019ve been and planning and executing against for the past 21 quarters and in each of them we\u2019ve driven 20 plus percent growth in our core Apparel business.", "We will continue to built out large platforms, charge better assortments and strategically broaden our wholesale distribution in the right businesses. Accompanying that growth with our wholesale partners and our continued focus on a direct consumer business where we grew 32% coming in at just under $1 billion for the full year. We saw strong growth in our Factory House stores as we increased our assortment of Footwear and benefited from our new Brand House stores in Tysons Corner and SoHo in New York.", "In Q1, we are opening our largest Brand House yet Michigan Avenue in Chicago, where we will highlight the innovation, localization and specialization of product that we can only do in a 30,000 square foot Brand House environment. And you also see our Connected Fitness initiatives integrated into the stores, as well. We know from our experience in the existing Brand House stores especially in SoHo that we are better positioned to tell great footwear stories and we\u2019ll expand on that as we build out new doors in 2015 and beyond.", "Our footwear business help accelerate our overall growth in 2014 with revenues up 44% for the year to $431 million. As we\u2019ve been discussing on these calls, we are most proud of the foundation and the team we are building in our footwear category, as we continue to gain share and drive innovation in large categories like running and basketball. We significant invested in footwear leadership in 2014 and the strength of the Under Armour brand continues to bring consumers to our Footwear, while our focus on cushioning and fit is helping drive market share gains.", "This past weekend Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl and third MVP award wearing red and white run n gun Under Armour cleats. And next week the biggest star in Under Armour\u2019s basketball universe and leading vote-getter for the NBA All-Star Game. Stephen Curry will be in New York City to debut his first signature shoe, the Curry One. We\u2019ll be telling the basketball world about it and we introduce our holiday one commercial next week starring Stephen and a very special surprise guest. This will be the largest campaign in our company\u2019s history, so big in fact that there will be a second part with for the campaign to support the introduction of the SpeedForm Gemini running shoe. ", "With the Curry One retailing at a $120 and the SpeedForm Gemini at $130, we are creating a sustainable platform for growth in footwear by focusing our premium innovative product for the best athletes in the world and will look back on 2014 as a pivotal year in the development of what may become our biggest engine for growth.", "The last piece of 2014 that I\u2019ll discuss also happens to be the part of our business where we saw the greatest increase in growth, international. Revenues grew 96% to $260 million in 2014 as we open new markets around the globe. Expanded our wholesale account base and continue to build out our international brand house-based with 68 brand house stores open outside the United States enrolling out underarmour.com in multiple new markets and languages.", "As we head into another strong year of growth in our global business, we\u2019ll continue to invest in both local and global assets like our recent signing of Andy Murray, the number four rank tennis player in the world and Australian open finalist. We will strategically grow with our wholesale partners around the world, continue to build out the international brand house stores, going from 18 stores at the end of 2013 to 68 stores in 2014 and adding more than 100 doors this year. This growing global presence enables us to bring the full Under Armour story to our consumers outside the United States and illustrate the true breadth of our product innovations.", "So summing up the year, 2014 was a period of great accomplishments for the Under Armour team and great an example of what\u2019s possible we\u2019re successfully anticipating the needs of our consumer. Our focus in 2015, as it has been since Under Armour\u2019s inception, is on making all athletes better and going well beyond their expectations. That philosophy enables us to focus on what is written on the white board in my office about everything else. Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes. That is job one for our team in 2015 and will always be the foundation on which we grow the Under Armour brand\u2019s global footprint.", "That being said, I want to transition now and provide some color on how the acquisitions we announced earlier today accomplish two very important things. First, the immediate scale we gain by adding Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to the MapMyFitness in UA Record platform, positioning Under Armour as the world\u2019s largest digital health and fitness community.", "And second, how this investment would enable us to better anticipate our consumers\u2019 needs, drive more inform purchase decisions and authentically build brand loyalty by helping our consumers lead a healthy life. So first the facts. Early last month we purchased Endomondo the Copenhagen based company that is still one of the largest global connected fitness communities, with approximately 20 million registered users, most of whom live in Europe. Endomondo provides the perfect strategic complement to the activity and work out tracking we currently have in our existing digital platform of MapMyFitness in UA Record.", "And with today\u2019s announcement to acquire MyFitnessPal, we have firmly established our Connected Fitness platform as the leading provider of everything in athlete needs to live a healthier lifestyle. Based in San Francisco, MyFitnessPal is the leading resource for healthy living and nutrition with over 8 million registered users and world-class nutritional resources. By bringing this established leader into our Connected Fitness platform, we can offer the full suite of information activity and workout tracking as well as nutritional expertise to truly make all athletes better. So what do we brought and more importantly why?", "For starters with MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world's largest digital health and fitness community with a combined audience among all our platforms of over 120 million unique people. For perspective, there are approximately 20 digital communities in the world with more than a 100 million members to the first thing to note is the sheer scale that we now bring to bear.", "I give you a sense of that scale, one out of every five people in the United States has downloaded one of the apps in our platform. Collectively, the three sites grew 46% last year, adding 40 million members and we continue to add over 100,000 registered users everyday. We have great geographic balance with 57% of our 120 million registered users in North America and the balance outside the United States. We also have 72 million women registered on our platform, providing another great opportunity for us to grow our brand presence with both female athletes and athletic females.", "Second, owning the world\u2019s largest digital health and fitness platform provides an incredibly unique opportunity for Under Armour to build a different type of relationships with our consumer over the long-term. Health and fitness is a part of your life from childhood onwards. And our goal in aggregating these three platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand.", "The truth is that you know more about how your car is performing than your own body. And we see the potential to inform and inspire our consumer through these assets and its impact on our ability to sell shirts and shoes as unparalleled in our industry. We build a $3 billion business by making great product and telling great stories, but there is nothing that says we must follow our competitors\u2019 playbook especially when the way consumers digest media and make their purchase decisions is undergoing such dramatic shifts.", "The net result of the shift is that our consumer is demanding more from athletic brands and just making shirts and suits. We embraced those higher expectations and believe these investments position us better than anyone in our industry to truly make all athletes better.", "At the end of the day, the math is pretty simple. The more active someone is the more likely they are to buy athletic apparel and footwear. And for the month of January, the four sites in our Connected Fitness platform, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal and UA Record recorded more than 100 million workouts and added 4.2 million new unique users. So how do we come to this decision to invest in these communities and strategically add another tool and how we interact with our consumer?", "This chapter in the Under Armour story started at the NFL Combine in 2011, where we debut the Armour39, the first performance apparel that incorporated biometric measurements and was used to track the performance of top NFL prospects. We saw the potential and measuring performance and how our consumers could benefit from it. At the same time, a lot of different trackers are wearable technologies started to hit the market. And we were quick to realize that our core competencies lied in making shirts and shoes and understanding how to best incorporate technology to improve athletes\u2019 lives.", "We also realize that for Under Armour, it wasn\u2019t as much about the hardware as there would always be someone else working in a lab or garage, someone who might crack the code on the next great device. And that we can create the most value by working closely with partners, who understood the power of the Under Armour brand and our knowledge of the athletes. At the same time, we started to understand that the true value for an athletic brand was actually in the community. And that crystallize for us when we started the conversation with Robin Thurston that led us to acquiring MapMyFitness in December of 2013.", "As we started working with Bob and his team in Austin, Texas, it only reinforced our belief that the value is in the community, especially one where the user is not just looking at their friend\u2019s pictures, which providing you with data that empowers you to come back to them with an informed point of view to help improve their health and fitness. We understood that there was tremendous value in becoming that trusted brand as a setout to assemble all the elements that would enable Under Armour to be the one place to access all of that information.", "From a geographic view, Endomondo was the obvious choice to complement MapMyFitness. Their community of 20 million users most of whom are based in Europe provides a great opportunity for us to learn from and expand our ability to interact with the consumers who are still relatively new to us. With MyFitnessPal, their expertise and the nutritional space positions us to have a complete picture of our athletes and rounds out the data from which we will be able to provide the most informed and personalized input on our users health and fitness.", "So how will all this come together? All the three existing platforms MapMyFitness, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal will leave distinct platforms under the Under Armour Connected Fitness banner, but we have a longer term point of view in vision and it\u2019s found in UA record, the community we launched last month at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. Over time, we believe UA record will eventually become the daily destination dashboard, aggregating all you want to know about your general fitness, sleep, steps, activity level and yes nutrition.", "We know that we are on the verge of a marketable developments and wearable technology, some of which are being worked on across the street and in our own innovation lab right now. And our recently announced partnership with HTC will enable us to help develop statement level products that demonstrates the full capabilities of UA record, but by focusing on an open platform and being device diagnostic, we believe we are the best positioned among all athletic brands to benefit from the evolution of wearables.", "So let me sum up with this investment we will do for Under Armour and why we believe it\u2019s critical to our ability to sell the shirts and shoes going forward. Everything about our consumer is rapidly evolving. The way they digest media, what influences their purchase decision, how and where they buy things. We see that everyday in our business, for example this past December, we did 77% more e-commerce business on a mobile device than we did in December of just the year prior in 2013. Brands that do not evolve - that do not offer their consumers nothing more than product will be hard for us to complete in 2015 and beyond.", "We fully understand a massive shift and how consumer will intersect with that favorite brands. And these acquisition firmly position us on the leading edge of that new paradigm with the world\u2019s largest digital health and fitness community, we now have a unique opportunities to build equity and consumer loyalty over the long-term. We will be able to provide the most complete measure of a person\u2019s health and fitness and become the trusted brand that will help to drive not only e-commerce, but also long-term value for our shareholders.", "Are we ready for this next step? Two years ago, I would have had the answer no. But since that time, we have assembled an incredible pool of talent, led by three entrepreneurs who had literally helped to create the entire category of Connected Fitness, Robin Thurston and the founder of MapMyFitness; Mette Lykke, the founder and CEO of Endomondo; and Mike Lee, the founder and CEO of MyFitnessPal.", "Prior to the MapMyFitness acquisition, we had four engineers working in our digital team. With the two acquisitions announced today that number is now over 300, more important in the sheer numbers. We now have three of the best minds in the space, all adept [ph] that navigating in a rapidly shifting market and all with extensive experience, understanding the needs of their communities.", "Robin is going to run our overall Connected Fitness Business and reporting to him will be [indiscernible], who\u2019ll drive our international business and initiatives; and Mike Lee will be running our North American business. This breadth of experience will enable our core product leadership to focus on the business of selling shirts and shoes, as we build out these new growth platform that will position Under Armour at the center of the world\u2019s health and fitness activities for years and years to come.", "And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. I\u2019ll now spend sometime discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year net revenues increased 32% to $3.08 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.03 billion.", "As Kevin outlined, this $3 billion milestone was comprised of strong results across all of our growth drivers with Apparel up 30%, Direct-to-Consumer up 32%, Footwear up 44%, and International up 96%.", "Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew Apparel category 30% to $708 million compared to $546 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our platform innovations of Storm, ColdGear Infrared and Charged Cotton were key volume drivers across the category, while new innovation like this year\u2019s MagZip showcased our ongoing ability to bring value to the consumer. Areas of particular strength in Apparel include training, golf, outdoor, and studio.", "Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 55% to $86 million from $55 million the prior year, representing approximately 10% of net revenues for the period. We continue to see success in running footwear across a broader price spectrum, including the $100 Speedform Apollo, traveling markets share gains has been our core sporting distribution. Basketball also continued to gain momentum, most notably around the $125 ClutchFit Drive. These categories along with our ongoing strength in areas such as cleated and slide position Under Armour as the number two overall footwear brand in some of our top wholesale accounts in 2014.", "Our accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 22% to $79 million from $65 million last year. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by headwear offerings, and gloves.", "Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 27% for the quarter, representing approximately 38% of net revenues. Within North America, our Factory House store footage grew 17% year-over-year. This growth reflects the total of 125 Factory House stores at the end of the year, up 7% from the end of 2013, as well as the upsizing of 14 existing locations during the year. On the full price side, we remained at 5 Brand House stores in North America.", "In our e-commerce channel, where we continue to see the migration of traffic from desktop to mobile devices, we were encouraged by the conversion improvements from our new responsive site launched at the end of September. We also followed up our third quarter launches of global e-commerce sites in the UK, Germany and France with the fourth quarter debut of our site in Singapore, which is our first site in Southeast Asia. International net revenues increased 123% to $82 million in the fourth quarter and represented 9% of total net revenues. In EMEA region, we saw continued strength in our three key markets in Europe: The UK, Germany, and France and commenced our new distributor agreement covering the Middle East.", "In Asia Pacific, we remain focused on accelerating growth at both wholesale accounts and distributor including partner store opening throughout Greater China and Southeast Asia. Finally in Latin America, our business benefited from the early 2014 conversion of our Mexico distributor to an Under Armour subsidiary and our market expansions into Brazil and Chile. This included our first South American brand house storage opened in Santiago, Chile during the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted a 140 basis points to 49.9% compared with 51.3% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Three primary factors contributed to this performance during the quarter. First as discussed in our prior call, our sales mix adversely impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points for the period, primarily reflecting a higher mix of international net revenues including the introduction of new lower margin distributor businesses during the fourth quarter.", "Second, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points for the period and finally higher freight costs to better meet consumer demand, negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the period. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues levers 330 basis points, 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 36.9% in the prior year\u2019s period. As a reminder, we incurred a higher incentive compensation expenses in the last year\u2019s fourth quarter which was a primary contributor of leverage in each of our four SG&A buckets.", "Additional SG&A details are as follows. First, marketing cost decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior period. Second, selling cost decreased to 11% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior period. Third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 9% in the prior year period. And finally, corporate services decreased to 5.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.4% in the prior period, inclusive of clothing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition in the prior year period.", "Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $146 million, compared with $98 million in the prior year period. For the full year operating income increased 34% to $354 million, compared to our most recent guidance of $348 million. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points during the quarter to 16.3%, compared to 14.4% in the prior year period. For the full year, operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 11.5%, compared to 11.4% in 2013.", "Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased to $4 million, compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the negative impacts of foreign currency along with increased interest expense from our additional term debt. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.3% was unfavorable to the 34% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of a state tax credit received in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our full year effective tax rate of 39.2% was higher than the 37.8% rates in 2013, primarily due to increased international investments and the lacking of the state tax credit.", "Our fourth quarter, net income increased 37% to $88 million, compared to $64 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $0.40 compared to $0.30 in the prior year period. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.95, compared to $0.75 in 2013.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 71% to $593 million, compared with $347 million at December 31, 2013. Total debt increased to $284 million from $153 million at December 31, 2013. Both, our cash and debt positions reflecting additional $100 million term loan drawn during the fourth quarter used primarily for the closing on the $85 million Endomondo acquisition in early January. Inventory at year-end increased 14% to $537 million, compared to $469 million at December 31, 2013.", "Looking at our cash flow our investment and capital expenditures was approximately $59 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $145 million for 2014. Now moving onto 2015. We have three factors driving our updated outlook. First, the impact of the two new Connected Fitness businesses we are acquiring; second, the negative impact of the strengthening dollar on our international results; and third, the continued strength of our existing business.", "Starting with revenues; we are maintaining our prior guidance of approximately 22% net revenue growth. It should be noted this is upper by higher number compared to three months ago as we exceeded our most recent 2014 target by nearly $55 million. This growth rate takes into account the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past 90 days, which has negatively impacted our 2015 net revenues forecast by approximately 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. However, revenues from the Connected Fitness acquisitions are expected to largely offset this currency impact.", "As stated in our previous guidance, we expect solid growth across all of our growth drivers led by continued outperformance in our footwear and international businesses. We expect the year-over-year growth rate across each of the quarters in 2015 to be relatively consistent except for the fourth quarter were we will be lasting strong international growth including new market entries.", "Now moving on to operating income, we are now planning 2015 operating income in the range of $397 million to $407 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. This change from our prior guidance of operating income growth of 22% is largely due to the impact of our two Connected Fitness acquisitions. We estimate a 90 basis point of operating margin dilution from these acquisitions mostly within SG&A offset with a slight gross margin benefit. There are three components of this.", "First, one time deal closing cost recorded in the first quarter are expected to impact the full year by approximately 20 basis points. Second, operating losses from the operations of the two businesses we are acquiring are expected to impact the full year by approximately 40 basis points. And third, the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions will result in non-cash amortization charges, which are expected to impact the full year by approximately 30 basis points.", "The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar also has had a negative impact on our 2015 operating income guidance. Specifically in our gross margin line as we purchased the majority of our inventory for our international businesses in U.S. dollars. This just created an incremental 50 basis points impact operating margins just in the time of our prior guidance. We anticipate to offset this currency impact through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A.", "Our current guidance assumes no further significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to current exchange rates. From a gross margin standpoint, we believe we can still generate a modest improvement from last year\u2019s 49% level, despite foreign currency headwinds, even ongoing supply chain opportunities as the year progresses. Relative to timing we expect this improvement to be generally consistent throughout the year.", "On SG&A we expect expense deleverage mainly driven by the Connected Fitness acquisitions. The rate of SG&A expense deleveraged is expected to gradually ease throughout the year from approximately 200 basis point deleveraged during the first quarter.", "Factors weighing on expenses during the first quarter include higher year-over-year marketing expenses to support our first Brand Holiday of 2015, as well as the one-time deal closing cost for the Connected Fitness acquisitions. Below the operating line we expect higher year-over-year interest expense for the funding of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. We anticipate funding these acquisitions through cash on hand and expanded term loan and revolving credit facility.", "Full year effective tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our 2014 effective rate of 39.2%. The impact of the strong dollar on our international result is negatively impacting our 2015 effective tax rate in excess of 100 basis points. Our 2015 fully diluted share account is expected to be approximately $220 million.", "Finally, as we indicated with our preliminary 2015 guidance in October, we expect elevated capital expenditures during the year. Part of this acceleration includes combined investments of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore. We also expect elevated capital expenditures tied to our global retail expansion. In total we are currently planning 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million.", "In conclusion, 2015 has developed into an important investment year for our company, as we trade the world\u2019s largest digital health and fitness community. We believe these investments will enhance and support our growth drivers and drive a long-term value for our shareholders. Even after factoring in the dilutive impact on 2015, we believe that our forward three year operating income CAGR through 2017 will be in line with the 22% growth rate level that we provided in our prior 2015 guidance. We will provide specific long-term guidance at our Investor Day targeted for September 16 of this year.", "We now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two per person so we get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ", "Kevin Plank", "Omar?", "Omar Saad", "Thanks guys, sorry about that. Nice quarter, congratulations on the bigger acquisitions. I wanted to ask about pricing. If you think about currency and some of the other things affecting your business, Kevin you mentioned premium pricing. Are you guys seeing that or thinking about using that more as a tool or mixing up to the higher price point products, the tool to drive the business and offset some of these currency and other issues...", "Kevin Plank", "Well, I think you heard some of the energy that we talked around footwear with the new Stephen Curry 1 at $120, SpeedForm Gemini at $130. [Indiscernible] a few years ago was what can we do to sell more products over a $100 and that\u2019s not as easy as it\u2019s said. And so we\u2019ve had to learn that in the hard way, but I think what you\u2019ve seen and now we\u2019re in our tenth year making shoes, our eight year selling shoes that we\u2019ve actually gotten pretty good at it. And we can drive premium pricing, something what\u2019s been familiar to us in apparel for a very long time.", "So I think that we\u2019re thoughtful and there is lot of factors of play with oil and a few other things they\u2019re still working their way through the system, but we\u2019re not seeing number one a great squeeze on the manufacturing prices that we\u2019re not enjoying any advantages just yet and we are feeling some of these currency benches, but I think everybody is trying to figure out which way is up with that. At the end of the day, I am not sure it\u2019s going to be any global or international market that will be dictating what price the Under Armour is assuming the relationship that we have with the consumer. And I think that we\u2019ll continue to drive that and echo that and everything we do from our branding, our marketing and frankly highlighted today with the two acquisitions that we announced about a deep and better understanding of that consumer. ", "Brad Dickerson", "And Omar, a couple of other things on that too on pricing and also costing I guess I\u2019d add into that next to. On the pricing side obviously with the strength in U.S. dollar, we\u2019ll look at the ability to increase prices potentially on the international businesses, but obviously, that\u2019s probably more of a 2016 conversation at this point and the teams are working through the impact of the strengthening dollar and how that will have on pricing on the international front. On the costing side kind of the same timeframe for the most part is we\u2019re about a year ahead of the selling season and locking in fabric pricing. So the locking in are our spring, summer 2015 product and obviously our fall, winter 2015 product too are really occurred a year or to eight months ago to some degree when oil prices were still elevated.", "So when oil price is coming down that is one of the input cost, obviously that impact our cost. We\u2019re locking in spring, summer 2016 fabric pricing today and we\u2019ll be locking in fall, winter 2016 over of the course of the next six months. I think we have a better opportunity in 2016 both from a pricing perspective to the consumer and also the costing perspective from the vendor.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask one quick question on the acquisitions announced, for those of us who aren\u2019t familiar with those two platforms, maybe help us understand the two businesses, the revenue algorithm, it sounds like there going to be earnings drag and still on the investment phase although growing quickly. Just kind of some of the basic fundamentals around those businesses from a financial or even just help us understand what the [indiscernible]? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "Let me take a minute Saad, because I think it\u2019s worth just letting me explaining and go a little bit deeper. So bear with me here, but let me just start with first of all why we thought that we could do this. The basic reason is because frankly our business and our brand have never been stronger, 19 consecutive quarters 20 plus percent top line growth including last five of which we delivered over 30%. The year that we had in 2014 we saw strength across the business from, again core apparel business that grew by $0.5 billion, our footwear business that grew 44%, our international business grew 96% just to name a few of them.", "And frankly at the end of the day as we said and you\u2019ve heard me say, in my white board there you see lots of slogans, things would say like over promise and delivering, dictate the tempo, and walk with a purpose. And one note that\u2019s written in red very simply says don\u2019t forget to sell shirts and shoes, the reason that we did what we did today was because we believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes and reach more athletes to make them better. So what we really did? This exercise began for us a little more than a year ago in December 13, we announced the acquisition of MapMyFitness and we paid a $150 million to them.", "It really helps us established a beachhead in digital and as I said I think in my script, here I\u2019d be talking about how we didn\u2019t really have a presence, I mean combined between our internal Connected Fitness team and our e-commerce team we had less than 50 people in that group. And today we have roughly 400 people in the group we\u2019ll add another 100 this year.", "So the world of Digital and again some of the anecdotes that led to that thinking and you heard me give the stats out 77% more people going to mobile we offset another stats for you, we had a 11% of our orders on cyber Monday this year last year, we saw come across mobile devices and in just one year in 2014 the same day apples-to-apples that number has grown to 27% of people that placed orders at ua.com were on mobile devices. So we recognize that having relations there is incredibly important.", "With this acquisition though the one thing that we learned was that having additional functionality was we knew we had dealing with Robin and the team over the last 12, 13 months. But also realized what we didn\u2019t have. If our ultimate goal was to build a complete picture of the athlete there were two things that we\u2019re missing. Number one we have an incredibly North American outlook and so global scale was something that we were looking for.", "And secondly, something that we thought would be much easier for us to buy than to try to build, was the idea of nutritional expertise and announcing the purchase of these two of the world\u2019s leading platforms Endomando in Copenhagen and MyFitnessPal in San Francisco. I mean in [indiscernible] we\u2019ve created the world\u2019s largest Connected Health and Fitness Community with a 120 million unique members, and the largest by a factor of two and arguably three. So there is no real person in second place that we have basically aggregated this community all at once.", "And just importantly it\u2019s growing at over 100,000 people a day and just a little fact, in January, its obviously a big month particularly for people as say start thinking about health and wellness measuring itself, we averaged a 136,000 people joining and registering every single day, totaling 4.2 million people in the 31 days of January. And just as impressively as you\u2019ve heard me mentioned, over a 100 million workouts were locked, 100 million workouts. And so when you talk about the one thing that we emphatically know is that the more someone exercise is that the more that they workout, it\u2019s just logical that the more apparel and footwear that they are going to ultimately buy.", "The mission that we have to make athletes better and with that information people choose to share with our Connected Fitness platforms, we think it creates the piece of the puzzle. It\u2019s going to allow us to have that total complete picture of the athlete. How much they\u2019re exercising, how much they\u2019re sleeping, how much activity they have, what they are putting in their body, and what the nutrition have -. So with all of that it basically comes down to why we did it and really what it means for Under Armour.", "The thing that as I saw it and look this was not an easy decision and as we talked about this, we debated this heavily internally, had a lots of conversations and at the end of the day we kept coming back to the same thing. Is that this will help drive our core business. This will help with our five core growth drivers. And frankly, the idea of standing here and looking and think should we do it or not. To me it felt incredibly obvious, it reminded me when I made that first - and looking around and saying has anybody ever done anything like this and why everyone is still wearing short sleeve cotton tee in the summer and long sleeve cotton tee in the winter. And I look and say no one has aggregated and put all of these pieces together and we don\u2019t see anything coming.", "So the ability we have was incredibly new, but why - I saw this really wide-spaced with what we\u2019re doing in making T-shirts. The opportunity that we have here is a bit different just because there is so much energy and excitement around wearables and biometric measurement. But the surprise that I have is that frankly no one is leading or adjusting what we are today, the power of a truly Connected Fitness Community.", "[Indiscernible] shift that\u2019s happening and way the consumers are interacting with their favor brands as a world goes digital, and we don\u2019t see anyone appropriately addressing the needs of consumers. So now when you look and just think about what\u2019s happening and frankly for myself, coming back of CES, in 2009 there were roughly $1 billion \u201cconnected things in the planet.\u201d An estimates depending on who you listen to by 2020 that number will be somewhere between $25 billion to $50 billion. So who does the best job of sensitizing that data and making it easier for the consumer to understand are the ones that will win.", "Activity, sleep, exercise and nutrition and that\u2019s the place where we think that we can win particularly with our UA Record dashboard. And again the vision there is to become the daily dashboard that people check, the same way you check your bank balances, same way you check the whether, is the same way that you get an update on the most important asset in your life, your own personal health.", "So, finally, this convergence that we see happening, the digitization of kids as we look and we talk to people and see that they have forgotten about no ones looking and wondering what\u2019s happening in the newspaper. You have one device that a 20-year-old cannot live with today, right, it is not a magazine and print, it is without question it is a handheld device.", "And what we see is with the acceleration of wearables and what\u2019s happening there that we feel like we are positioned squarely in the center of what is supposed to happen. Community and platform is the right play, and because of the acquisitions that began December 13, we\u2019re sitting in the middle of it. This aggregation provides us with the opportunity to build a long and sustainable relationship with our consumer and ultimately we think we\u2019re going to sell lot more shirts and shoes. That would be - I was waiting for that question, I wanted to thank you.", "Omar Saad", "Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.", "Camilo Lyon", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Nice job in the quarter.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks Camilo.", "Camilo Lyon", "Shifting gears a little bit, Kevin it looks like you are making a bigger push into the outdoor category, if you could just talk about the opportunity that you see and how you think you will differentiate from some of the well-established brands in that category and what you\u2019re doing to go after that consumer in a much bigger way.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Camilo. So I think it\u2019s a massive opportunity for us. And frankly, it\u2019s one of those silent businesses that we don\u2019t get a lot of credit for, but that we are one of the pure player leaders in this space. Walk into any Cabela's Bass Pro shop and the Under Armour presence is overwhelming.", "And first of all, as I dive into the question on outdoor, I think just given a nod, I think, to the brand that\u2019s been established with the elasticity that would demonstrate with the same company that can come out with probably one of the most talked about commercials of 2014 featuring Misty Copeland and Gisele in our women\u2019s business, I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign.", "It\u2019s frankly the same company that has a relationship Willie from Duck Dynasty. And when you walk in, you see what we have in the outdoor, in the fishing, in the mountain business, there is a need for a brand like Under Armour, and I think we\u2019re continuing to innovate, refresh off the outdoor retailer show out in Salt Lake. And amongst other things, we won Best Product, most innovative product for new shoe that we have coming out called the Fat Tire shoe, it\u2019s a partnership that we did with Michelin and it puts us against currently with a shoe that\u2019s fashioned to be seen those big oversized bikes that ride on snow or can ride on sand. And I think it\u2019s just another approach that we\u2019re taking from a very consumer centric approach that demonstrates we know what we\u2019re doing.", "From a ability to win there, you\u2019re going to start see our outerwear which we\u2019ve been making frankly for the last seven and eight years. And among that time we\u2019ve of course built a better relationship with the consumer, understanding them, but we\u2019ve also built a better relationship with the factories, building better product, taking and incorporating the ethos the essence that is Under Armour that makes this special on the athletic playing field, makes us just as special on a ski mountain, just as special in the woods, just as special on a saltwater flat fishing boat. So I think what you\u2019re seeing from us is that what gives us the greatest elasticity is the ability to apply try the principles that make something so incredibly Under Armour and apply it to a market that makes sense.", "We have an authentic team here, we have it on the grass root side, we have it on the product side especially we have it on the marketing side. And I think that we see a great opportunity with the business now that\u2019s clearly well over $300 million for us. That surprises people when they hear that number, in fact we\u2019re growing north of our external growth rates as a company too. So we great upside down and frankly we think we can be a player in the Outdoor space for a long time to come and we think that we\u2019ve got a good relationship now and this just keep getting better and better.", "Camilo Lyon", "Great and then Brad just another question for you on the 2015 revenue outlook, so the fourth quarter had pretty impressive growth, on top of was a very strong growing quarter last year. So you see basically prove that you can comb on the comps. You\u2019re looking that 22% growth for 2015, may be you can just help us understand why that momentum that you\u2019re seeing in the business shouldn\u2019t sustain at some elevated level above that?", "Kevin Plank", "Sure. So if you kind of walk from our 2014 a 32% top line growth to our 22% guidance for 2015, I think, the first place you have to look is our international business, which grew 96% in 2014 and that really included a lot of new launches into new markets like Brazil, Chile, South East Asia and the Middle East. Most of those launches happening more from the middle of the back half of the year. So although we still anticipate very, very strong growth in our international businesses we will be comping those market entries, year-over-year.", "In addition, on the international side the foreign currency, the strengthening off the U.S. dollar, I mentioned in my prepared remarks the 1% decline in revenue just from the last 90 days activity in foreign currency for the full year is a two percentage point growth head with the strengthening dollar, full year year-over-year for us. So if you take both of those factors, the international business comping those market launches and the impact of the strengthening dollar, we probably have more than half of the walk down from 32% to 22%.", "On the North America side, obviously, we have this planned deceleration of our factory house growth, we\u2019ve planning for over the course of the last few years. We talk about adding less new doors and focus more on square footage growth. So although we are focusing on square footage growth that that square footage growth year-over-year, as you saw in Q4, also it declined in 2014 from 2013. It will be declining throughout 2015 compared to 2014 also. So that\u2019s another factor that\u2019s really kind of driving us down.", "And on the wholesale side, I have always been pretty clear and I am going to take a look at the information I have today, when we give our guidance and forecast going forward. And obviously, we have our Q4 results in, but the data point that I don\u2019t have today for the back half of 2015 is all of our bookings and orders on the wholesale side, specifically again in our largest business, which is North America wholesale don\u2019t have those booking in for a good part of the back half of the year, especially the fourth quarter. So obviously, taking a cautious approach to our forecast and from that aspect based on the sector we don\u2019t have that data in place right now. ", "Camilo Lyon", "Perfect. Just quickly a follow up on that is - there was a question and I think that Laurent asked about pricing. It sounds like with new technologies, new innovations, new product introductions that there is a positive-ish fee contribution that we just expect to see at least in the back half, introducing GORE-TEX into some of the outerwear, got new innovations on the [indiscernible] side. Is that a fair way to think about it? And if so, maybe help understand - talk about the magnitude of the ASP increase?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I mean, we - it\u2019s little hard to forecast an ASP increase. There\u2019s a lot goes into that relative to mix and the expectation of mix. But that\u2019s - obviously, it\u2019s an important part of our story from an innovation perspective. And obviously as we innovate, those are mostly coming in at premium price point when we innovate. So it will definitely have a positive impact on our ASPs as it get to the back half of the year, continue to innovate. But obviously our price point increase over the course of the last few seasons has been kind of in the low to mid single-digit range. So our story is growth, its unit growth, it\u2019s less about ASP growth. That ASP growth is important from an innovation perspective for us, but our brands is all about unit growth.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, look, Under Armour is a front porch brand. So what you will continue to see us do is take a Class A partner that we can bring in that have incredible technology like the Gores and like the Michelins and companies like the HTCs that we can use that to leverage our existing platform of story telling and we can take it in a meaningful way to our consumers that helps improve them and make an athlete better.", "So we will continue to stay with that. We will continue to find the right partnerships. And when you make great product that actually works, it\u2019s not - price is not your issue or your problem. So I think going back to the first question that Omar asked as well as that we\u2019ve got a lot of room for our consumer that trust us. And what we do and we focused on every single day here is making sure we never violate that trust and keeping levering best-in-class products.", "Camilo Lyon", "Perfect, thanks guys.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel, your line is open.", "Jim Duffy", "Thanks good afternoon everyone. So I look forward to watch in the connected health and fitness evolves that\u2019s quite a portfolio you\u2019ve built. Kevin, with that mind, you speak to opportunity to leverage Endomondo European user base to help accelerate development of the shirts and shoes business in Europe?", "Kevin Plank", "Of course, so I think first of all, we\u2019re doing on a global basis right now, is pretty extraordinary. We\u2019re up a 123% in the quarter, 96% for the full year and it\u2019s a first year where we saw Europe to pass a $100 million and really hats off tour team and particularly, Matt Shearer, who is there before, who we pulled our Canadian business and sent over there to really get the shift right which was a place that we took a lot of hits in Europe for a long time before we figured out how to make things happen.", "And we really took one of our own who built an amazing $100 plus million business in Canada and asked him to do the same thing in Europe. And then handed him the reins in the last eight months or so to an industry professional guide and Chris Bate has been, we\u2019ve got the leadership established and in place. But there\u2019s a lot of things that apply there, so of course first and foremost his leadership. But I really like the assets that we\u2019ve been signing and thank to the global perspective that we\u2019ve taken. Things like Tottenham Hotspur and being in the EPL has been really important for us and continued to double down with athletes and with assets on the outside being relevant to that consumer but like anything, Europe is not happen over night and it takes a little bit longer. And so as we sit here in our, I guess ninth year doing business over there it\u2019s been a long run.", "What we\u2019re seeing there was the partnerships that we have on the wholesale side, a lot of really good things that have been going on. Some of the milestones, again we said to surpassed $100 million, it\u2019s actually north of $130 million in Europe in 2014. And the plans that we have are even to breakeven for the first time in Europe, we took some - Europe was difficult for a very long time, so going from not having that negative is actually is being a breakeven and actually looking and having a line of site to making money, is incredibly powerful for us.", "The aided and unaided brand awareness that we have basically tripled year-over-year in key markets like the UK and Germany. The launch of our E-Commerce site for the first time in the UK made a big deal, same thing in Germany, the same thing in France and then we expect to have at Netherlands and to the EU in 2015. And our market focus provided a visibility, the opportunity to drive deep account connections. We\u2019ve been in some of the right places, we still have opportunity to go from a wholesale standpoint, it\u2019s a difficult wholesale environment to say the least in Europe but we see ourselves really driving and moving.", "And frankly the partnership that we felt from people is that we\u2019re now getting recognized is that Under Armour is an incredibly key brand to have in your store and you cannot live without us. And frankly what we\u2019ve recognized is that we can\u2019t live without them either, which is a very healthy relationship and one that we probably share in our wholesale environment here in the United States. So we\u2019re looking forward to some of those new partnerships we have.", "But that that global story doesn\u2019t stop at the boarders of Europe either is that - the good news is that what Charlie and our team in the international group have done are really driving Under Armour toward that vision of some day we expect in order to find ourselves the global brand that definition means that more than half of our revenues must come from outside of our home country. So we got a shot and we love the execution that our teams take and making that happen. And we\u2019ve got Andy Murray now, finalist for the Australian Open, so it\u2019s a good scout on our team.", "Jim Duffy", "Great. And then state on the international topic, which are the regions are you most optimistic about growth for 2015. Is it Europe or some of the other regions, which maybe you didn\u2019t mentioned over delivering?", "Kevin Plank", "So let me layout. So Latin America was really - it began as Charlie\u2019s wheelhouse for us, but we\u2019re looking at these markets and things that we thought would be nice countries to do business in. We\u2019re not looking at and saying what\u2019s our roadmap to $100 million, places like Mexico, Brazil, Chile, where it begins as always with great, great leadership. But Brazil right now, we\u2019ve got over 100 branded spaces that we opened in 2014 while more than 250 spaces in 2015. Obviously the energy and excitement with the Olympics coming there next year is going to be a big deal.", "Mexico continues to move for us. We\u2019ve got a new master franchise agreement that\u2019s going to magnify our distribution approach that we have there, big assets like Toluca and Cruz Azul and the Mexican Football League there and then in Chile where we announced probably would felt like a bit pre-mature, but Colo-Colo which is one of the top football clubs in Chile. We opened our first brand house in the fourth quarter and its doing incredibly bigger than we thought it would do.", "China is when we talk about store growth opening over a 100 stores, the majority of those stores - come out of China and finding and many of them partner run and but it\u2019s not like its make the difference as we expand from just two cities to more than 10 cities across China. We want to get into the routes of the country and we want to make sure that they understand our authenticity and our commitment to China. But again China from where it was and we launched in 2008-2009, China again is going to be another international breakeven story for us. So the line of sight that we have towards making money in global markets is something that it\u2019s incredibly time consuming, it\u2019s an incredible amount of sacrificed money, energy and all those things, but we have an international team that is building out and giving us that global perspective as the company.", "The new Southeast Asia distribution agreement that came to as well we have these terrific partners based in Singapore that have been really incredible markets that you didn\u2019t think of and one of the imagery we show when we talk about global growth is when we opened roughly 2,000 square foot store - 200 square meter store in Downtown Manila in the Philippines and there is 700 plus people waiting in line to get into it. So we are seeing that there is a pool and there is an absolute demand for our brand.", "And throughout Asia, our partners in Japan continue to move and grow. Currency has been a struggle with them, but on an apples to apples basis their business is incredibly healthy and growing at a real rate.", "The last thing I\u2019d like to say just about international growth and expansion and tying it back to the announcement that we\u2019ve made today, we have frankly 52 million people outside of North America that now have Under Armour\u2019s Connected Fitness, one of our Connected Fitness platforms on their mobile, their digital device. It\u2019s the opportunity for us to have a different type of introduction with this consumer.", "It\u2019s a different type of handshake that we are going to introduce the Under Armour brand to them. And we think we can do it an incredibly digital way. We think its going to give us the opportunity to tell the incredibly complete story of who we are and just as importantly where this brand is headed.", "So a lot of energy and excitement around what\u2019s happening with Under Armour on a global basis to the point where people here are knocking on my door saying, I want to - can I go move to Australia, can I move to China, can I move to these other markets. And so I think it\u2019s a lot of energy and excitement, I think that digital painting of global brand is something that we expect to bring to life.", "Jim Duffy", "Great. Thanks for the regional profitability perspective.", "Kevin Plank", "You bet, thanks. One at a time, Jim, one at a time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, guys, good evening, great quarter.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Michael.", "Michael Binetti", "Just on the guidance, Brad, maybe just a good one for you. If I strip out what you are telling us the guidance was like for the acquisitions and maybe FX, it looks like a pretty meaningful increase to the EBIT dollars here. And you said, you pointed quickly to supply chain efficiencies and those kind of things. Just the number looks a little bit [indiscernible] so maybe we can just get a little bit more color on that please?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, you are talking about the offset basically to what I talked about in my prepared remarks.", "Michael Binetti", "Yes, it seems like some pretty good efficiency rolling through there.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I think part of it was looking at some opportunities that were really driven by the impact of the strengthening dollar to some degree. So a lot of our initiatives are focused on things in the supply chain for the fact that the dollar strengthened pretty significantly here in the last 60 days really. I think it gives us some opportunities potentially within the supply chain to take advantage of some of that especially towards the back half of this year, obviously, the front half of this year is locked in.", "So part of that probably initiative there is to look at ways to get some money out of the supply chain because of the strengthening dollar. Obviously, you kind of have some offsets in SG&A with the strengthening dollar too in the international business from a cost perspective to that just going to come naturally. And if there are just things of SG&A or itself as we did the acquisitions, there are some things that made sense to scale back a little bit because we felt the investment in the acquisitions was a complimentary thing to be doing to some of the things that we\u2019re planning on doing initially anyway, so some synergies there to some degree.", "So although it seems like big, big items there to offset, most of them are pretty natural because of the strengthening dollar, some synergies and the acquisitions that we\u2019re doing compared to some other investments that we\u2019re going to make and some things naturally true [indiscernible] make sense for us to kind of go after again just from a bottom line perspective.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay, thanks. That is helpful. And then if wouldn\u2019t mind just a couple other modeling questions. It\u2019s we obviously got like a one time step up change in the revenue growth rate for international as you rolled in some businesses this year, but I think one of the more complicated things for the modelers is to figure out what the run rate of these international businesses. Is there anyway you could give us guardrails to think about between U.S. growth versus international growth for the year within your guidance and then maybe DTC versus wholesale just we have some guardrail.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, I mean, I could probably pick points more directionally and giving you actual numbers, but again like if you think about our overall growth in company in 2014 of 32% and our international growth at 96%. There is even three times number basically there international versus overall company growth. Obviously as we talk about again lasting some of those market entries last year, again the impact of foreign currencies on international revenues that that growth rate will come down much more. So instead of a three times number, it might look more like a two times number or something like that, but again I\u2019m thinking more directionally here versus giving you number.", "On the DTC side, the real change here is going to be on the factory house side that real change is again planned business we\u2019ve been talking all along in the last couple of years. The ability to really focus more on our Brand House initiatives and our e-commerce business has growth drivers and really planning on taking our especially North America Factory House growth down as we started limit our new door growth and focus on square footage growth. So again I think that\u2019s going to be a piece that if you look at DTC growing 32% this year, you would expect with Factory House being a largest portion of that, you would expect that growth rate to come below 30% to some degree.", "Michael Binetti", "Thanks a lot guys.", "Brad Dickerson", "Okay.", "Kevin Plank", "Operator we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Tracy of Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Eric Tracy", "Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in, my congrats.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks Eric.", "Eric Tracy", "Hi, Kevin, let me - up on footwear here, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really talked about that. Is this feels this was the year that you gotten permission from the consumer, clearly reflected in the pricing migrating higher, is huge brand campaign around [indiscernible]. Maybe just talk through again the selection, how we think about the innovation sort of emerging? And then maybe most importantly adding Peter here to the leadership team what we should be thinking about directionally for the overall business?", "Kevin Plank", "Of course, so like everything it always begins with leadership. And first of all, that starts with my regional partner Kip Fulks who has been driving footwear for last several years. And Kip is really - he is the heart and soul of this company, and I think what we\u2019d always looking for is for that heart and soul to come out through our product. And something we are very proud of is our apparel, but something I would think that the consumers seen come out and really articulate in the voice of our footwear product too.", "So a lot of big stories, lot of good things to build on I mean, launching this SpeedForm platform was one of the leading launches that we had in best debut runners world and I think a lot of accolades that made us all incredibly proud of what we did last year. Likely I feel like we\u2019re always getting caught up talking about success and cleats. But that is really a big deal from where we begin all the way back in 2006 till today. We are clearly the number two player in the market with somewhere in the mid 30s in terms of market share. And outline of side is being the number one football cleat in America.", "And we say that from the standpoint now if it leaves we can kill it. And what we heard was that we would never have the ability to be successful in these markets, we could never, we can never. And all we\u2019ve done is comeback with better product every single year winning more consumers that are choosing our brand.", "So what you\u2019re seeing happen in play out in our longer standing business in Apollo was this American football cleats, its happening in the same way in baseball cleats, its happening in the same way in training shoes, in running shoes and in basketball shoes right now. So the big place that we are looking for is and you know I can, one thing I definitely want to say is that when it comes to footwear, we have a solid footwear company, I mean, with the growth that we saw at a 44% growth that we saw were over $400 million today and growing at an incredibly healthy phase. ", "We are the number two market share in overall footwear at several of our key accounts. So there are lots of places around this country and frankly places we are working on around the world that Under Armour is absolutely winning in footwear. And then also things like anecdotally doubling our basketball footwear business as season lead by things like the ClutchFit Drive that you saw on - three other teams we have in the top 25 in the AT Men\u2019s poll [ph] and I think three to the top five in the Women\u2019s Day people is well. So Under Armour makes great quality shoes and especially when you talk about things like basketball, we have the leading vote getter by 40,000 votes for the NBA All-Star Game.", "Like Stephen Curry has been an unbelievable human being to begin with, but its five odd quarters something this is flat out of inspirational. So we\u2019re incredibly proud of what that means. In addition with Kip, we talk about Peter joined in the team. So you\u2019re bringing an professional in, you\u2019re bringing an absolute that who comes in who\u2019s basically seen the big movie before and someone who could help us as we start guiding ourselves through that where a lot of big numbers starts to laying in. And I don\u2019t see the growth rates flowing in footwear and I\u2019ll temper myself when I say that. But I think that we have an opportunity as impressive as 44% is, I would say there are opportunities still much, much larger than that.", "In 2014 alone we added 60 teammates to our team. We really reinforced our office in Portland and some - a place that we will continue to add talent and bring people toward as well as bring Peter Ruppe as our new SVP of Footwear, the 25 years of industry experience that Peter brings is something that complements probably the brand knowledge that Kip has, what\u2019s the expertise that we build here. And beyond that just a really great team and a really positive energy in Under Armour footwear.", "So we\u2019ve pleaded we\u2019ll continue to lead and attack their football, baseball all these categories, Speedform is actually a product in a platform that we\u2019re taking into our creative business as a whole, the highlights continues to be the top selling premium product sold at key accounts like Eastbay and frankly places where kid shop go to a football field and you\u2019ll find our products showing up there.", "Our running is really the next chapter for us. It\u2019s a place that we really focused. The Speedform that they view it last year was pretty impressive, the Gemini what you will hear from people its not only the best running shoes that Under Armour has ever built, they could be one of the best running shoes ever. It is that good of a product and has a $130. We\u2019re really reinforcing ourselves. I think as a premium player and what we\u2019re seeing from some of the especially the key accounts that we have in the run specialty shop getting refills and things that the kind of reaction we have in Under Armour for a very long time.", "That\u2019s [indiscernible] Stephen is a signature shoe kind of an individual. And as I said in my script earlier that Stephen will be featuring him next weekend at the NBA All-Star Game where we\u2019re launching a commercial, the new Stephen Curry one, a lot of energy and expectation around that. And I think the campaign is one of the best that we\u2019ve done in our history. And then as I mentioned on the earlier question as well like footwear is something that stops its sporting goods either. What we\u2019re doing in the outdoor space, our outdoor footwear line is one of the most impressive frankly anywhere in the world and that shoe that we won best new product and best innovation at the outdoor retailer, the Fat Tire shoe that thing is cool.", "You should get one to your kids; they\u2019re going to go crazy for it. But I think it also demonstrates our ability to sell leveraging our partnerships with people like Michelin and people like [indiscernible] of the world that we don\u2019t have to do all the heavy lifting ourselves and that we\u2019re taking this platform that we have as the consumer wants our brand. We\u2019re making sure that we just put the best around it all the time.", "So lastly from a distribution standpoint in footwear, we\u2019re going to continue to broad in our footwear business inside of our existing terrific partners that we have. We don\u2019t believe that we need necessarily new doors today as much as we just need to be excellent in the doors where we\u2019re doing business. And for us that begins with sporting goods it also means extending some of our key partners at places like Finish Line and Foot Locker. And one quick note as well as just to support that we felt from the executive team as Foot Locker and particularly Ken Hicks and wishing him well in his retirement and welcoming Dick Johnson, who is that first person who bought Under Armour back in each day when he reared that in 1999.", "So long story we\u2019ve been at this for a long time, we feel pretty very proud of what we\u2019ve done and thankfully we think we\u2019re just getting started.", "Kevin Plank", "[Indiscernible] sneak out long was a pair of flat tires not from kind to me in and I didn\u2019t want it.", "Eric Tracy", "Hey, let me just really, quickly follow with Brad, just again if we could from a modeling perspective, if we strip out currency and the supply chain efficiency sort of offset there. And I think through again just a mix shifts on the accelerating footwear and still outsized international growth. And what point are we at whether it\u2019s, we really start to flatten it, it is at least neutral is it this year, is it next year just trying to think through to delusion accretions for these businesses?", "Robin Thurston", "I think one thing we should take into account is the fact that we had been investing in the Connected Fitness business over the last couple of years, even before these two acquisitions. So the reality that our operating margin has been relatively flat over the last couple of years that 11.4%, 11.5% range. Reality is the mix of that Connected Fitness obviously has been an investment and increasing investment on the last couple of years, even before these acquisitions and on top of that, obviously adding 90 basis point dilutive impact in 2015.", "So the reality is over the last couple of years we have been leveraging kind of our core business. Even though we are investing in places like International, and innovation and product creation and footwear, we\u2019re still seeing some leverage across other points in our existing business. And Connected Fitness has been an investment perspective.", "So if you look going forward, I think, what you would expect to see is continued investment in places like I just mentioned, International although becoming profitable and although leveraging within the business and itself, is still really an overall investment point in overall company. Things like Brand House was the kind of - just kind to getting of the ground whether it be Brand House in the international front or specifically Brand House here in North America is definitely in investment mode for us.", "And then I think again Connected Fitness with the acquisitions on top of the existing model will be investment mode. So I think what you\u2019re seeing here is kind of a continuation of leverage in our core business in the places you would expect us the leverage and balancing that leverage with needed investments to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth for our brand.", "Eric Tracy", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks very much, Eric.", "Kevin Plank", "And If I could just take one moment and thank everyone for joining us today. We\u2019re incredibly proud of our results and performance and consistency that we have demonstrated throughout 2014 as well as the defining steps taken today to drive our leadership in the Connected Fitness space.", "We look forward to providing further details on our Connective Fitness efforts at our presentation and webcast next Tuesday, February 10, live from New York City beginning at 10 AM and you are all invited. Thank you all very much and have a great year.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

(NYSE:UA) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2015  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Tom Shaw - Director, IR", "Kevin Plank - Chairman & CEO", "Brad Dickerson - COO & CFO", "Analysts", "Matt McClintock - Barclays", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Under Armour First Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there we will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Tom Shaw", "Thanks. Good morning to everyone joining us today's first quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "In addition, as required by Regulation G, we need to make you aware that during the call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial information specifically currency neutral net revenue growth. We provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information in our earnings release a copy of which is available on our website at uabiz.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the first quarter and provide an update to our 2015 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. I want to start this morning with some math. There are 1,696 players in the NFL and there is only one Super Bowl MVP. There have been hundreds of skiers in the Women's Alpine Circuit since 2004 but just one has won 67 times. There are 450 players in the NBA and there is at least in my mind just one MVP. There are 125 players on the PGA Tour and there is only one Masters Champion.", "The numbers associated with the recent performances of Under Armour athletes like Tom Brady, Lindsey Vonn, Stephen Curry, and most recently Jordan Spieth, are compelling and true evidence that we are just getting started.", "Three months ago we talked to you about some of the important numbers Under Armour achieved in 2014. So far in 2015, we put some equally impressive numbers on the scoreboard. First, there were acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomando, which combines our existing MapMyFitness and UA record platforms, creates the world's largest digital health and fitness community now with over 130 million unique users.", "We opened our Chicago Brand House, 30,000 square feet of Magnificent Mile with the best presentation of the Under Armour brand experience anywhere in the world.", "We opened a store in the Mall of America, bringing the Under Armour brand to more than 40 million shoppers annually.", "We signed S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube, Brazil's most successful club with 18 overall titles and more than 17 million supporters in that market.", "And with the results from our first quarter, we've now recorded 20 consecutive quarters of 20-plus-percent revenue growth, that's five years since our last quarter with less than 20% revenue growth or to put it more topically back before Jordan Spieth had his driver's license.", "Bur without question, the most impressive performances were put together by the Under Armour athletes I mentioned earlier. So indulge me for a minute while I talk about these record setting performances from Under Armour athletes so far in 2015.", "Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl Ring and his third Super Bowl MVP Award. Lindsey Vonn broke the record for most carrier Alpine Skiing Women's World Cup wins. Stephen Curry the league's most unguardable player led his team to the best record in the NBA and is my choice to win the NBA's MVP Award when it's announced shortly, as well as having been the leading vote getter at the MVP All Start Game.", "Jordan Spieth a record setting performance at the Masters where he became the first player to win wire-to-wire since 1976. He reached 19 under, which no one had ever done in the history of the tournament. Set the record for most birdies at one Masters with 28 and became only the second man in a hundred years to win a major wire-to-wire at 21 years or younger.", "Equally important, Jordan dominated those four days at the Masters, with the sense of purpose and will that define both him and Under Armour. Part of the formula for success in our business is making a big bet and we did so when we signed Jordan as a teenager, a few years ago.", "To quote the great Dodger's Executive, Branch Rickey, luck is the residue of design and knowing that we have Jordan Spieth as the face of Under Armour Golf into the future, solidifies our presence in the category, and aligns us with a new face of Golf in the United States. We're proud to be associated with athletes like Tom, Lindsey, Stephen, and Jordan, not just because of their accomplishments, but especially, because the people that they are.", "The great performances of these athletes are driving sales force too. We had a great launch at the Curry One at the All Star Game in February and there is tremendous buzz in the sneaker community about that shoe as well as great anticipation already around the Curry Two. So while it feels good to be viewed as a growing presence in the signature shoe market, it's important to recognize that we are just getting started.", "In golf apparel, our team did a great job of outfitting Jordan for the Masters and it provided terrific visibility for our golf apparel and footwear. When we signed him, we knew he had the ability to help drive our brand, beyond just golf, and that we needed to align our product stories with his aggressive, young, and fearless personality.", "We come a long way in the category in the last two years, and because we know that every detail matters. It was nice to be able to put him in that blue polo on Sunday, knowing how great it would look wearing a Green Jacket.", "Moving on other areas of our business that continue to shine, we saw 41% growth in our footwear business this past quarter. In addition to the heat being generated in basketball by the Curry One, our SpeedForm Gemini running shoe at $130 continued to collect great reviews in check at retail.", "Building off the success of our SpeedForm platform, we're introducing cleated models in both American and global football, including the boot worn by one of our newest athlete, Memphis Depay, the top scorer in the Dutch League who helped his team clinch first place, Saturday, with a spectacular free kick, and who at only 21-years-old may soon become one of the most exciting players in the beautiful game.", "We continue to see strength in our core apparel business, with revenues up 21% in the quarter, the 22nd consecutive quarter of 20-plus-percent apparel revenue growth, our largest category.", "In addition to our strength in golf, we are off to a strong start with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. As we grow our presence in key footwear categories, like running and basketball, it's helping drive our business in those key growth categories across all men's and women's apparel. Our growing strength in footwear is also helping to drive apparel sales with kids, as we understand how critically important the footwear piece is to how our young male and female consumers dress.", "Our financial results are great evidence of the growing power of the Under Armour brand and our ability to execute against this tremendous opportunity. But operationally, we believe we have yet to play our best game. We believe there is a great opportunity to improve both how our supply chain gets product to market, and how our product looks once we get there.", "On the latter, our growing pipeline of innovation in footwear, apparel, accessories, and Connected Fitness, provides us with the opportunity to evolve our model by providing better merchandizing to our wholesale partners, as well as in our own direct consumer businesses. We are adding human capital to our global merchandizing function, starting with Kevin Eskridge, who will run our global merchandizing team after two and plus years successfully establishing our brand in China.", "The Under Armour brand will continue to grow by ensuring we show up in a premium way whenever our consumer interacts with our brand, whether that's in a wholesale partner store, our own doors, and e-commerce environment or anywhere our brand is available.", "Our ability to stratify our presentation at retail with multiple end use categories is an asset we have yet to fully maximize, and we believe these types of surgical improvements in our merchandising will help ensure our continued growth with our wholesale partners.", "In our DTC business, we are laser focused on using our Brand House stores to provide that elite presentation of the Under Armour brand. That presentation is on display at our newest 30,000 square foot Brand House store on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, where we've dedicated space for men's and women's, running, golf, basketball, hunt, studio, and use, as well as the presentations of local assets like Notre Dame, Northwestern, The Cubs and White Sox. It's also our first opportunity to bring our Connected Fitness story to our consumer and we will evolve that experience as we continue to develop our Brand House presence.", "Our Connected Fitness community added over 10 million unique users since our last call in February and now totals more than 130 million combined.", "We average more than a 130,000 people in the first quarter downloading one of our four apps.", "We are focused on integrating the core companies and continued development of the individual apps as we build out the Under Armour record platform.", "To build on this, we are expanding our partnership with SAP for the infrastructure that will help us create a single integrated view of our consumer. We believe the brand that can build true communities among our consumers by improving their health and fitness will be best positioned and we are focused on the competitive advantage we enjoy by having the world's largest digital health and fitness community.", "The final piece I want to cover today is our fastest growing business, international, where we grew 74% this past quarter. We continue to show great strength as the Under Armour brand establishes itself as an authentic athletic brand in new markets. We will add over 100 total stores outside the United States in 2015, and this past quarter we opened our first stores in Abu Dhabi and Brazil. Next month, we will be in Brazil to unveil the kit for our newest team, S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube, the most successful club in the country's history. Adding key assets like S\u00e3o Paulo accelerates our presence in these new markets and helps us deliver authenticity as we establish ourselves in global football.", "And finally on international, we are most excited about the fact that we are just getting started. I mentioned earlier that we are bringing our former GM in China back to run our global merchandising team. Taking over as our new GM in China is Eric Haskell, who brings extensive industry expensive in the country as he leads what will be one of our largest countries in revenue outside North America by the end of 2015.", "So, whether it was football cleats and we entered that market, Golf with Jordan Spieth, for Basketball with Stephen Curry, we consistently proven our ability to go hard and disrupt key categories which we believe positions us as the next grade global athletic brand. And with the additional asset of our Connected Fitness platform, we believe, we can do so in a way that connects us to our consumer like no other brand in the planet. We are truly just getting started.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin. And I'll just spend some time discussing our first quarter results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted our results represented 20th straight quarter achieving above 20% top-line growth. We are proud of this consistency particularly in a period where several external headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our business.", "On a currency neutral basis net revenues increased 27% for the period. In addition, our North American business experienced some disruptions from the West Coast port delays and weather-related store closures during the period which we estimate had a 1% to 2% cumulative impact on overall net revenues.", "Looking at our product categories we grew apparel net revenues 21% to $555 million compared to $459 million in the prior year's quarter. Despite the impact of some of the headwinds I just outlined, we were able to post strong results in our largest product category, led by the introductions of Armour Base Layer and our updated training platform, as well as continued growth in Golf and running.", "First quarter footwear net revenues increased 41% to $161 million from a $114 million in the prior year representing 20% of our total business for the first time since our initial running shoe launch in early 2009. As the centerpieces of our first brand holiday of 2015, our new SpeedForm Gemini and Apollo Event running shoes, as well as Stephen Curry's first signature basketball shoe, the Curry One, drove tremendous excitement for the category in the marketplace.", "Our accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 23% to $63 million from $52 million last year with particular strength within our bags line. Our global direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 21% for the quarter representing approximately 25% of net revenues. The e-commerce growth rate exceeded our retail growth rate during the quarter with weather driving store closures for several of our domestic doors during the quarter. Nevertheless, we were excited with the retail progress we made during the quarter, including strong new Brand House openings in Chicago on the Magnificent Mile, and in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, as well as our first Brand House store in Brazil.", "From a global standpoint we ended the first quarter with 153 owned stores, including a 134 factory house stores and 19 brand house stores compared to a 134 owned stores in the year-ago period comprised of a 123 factory house stores and a 11 brand house stores.", "In our e-commerce channel we continue to see strong overall trends as our consumer continues to shift to mobile which represented over 40% of our traffic and nearly 20% of our e-commerce sales during the period. At the same time, we are seeing a strong response to our new local e-commerce sites including the first quarter launches in the Philippines and the Netherlands, which we believe is indicative of some of the untapped demand in these markets.", "Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 20% to $700 million in the first quarter compared to $538 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency neutral basis North America net revenues increased 21% for the period primarily by growth in the apparel and footwear categories and in our direct-to-consumer channel as I just outlined.", "International net revenues increased 74% to $96 million in the first quarter and represent 12% of total net revenues. On a currency neutral basis international net revenues increased 86% for the period. This was the first quarter in Under Armour's history where the international mix surpassed 10%.", "In the EMEA region in addition to our strong launch of our new Dutch website, we celebrate the opening our new office in Germany, which puts us closer to our customers at a time when we are beginning to see strong traction within the market. We were also just beginning our new distributor agreement in the Middle-East which included the January opening of our first regional Brand House store in Abu Dhabi.", "In Asia-Pacific we more than tripled our business in China, as we began to accelerate our partner store expansion efforts and experience significant traction across e-commerce. We also remain in the early stages of our expansion efforts in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.", "Finally, in Latin America, we are still less than a year into our market entry in Brazil, and we are seeing success building brand awareness with efforts such as our recent signing of S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube, the opening of our first Brand House store in S\u00e3o Paulo, and a local marketing push in conjunction with our SpeedForm Gemini launch.", "Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins held steady year-over-year at 46.9% with three primary factors contributing to this performance during the quarter. First, favorable product margins in both North American and international apparel and footwear benefited gross margins by approximately 110 basis points for the period.", "Second, higher airfreight cost primarily tied to our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the period.", "Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points for the period as we purchased the majority of our inventory for international businesses in U.S. dollars.", "Selling general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 80 basis points to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2015, from 42.7% in the prior year's period. Starting this quarter in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation we are consolidating our SG&A detail into two primary buckets: marketing and other SG&A. Other SG&A is the sum of our previously outlined selling, product innovation and supply chain, and corporate services buckets.", "SG&A details for the first quarter are as follows: Marketing cost decreased to 13.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.7% in the prior-year period driven primarily by the shift of certain planned expenditures to later in 2015. Other SG&A costs increased to 30.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 29% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in Brand House and e-commerce. The one-time deal closing cost of $6.3 million for the Connected Fitness acquisitions negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points.", "Operating income for the first quarter increased 3% to $28 million, compared with $27 million in the prior-year period.", "Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased to $4 million, compared with $2 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Our first quarter tax rate of 50.3% was unfavorable to the 46.1% rate last year, primarily driven by increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses. Discrete tax items such as international losses are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in period such as first quarter with lower consolidated pretax income levels.", "Given these factors below the operating line, our first quarter net income decreased 13% to $12 million, compared to $14 million in the prior-year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.05 from $0.06 in the prior year's period.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter increased 29% to $232 million, compared with $180 million at March 31, 2014.", "Inventory for the quarter increased 22% to $578 million, compared to $472 million at March 31, 2014.", "Total debt increased to $677 million as compared to $152 million at March 31, 2014, and $284 million at December 31, 2014. The first quarter increase reflects the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions, including $250 million on our revolving line of credit and additional $150 of term debt.", "Looking at our cash flows, our investment and capital expenditures was $68 million for the first quarter compared to $31 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our new North American distribution center, our corporate headquarters in Baltimore, and our global fixturing and retail strategies.", "Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.78 billion representing growth of 23%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $400 million to $408 million representing growth of 13% to 15%. Our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of $6.3 million of one-time transaction cost incurred in the first quarter, as well as full-year operating losses from these businesses, and non-cash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions.", "Below operating results, we estimate $9 million increase year-over-year in interest expense, primarily due to incremental borrowings under our credit agreement to fund the Connected Fitness acquisition.", "We currently expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 41%, which is higher than previously anticipated given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacts our international profitability, which in turn negatively impacts our consolidated tax rate. As this impact is more pronounced in quarters with lower consolidated pretax profits, our guidance assumed a second quarter tax rate similar to our first quarter rate followed by a more normalized effective tax rate expected in the back half of the year.", "I'd also like to add some color on several items, starting with revenues. As we indicated last quarter, and as reflected in our first quarter results, international and footwear are areas that are planned to outperform in 2015, as we continue to enter and expand in new markets and see successes across our footwear line. From a macro standpoint the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to impact our 2015 net revenues by approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points given current exchange rates, and we have factored this into our updated guidance.", "Now looking at gross margins. Given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar along with anticipated higher ongoing airfreight needed to service to our customers, we now expect full-year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. This compares to our prior guidance of a modest year-over-year improvement. Specifically, we expect our second quarter and third quarter margins will be down approximately 50 basis points compared to last year. We continue to plan for higher airfreight expenses in the second quarter as we continue our efforts to mitigate the impact of the West Coast port disruptions, while the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar is expected to have the most pronounced margin impact in the second and third quarters.", "In SG&A, the timing of certain expenses has resulted in some changes to our quarterly cadence. Given our current visibility, we now expect SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 200 basis points during the second quarter, including higher costs associated with our Brand House strategy, given the timing of store openings, as well as the timing of certain marketing and innovation expenditures. We anticipate SG&A will continue to deleverage albeit to a lesser degree during the third quarter before showing modest leverage during the fourth quarter.", "From an operating income standpoint, while the gross margin headwinds have increased since our previous guidance, we have seen some offsetting impacts from our Connected Fitness acquisitions, primarily related to lower amortization expense than previously anticipated. In addition, we continue to expect to mitigate some of the overall margin pressures through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A, with the largest offset emerging in the fourth quarter.", "Finally some updates on our planned capital expenditures. We had previously indicated planned 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million inclusive of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore.", "Following our recent acquisitions in the Connected Fitness space we began looking into areas of integration tied to our overall business. An important first step is our technology platform. As such, we've decided to invest in our systems with SAP to enhance, expand, and integrate our core apparel and footwear systems, along with our Connected Fitness platforms. This project will occur over the next few years with the initial phases occurring in 2015. As a result we now expect 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your question to two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "Our first question is from Matt McClintock of Barclays. You may begin.", "Matt McClintock", "Kevin, in your prepared remarks you talked about merchandising improvements and supply chain improvements. I wondered if you could focus a little bit more on the supply chain improvements. What are you doing in regards to working with your supply chain to make it more efficient going forward?", "Kevin Plank", "Well I think a couple of things we've done is just from an organization standpoint the way we structure it. So Brad, as you know, has taken on additional responsibilities in making shuffling some things around. Well we prioritize footwear and I've moved Kip and have him exclusively focused on footwear and innovation, and I think it's really going to be a driver for the company with what you'll see coming out as we see this massive opportunity in footwear.", "At the same time, the supply chain particularly as you get more complex particularly as you look to grow globally it's incredibly complex. And frankly for us much further beyond what we were just making, we used to sell tight T-shirts and we'd put them in sporting good stores and they would sell and now it's a much more complex and diverse line and you have things like women's that includes fashion and flow and all these other pieces that come to bear. Doing business with other markets is incredibly sophisticated and difficult as well. We just opened or just broke around rather a few months ago, a new distribution facility down in Tennessee, and things like that that are happening and taking place for us.", "When I wanted us to come across frankly a bit deprecating for the company in terms of we just think we can do better. We're incredibly proud I think of the results that we put on the paper and what we've done particularly from an apparel standpoint with 22 consecutive quarters and approaching the growth that we have. But as I said, we had yet to play our best game.", "So I don't think that what Brad is building out with our team and Jim Hardy who has been our Chief Supply Chain Officer here for the last several years, and bringing to bear the expertise. I can tell you what we're doing physically with warehouses and some of the other components but also systems are going to play a massive role in where we're heading.", "One of the things I also mentioned was our new partnership with SAP, who Bill McDermott has been on our board for last nine or nearly 10 years. And so we've had a lot of insight into what running what best -- best run companies do and what they look like. And I think we're now in a position that we're big enough to be able to implement that but not too big where it will actually be a hindrance to the company. So I think there is a renewed figure is that what we've done to-date is -- has been good. And we've done well. But we're just looking and saying from a company that now has a focus on things like women's wear, we're looking to turn product every three and four weeks versus having two seasons a year.", "Doing business and truly having distribution facilities in Europe, in Asia, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, around the world, and figuring out those complicated supply chains that include things like duty and tariff and all that -- those other issues, it's just -- it's becoming a much more complicated world and we're elevating ourselves. And so Brad is moving away from the CFO which of course will continue to report to him is part of the challenge with closing on $4 billion or close to $2 billion in FOB this year, gross margin moving few bps let alone percentage point or two has a massive impact in the company.", "And so we think that we've done well, we think that we've been probably a little fat in getting to this point, and we're just looking and recognizing the fact that if we begin to tighten the belt and bring in professionals, this is not like finding a new designer where you're hoping someone can do the job, there is lots of people that have this expertise and experience from some of the fast fashion people that are great to learn from as well as we can implement ourselves. And so I think what you're seeing is the company growing up.", "And the last thing I'll just say is around the merchandizing function. We did not have a merchandising function in the organization. And I say that from, we had product people that build product, and we had sales people that sold it in, and then the buyers would select what they wanted, but truly curating and articulating exactly the voice that we want depending on the distribution is not a function that we had as a company. And so what you're seeing I believe is a more sophisticated Under Armour, and at the end of the day I think we're going to have a better end result for our consumer first and foremost that continue to drive the kind of results that I think we've made everyone accustomed to over the last five years.", "Matt McClintock", "Sounds great. Thanks a lot, Kevin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane of Citigroup. You may begin.", "Kate McShane", "Hi, thanks good morning. I was wondering if we could hear a little more about your women's business. Can you update us on the performance of the category and have some of the expansion that we've seen within just women's in general and the department store and some of the supporting goods stores helps the overall brand?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, Kate, I think first of all we see that general trend toward athletic in women's fashion as a whole is something that we don't see it slowing any time soon and we're very fortune for that, I think being the heart and soul of it. Beginning going back to 2014, we are incredibly proud, I believe the conversation that we kicked off with our will what I want campaign that began with Misty Copeland and that aspirational commercial that we had with Misty and then following up with Gisele. That -- the momentum from that is something that we're still feeling today, and capping off last week with Misty being named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people on the planet. So I think we are having a bigger conversation than even what is the style color that's in the store. At the end of the day though that is what we do for a living and we are looking at how the style color hits in the store.", "I am not sure that we have taken full advantage of the conversation we started from a product merchandising standpoint, and we believe that there is a greater opportunity for us in women's to have a conversation with her that is meeting her where she is versus asking her to come to us. And we articulated that last year with this idea of the athletics, the female athlete versus the athletic female. And so I think you'll continue to see styles and silhouettes and speaking about Under Armour, we basically build our women's business on the back of compression shorts and sports bras. And where we are trying to show up in more places for and be more relevant beyond just strictly in the gym or what she is wearing beneath, I think its part of where we're going. And I say all that in the context of, we've got the $600 million women's business by the end of 2014. So there is no signs of this slowing. I think you're just seeing us continue to sophisticate but we feel great I believe about the team that we put in place, momentum we have, and the direction that we're going.", "A couple of things to play with that as well and I think it's worth mentioning is our Connected Fitness platform which you know and bringing that on and assembling that community of now over $130 million, more than 60% of which are women. And so you know, as we really get our arms around what we have there, we believe that continuing that conversation with her and having finding ways to have meaningful conversations, number one, of how we can communicate to her, but also how we can listen to her.", "And so I think you'll see Under Armour continue to take those steps towards being more relevant in more aspects of her life and I guess if there's one message that I wanted to get across today and whether it's sort of may be a bit masked in the merchandising is that we don't believe we played our best game yet. We don't think when you walk into a store you're getting the best version of Under Armour yet, and it's where we were and we're proud of it but we believe that there is people out there that are doing it well. We believe we are one of those people. We just think we can do a lot better.", "So more to come in that and if I end it with anything, may be just quickly on distribution, talking about meeting her where she is, our sporting goods partners have been incredibly aggressive in this space as well, with ourselves, with our merchandisers the way we set up. There is actually a lot of competition in sporting goods and I feel we are answering that well. But we also see that number one in winning in our core distribution and number two, the ability for us to move to other places where she is shopping is something that you'll continue to see happening from us with people like our department store partners and a few other places.", "But answer it in one felt swoop, Kate, is we believe our women's business can be as large if not bigger than our men's business and we will stick to that and we are pretty proud of our men's business as well.", "Kate McShane", "That's very helpful. Thank you. And then if I could ask one follow-up question on international, specifically Europe. Can you give us any more detail on where you are today in terms of distribution versus where you were last year at this time whether it would be types of retailers or countries that you're in versus last year?", "Kevin Plank", "Let me take a crack and may be Brad can help on the back of that too. So we're -- we really had breakthrough year in 2014 and again like most things that came down to leadership. We struggled for a longtime in Europe beginning back in 2006, when we launched and finding our way and finding local partners that would spoke six languages and then finding Americans to send over and kind of back and forth. And I think we settled on some of that a) had a greater understanding and relationship with the brand and guy named Matt Shearer who is running our Canadian business for us and took it from basically $0 million to over $100 million and walked into $50 million or $60 million U.S. dollar business and we crossed $100 million for the first time in 2014. So the momentum continues in Europe and we are incredibly excited about that.", "And it is not as much today about a distribution expansion game but it is about getting better in the places where we are doing business because when we say we were distributed in most of the stores it was a few racks at best of a couple compression T-shirts in typically men's only. And so we're looking to I think modify that conversation as well and take our positioning to be first of all a full resource brand meaning men's, women's, and kids. To show up and where we show up, to show up in presence, sporting goods particularly in a place like the UK has been a pretty challenged place from a discount environment and so we are also looking to be able to offset that of may be creating a unique experience for people in wholesale distribution.", "And then not like you're seeing us do here in America, we want to augment that with our own full price stores. The Brand House concept is something we're incredibly proud of and is really been working for us. In entering us back to America for just a second, the 30,000 square feet we just opened up in Chicago, we could only dream about what that would do from a brand elevation standpoint in celebrating some of the stories that we have in the area, but I can tell you as a company as we look to move forward we will continue to have wholesale being incredibly important part of what we do but where we look for statement retail through our Brand House concepts whether that means 2,000 to 3,000 square feet in some of the smaller markets like we mentioned Abu Dhabi or 30,000 square feet in Chicago. I think it's important that people understand the full expression of what our brand can be and frankly it's not appropriate that it's always interpreted. So we'll continue to build on that and I think you'll see more of that coming from us particularly in a place like Europe.", "Brad Dickerson", "And Kate, I'll just add on to that like if you look at the three spots where we had the most increase in revenues year-over-year in Europe the UK, Germany, and the Middle East were the three places that you'd see that. The UK, we talked about opening up an office in Manchester back in probably 2014, and seen some benefits getting closer to the customer and the consumer there. Germany again putting some focus in market over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months and just recently now opening up an office in Munich in Germany again getting close to the customer there. And in the Middle East, we opened up our distributor in the Middle East in Q4 of last year so seeing obviously some benefit we're comping that in Q1.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Sole of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Jay Sole", "Kevin, can you talk about Connected Fitness strategy for a moment? Just from the big picture perspective how will you define success in Connected Fitness?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, we spent a lot of time thinking about that and looking at what we bought and what it means in the positioning. So a couple of things, just some updates, since we've been to -- we left in New York and gave you a last real deep dive on what's happening with Connected Fitness. So first of all it's still very, it's very new. The MyFitnessPal deal just closed on March 17. So we are less than 30 days roughly into our partnership in getting to know one another.", "As we said, the first year was all going to be about integration and the integration begins with culture, culture of four different companies really coming together and we've been doing that with MapMyFitness from Austin, couple -- five to six weeks ago we just opened our new 35,000 square feet office in Austin which is -- it's an incredibly hot tech market and the Under Armour Connected Fitness office there anchored with Robin and his team is no exception to it.", "So I think that we're beginning sort of putting a flag in the ground of what that Under Armour attitude looks like. And it's evolving with taking the best things I believe of the culture that were like MapMyFitness and evolving that together to really help shape Under Armour. And it's no different with Endomando and MyFitnessPal and the way that we are going to approach that.", "The first thing we realized in the integration effort though is that this need for alignment from a systems perspective. So now between our own e-commerce, the number of people we have 40 somewhat odd close to 50 million people walking into our retail stores in North America this year, the 130 million unique users that we have on the platform. Finding a way to synthesize all this information is where the SAP integration really comes from. So we're looking for this single view of the consumer that will give us a much better picture and easier understanding of our consumer. I think it's going to make us a lot smarter ultimately in the long run and we will anticipate the needs of our athletes and of our consumers.", "The second thing that we're really focused on is building out the communities. So within all of the apps; I mentioned some of the stats in my written comments. But building the world's largest 24X7 365 day digital health and fitness community. In the first quarter alone we added over 10 million. And I want to be clear; we expect to update you on the growth numbers in our Connected Fitness in 10 million unit increment. So when we cross the 120 million, we crossed the 130 million, we crossed the 140 million that's how we will be articulating that.", "And you just look at the sheer scale where we don't want to compromise MyFitnessPal, Endomando, or MapMyFitness those -- their individual apps and their downloads, we want to continue to encourage that. But we want to continue to focus on them all helping us with Under Armour record sort of a collaborative product that we're going to build that we think will then be able to aggregate those disparate communities into one place in time by satisfying them, and so using all of the mind power that we have from Mette, Mike Lee, and Robin, of the founders of the three sites. We think that we have the capacity and capability to do that.", "And showing that we're not slowing down any of that growth, I mean, we average over 130,000 people were downloading one of the four apps every single day in the first quarter. And we're not really seeing any signs of that slowing any time soon. So we have a bit of concern and trepidation in our part speaking about how we define victory is that our people going to say they've -- now they've have been bought by a company, I\u2019m not going to use it anymore, so we haven't seen any signs of that. We just see them now having a higher expectation I think of the product that we're going to deliver. And I can tell you that everyone now with our closing on 500 people working in our Connected Fitness and digital spaces are focused on working toward that.", "So what I'd tell you is that, I'm going to hold back before I truly define victory. I'm just going to start with; we think we've grabbed something that was incredibly unique that's really large in size and scale. And that -- with that there is the monetization things that we've talked about, that we can look at from, a) the brand halo effect, subscription services, products and bundles, pretty new product services that we can showcase. But at the end of the day, we're still finding out exactly what we have. Meanwhile, we're going to continue to grow what we have, we're going to be thoughtful about the investments that we make there, and we're going to continue to encourage things as they come to us, I mean the Apple Watch is a great example of that. I mean, three of our four apps are now completely compatible with the Apple Watch and we encourage it. We think it's another conversation around tracking and wearable's and in health and fitness and so it's actually the best thing that can happen to us. And so those are the good things that I think are happening.", "So we're also working on building great new products and what I can tell you, is if I would give you -- put one flag in the stand, we want a little more time to reflect, we want a little more time to get used to the flight that we're getting used to between Baltimore to Austin to San Francisco to Copenhagen, and get them comfortable with us and us comfortable with them, and we anticipate to have some very large news for you around Under Armour's Investor Day in September.", "Jay Sole", "Well, that's sounds great. I mean, I can follow-up with one on that. Can you talk about the number of users in which the growth has been tremendous? Are there other metrics that you're using to measure progress? Is it sales? Is it on your engagement? I'm a user on the website? Any other detail you can share with us how to measure going forward, would be really helpful?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, I'm not really ready to give the new one, but another stat that I like a lot is the number of workouts that we log in a given month. And when we made the announcement, in the month of January alone, more than a 100 million workouts were logged in the month of January. And we're frankly, we're seeing that number increase and obviously, January is a big month where we all make big promises to ourselves that what's about to happen. It's like getting ready for the new school here.", "Well how we follow through with that in February and March, when it's cold and rainy and it's not quite as easy, but we'll be updating you with that in the future going forward. But I think we want to make sure we've got all the data synthesized and have it completely perfect. So we'll be updating you on the next call and again at the Investor Day.", "Jay Sole", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. You may begin.", "Omar Saad", "I wanted to ask about DTC actually, it slowed a little bit. I know some of it was the -- some of the storms in the quarter. We've been hearing kind of generally outlet trends; traffic outlets have been slower in general to outlet centers. Why don't you give an update specifically on your outlet business, and then also the e-commerce side as well?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Omar, I'll take this one. On the DTC side, maybe it's kind of reconcile; some of the impact of some of these things that we talked about in my prepared remarks. Again, on the total revenue side, we talked about growing at 25%, but obviously at a constant currency we're at 27% and then we -- estimated impact of due to port delays and weather 1% to 2%. I will be honest with you I think we're being pretty conservative there. The thing that we can really measure and define accurately there is the retail piece, our own retail, and we know that our own retail was at least at one percentage point due to store closures for two different weekends during the first quarter where the storms hit on a weekend and we literally had dozens of stores closed down.", "It's a little more difficult to estimate exact impact of ports on our businesses both in DTC and wholesale, and a little more difficult to impact -- the weather impact on our wholesale business due to some degree. So we think that 1% to 2% is pretty conservative. So again total revenue going from 25% to 29% I get the use upper end of that at port and weather impact.", "On the DTC side, again I think if you look at weather and port we'd probably be more we say in the upper 20s as a percentage growth which would be similar to our growth rate in the fourth quarter for DTC. The biggest driver of DTC growth change year-over-year as we've talked about is the fact that we're opening up less factory house stores so we planned our DTC growth down year-over-year because of the slower growth in factory house for us and again that was as planned.", "On the e-commerce side in DTC, we've seen consistent strong growth in e-commerce. There's not really when you look at Q1's growth rate versus last year's growth rate pretty consistent growth rate overall in e-commerce. So, most of that decline in DTC growth rate was coming from the retail side, a lot of -- some of it being planned and some of it being because of the impact of weather.", "If we also just to take that a little bit further into the impact of North America obviously we put North America at 20% growth. Again we take into effect FX which is more on our Canadian business and again the port and weather challenges we probably are closer to probably a 24% or so growth rate in North America normalized taking into those items.", "So DTC going forward I think obviously what we would expect not really any impact going forward for port and weather obviously in the next few quarters. However, again just to -- again to make you aware that we have planned slower growth specifically around factory house new doors.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks, Brad, and that's really helpful. And then Kevin, you talked about it upfront and you got these really hot properties right now in Stephen Curry. May be you guys can talk about some of the initiatives to keep the momentum going with these guys and how you monetize this, keep the momentum going to the summer and to the fall? I don't know if there's product and issues out there or maybe you start to tie it into the digital piece as well, I'm not sure if it's advanced enough to leverage that yet. But just thinking about these two incredibly hot properties right now, how you turn that into dollars and cents or maybe it's just brand halo, help us understand how you're thinking about it?", "Kevin Plank", "Let me expand to the conversation from just those two for a second. But Clayton Kershaw 2014 national MVP and Cy Young Award Winner; Tom Brady 2014 Super Bowl MVP, third time being named the MVP; Memphis Depay, the 20-year-old footballer that we've just signed and somebody that we have great expectation I think what he is going to be as we move into the beautiful game in a bigger way. Jordon obviously Andy Murray the number three ranked tennis player in the world; Misty Copeland, one of the top -- one of the most influential people by Time magazine, Lindsey Vonn, I think another maven just on the women's side and defining what a beautiful athlete is. And then Steph Curry, so without question, Jordon and Steph are two that incredibly relevant right now and make a lot of sense.", "With Jordon, I think we're letting it come to us. I mean incredibly proud I think of the styling and the way that we dress Jordon. It was incredibly athletic, it was incredibly Under Armour, it was incredibly bold, and it was incredibly American, and we that story is something that's going to translate as Under Armour continues to move itself from just being a product that seen and perceived about being on court, on field, on pitch, on the course whatever that may be as we continue to move to other places.", "Now this doesn't mean that we begin to compromise who we are the fact that ever Under Armour product does something for you but I just think that people are finding and seeing more ways that they can utilize and interact with our brand. And so having someone like Jordon will be able to showcase those look for us over the next decade and frankly throughout the rest of his career. It's something we're incredibly excited about. I mean, you look at sports where, over the last 30 years, where transformational athletes have lived and been successful its golf and basketball. And sitting on Jordon that we think has that type of upside and potential is pretty remarkable. So he's having a lot more career to play, it's one tournament but I can tell you when you sit down at Jordon speed there is every belief that he's going to win every golf tournament every time he heads out and takes the Tee box. And I can just tell you that not every golfer things like that. He is different, he is special, and we're continuing to evolve that. So from a PR standpoint I think we had a great pop. We had four great days of celebrating him and they will be more to come and those will be spoke through this play.", "As far as Steph goes, it's certainly not guaranteed nothing is guaranteed. But no matter of what happens with the MVP though we couldn't be more proud to just have someone like Stephen Curry. I said this before is that the crew he rolls with us is his wife, his kid, his mom, and his dad. And right down to his agent, his entire organization, just really some of the best people that we deal with. And so I'm as proud I think of quality of people we have and then of course what they're doing on court.", "But Steph from the Curry One to the Curry Two, we've been modifying and chasing that a little bit, where we had pretty limited expectations of what we really wanted to do with that product to begin with. And looking and saying the places we have coming from places like China are really just extraordinary. And so I think there's probably been some books written about how you're supposed to limit and allocate and tighten things up and so don't get me wrong, we're not going to open the floodgates, but we definitely see this as a watershed moment for us, with several of our athletes who take advantage of things that you just don't get these opportunities in life. And so the train is going by, we're going to hop on the train, and we will exploit that to the sense where it makes the best sense for athlete in continuing their performance first and foremost, as well as things that will celebrate the brand and help drive a great business.", "So the Curry One, the Curry Two, like I've seen the Curry Three and the Curry Four. So this is a -- being in the signature basketball business, we've sort of been around it before but now we're really in the game and it's something that we like very much and at the same time it's going to elevate what was a hundred-ish or little less than $100 million-ish dollar of basketball business and our goal is building a billion dollar basketball brand.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Weiner of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.", "Dave Weiner", "Great. Good morning. So I had two questions, Brad, first on your gross margin guidance. I think you said the 2Q and 3Q gross margin would be down in part because of West Coast airfreight and then FX. Is the expectation then in 4Qs those impacts or at least the first one regarding airfreight will fade and you'll get better -- you get a better expectation in 4Q. And then regarding China, Kevin, I think you said that by 2017 China, could be the second largest market behind North America, if you could just kind of confirm that and may be talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? Thanks.", "Brad Dickerson", "Hi, Dave, I'll take the first gross margin question first and yes, if you just look at the nuances here, I think that the big stories are the foreign currency impact and airfreight. And if you look at just how the timing of those works out, the biggest pressure for airfreight which again is mostly run mitigating the West Coast port delays is going to be in the front half of the year, we talked about it in Q1. We will also have some of it, some residual going into Q2 also.", "And then when you look at FX, your biggest impact, we're going to have impacts every quarter for FX but your biggest impacts are going to be Q2 and Q3 kind of right in the middle of the year. When you kind of allowing those two things up together, your second quarter probably is your biggest challenge because you have both FX and airfreight. In Q3, you end up just with kind of more of an FX impact. And as you get to Q4, the FX impact is still there in Q4, just a little bit lesser because as you recall the strengthening of dollar started to happen in Q4 last year. So your comp gets a little bit easier but you still do have some challenging FX in Q4 also.", "Dave Weiner", "Okay. Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "And Dave, as far as we think about China yes, I made that statement. So I want to be clear that our Japanese business continues to be our largest business outside the United States and closing around $300 million business for us. But that shows up as a licensing partnership that we have there. But without question, I think even considering Europe and the great growth that we're seeing there in the 30% and 40% type of growth range that we're experiencing there, China is one of those, it seems like an abundantly limitless place. And so we're just experiencing feeling a bit of that.", "We finished 2014 with 50 -- roughly 57 stores by the end of the year. We made mention that we're going to be opening a 100 stores outside of North America today. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. So probably come close to doubling the number of stores we have in China and these are partner stores that we show up and lot of it going to be a learning process. I mentioned Eric Haskell will begin with us April 1. He was previously the CFO and COO of Adidas, China, and he was before we brought him on is the MD of Adidas India. So he is somebody that we look at and say that somebody who has sort of been there and done it, they've seen the movie and really while it's not as easy to find him a place our brand as incredibly unique and different. The partnerships and relationships that are there is something that we really just need to tap into. We feel like we've established, I think, done a lot of the hard work in China as we have been there now. Really we opened our first store there in 2010.", "So we've done a lot of slugging to put the hard work in. And frankly with some of these relevant global assets we have and whether that is Stephen Curry that we're working on a tour of China with Stephen at some point later this year, or whether that is the relevance of a Jordon showing up, or the EPL, whether it's Tottenham Hotspur, we're now having Memphis Depay showing up as well. So we think that we're doing things to interact and be relevant in that market and China is almost its own world. And so we believe that when we focused and we now we have the foundations in place that we're really going to be able to number one, bring something to China and give something to China and in turn we think that's going to have a -- reap a great award for Under Armour and ultimately shareholders too.", "Tom Shaw", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "I wanted to follow up, Brad, at the Connected Fitness day you talked about disclosing core operating income, core operating margin going forward just because of some of the noise related to your acquisitions. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your outlook for the full year, whether your view on core had changed, given some of the differences in amortization expense that you're expecting. And then, may be it sounds as if maybe there's opportunity to talk about some more specific cost savings. And, Kevin, you talked about perhaps being a little bit fat getting to where you are in terms of inventory purchases and how we should think about some of the opportunity for more belt-tightening, more efficiencies going forward? Thanks.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure Lindsay. And I think as you talked about yes, there are some changes here in some of the impacts. So obviously with FX working against that's a little bit more from our last time we spoke and airfreight also, we do see some offset to those impact. One, in the Connected Fitness space, the acquisitions themselves back in February, we talked about a 90 basis point impact to 2015 just from the acquisitions. We see that probably being closer to about 70 basis points or so. The biggest change being the amount of amortization that we were anticipating back in February and the intangibles and the acquisition came in a little bit different as far as value and the useful life's that are a little bit longer. So we had a little bit of benefit in amortization there for Connected Fitness offsetting some of those headwinds we had in FX and airfreight.", "In addition, in our core business, we do see some other opportunities again for some additional savings to help offset some of the other headwinds we talked about earlier. So overall, Connected Fitness acquisition with probably 90 basis point impact for the year is looking more like about 70 basis points now.", "Brad Dickerson", "All right. Thanks, everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to reporting you our second quarter 2015 results which tentatively have been scheduled Thursday, July 23, at 8:30 a.m. Easter Time. Thanks again and goodbye.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation.

I am calling in from Munich Germany where later today we\u2019re opening our newest international office from which we\u2019ll serve the markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is my last stop of a weeklong trip that has taken me to multiple cities including Glasgow, Copenhagen and now Munich. As we continue to grow our global footprint these trips continue to provide deeper insight into the markets and how consumers are thinking about our brand.", "My visit to Copenhagen reconfirmed and enhanced excitement around our recent Endomando acquisition and a huge opportunity that connected fitness provides UA with global consumers. With today\u2019s ribbon cutting in Munich, we will now have 17 regional offices outside the United states which are positioning the brand closer to local consumer and driving incredible execution we have seen in the past year, including 93% international net revenue growth just this past quarter. That strong growth outside the United States help drive total net revenues for the quarter up 29%, the 21st consecutive quarter of 20 plus percent net revenue growth.", "In addition, total apparel net revenues grew by 23%, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of 20 plus percent net revenue growth. We have traditionally referred to this as our scoreboard but based on my visit the St. Andrews earlier this week, maybe we should refer to it as a leader board. Either way, we continue to shoot consistently great numbers. As we prepare to enter our 20th year in the business of sports, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons, some of them have been learned through business, but just as many probably, have been learned through sports.", "Over the past year, three Under Armour athletes have transcended their sports and become known by just their first names, Stephan, Misty and Jordan. These three athletes have combined to teach us one incredibly valuable lesson that we need to think bigger. For Stephan Curry, Misty Copeland and Jordan Speith, being a great basketball player, principal Ballerina and PGA Golfer was rooted in their ability to see beyond to be prepared to not just be great but to be extraordinary, to plan and practice but also know when to take the risk. Our lessons out of this are incredibly relevant to this moment in time for the Under Armour brand.", "First, our athlete success pushes us to see beyond just maximizing the revenue opportunities in any given quarter. It forces us to think clearly about what we need to do better and how we need to organize to be more than just an American sports brand to go from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way athletes live. Second, this intense brand key provides us with abundant opportunities to invest in businesses like basketball, women\u2019s and golf that will not only grow our share within those large categories but will also positively impact all of our business across both categories and geographies. So my two main topics today are how do we invest to capitalize on that momentum and how do we organize to think bigger about the opportunities in front of us today.", "Thinking bigger is part of what drives the world\u2019s greatest athletes to outperform on the highest stage and it\u2019s hard to think of three individuals who have done more of that recently and Stephan, Misty and Jordan. And the best part is it just like UA they too are just getting started.", "Stephan Curry, NBA League MVP World Champion recently voted best male athlete and best NBA player at the ESPYs and most importantly new father of a baby girl who one day might give her big sisters [rallies] and competition for the spotlight, a pretty good stretch for a great young man and tremendously rewarding for Under Armour to be part of his on-court success. We\u2019re taking stepping on a tour of China and other markets in Asia starting late next month and frankly we believe he\u2019s just beginning to touch upon his potential both in the U.S. and other key basketball markets across the globe.", "Misty Copeland trailblazer, Prima Ballerina athlete named last month as the first female African-American principle dancer with the American Ballet Theater, again tremendous pride on our behalf to be involved early in Misty\u2019s meteoric rise by helping introduce her to an audience beyond the ballet world with last year\u2019s I Will What I Want campaign.", "Jordan Speith, when we signed him more than 2.5 years ago we told you to watch out for this young man as we had a strong feeling he was going to turn into a huge asset for our golf business. It\u2019s amazing to all of us that in such a short time his has gone from being one of the names counted as the future of golf to being the story of golf, not just now but we believe well into the future. And while I\u2019d be remised to not at least mention the great performances by other UA athletes this quarter not this year Andy Murray, Carry Price, Brice Harper, Todd Frazier the Cincinnati Reds who last week won the Home Run Derby in front of his home crowd at the great American Ball Park.", "The recent accomplishments of Stephan, Misty and Jordan are somewhat overwhelming and heavily impactful. Their achievements these past few weeks represent a moment in time for the Under Armour brand one that forces us to reassess our opportunities and look deeper to understand what all the success means for us. There is of course the immediate benefit to our brand. This brand heat is driving huge amounts of incremental traffic to our ecommerce platform across the globe with our basketball traffic up more than 300% year-over-year while our social channels we added more followers on Instagram during the recent NBA finals than we did in all of 2014.", "The Curry One Shoe was a great success with our ecommerce site as we continue to gain share in key footwear categories with our wholesale partners. Our women\u2019s business continues to grow strongly in key areas like caprice, shorts, sports bra and running footwear while our ecommerce golf business was exceptional growing about 60% year-over-year. But there is a bigger takeaway for our company and all of this, we've learned from these athletes not only about the preparation it takes the great but the added level of commitment it takes to be truly special. All three of these athletes started as clear underdogs, they were able to put themselves in a position where their skills and focus enable them to transcender sport. All of them have proven as Jordan Spieth stated following his master's victory when asked why he chose Under Armour. That being aggressive, young and fearless can be a deadly combination.", "Our athlete's ability to see what was needed to be excellent forces us to think bigger. It requires we except there are moments in time where we need to accelerate to take advantage of the new opportunities our brand momentum creates. We understand our short-term benefit this unprecedented momentum but we\u2019re focused on the long-term. To us this moment provides a great chance to build a more meaningful connection with our consumer through the power of these transcended athletes. And that connection can be deeper and more powerful for our brand than any short-term spike in our revenues or our earnings. Without question the brand equity we\u2019re creating right now will benefit our business more significantly over the long-term than it will simply just this year.", "Specifically in a large category like basketball we've had incredible success for the Curry One footwear including some very hot selling limited releases. But that brand heat evidenced by the lines outside our brand house stores on release day gives us great confidence in the brand we\u2019re building with Stephen Curry and our strategy in bringing new product to market. It has motivated our footwear team and has given confidence to our retail partners about our expanding presence in the basketball category amongst the others particularly in the mall.", "We recently debuted a new shop-and-shop concept with Champs Sports called the ARMOURY which highlights not only the basketball category but a broader mix of product and innovation that the athletes have been historically unable to find from our brand in the mall. This is great evidence of the confidence we have in our product and the continued success we\u2019re seeing across our offerings with our key retail partners.", "And like basketball that same foundation and confidence is building in our Golf and women's businesses. We\u2019re still developing a wide consumer audience in these three categories here in the U.S. and the opportunity for us in international market is abundant.", "The second element of thinking bigger lies in how we organize our business. And in this case thinking bigger means thinking smaller. Thinking in a way that enables us to be more surgical with how we reach our consumer and the experiences we provide them. To look at our end use consumer more discretely and with more disciplined. As the breadth of our product mix continues to expand we\u2019re moving to a sports category focused organizational structure that will enable us to maintain our focus on the knees of that end use consumer. We recognized that a UA run consumer has different needs than UA basketball consumer. And we\u2019re now in a great position to harness the overall strength of our brand and innovation pipeline to ensure we\u2019re exceeding expectations for all of our consumers.", "To help drive this initiative we\u2019ve recently brought on Terdema Ussery who for the past 18 years has served as President of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and has prior industry experience in athletic footwear and apparel. We can speak to this in more depth at our Investor Day meeting at September but we want to be clear today about our intent. This category focus will provide the structure to help us sell more shirts and shoes. This structure has proven successful for us in Golf with the combination of great product; a great asset and a great team helped us double revenues in the past two years. This increased category will help us drive our core business, a critical component in our long-term growth story.", "The last piece I want to cover today is our evolution from a brand that started by just making compression tees to one now focused on perfecting shirts and shoes as well as creating authentic and relevant sports and fitness experiences every time and everywhere our consumer interacts with our brand. We can do so because of the strength of our Connected Fitness platform, but we continue to add more than 100,000 unique registered users of a platform every single day. We remained in the early stages of incumbent potential of what the world's largest digital health and fitness community with now over 140 million athletes can do to help us build consumer engagement and drive healthier lifestyles.", "We\u2019re growing our community at more than 30% year-over-year and so far in 2015 these users have voluntarily logged over 1 billion workouts and more than 5 billion [foods] have been logged in to our apps. This level and detail of data will empower us to provide actionable insights back to our community that will help them lead a healthier lifestyle and we believe the brand equity that can provide us is immeasurable.", "Ultimately the more people exercise the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy. Again we will provide deeper detail on our Connected Fitness opportunities in September at our Investor Day but we\u2019re extremely pleased with the growth of our community and the type of insight we can bring to our consumers lives.", "So just before I hand it back to Brad I want to reiterate our commitment to grow. We have delivered 21 consecutive quarters of 20 plus percent revenue growth. We are growing in key areas like footwear, women\u2019s and international and doing so while investing in new opportunities like Connected Fitness which we believe will be critical to our continued growth. And most importantly we have a capacity to adapt to change course and accelerate investments when the opportunity calls for it and to think bigger about what the Under Armour brand can eventually be. There is so many great things going on in Under Armour today which are difficult to fully articulate in a one hour conference call.", "I look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in September at our Headquarters in Baltimore to further showcase the brand that we are building. We remain aggressive, young and fearless and I am excited to provide more color on how we're thinking and organizing to become the next great global brand.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Brad.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks Kevin. I would now like spend some time discussing our second quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 29% to 784 million. On a currency neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period.", "Within our product categories we grew apparel net revenues 23% to 515 million compared to 420 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Many of the same growth drivers that drove our first quarter apparel business continued during the second quarter including our new Armour Base Layer, updated training products and expanded golf and hunting lines. Second quarter footwear net revenues increased 40% to 154 million from 110 million in the prior year. We continue to gain significant traction across multiple footwear categories most notably within the larger markets of running and basketball. SpeedForm remains the key growth story for our brand where we introduced this innovation across a wider range of styles and categories this year. And as Kevin mentioned, we capitalized on the incredible success of Stephan Curry in basketball but new color wave quickly selling house during his MVP and championship run with the Warriors.", "Our accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 39% to 83 million from 60 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global direct to consumer net revenues increased 33% for the quarter, representing approximately 32% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged with our recent brand house openings including the first full quarter of results for our Chicago and Mall of America stores as well as the new second quarter openings in Indianapolis and Orlando. From a global standpoint we ended the second quarter with 160 owned stores including the 139 factory house stores and 21 brand house stores.", "Our ecommerce business had a standout quarter and we are seeing the return on our investment in mobile optimization across our expanding list of global sites. While ongoing focus on mobile is key we are also able to drive strong traffic gains through more effective email communications as well as by leveraging the incredible success of our athletes during the period.", "Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 22% to 681 million in the second quarter compared to 558 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter. On a currency neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 23% based primarily on the drivers I highlighted for the overall company. International net revenues increased 93% to 89 million in the second quarter representing 11% of total net revenues. On a currency neutral basis, international net revenues increased to 112% for the period. In the EMEA region, we continue to focus on the three core markets of the UK, Germany and France, while also developing distributor agreements in the region including the Middle East.", "In Asia Pacific, our partner store expansion and ecommerce growth in China remain key stories and we also benefited from the rollout of our distributor agreements in Southeast Asia. And in Latin America we are seeing balanced growth throughout the region following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014.", "Moving on to margins, second quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis point to 48.4% compared to 49.2% in the prior year\u2019s period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter; first, as we previously outlined the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the prior year; second, we incurred higher airfreight expense in the second quarter, primarily due to our efforts to normalize products flow from the West Coast port disruption and better service the back to school selling season which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. Partially offsetting this margin pressure better margins in our factory house business combined with our higher margin Connected Fitness revenues benefited gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the second quarter.", "Selling general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 80 basis points to 44.3% in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.5% in the prior year\u2019s period. As a reminder, starting last quarter in an effort to simplifying and streamline our conversation we consolidated our SG&A detail into two primary buckets, marketing and other SG&A. SG&A details for the second quarter are as follows; marketing cost decreased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period with modest leverage driven primarily by the strong net revenues during the second quarter.", "Our SG&A cost increased 32.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 31.9% in the prior year driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in our Brand House strategy. Operating income for the second quarter decreased 8% to 32 million compared to 35 in the prior year period. Interest and other expense in the second quarter increased to 4 million compared with the 1 million in the prior period primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. Our second quarter tax rate of 46.7% was favorable to the 47.5% rate last year primarily due to certain tax planning strategies.", "Our second quarter net income decreased 17% to 15 million compared to 18 million in the prior year period. Our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.07 from $0.08 in the prior year's period. On the balance sheet total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 43% to 171 million compared with 300 million at June 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 26% to 837 million compared to 662 million at June 30, 2014. Total debt increased to 716 million as compared to 197 million at June 30, 2014 primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was 91 million for the second quarter compared to 29 million in the prior year's period driven primarily our investments in our SAP platform and our global retail strategy.", "Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately 3.84 billion representing growth of 25% and 2015 operating income in the range of 405 million to 408 million, representing growth of 14% to 15%. We have long stated that we would be opportunistic with our investment levels if and when the right situations present themselves. In a period where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global stage we believe we have a unique opportunity to position ourselves more aggressively in key long-term growth categories such as basketball and golf which we believe can create brand hallows across the Under Armour portfolio. As a result we expect to spend more than originally planned in marketing throughout the remainder of the year and this is the primary reason we\u2019re raising our full year net revenues guidance while maintaining the upper end of our previous operating income guidance. We believe this will better position our brand in delivering long-term sustainable growth.", "As a reminder our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of one-time transaction cost in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and non-cash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. Below operating results we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which continues to negatively impact our international profitability.", "Now I would also like to provide some additional color on several items, starting with revenues. We expect the growth rate in footwear to continue outpacing the growth rates for the overall business during the second half of the year. International growth is expected to ease from the growth rate achieved in the first half of 2015 as we begin the cycle for our entry into Latin America as well as new distributor partnerships launched during the second half of 2014. From a cadence standpoint we expect relatively consistent net revenue growth rates during the third quarter and fourth quarters.", "Now looking at growth margins. We continue to expect our full year growth margin to be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. During the third quarter we continue to expect an approximate 50 basis points contraction primarily due to the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In SG&A we expect the combined impact of higher planned marketing spend I previously discussed and ongoing other SG&A expense pressure will result in similar year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter as experienced during the first half of the year.", "Finally a quick look at our planned capital expenditures. We continue to plan 2015 capital expenditures in the range of 330 million to 340 million; consistent with our prior guidance approximately 140 million of this total is allocated across three large areas to support long-term growth including our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and a new and expanded SAP platform. We've also accelerated our investments in key areas that will drive revenue growth and putting the rollouts of our global retail strategy and new ecommerce sites.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Erinn Murphy", "I guess I was curious if you could talk a little bit more Kevin about the Connected Fitness fees. In the ware book space broadly just continues to expand whether it's Fitbit or whether it's Nike you guys already have the largest platform globally. And how do you think about it maintaining that leadership position, driving engagement. And then what are those key metrics that you are focused on, is it unique user, is it a log out, or logged workout just how to think about kind of how you are thinking about this bigger picture?", "Kevin Plank", "So, first of all we see this as a just a massive wide space and for me personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt or more importantly a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes uniforms or equipment, that in the past it always just been a short sleeve cotton t-shirt or long sleeve -- or a long sleeve cotton t-shirt depending on the weather. And it just felt like how come no one has done this before and for me personally is when we look at this opportunity to begin with it felt as if there's massive wide space in that no one -- no one in the world is measuring sort of an athlete's performance.", "And you start to see these things coming around whether its wearables and biometric measurement session we dabbled in that all the way back to 2008. But we quickly came to realize the value for us was not going to be in -- I think the equipment side of it but the value for us is going to be in the community. And we feel like we've really locked that up. The fact that consumers had no barometer for their health today is a mistake and it frankly that's where we see this massive opportunity. We feel that we're the best ones to take advantage of it, really because the acquisitions that we've made in the last two years. The sheer size and scale of the community that we've made, it marks us as the clear leader by a factor of as much as four, three or at least two times, now having more than 140 million unique registered users.", "As I mentioned in my script, adding more than a 100,000 users are downloading one of our four apps today. MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal or Under Armour Record.", "And again from the stats of our [red] office, well I want to drive them home, so I think it's incredible. We logged more than 1 billion workouts for log into one of our four apps over the last -- just since beginning of the year. When the 5 billion different foods have been logged as well. In giving scale MyFitnessPal which is the largest of the four apps that we have and as we continue to merge them, that voice will continue to come out as we articulated, but this is the world's largest database in the history of mankind of food.", "I mean just think about it for a second that we logged more than 5 billion foods that we know in over 80 countries, what people are eating and what they're putting in their body. So we now believe we got the ability to be relevant across all of our platforms and we're going to work and merge them in the consistent products that read to the daily dashboard, I mean ultimately that's where we are heading.", "We think that the consumer needs the dashboard which just says how am I doing. If I can look on my cell phone and I can figure out my bank balance, my stock price, so the weather in the given city, the fact that I've no measure of [biometric] for my health except we're going to see a doctor, it'll be 12 months to 18 months or 24 months we think is really a crime. So, we are identifying that issue for key plays that the consumers should be measuring themselves, the app really to measure themselves.", "Sleep, how much did I sleep last night, fitness, did I exercise or not and if so to what degree, daily activity which is typically like the steps, like how much am I moving around and then fourth and probably most importantly what am I putting in my body, my nutrition. And we've thought a lot about this and I think one thing I really want to get across is sort of the way that we're thinking about to finding success. And we do believe that there needs to be a daily dashboard and so we'll -- you'll continue to see that articulate itself through the Under Armour Record platform and we got few -- many things coming for that, particularly we'll showcase for you at Investor Day, but if you ask us to sum it up, we are looking for an engaged user community that relies on Under Armour and the Connected Fitness eco-system we are building to help them measure these four central areas of sleep, fitness, daily activity and nutrition.", "And more importantly we want to empower people, this isn't just about knowing that I took 8,000 steps yesterday but because I took 8,000 steps how did that make me feel. And more importantly how did that work with how I slept or what I exercise or what I ate that next day. And we think that having that information is going to allow them to make better decisions to live healthier and enriched life, I mean affecting I think ultimately obviously fitness the way that work but we think there is the outlook for us to affect global health and that gets us so excited.", "And by doing this of course, we believe that Real Time is a company that focuses on selling shirts and shoes, we believe that we're going to create engagement with consumer to give them a reason to interact with our brand multiple times and I think all those things lead to this energy that you're feeling from us and frankly the resources that we've expanded over last couple of years position ourselves I think really uniquely and unlike any other brand, especially in our space but frankly anyone who's looking at biometric measurement for the athlete or for any end consumer.", "So, as I said this is going to be a big part of our focus that we'll have at our Investor Day in September and I encourage you to come and see we have coming on but incredibly exciting for us and I think there is a lot more to come.", "Erinn Murphy", "And then I guess just my second question would just be, we head into the back to school season here domestically. Could you just talk about how your guys are feeling broadly about the environment and then I think last year, one of your major retailers received product later and this season so just help us think about if there's any kind of key nuances in the order pattern flow this season as we lap that?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I can take that Erinn, definitely we're focused on delivering back to school in a much better fashion, I think we're doing that in a better fashion this year, I think still not quite at the level that we'd like but definitely incrementally better than last year. So I think we should look much better on the retail floor in a more timely fashion for back to school this year. So we're looking -- we're thinking pretty well about that. As we get into back half of the year also, just to remember also in our guidance, kind of consistent with how we look at things in the past years too, especially when you look at fourth quarter in our guidance we\u2019ve been consistent I think in the last couple of years talking about being very prudent in how we forecast the fourth quarter relative to weather and holiday and so forth and not taking things for granted there in our guidance. So, I\u2019d say those are the two things in the back half of the year revenue guidance a better flow in back to school and also consistent of how we\u2019re approaching the fourth quarter revenue guidance.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.", "Camilo Lyon", "Kevin or Brad you guys talked about spending more on marketing here in the third quarter capitalizing on the success of your athletes and rightly, so. How do you guys think about balancing being in stocking these categories with the increased level of advertising? Are you planning on to begin production using more airfreights to get product to stores? How do you balance that supply demand equation?", "Brad Dickerson", "This is really much more about beyond 2015 than it really is about the back half of 2015 from a revenue and product perspective. Taking advantage of the opportunity that\u2019s in front of us from a brand perspective is really what we\u2019re talking about here. So, the ability for us to invest in our stories here tell our stories take advantage of the unique environment we\u2019re in and say that we\u2019re going to drive much, much more top line in the back half of the year because of that I think there is no doubt that we\u2019ll see some benefit and we expect to see some benefit and that\u2019s kind of including our guidance. But the real story here is about beyond 2015, it\u2019s about 2016 and beyond of what this does especially in key categories again like basketball and golf. And if you just think about basketball for a second and you take Stephan Curry and the ability for us to tell a story in a category that is influential not only in the basketball category but just the younger consumer and what that can mean for our youth business in 2016, '17 and beyond that\u2019s what we\u2019re really talking about here is just the longer opportunity versus the shorter term opportunity.", "Camilo Lyon", "And then following up on that on the basketball commentary and Steph Curry\u2019s success clearly the shoes have been a runway success selling out in pretty much every color where that you come out with. I think you have spoken in the past about wanting to get the footwear right the category right before fully expanding in the mall with the biggest basketball malls based retailer. Do you feel that you\u2019re now at that point you can start to really get all of those doors penetrated and if you could remind us where you\u2019re at from that penetration perspective and what the opportunity is?", "Kevin Plank", "Camilo let me take this an opportunity to just talk about our footwear a little bit, and without question the performance of Stephan and really breaking through I mean he\u2019s since we signed Steph three years ago he\u2019s always an underdog but he\u2019s always the best everywhere he went and so getting credit for that is something we\u2019re really proud of in doing whether it was as first of all most important thing to him was winning the championship but then the league MVP and then his acknowledgement at the ESPYs where I think among all athletes he\u2019s broken through and that\u2019s a really difficult thing to do particularly in the sport like basketball. And so we\u2019re proud of what that means but it\u2019s not a one way ticket to all the sudden you\u2019ve arrived but there is a lot of work for us to be done and there is a lot more one thing I learned a long time ago when I mean with the first time an Under Armour logo popped up on the front cover of a US Today\u2019s sports page and I thought I was walking the office and the place to be flooded with orders it\u2019s just not the way it goes.", "And so brands are built on consistency, consistency is built in trust and trust is built in drops and is lost in buckets. And so what you see is we had a great big pouring I think of credibility in the sport of basketball and which Steph brings us on a day to day basis but that\u2019s going to require a lot more investment and it\u2019s going to require a long-term commitment. And so we want to let everybody know particularly our consumer but frankly our competition as well that we are moving in the basketball we\u2019ve been working on this for it\u2019s not an overnight success we\u2019re working on this for years if not decade and we\u2019re incredibly proud of where we\u2019ve gotten to but we\u2019re really just getting started.", "So as far as basketball the category goes we\u2019ve been working we\u2019ve had great support from our sporting goods partners first and primarily where I think we really have that kid who is buying product to play at the high school level and we\u2019ve had -- we've been working on with the right assortments there and really getting behind footwear for us as an initiative taking in basketball and then in the mall channel whether it\u2019s finish line or Foot Locker and I described what we\u2019re doing with the Champ Sports through Foot Locker with the ARMOURY series, it\u2019s going to be a really need opportunity for us I think to change the way that consumers is looking at the brand and the way that they see us is that breaking through and having people see the basketball brand again it\u2019s just taken lot of time and the chance for us to I think really differentiate ourselves in the brand and maybe people have seen this as to the brand that we see ourselves the brand we're going to be. So Steph's a big part of that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Krasik of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Scott Krasik", "Just first, can you give a rough mix of your international sales by region EMEA, Asia, South America, Brad? And then outside of partner stores what\u2019s the strategy at this point I know opening owned retail.", "Brad Dickerson", "Sure, on the mix of international roughly at this point in time you are going to look at EMEA being about half of the international business and then the other half broken out fairly evenly between Asia Pacific countries and Latin America for the most part.", "Scott Krasik", "And in owned retail?", "Brad Dickerson", "Owned retail by region?", "Scott Krasik", "Yes, going forward.", "Brad Dickerson", "I think Kevin to take this one too, but owned retail right now for us outside of North America a large majority of the owned retail for us is going to be in China and Latin America, in Europe we really don't have too much owned retail yet but we\u2019re starting to get going in there in the next year or two, but you are looking at mainly Latin America and China with owned retail.", "Kevin Plank", "Let me use this opportunity to just talk to you about international for a second. Let me a take a minute to do that. Our footwear get away so somebody asked another question about that we can circle back on footwear. But international as I'm sitting here in Munich opening this new office and cutting a ribbon this afternoon first of all what Charlie has done for international business in really helping us accelerate and think about ourselves as a global brand but more importantly beginning to act like a global brand, we\u2019re fast in the way of doing that, this will be our 17th office that we've opened up I think our fifth or sixth this year, in a way that relates to our brand incredibly authentic. And if you are here it basically it feels like Baltimore and Munich is beginning of course with setting the esthetic the way the place looks but the team, the people, the energy just incredibly, incredibly proud.", "And you are seeing that at retail too. We went and watched stores we saw three of the largest sport stores and retailers that are here in Germany and throughout Europe over the last couple of days and the excitement we have when we talk to these organizations and I believe that they have that Under Armour can penetrate where we\u2019re very, very -- we\u2019re very young and we\u2019re just getting started here, while we've been doing business in selling stuff probably for the last eight years, or nine years or close to 10 years now we\u2019re really beginning to do business, and I think it's reflective obviously in our revenues.", "I mean 93% revenue growth in the second quarter alone, 83% revenue growth internationally year-to-date, 94% growth in 2014, so that idea of coming close to doubling and the plans we talk about is growing by about 50% a year in international and it's something I think that we get really excited that is incredibly realistic to happen.", "A number of things that we have from product standpoint, we remained positioned really in the premium way the way the consumer sees us and so I think that\u2019s way the retails want us as well. We\u2019re a full price brand basically everywhere we do business and that\u2019s no different abroad. We have learned a lot of about how our brand translates through Japan and learning that Under Armour moves outside of North America and we\u2019re just seeing that reinforced especially here in Europe. And we\u2019re doing a lot of that around the strategic accounts in core markets with premium shop-and-shop investments that we can have and that\u2019s been a real positive for us with the right market retailers.", "From a retail standpoint as well, we've opened 18 Brand House stores in the second quarter in places like Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and we\u2019re targeting more than 100 additional global Brand House stores opening in 2015 build off of a base of 73 in 2014, three quarters of which we\u2019ll be located in Asia 85% of those that will be doors that will be leveraging distributor partners that we\u2019ll be opening those up and just from perspective the majority of those stores are obviously I guess going to be in China, I guess that will be obvious. But just for some perspective in the month of September alone we\u2019re going to be opening roughly one store per day in the month of September. So it's going to be a big month for us and it's something we've been prospecting for the last five years and six years they are nearly globally with Susie McCabe and Henry and our retail team really becoming expert in how to open and translate our store have a consistent message for the brand everywhere we show up.", "So not to be lost in all the physical manifestation of the brand that we're putting in retail is I think some of the success that we\u2019re seeing e-commerce. In the second quarter alone we launched new sites in Thailand, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and I think we've also been working on translating our sites as well and making sure they are open. The new markets continues to be a real big opportunity for us. One thing I don't want to get lost the message is it's not all roses either, going globally is not an easy thing, it's a slug, it\u2019s an investment, and it's something we\u2019re continue to get better.", "So while we\u2019re pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing. We still see that there is a tremendous amount of meat left on the bone with the opportunity for us to improve is that our fulfillment rates are not where they need to be, the wholesale partners have been incredibly patient with us as we get this settled and organized but things like Brad mentioned with our new SAP upgrades and implementations they are make a big difference with systems and processes and this is part of the shift to becoming a global brand.", "So across the world EMEA as I mentioned having spent the last couple of days here in Europe a lot of excitement lot of energy of course driven in part by our sports marketing assets the success we've seen there but I think really it's the teams in the ground and it's the energy and it's the culture of the brand that it's really leading the way. Asia lot of incredibly exciting things happening there, Japan continues to be a stall workforce and leading but as I mentioned things like China where all the stores we're opening up and what we\u2019re doing in September we\u2019re going to drive a lot of energy from the Stephen Curry store that we would be taking in through for about seven days over there between Japan and obviously three stops in China and then a few other stops as well. So it will be very exciting and then Latin America, I think energy is still building around Brazil, especially with the Olympics coming back and things we have there, we opened our first Brand House in Sao Paulo, in the Morumbi Shopping Mall and that's doing very, very well.", "And really every place that we've opened stores, I think we're outperforming. So we haven't seen any surprises to the downside is tremendous amount of heat and energy to the brand, I'm living and feeling that today, and excited for about 350 to 400 of our closest friends and media partners are going to come over and help us cut a ribbon this afternoon, so a lot of energy that Under Armour being here in Germany and really every place we're opening offices and stores around the world. So it's a good story, it's good news, but as I said there's still room for us to improve and you'll see us viciously go after that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Omar Saad", "Two questions, first one on the sports category alignment, Kevin that you mentioned. Could you talk about the different -- the way you're going to reorganize the company's work structure, what are the different keys or categories you're going to be focused on, and is it going to be kind of soup to nuts, designer, design team for each of the sports, with P&L responsibility, managers reaching the sports category, even down the innovation levels, will that be sports specific marketing et cetera, help us understand to how that's going to channel -- the organizational structure is going to be change? And then I got one more follow-up?", "Kevin Plank", "Great question Omar, one we're anticipating. So we've been talking about this for years, we've tried implementing it for years and then we sort of got to this point where it's hard, it's not easy to change things as that we are -- we've not been end-use driven in the past, we're basically -- we've got an apparel team, we've a footwear team, we've an accessory team and we think that obviously has worked to getting us started but we're at the point where we're reaching the size and [thank you] to scale to be able to afford and more importantly not be able to not afford to go after really addressing category management.", "And the thing we use was the sport of golf which really got us excited, several years ago where we implemented this. And we identified a leader and they really took the bull by the horns and started with products in organizing everything from the way we showed up in our sporting goods and our wholesale partners, the way we showed up in the Green grass golf course and also given the same control over to how we're going to spend the marketing dollars and that means in addition the way we've showed up the things like POP and marketing all the way to the assets, that we signed. So it was a great story that led us to getting us during the speed. The thing for all of this and as we are going to think about category management it's going to come down to leadership and but what we wanted was accountability and where golf started is that -- I have never looked after a golf tournament several years ago, sitting there on Sunday and I'm watching and not feeling great about the way that one of our golfers was outfitted and I write an email and say this isn't working well and I think I had 18 people cc it on the email. And saying this is ridiculous, we should get this to much more consistent manner, where we can flow the information in a better way, that'll be more effective and ultimately is going to better serve the end use consumer and the athlete.", "So, I use that theme of thinking bigger and that's where us hiring Terdema Ussery who's going to join us and has great experience in this industry, someone who knows everyone, who's got a five-star resume of leadership and success and frankly a really great person, I think that just as importantly as anything is his expertise and his march is the culture fit that he's going to be at Under Armour.", "So, there's a lot to happen there but I think we have to almost force the issue, and while we've been working through these pieces, we're going to give you a lot more color at Investor Day as well, that'll tell you a little more specific how we're thinking about it, but alternatively the idea is we're not going to just pull the plug and eliminate our apparel and our footwear groups, there is going to be a bit of transition there, the first way we're to start though is identifying the category leadership, across it's roughly nine different categories that we have right now, that we've identified, where we want a true general manager, to run each of these that will have both in some instances clear P&L responsibility and other instances a bit of a virtual P&L responsibility, but the most important thing is when to create accountability across each of these divisions where hopefully it'll drive and prevent us from things that maybe perceived as in-authentic and making sure that we preserve the Under Armour lead.", "But again I use that example of golf, in just a sport of golf in the last two years our revenues have more than doubled. We're seeing key category growth throughout the rest of the year -- things like on our Web site, it's a -- our playoff polos a number one item at our Brand House and our ecommerce site, the business is basically up everywhere, where we have our key assets which is the one thing which led us the ability to find the right asset with Jordan, that we're leading the way out there it's been absolute killing home run for us too. And it also allows us to launch a new categories like we'll have authentic golf shoe coming out, you're seeing Jordan wearing our golf club out there on the course, so all these things, from the right assets, from the right marketing, from the right positioning, being in a right retail distribution, it has already led us to get this.", "So, we're excited, what we see in the success in golf is something we hopefully see a strategy through and things like that football and running and really the obvious category that you'd imagine we'd be looking for sport and you're seeing global football of course things like that. So, we want to win, we think that the opportunity for us to do that is it's not the sign, but everybody else is done and carve a bit of our own life but still at the same time there is lot of good lessons to learn from other people that have done this before too. So I think we\u2019re taking the best of all worlds and we\u2019re going to do what's best for the Under Armour brand.", "Omar Saad", "And then a quick question on the ARMOURY concept, having been doing by seeing cover pictures, is it more of a shop-and-shop or almost just like a store standalone store. Can you help us understand the dynamics there what it is and obviously there is I think 400 and plus Champs locations throughout the country. How you\u2019re thinking about the rollout of it at least what the plans are at this point in time?", "Kevin Plank", "I think we\u2019ve been highly successful in sporting goods the mall is being different I think Champs is a great -- it\u2019s a bit of a step from sporting goods into the mall. And because they play that bit of a twin role but Champs and Foot Locker as a whole has been an amazing partner for us and something I think where we can translate our existing consumer. It helps get them to use to thinking about us in a mall environment. We still see ourselves as a holistic head to toe brand and our philosophy remains that we\u2019re going to go where our consumers want in fact where they expect us. And so we\u2019re looking forward is further ways where we can build relationships with our wholesale partners to elevate the product story of the best Under Armour we\u2019re only and roughly 25% of the 3,400 global footing stores today. But obviously we\u2019re working with their team and align with that.", "The ARMOURY and Champ is a great example of how we can grow our business in the relationship together. We\u2019re testing a handful of these premium shop-and-shops over the next couple of years starting our own backyard in Maryland. And the early reads that we\u2019ve seen in this thing the first several weeks that are very, very encouraging. The merchandizing is going to consider for the mixture of in line product the mall specific product in addition to some products not found elsewhere in the mall too. Things like that we\u2019re putting our highlight fleets into the mall channel, into the ARMOURY and it\u2019s giving just as a deeper breadth of sort of the Under Armour experience in a mall environment. So, I mean I think it\u2019s exciting I encourage you to get a chance and we can put on listing in time and let you know where we got some of those, go see one for yourself as well.", "Tom Shaw", "Operator we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question will come from Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Randy Konik", "So I guess Kevin just wanted to kind of go back to international there that you're in Germany. So as you go along this journey of globalizing the business and the brand what if you kind of taken away over the last few years that's changed about I guess the perception of the brand from an international standpoint. How do you think you have to market differently or the same from the United States market or kind of just curious you talked about the brand evolution what do you think needs to kind of change there from an international standpoint?", "Kevin Plank", "Well, I think we\u2019ve been doing it. It\u2019s always like the 1998 the first time that we went outside the United States and that was in Japan the first partnership deal that I signed was with the NFL Europe League. So we\u2019re no stranger to international business it\u2019s becoming good at it more importantly I think in a lot of places, particularly here in Europe continuity is an incredibly important lesson and attribute of any brand consistency is very-very important doing things the same way I mean it\u2019s a continent that\u2019s a sign by history. And brands have sort of come in live today and are gone tomorrow I think everyone seen a lot of that. So a lot of it\u2019s a bit of questioning the waiting you out and wondering are you going to make it, are you going to be there.", "And what we\u2019ve seen is the brand it\u2019s taken a while it doesn\u2019t happen on the first handshake it doesn\u2019t happen on the first introduction. And we came over to Europe for the first time back at the end of 2005 and in 2006 and it was a -- it's been slog we weren\u2019t really understanding completely what we had going on at the same time we\u2019re also organizing ourselves in North America. The thing we think about with Brad and my job is and our entire executive teams' job is again the timing and deciding how to deploy the resources the time people and money. And there is only so much of any one of them. And we\u2019re torn with the fact that it\u2019s always international such a small part of our business. And so U.S. and North America would usually dominate the amount of time we spend.", "So as we\u2019ve grown you seen us going all the way back to 2009 and 2010 I think we filled a lot of questions so why are you pouring this money into Europe, why are you pouring this money and where is the return is going to come. And so we have this long story of long-term investments in things like women\u2019s long-term investments in things like footwear, long-term investments in something like international. And this year and we said it and it\u2019s big enough comment but we\u2019re going to be profitable in Europe this year. And that was something if you went back five years you may have filled the question on why not throwing the towel, can you really be successful there why not just focus on North America.", "So we\u2019re now looking at, a) our profitability and it\u2019s been one asset at the time and it\u2019s been things from joining the EPL football with people in places like Tottenham Hotspur and then finding ways to make investments the recent announcement we had with Sao Paulo Football Club down in Brazil it\u2019s not an immediate return for us. I\u2019ve always said I don\u2019t really see us as a licensed jersey manufacturer I don\u2019t like that idea of growing sport by simply selling fan gear, we want to be on the authentic athlete we want to be on the pitch on the court on the field. But there is ways for us to get in and so finding the resource that we can spin off to make an investment in the market is very new for us like Brazil, its\u2019 a big deal. And so we\u2019re -- I think we\u2019re very patiently doing that around the globe where we\u2019re finding assets that make sense and especially we can reinforce at markets that we can create an ROI that\u2019s sooner than later.", "So it's a big running something global and we said that a long time but really understanding what it means to be a global company that takes time, but it takes experience and it takes maturity and it takes patience and things that maybe you would characterize this is not having in the first few years as a company, but I think that we've been developing that skill set and most importantly that we've been developing that leadership team. So Terdema is a great example of that coming on board and I think you're seeing and feel about throughout our company and something that will only continue to get bigger and better for us the brand.", "So we\u2019re learning a lot of lessons. As I said their mistakes believe me but when it come through I think the performance of the 90 plus percent revenue growth that we saw this quarter and is reflective of I think what you are seeing happening. One thing I can tell you is there is the tremendous pull, tremendous demand for the brand right now with the matter of our execution and there is a lot of places we can improve we can enhance we can get better as I called out supply chains specifically is that it's difficult digging out how to move product that duty conscious and being careful and being able to make money and not getting brushed on margin and learning how to manufacture locally.", "And so we've been learning all these lessons, the good news is this is the something we've been doing for last three months or six months and this is something we've been doing for really the last six years to 10 years. So we\u2019re certainly not going to be access right now but we feel great about our trajectory, we feel great about our team, we remain humble and hungry and we got a shot, the mission here is to be the next great global brand and you\u2019re going to see us bite, crawl and scratch and do everything we can to make that happen. We will keep running hard for you, that\u2019s for sure.", "Randy Konik", "Can I just ask one more question then? As it relates to the Connected Fitness, in terms of the long-term vision is it something where over time you say we have these 100 plus million users and we can see that person A runs consistent at 5 in the morning to 10 miles a day and person B runs or doesn't run what have you over time you can tailor your marketing, customize marketing to these people whether it be your footwear or apparel what have you. How do you kind of think about the leveraging this data base from A from a marketing standpoint to further drive more connectedness towards the brand but also towards specific categories to help accelerate those?", "Kevin Plank", "When we first did the, I don't think I answered that when I did my Connected Fitness either sort of the way that we\u2019re thinking about measurement of growth and things like that. When we made the announcement we called Digital Day few days past following our 2014 earnings call we told that there were 120 million people roughly on the platform and there was about a month or so later I was on I did talking head show and we said 130 million and now today we\u2019re telling it's over 140 million people. We would be careful to sort of quantifying these things in terms of number of users we have.", "Our next job is really figuring out how to make them good quality users as well. I take 40 million hyper engaged people that really we\u2019re getting benefiting from the brand using our apps and our ecosystem using that as a learning place that we could grow that out to a broader audience. At the same time the scale that we\u2019re growing is nothing we want to ignore but we think the definition of success is not just the total top-line number of users, however we\u2019re growing north of 30% and seeing that consistently happen that is going to be something as positive. But what I think you'll see from us and again we\u2019re going to go deeper on our own Investor Day into what the story of Connected Fitness means for the Under Armour brand is that there is a high level of engagement that we\u2019re going to be able to drive with that.", "And without doubt our gear tracker side alone which is something it's exclusive to the MapMyFitness platform there is more than 400,000 people that are actively tracking products and whether it's a pair of shoes they wear or whatever item that they use. I think it's close to 2,000 people a day are signing up for gear tracker. So people are interested in this idea the Internet of Things that, that theory being that eventually everything that we have is going to have a chip in it. So a billion connected things in 2010 and I think the projection is by 2020 it's going to be over 25 billion or 30 billion connected things in the world.", "So we obviously want to use that to make ourselves smart and honestly to help enrich and improve the life of our consumers. So we think we now have the ability to do that we think getting smart in everything we do. Again the thing I'm probably most proud of with these acquisitions of course the team we built but also I think the level of engagement that we\u2019re creating with the consumer of giving them a reason to think about themselves holistically, this idea of approaching help and arming people with the ability to make better decisions for themselves is a pretty powerful thing that I think who is going to own that information or who is going to help to give you that and organize that information for you should it be healthcare provider, should it be a drug store, should it be a health insurance company or should it be a sports brand that you trust.", "So we think we have a great connection with the athlete we think that we can test and prototype this at the highest levels with people like universe noted in football team and if it's good enough for them we think it's and some of our other marquee athletes should be good enough for the consumers. So building that trust is going to be paramount and doing this and yes we think we\u2019re going to be able to sell more shirts and shoes ultimately but we think we\u2019re going to be able to continue to transform what the Under Armour brand is and continuously enable to do that. ", "Tom Shaw", "And we have a few closing comments from Kevin.", "Kevin Plank", "With that, I think we've talked a lot today, I wish it could have gone a little deeper in the footwear but regardless, I think we remain very excited about the assets that we have today, the team that we've assembled and that begins of course with the internal leadership team that we have. I think the consumer base that we're growing and then of course the assets that we have at our athletes table. So, we're very proud of what Jordan what Steph, what Misty, what frankly all of our athletes have done and the best of all that we do believe they're all just getting started just as the Under Armour brand. So, with that I want to greet you all a good morning and have a wonderful day. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas D. Shaw", "Great. Thanks and good morning to everyone joining us in today's third quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially.", "These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "In addition, as required by Regulation G, we need to make sure you are aware that during the call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial information, specifically currency neutral net revenue growth. We provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information in our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our Web-site at uabiz.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Kevin Plank, Chairman and CEO; followed by Brad Dickerson, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO, who will discuss the Company's financial performance for the third quarter, provide an update to our 2015 outlook and introduce our preliminary 2016 outlook. After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Brad will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9.30 AM. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our Web-site at approximately 11.00 AM Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. In three weeks, Under Armour will be celebrating our 10 year anniversary as a public company. Back in 2005, we were a $281 million company. Compression apparel made up two-thirds of our business. The phrase 'connected fitness' had not yet been coined. The day when we would feature a ballerina in a commercial seemed unlikely. And Jordan Spieth had only just begun his journey to greatness by taking golf lessons at Brook Hollow Golf Club in Dallas at the tender age of 12 from Pro Cameron McCormick.", "What I knew back then and still believe today is that anything is possible because of the ever-evolving power of sports. In just the last few months I've seen first-hand the value to advertisers who understand that sports is the only thing left that viewers insist on watching live, like the emotion of 80,000 fans stilling Twickenham Stadium including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and His Royal Highness Prince Harry of Wales on a fall Saturday in London to watch England take on Wales in the Rugby World Cup, while 4,000 miles away another 80,000 were watching Notre Dame Football in South Bend. More than 10,000 fans lining up in Manila to get a glimpse of the NBA's most valuable player, Stephen Curry.", "The power of sports and its ability to transcend generations, technologies and trends is what makes other industries envious of the business that we are in. The power of sports is the engine that has fuelled our growth from day one and the reason for our confidence in the future. It is the foundation behind our doing business in just four countries in 2005 to now more than 60 today; growing our retail footprint from a single UA Web-site and four domestic factory house outlet stores in 2005 to now 24 global e-commerce sites and more than 300 UA owned retail destinations and partner-doors around the world; building our team from around 600 employees in 2005 to more than 11,000 today; going from not producing a single shoe in 2005 to approximately 30 million pairs in 2015; recording 22 consecutive quarters of 20 plus percent revenue growth and 24 straight quarters of 20 plus percent revenue growth in our largest category, apparel; achieving our first billion-dollar revenue quarter; saying confidently we're going to double our revenues to $7.5 billion by 2018; and our stock price appreciating more than 2800% from our IPO price compared to roughly 60% for the S&P 500.", "It has been a great 10 years of public company and we have learned a lot during this time, but our focus remains the same and that is unlocking the equity we have created to continue to build the world's most important sports and fitness brand. To do that, we will continue to invest, we will do so in a prudent way that has driven our results over these past 10 years. At our Investor Day here in Baltimore last month, we spoke to the diversity of these investments. We are focused on three key areas where we are confident the return on investment will be increasingly evident as our business continues to grow globally.", "The first area is our core business including sports marketing assets, brand marketing, supply chain and investing in inventory to help us meet the unparalleled demand for the Under Armour brand. The second area is our growth drivers like international where we grew the business 69% year-to-date, and footwear where we posted a third quarter growth rate of 61% and continue to invest in world-class talent. And finally are the new opportunities like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness that may not meaningfully impact our top line results in the short-term but will bring a new dimension to our model and create new competencies within our organization in the years to come.", "Starting with our core business, we continue to find assets that are a fit with our brand, the most recent example being two weeks ago, we announced a new long-term partnership with the University of Wisconsin. It takes one trip to Madison, Wisconsin on a football Saturday to understand the value of college assets and the marketing landscape where more than 80,000 people show up to cheer on the team wearing our brand, where one's loyalty is literally worn on their sleeve.", "Take for example two historic rivals finding common ground through their outfitter and donning the same base-layer T-shirt for a football game, as our two partners Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy did just two weeks ago in the name of respect for one another. We are not just clothing athletes, we are telling stories. We are tapping in the emotion that is tied to the power of sport and we are giving them an authentic way to display their passion.", "We also talked at our Investor Day about our ongoing work with SAP. The vision here is a single-user database that combines the traditional consumer purchasing habit information with Under Armour's additional insights gained through our Connected Fitness platform. This work can be categorized into two main areas, architecting the future to create a business platform that will scale our organization and sustain our global growth and developing the consumer insight engine that will use data to drive this business to $7.5 billion and beyond. Our increased insight into the consumer will empower us with better information to make better business decisions, to build better products while helping athletes make better choices in their own personal health and fitness, and ultimately enriching their lives.", "Second big area of investment is in our growth drivers. They are the same five that we talked about since our IPO, men's apparel, women's apparel, footwear, international and direct to consumer, and our strategy which also remains the same today is simply to make women's larger than men's, to make footwear larger than apparel as a whole, then sell that product country by country around the globe, and where we don't find appropriate retail distribution, augment that with our own direct to consumer e-commerce and retail channels. And the one thing we will never forget to do and is written on the whiteboards in my office is, don't forget to sell shirts and shoes.", "So let's start talking about footwear. The momentum that you see and read about around our footwear business is a result of the investments we've made starting back even before our IPO, but as we often say around here, we are just getting started. To give some perspective, we will produce 30 million pairs of shoes this year, compared to our competition that produces around half a billion pairs each year. This demonstrates the miles of runway in front of us for growth in this one category alone.", "We already have seen a return on investments in footwear through the 90% plus sell-throughs for the Curry's signature footwear line. We are incredibly excited for the Curry 2 which becomes globally available at retail this Saturday and was first unveiled by Stephen Curry during the roadshow tour of Asia last month. To support this launch, Stephen and Jamie Foxx have teamed up once again in a new digital campaign titled 'Flash', which is created by award-winning agency Droga5 and is available now for viewing across all our social platforms.", "Additional returns have come from the SpeedForm platform, more than tripling in revenue year-to-date, our highlight Football Cleats earning the number one spot in the marketplace for the third straight year, and new breakthrough innovations like the Fat Tire shoe which launched in May continues to disrupt the market and earn high praise including Gear of the Show at the 2015 Winter Outdoor Retailer trade show.", "Looking ahead to 2016, we plan to leverage our relationship with Jordan Spieth, the recently crowned PGA Tour Player of the Year, by introducing our golf footwear brand, much like we did with our basketball footwear brand through NBA MVP, Stephen Curry. You also will see a much deeper concerted effort to put resources in the women's footwear as we brought in a depth of talent to help support this growing area of our business.", "As I said earlier, the third area of investment for us to unlock the power of sports in new parts of our business like local manufacturing, sportswear and connected fitness, we unveiled our plans for Project Glory, our local for local manufacturing at Investor Day, but let me refresh you on how this investment will change the game for us and for the world.", "State-of-the-art footwear and apparel manufacturing facilities haven't modernized like other industries, with end to end upwards of 150 people being needed to build a single product like a shoe. We know there's a better way and through our SpeedForm footwear platform and the innovative manufacturing approach that we took there, we've been able to reduce the number of human touches up to 30% and we believe there is plenty of runway left. So we see an opportunity to innovate the process, increasing our speed to market by introducing local for local manufacturing that will produce better product globally, product as great as our brand in the most efficient way possible.", "In 2016, we'll open our physical space for Project Glory which we will call our Lighthouse. The Lighthouse will be an advanced manufacturing innovation hub located right here in Baltimore. It will commercialize new enabling technologies and processes that will first be integrated into our existing supply-chain by our current partners before ultimately being rolled out by those same partners in new facilities around the world, changing the dynamics of speed to market, pricing, costing and labor, made in the U.S. for the U.S. market, made in Brazil for the Brazilian market, and so on. Being an innovative company means not only bringing innovation into everything we make but also into how we create better product more efficiently.", "Also at Investor Day we revealed our plans for a new category for Under Armour, sportswear. We will answer the call from our consumer for product that can be worn outside of the gym, court, pitch or field, delivering the same promise, a functionality and form-fit and performance that they've come to expect from Under Armour. This category expands our vision of empowering all athletes on and off the sporting field.", "Our gateway to engage consumer which will allow us to enter into new categories such as sportswear is connected fitness. As we move from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way they live, we are becoming part of the athlete's life 24/7. From sleep and activity to fitness and nutrition, we are directly interacting with our consumer turning their data into a call to action in support of our mission to make all athletes better. This type of insight we've come to rely on in other areas of our lives such as our personal finances or the performances of our cars is now finally available for our own health. I look forward to sharing with you more on how we will leverage this opportunity with some very exciting announcements to come at CES in early January 2016.", "We believe Connected Fitness will enrich the lives of our consumer and we also believe it will help inform us to make better decisions on behalf of our consumer. The information derived from our Connected Fitness platform delivers deep algorithmic capabilities that create a highly interactive relationship with our consumers making it possible to engage with them in a more personal and relevant way as individuals.", "World-renowned advisor and best-selling author, Ram Charan, believes companies with these mathematical capabilities for personalization, companies he calls 'math houses', possess a huge advantage over companies that don't have these capabilities, even if they've been highly successful in the past. Companies that will experience difficulty keeping up with a math house are referred to as a legacy company. A legacy company still lives in the era of mass production and mass markets with a customer experience in delivered second or third hand. A math house uses a data to shorten the distance between a brand and the consumer.", "Today, the information we gain through the more than 150 million Connected Fitness registered users including now updated from Investor Day 6.5 billion foods logged and over 1.5 billion workouts logged just year-to-date across our four platforms, combined with the global point of sale, e-commerce and transactional data from our partners, has firmly secured our status as the math house of the health, fitness and nutrition industry, and we believe, as Ram has said, any organization that is not a math house now or is unable to become one soon is already a legacy company.", "The hidden benefit in entering these new spaces like Connected Fitness and sportswear are the organizational competencies that we gain as we build up these businesses. We are a team that adapts well, whether it's moving from U.S. to global, apparel to footwear, men's to women's or wholesale to direct-to-consumer. The theme of my presentation at investor Day was based around a piece of advice given to me by former Navy SEAL and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric Olson. His advice was simply that when a map differs from the terrain, I would always tell my soldiers to go with the terrain.", "Led by our world-class leadership team, we continue to demonstrate our deep expertise in going with the terrain to evolve with the upward and downward trends we will inevitably see through any business cycle. Our 10 years now of both 30% top and equally 30% bottom line growth established since our IPO and our healthy strong shirts and shoes business gives us great confidence for the future, and our Connected Fitness math house which will empower us to understand the consumer at a higher level to help shape our cultural approach to continue to innovate and tap into the power of sports for the next 10 years and beyond, we are just getting started. Brad?", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks Kevin. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and preliminary thoughts on 2016. Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period.", "Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $866 million compared to $705 million in the prior year's quarter. From a product perspective, our new Armour baselayer and expanded innovation platforms like Storm and ColdGear Infrared were key stories during the third quarter. On four categories we saw significant growth in golf and outdoor.", "Third quarter footwear net revenues increased 61% to $196 million from $122 million in the prior year. Our strength in footwear remains broad-based, including our largest categories of running and basketball, and extending to some of our newer categories such as hiking and global football. Key products included our latest addition to the SpeedForm platform with the SpeedForm Fortis running shoe, as well as additional Curry 1 basketball styles ahead of the Curry 2 launch this weekend", "Our accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 22% to $104 million from $85 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 28% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged by the success we are seeing with our 2015 brand house openings. From a global standpoint, we ended the third quarter with 173 owned stores including 144 factory house stores and 29 brand house stores.", "In e-commerce, we launched six new country Web-sites during the quarter bringing our total to 24 global sites. We continue to utilize more targeted, effective communication to our consumers and traffic remains strong benefiting from the remarkable 2015 success of our sports marketing assets. While very early in its evolution, we were also encouraged by some of our efforts to generate traffic to our e-commerce sites from our Connected Fitness community.", "Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 25% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $848 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 26%, based primarily on the drivers I just highlighted. International net revenues increased 52% to $130 million in the third quarter and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency neutral basis, International net revenues increased 68% for the period.", "In the EMEA region, we remain focused on core markets with our largest two countries, the U.K. and Germany, contributing the strongest growth during the period. Our e-commerce strategy has also played a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region as we have launched nine new local sites year-to-date.", "In Asia-Pacific, the growth of our own DTC combined with partner store expansion continues to drive our business. The recent Stephen Curry tour and opening of our largest international brand house in Shanghai have helped drive strong demand for our brand. And in Latin America, we continue to see balanced growth throughout the region following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014.", "Moving on to margins, third quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.8% compared to 49.6% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year. Second, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business.", "Also, on our ongoing focus to better flow of product to service our business resulted in higher freight expenses which negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these margin pressures, we continued to see favorable product margins in both our North America and International businesses which benefited gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the third quarter.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 60 basis points to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 from 34% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the third quarter are as follows. Marketing costs increased to 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.6% in the prior year period, reflecting higher marketing associated with our Connected Fitness business and our most recent global marketing campaigns for training and global football. Other SG&A costs increased to 23.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 23.4% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness business and investments in our global brand house strategy.", "Operating income for the third quarter increased 17% to $171 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased to $7 million compared with $5 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Our third quarter tax rate of 38.8% was unfavorable to the 36.9% rate last year, primarily driven by non-deductible costs associated with our Connected Fitness acquisitions as well as increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses, partially driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our third quarter net income increased 13% to $100 million compared to $89 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.45 from $0.41 in the prior year's period.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 36% to $159 million compared with $249 million at September 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 36% to $867 million compared to $637 million at September 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $905 million as compared to $192 million at September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was $71 million for the third quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our global retail strategy.", "Now moving onto our updated 2015 guidance, based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.91 billion, representing growth of 27%, and 2015 operating income of approximately $408 million, representing growth of 15%. As we have highlighted on our last earnings call in July and during our recent Investor Day, we believe the decisions we make on where, when and how much we invest are a key driver of our success to-date and it is our job to deliver both near and long-term value while simultaneously investing in our growth.", "In a year where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global scale, we believe the investments we are making today will help fuel our growth for years to come. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have abundant opportunities that we are investing in to drive our long-term top-line growth.", "With so many areas that require investment, we continue to be focused on driving operating income dollars and not necessarily operating margin. This is why we have now raised our 2015 net revenues guidance by a cumulative $150 million since January, while at the same time maintaining the high-end of our operating income target at $408 million. We are committed to a certain level of investment back into our business and we will continue to be opportunistic if and when possible during the fourth quarter.", "As a reminder, our operating income guidance continues to include the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of one-time transaction costs in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses, and non-cash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions.", "Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which continues to negatively impact our international profitability.", "Now I would like to add some additional color on several items pertaining to the fourth quarter. Starting with revenues, we believe we are well positioned to execute heading into the holidays as our investments in service are paying off in fresher, cleaner assortments across our distribution. As we expand our innovation stories like ColdGear Infrared and Storm across our sports categories, we also believe we are more diversified in our solutions for the athlete. Supported by the launch of Curry 2 basketball shoes, we expect footwear growth will continue to outpace the growth rate for our overall business during the fourth quarter.", "Our gross margin rate is now expected to decline approximately 100 basis points during the fourth quarter. Some of the same themes impacting our business the past few quarters will extend into the fourth quarter, including pressure from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, higher freight costs, and a higher mix of footwear revenues. While higher than planned, the latter two factors are also key in our increased top line guidance for the year.", "In addition to these factors, driven by the recent higher growth rates in our footwear business, we are now planning higher excess footwear liquidation sales as part of our normal inventory management process, which will negatively impact gross margin in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these factors, we anticipate that we will continue to see improvements in our product margins.", "In SG&A, we expect a lower rate of spend for the fourth quarter due to the timing of marketing spend, while other SG&A is expected to grow approximately in line with our net revenues growth as we continue with our planned investments in areas to support our long-term growth including Connected Fitness, international and footwear. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic in investing incremental dollars during the fourth quarter in the event of more favorable than planned net revenues or gross margin rate.", "Switching over to inventory, as we outlined at our Investor Day, over the next few quarters we are focused on delivering our products to our consumers more timely, specifically on key seasonal floor set dates. We anticipate this will result in elevated inventory growth rates over this period to flow product earlier.", "Finally on capital expenditures, based on our current visibility we are now planning capital expenditures in the range of $350 million to $360 million for 2015, including approximately $140 million allocated across three areas to support long-term growth with our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and initial investments in our new and expanded SAP platform. In addition, we have accelerated investments in key areas to drive revenue growth including the rollout of our global retail strategy and new e-commerce sites.", "Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are planning 2016 net revenues to grow at approximately 25% and 2016 operating income to grow at approximately 23%. Both of these measures are in line with our long-term growth targets we established at our Investor Day last month. [We will] [ph] provide further color on 2016 during our earnings call in January.", "With that, let's turn it over to questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Robby Ohmes", "Kevin, actually two questions. The first, can you talk a little bit more on the international side specifically about China and was China a big contributor this quarter and is expected to be big this year or is it maybe some help on the timing of when China could really ramp up as a market for you? And the second question, I know on your Investor Day and then today again you've mentioned the sportswear opportunity, could you just give us a little more color on how Under Armour thinks about that huge opportunity in terms of partners and product categories or any insight you could give us?", "Kevin A. Plank", "First of all, internationally, we're really excited, we've crossed the 11% of the total mix for the Company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something you can't just say it, you actually have to act on it. So I think it was really 2006 we launched our first office in Europe, 2010 we opened our first brand house with a 1,000 square foot store in Shanghai, and it has been a lot of learnings and a lot of adjustment. It's not as easy as just opening stores but it's into the products, it's into the localized fits and localized merchandising, it's into the execution, the distribution, the manufacturing. So there are a lot of pieces and China is a great lesson for that.", "I haven't given these numbers publicly but I think it's instructive of just sort of what our growth has been in China. So in 2012 for instance, I said we launched our first store at 1000 square feet and it was incredibly successful. We were doing over $1 million off that 1000 square feet out of one store in Shanghai. We didn't have the right leadership when we went in there and we sort of toiled around for the next couple of years. By the end of 2012 we were doing $3 million in sales in China.", "We took somebody who was one of our \u2013 I introduced to you a guy named Kevin Eskridge, he is now running global merchandising for us, but I pulled him out of our outdoor group and sent him and his family to Shanghai and the results that we had were the business went from $3 million in 2012 to $7 million in 2013 to roughly $30 million in 2014. The current plan this year is just over $75 million for 2015, and as we look forward to 2016 that number is north of $150 million today. So we are incredibly bullish that the hockey stick approach has really begun to lay in for us. We're excited about what that's going to mean.", "In China though one thing we did I think as a nod to the market was the visit that I did with Curry, the Stephen Curry tour of five cities in five days. We actually launched the shoe that we're launching this Saturday globally, we launched it exclusively in China back at that tour. So China is very important to make sure that you show and demonstrate great respect I think for the market and hopefully it's just another sign of the things we are doing there, in addition to opening our largest international brand house store, 15,000 square feet on Weihai Lu Road in one of the great shopping districts in Downtown Shanghai.", "So we see great growth coming from there and I speak to some of \u2013 one of the numbers that I mentioned was, we'll have more than 300 stores globally. I think it's close to 100 stores or so will be opening this year, roughly three-quarters of those stores are actually going to be in China. So we see great opportunity there. It's going to be our second largest controlled market and growing exponentially. The 30 stores that we opened in the third quarter including 18 in September alone including the Weihai Lu Road, then e-commerce revenues in the third quarter, nearly equalled to total number of 2014 business that we had in China. So, a lot of big things and exciting things happening for us there.", "Let me jump on sports category for you for a second, because I think it's important and it's a good barometer I think on how our business is moving. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to move to nine specific sports categories, men's training, women's training, studio running, outdoor, golf, basketball, team sports, global football and sportswear. Sportswear is one of those quiet discussions that we have, and we outlined at Investor Day the size and importance that sportswear represents for our current competitors. So collectively our competition has roughly $50 billion in revenues, 25% of which they claim publicly derived specifically from sportswear. That's basically $12.5 billion opportunity as we look at it. Today we're competing with effectively zero.", "We feel like we've got the right leader in someone who came from this industry, worked for one of our chief competitors and responsible for helping to build out their sportswear category in Ben Bruce, and Ben is someone who is a process. I want to set people's expectations on sportswear at the same time. We issued $7.5 billion as our Investor Day goal for 2018. Sportswear isn't heavily considered in that. It's going to take time, it's going to take build, and I think that understanding what we're going to need to do from an investment standpoint which is why I think we've been so specific as Brad and I have been really hammering down the fact that while we expect we can really grow and amp-up our top line revenue, we want to be prudent with what we are doing on the bottom line, but this growth, this 25% CAGR that we have committed to, it will come at a price and that price is continuing investment, and I think it's measured investment at the same time and our 10-year track record of I think making appropriate and the right investments is something that gives us great confidence that these are categories that are going to pay dividends for investors in the future but it's the right thing for us to do at the time and it's certainly our moment in time to make that happen.", "Robby Ohmes", "Sounds great. Thanks Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.", "Camilo Lyon", "Great job on the quarter, guys. Brad, I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on the inventory composition. I think you mentioned a couple of things. So a little bit more footwear inventory as well as a little bit more build to improve the service level. Could you maybe quantify the mix between those two and how we should think about the growth rate of footwear relative to the increase of the inventory in footwear?", "Brad Dickerson", "So I think you are hitting a couple of things, so yes, definitely with footwear growing at the rate it's growing and obviously ASPs in footwear much higher than apparel, that's part of the driver behind inventory growth, but probably the bigger driver of what we're doing right now year-over-year specifically in Q3 and as we look into Q4 is more gauged around just the flow of inventory. So if you recall, looking back a year ago or so, or maybe a little bit more than a year ago, we talked about some of the challenges that we had in flowing product on time for things like back-to-school and holiday, and we really got focused this year as we came into 2015 on making sure to some degree at all cost almost that we're going to flow product on time and we\u2019ve called out freight cost, specifically air freight, as an impact to gross margins this year to do that.", "So that's probably the bigger driver of what you're seeing in inventory growth rate, is we were really focused on hitting key floor set date. So when you look at things like getting into the holidays of this year, making sure that product is flowing in and ready to go, is increasing our Q3 inventory levels. When you look at starting to set the floors right at the beginning of next year, in spring 2016, what you're going to see is earlier flow of product in the back half of this year specifically as you get close to the end of this year.", "So as I talked about at Investor Day, when you kind of look at year-over-year growth rates in inventory, that's the bigger driver of this is the flow of product. Obviously we grew a little bit higher than revenue here in Q3 and I think what you'll see is even a little bit more so in Q4 as we really focus on getting product on the floor on time for our spring floor sets. That should start to normalize a little bit as we work through 2016 because we start to get into a comparison of that focus we had in 2015 to flow product better too. So as you start working through Q1 and Q2 of 2016, you should start to normalize that and get back more in line with revenue growth.", "Camilo Lyon", "Perfect, very helpful, thanks. And then, Kevin, there seems to be an endless amount of growth opportunities that you are pursuing. How do you think about the needs around your organizational structure? Specifically, do you think you have invested enough on the talent side on your bench to make future transitions more seamless?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I'm really proud and we used that theme at Investor Day about the map and the terrain, and I think we've demonstrated a really great expertise in being able to adjust with a different terrain. There's going to be many trends, we saw a lot of them in the last 10 years, we are anticipating probably something similar in the next decade or more importantly anticipating what we haven't even thought about yet. But I think investments are important, a great way to talk about our team. Our core pillars we talk about are, product, story, service and team, and team obviously being the most important thing.", "There's a couple of places that I think are illustrative of where we have and frankly where we now need to be more aggressive. Our women's business is a great example of that. Women's footwear is something that as recent as a year ago we had just a handful of people or less than that, really people who used [indiscernible] women's footwear as a part-time job, and where if you compare that to others in our industry, there is not dozens, there's hundreds of people working on [these themes][ph]. And so the investments that we're making from a few different sides are really important.", "I speak about being opportunistic with our investment in general and there's a few places that we think that we need to invest. Now first of all our core business, investing in areas like marketing, supply-chain and technology, and again along with this, Camilo, it all comes down to team and people. But we do see that we are at this unique moment in time and it's the right time for us because of the year we have, some of our assets and athletes, it's things like what should we be doing from a marketing and our storytelling standpoint.", "From a supply-chain, about being a better customer and having the right team, because right now we are okay but we're still not level-loading our factories the way that we could with the volumes that we are driving and being better with the best factories, and then when we are in the best factories, driving the A-teams in those factories and having the best people in the factories working on our business.", "In technology, it's things like laying out the vision, as I mentioned earlier with SAP, about the single view of the consumer. Growth drivers for us, our existing growth drivers, I mentioned they are the same as they were, the five growth drivers are the same as they were at our IPO, men's, women's, footwear, international and direct-to-consumer, and the footwear and international are place where I think we have done a great job as you look at the growth we have in footwear, we had a 61% growth quarter, in the international we have a 69% growth quarter and 85% in constant currency basis. And there are things that we weren't getting a lot of credit for a few years ago and we told you we were spending money in these categories. So I think you're starting to see them really come to life.", "We're also investing in talent and people where again I think making sure that [eight] [ph] is a broad canvas but the canvas isn't too wide either. We feel comfortable about the investments we are making because beyond our own growth drivers there's new areas for you like Connected Fitness, sportswear which I just spoke about, and again doubling down on some of the infrastructure we have, but Connected Fitness is one of those things that we are proud and I think we are bullish on the returns that we are beginning to see come back from it, and as we gave that bogie of $200 million we put out there for 2018, the real upside is something like Connected Fitness, the collective dollars that will help grow across all of our existing growth drivers as well as the new ones that we're investing in, in the dollars to come.", "But I feel we have done a good job, I just believe that there is \u2013 we are in the process of hiring. I think on our Web-site right now there's over 350 jobs or something to that effect that we're looking for. Obviously there's a few key executive positions that we're looking to fill, and as Brad and I have been working through the transition heading to February, we've gotten a great response for this position and we expect to have an A player, someone's who has been there, done that and really has seen what it's like as we look to cross the $7.5 billion plus range. So we are looking to bring experts and I think that's the unique thing about where we are today versus where we were even just a couple of years ago. We have a great attraction I think in this Company, it's custom-fit for some real professionals that would be excited by growth.", "Camilo Lyon", "That's great, thanks for the color. If I could sneak one more in, Brad, could you just remind us what your exposure to weather is in the fourth quarter and how we should be thinking about it relative to your guidance?", "Brad Dickerson", "Pretty consistent with the last couple of years, weather has become less and less of an impact to us as our product has diversified around the fleece products and specifically as we start to set floors a little bit earlier for next year also on the holidays. So last couple of years it has been, we've called out like a 1% to 2% growth rate potential in weather. I think every year probably becomes less impactful to us because of the diversification of our product and also in our regions too, on the international basis. So yes, I mean there's a little bit of an impact there but it's not tremendously significant, and obviously as we look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are not anticipating any dramatic change in weather year-over-year either way in our guidance.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Camilo, let me jump on the end of that as well with Brad. Look it's the second warmest September I think on record that came out recently and I think there's a lot of conversation around it but we're incredibly proud about the ability to still post a 28% growth rate in the quarter, and one thing we focused on really just going back four or five years where we realized how weather-dependent we were as a company with a pretty classic 60/40 split front-half versus \u2013 40/60 split with front half versus back half of the year, I think we have done a good job into letting things like [indiscernible] quarter not being silver lined on heavyweight fleece but focusing more on sort of stylish lightweight fleeces and we have really worked closely with our partners to create offerings that aren't just relying on big puffer jackets that are sitting in retail stores and if it doesn't snow aren't going to sell. So definitely it's a work in process but weatherproofing our business has been a real focus for our Company and I think we're pretty proud of how we're positioned versus maybe other people in our world.", "Camilo Lyon", "Perfect. All the best, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Michael Binetti", "Congrats on a great quarter. I have a couple of near-term questions. I know you guys are geared up to celebrate 10 years as a phenomenal public company, so I apologize for focusing on the near-term here a little bit, but can we just talk about the comments on the footwear liquidation in the fourth quarter? I'm assuming that that happens at the factory houses and maybe you could just help us think, I know you pointed out as a gross margin drag but as you work through some lower ASPs, will we hear about a little bit of a slower comp sales drag in the outlook as well as that happened?", "Brad Dickerson", "On the footwear liquidation, it's really kind of a victim of our success to some degree as we've had some tremendous growth rates in footwear in the last few quarters in the 40s, 50s and now 60s, 61% this quarter. So this is just the normal process of managing inventory and as you work through selling in and selling through, which both have been very positive for us on the footwear side, you're ultimately always going to be left with some excess inventory in footwear.", "We've become over the course of the last few years and this year too very focused on getting into the next season very clean on the footwear side. So looking at the excess footwear we had again which is really just being generated from the tremendous growth and success we've had in footwear in general. We really got focused on getting through some of the footwear liquidation in Q4 and making sure that we were very clean getting into next year.", "So obviously as you talk about footwear gross margins, just the regular gross margins of footwear being well below our apparel gross margins, that's also the case on the liquidation side where your footwear liquidation margins are going to be much less than your apparel liquidation side.", "As far as the avenues and vehicles to liquidate, factory house obviously is one of them and we have talked about third party in the past also of moving some of our excess inventory through a third-party also. Although small in revenue and volume, obviously does impact gross margin.", "Michael Binetti", "Got it. And then, Brad, I know it's one of the tougher metrics to kind of look at, but the currency impact on gross margin is fairly large for your international mix as I look at companies across this space have much bigger international components to their overall business. Can you help us, that fourth quarter 100 basis points that you talked to, can you help us dimentionalize that, what is causing that much pressure, and maybe is there anything you guys can look at down the road to help offset that a little bit more that you may not be doing at this point?", "Brad Dickerson", "So it's a good question, so when you look at the fourth quarter specifically, we anticipate 100 basis point decline. FX will be a big part of that year-over-year decline. If you remember, we came into this year talking about FX impacting our margins by about 50 basis points. Now we are up to about 80 basis points full year impact. So obviously the FX has worsened during the course of the year. So that's a big driver of it.", "Again, the fourth quarter margins, air freight, as we really get focused on slowing inventory, that's a little bit of a driver too and that kind of increased during the course of the year as we've got kind of laser-focused on better deliveries and better flow of product. Those would be the big, big drivers. We talked about footwear liquidation also being a driver in Q4.", "We came into this year on the FX side probably less prepared than we are coming out of the year relative to how we hedge currencies going forward. So we have done a better job during the course of this year offsetting some of the increased pressures on FX. We have built some better competencies in-house from a talent perspective and some better strategies around hedging that will continue to increase going forward.", "So I would expect that in the future we're more prepared to offset some of those impacts that you're seeing right now, and obviously as you get into 2016 we're going to start to compare to 2015 FX rates, so you would imagine that there would be a much more favorable comparison unless something drastically changes in the FX front.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. If I could just sneak in one last one, on the fourth quarter you guys have done a great job exceeding your plan on revenues for a long time, comparison of a couple of big growth drivers like international get tougher in the fourth quarter, specifically as you look through your plan and your inventors look like you're ready to chase if you need to, do you see an opportunity in the fourth quarter, where do you think we'll hear from you in the fourth quarter that there could be any upside to opportunity [indiscernible]?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Very consistent direct-to-consumer, it's the area we can obviously impact the quickest, we control the whole value chain there, so our ability to react and turn product is the most quickest in DTC. So that's where I would expect upside the most. That doesn't mean you couldn't see it in the wholesale also, but we can obviously react much quicker on the DTC side.", "Michael Binetti", "Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Boss", "Congrats on a great quarter. So with the footwear acceleration you're seeing, still early I think, but can you talk about any examples that you have seen so far of more [indiscernible] hook-up for the brand, meaning as it becomes a larger piece of the pie, do you think footwear can drive incremental apparel and just ways that you can even take advantage of this more?", "Kevin A. Plank", "I think classically as people typically get dressed, it's foot to head, it's not head to toe, and it's one thing where I think we've probably been dragging a little bit. The women's example that I gave earlier, that's something which was glaring and really obvious, but look, we've got growth coming from a lot of places, and so until you really turn attention and can focus on it, you're probably a bit vulnerable.", "So we've made I think six or seven hires just in the last 45 days on our women's footwear team, really looking to become robust and build that out, and there's places where we have definitely taken an ROI approach to it where we have the biggest impact. But at the same time, we don't want to apologize for footwear. It's a relatively small number and we also put a 60% number up this quarter committing to a 40% CAGR through 2018, we think there is great growth there and we're going to be the beneficiaries of that.", "But one thing I want to emphasize to people is that it is 10 years in making shoes for us, but it absolutely takes time. The first category we got into was American football cleats and that was 2006 and it was a big breakthrough and we had high teens, low 20s market share, and since that time we are now pushing close to a 40% market share in football cleats with our sight set on being number one. And I say that only because of the category we've been in the longest, and if we're 10 years in football cleats and five years in running shoes, imagine what we're going to look like in running shoes in another five years there.", "But I guess the thing to say is making a great shoe is not as \u2013 or be winning in footwear is not about making one great shoe, there's so many factors that are combined, and just like used football cleats, when we were successful with the 20% market share, we were basically making shoes for a particular type of athlete and the speed guys and the guys on the edges of a team weren't the guys that were wearing our product. And the reason we couldn't figure out is, why won't they buy our speed shoes, our speed shoes is not good, and the fact is that the kid who wear basketball is really important to him, and he likes wearing the shoe on the football field but he worn them in basketball court, and until we launch a basketball shoe, we couldn't even become relevant there, and until we became relevant in basketball, he wasn't even going to consider us.", "And so it was about the aesthetic of the shoe but it's so many factors more than just do you make a good speed cleat as to, are you in basketball, do you have an asset like a Stephen Curry that gives the credibility to the one who wears the shoe. And then beyond that, it's when we go to being in the biggest factories, it's not only being in the biggest or the best factories but it's not having the B, C or D teams in the factories, but getting to a point where you have the A teams in the factories. We're not going to get to that point where I mentioned 30 million pairs of shoes versus 0.5 billion to our competition, until we have the ability to truly level-load and give them the things that they need.", "And so as we sit here 10 years in and [indiscernible] football cleats and those six baseball and seven training shoes and eight running shoes and nine basketball shoes and 10, then we stop launching new categories, we're getting there, we're evolving, it just takes a little more time. So we absolutely believe in sort of the head to toe hooks that we are heading to, but I'll tell you at our bones we believe that we're as entitled as anyone else to be number one in footwear.", "And the challenges goes to what I spoke about local for local manufacturing, we talked about innovation in something like footwear. I don't think our industry has been incredibly innovative at all. When you look and you compare the fact that 20 years ago the technology that can fit on my fingernails today or in my iPhone or Samsung device, it took a mainframe the size of a Greyhound bus just 20 years ago and today it's absolutely evolved. In footwear, we make shoes, we make apparel the exact same way we did 80 years ago.", "So I think finding innovation and finding ways to win is that there is not an individual shoe technology that makes someone innovative. So I think the approach that we have is holistic and it will pay absolute dividends, but we are challenging our team to think much bigger. But a few I think highlights we have on the footwear side is that obviously basketball is something we assess, our basketball business up over in triple digits, bringing in our SpeedForm technology to what that's going to mean for us in basketball as well, signing additional athletes, the number seven pick in this [indiscernible], he's one of the breakout young stars this year as well, so doubling down there. Women's, we cover that.", "Our running business, we've got a great product in SpeedForm but we're also bringing six new running models to market in 2016, including a product we have in the market right now called Fortis which is our number one selling shoe in our key sporting gods accounts at $90-ish and doing really well, as well as another new, our first all-knit upper offering in a product called Slingshot which is doing really well.", "But across the board, outdoor with the Fat Tire shoe I mentioned in my notes earlier, football cleats have the number one shoe in the market with the Highlight Cleat. Soccer, our new Slay Your Next Giant campaign is our asset. Memphis Depay, the striker for Manchester United who is 22 years old and again another next big star. Jordan Spieth on launching golf footwear. Our youth footwear continues to be on fire as well.", "So there's a lot of sort of individual stories. I think they are drawing to the bigger narrative and we haven't connected all the dots I think for the consumer yet where when I mean the consumer, I also mean our customers, where we could be a great footwear brand, when you walk into a store with an A to Z footwear experience, but I can tell you is that we know what that movie looks like, we have seen it before and we are bringing pros who have seen it before as well, and it's just a matter of time for us to draw that.", "But I want to emphasize, we think we could be the number one brand in footwear and what our team is preparing for is in what's the next shoe coming from one of our current competitors, what we're thinking about is what are we going to do if Apple or Samsung decided to make a shoe, how are we going to answer that. So that's the type of I think leapfrog mentality and that moon-shot thinking that we are challenging our team with, let's not fight with where people are today, let's think about where they're going in the future and what we can do to be great.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. And then just a quick follow up to switch gears, on Connected Fitness and the math house, can you just touch on the integration, any learnings and really the opportunities to change the game as you think about the next year and beyond?", "Kevin A. Plank", "Since Investor day is when I had that time actually with Ram and he took us through that idea of math house which I guess we knew it all along but it was a great way to articulate it. But if I could just take a second on our Connected Fitness, today more than 150 million athletes continue to add over 100,000 a day throughout 2015 downloading one of our four apps. I mean the scale is extraordinary. At Investor Day we had mentioned there were 6 billion foods logged at the time. Today just a few weeks later, over 6.5 billion foods logged. Workouts, 1.3 billion is the number we gave you at Investor Day. Today it's more than 1.5 billion workouts. More than 200 million workouts have occurred just in the last few weeks.", "So the information we are gaining every day we think is incredible and is going to continue to enable us to provide the consumer with really relevant information inside to, we like to use the word, to enrich lives. We think the bigger opportunity though is much bigger, is much broader than the $200 million target that we talked about and ultimately it's going to help us sell more shirts and shoes.", "The math house idea though, the ability to use data and analytics to drive business, is something which is I don't even think we have quantified yet. I use the example and I think it's a really good one, that Amazon, how they credit 40% of the revenues, what they call the recommendation engine, and that's basically just based off toothpaste. I know if I sold you a tube of toothpaste five weeks ago, a toothpaste has a six week lifecycle, and I can ask if you want me to send you a new tube.", "Not only do we know purchasing history, but we can tie that to activity, to fitness, to sleep, to nutrition and data and information that our consumers are voluntarily giving to us, and we recognize that as they do that, our job is becoming this destination, this daily dashboard of your health and fitness that we think we can become, and that's all built on trust. And as I've said many times, this trust is one of those things that is built in drops and it can be lost in buckets, but we think that we have the credibility at this point and we think with some of the suite of products and apps and devices that we have as we are contemplating looking forward and partners we're looking with those devices to move forward, we've got a large announcement we're looking forward to making at CES in January and we think it's an incredibly exciting space that it's just partially contemplated as we look forward.", "But the one thing that is clear, as excited as we are about our Connected Fitness and how it's going to enable us with this math house to be that much smarter about our overall business, ultimately what it's going to do is help us sell more shirts and shoes.", "Matthew Boss", "Great, best of luck.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Operator, time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Omar Saad", "I'll keep this quick. The first question, one follow-up on the gross margin comments, Brad, I understand the headwinds, the FX, the mix shift, et cetera, but you mentioned product margin as one of the benefits to the gross margin line, 80 or 90 bps, something like that, could you be a little bit more specific and expand upon what you mean by product margin driving one of the takes against the puts?", "Brad Dickerson", "That's really probably more kind of on our core apparel business, so just overall our kind of core product margins, whether it would be through pricing and/or costing just in general across the globe, North America or international. Again, most of our core apparel product margins are improving. So that's helping offset some of the other pressures we talked about.", "Omar Saad", "Is that more generating scale in the business on the cost side, are you taking price strategically or is it a mix to more premium products, maybe just expand a little bit more?", "Brad Dickerson", "It's a little bit across the board. So obviously some of the innovations that we have come out with over the last few years from a price point perspective helped our margins, getting more focused on kind of our higher volume products on the costing side of things, obviously scale is a big, big part of that. So it's kind of all of the above, Omar, to some degree, but again, you would expect from a perspective of improving product margins that our apparel business would be the place we see the most of that because it's obviously our longer business and existing business, so that's where we're seeing it right now.", "Omar Saad", "Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one on DTC, if you kind of look at the store growth, it's been accelerating, you talked about at Investor Day accelerating the store growth longer term being an important channel, I think it's over a quarter of the business now. The revenue slowed a little bit the last couple of quarters, which implies a slowdown in the same-store sales number for lack of a better term. Can you help us understand, are there subtle things going on there we should be aware of, any timing issues, is it more on the e-commerce side where maybe it's slowing a little bit or is it the outlet channel, as we have seen other companies with outlet exposure see a little bit of a slowdown there, just maybe a little more detail around what's going on in DTC and how we expect that to unfold in the coming quarters?", "Brad Dickerson", "I think what you've seen from DTC is a little bit of, if you go back to the first quarter, it grew at 21% and it grew 33% in the second quarter and now 28% in the third quarter. So it's been up and down a little bit. A lot of that right now is going to be timing of new market entries on the e-commerce side globally, retail on the global side too, entry into certain markets and expansion of certain markets, Kevin talked a lot about China and the growth in China, the timing of some of that, obviously brand house in the states too.", "So if you look across the board, e-commerce side of it has been the strongest of the growth drivers across all the quarters really. If you look back over the last four quarters, e-commerce has kind of led the way from a growth rate perspective. The retail, although been strong, has been below the e-com growth.", "When you look at just in general on the retail side, you have to remember that still the majority of our revenues on retail are being generated by North America factory house channel. So although we talk about brand houses both domestically and globally, what's going on in retail, the large majority of our retail revenue still sits in that kind of North America factory house, and we've talked about over the course of the last six, seven, eight quarters that planning the slowdown of that growth rate as we opened less doors going forward and focused on square footage growth, that we plan that growth rate of North America factory house to decline as we got into 2015 in the future.", "So that to some degree what you're seeing is the impact of that North America factory house growth rate which we plan to kind of come down, still healthy but plan down. That's kind of what you're seeing I think from the perspective of some of the growth rates in DTC.", "Omar Saad", "All right, that's really helpful. Thanks, great job guys.", "Kevin A. Plank", "Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to reporting to you our fourth quarter 2015 results which [indiscernible] have been scheduled for Thursday, January 28 at 8.30 AM Eastern Time. Thanks again and goodbye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Shaw, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.", "Tom Shaw", "Thanks. Good morning to everyone joining us for today's fourth quarter conference call. During the course of this call, we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the risk factors section of our filings with the SEC.", "The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, as required by Regulation G, we need to make you aware that during the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial information, specifically currency neutral net revenue growth.

Following Kevin's remarks, Chip will briefly introduce himself and Brad will take us through the Company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, followed by an update to our 2016 outlook.

Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11AM Eastern time today. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I want to wish you all a belated Happy New Year and wish those in China an early, Guonian Hao. While this earnings call is to report on our 2015 fourth quarter and the past year as a whole, I want to focus for a moment on the year ahead. This year, 2016, is Under Armour's 20th year in business. It is an incredible milestone for any Company and for us, it means a few things.", "It means that the next generation entering the workforce doesn't know a world where Under Armour didn't exist. This generation doesn't recognize us as the underdogs but as the always was. It means that we're not a passing fad or a flavor of the month. The interlocking UA logo has become a globally recognized symbol for being aggressive, young and fearless. It means we're a brand that resonates with athletes, all athletes. We will continue to thrive because we remain as humble and hungry as we were 20 years ago with plenty of room left to grow.", "With that, our scoreboard remains strong. We're entering this milestone positioned for success, capping off the past year with yet another solid finish. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 31%, marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20% plus net revenue growth. Since this call is about our most recent fourth quarter, let me throw out a few more numbers to you that are fourth quarter related, 36, 34, 26, 35 and 31. Those are the percentages we have grown in each of the previous five fourth quarters.", "Each year around this time, weather inevitably plays part of the conversation. Each year, we answer those who doubt us, with extremely strong growth numbers in the fourth quarter. Was it 72 degrees on the East Coast this past Christmas? It was. Did it affect our business in the way some thought it would? No, it did not. Because here in the U.S., where we currently do the majority of our business, we know that football will be played in the fall, basketball will be played in the winter, baseball will be played in the spring and like soccer, personal health and fitness is a year-round all-weather interest.", "Our business is more diversified than it has ever been, we do not let weather play a decisive role in dictating our success. As we move into 2016, we have become a global brand capable of meeting athletes' needs from head to toe. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong gains across our business, illustrating the broad-based strength and demand for our brand, with, apparel growing 22%; direct consumer growing 25%; international growing 70%; and footwear growing a whopping 95%.", "While our growth drivers have not changed since we went public more than 10 years ago, these numbers show how diverse our portfolio has become and reinforces the continued success of our largest category, apparel. 10 years ago, we were a $281 million Company, with apparel representing 93% of our revenues and compression representing 64% of the entire business. Today, our apparel business represents 71% of our revenues and compression is less than 10%.", "We closed 2015 with more balance and breadth of product across our businesses, men's, women's and youth driving our apparel business to over $2.8 billion from just the $260 million it was a decade ago. In the fourth quarter, apparel growth at 22% showcases that our brand has products for all seasons and temperatures and perhaps more importantly that today our athletes have the complete head to toe assortment available to them in more channels globally than ever before, 10 years ago, our direct consumer business represented 6% of our net revenues, consisting of a single website and just four domestic factory house doors.", "Today, our direct-to-consumer business represents 30% of net revenues, made up of 25 global websites and nearly 400 Under Armour owned and partner retail doors around the world. It is impossible to not talk about the strength of e-commerce when we look at our direct consumer business.", "This business continues to be on fire, not only in the United States but also around the world. In China, on Singles Day this past November, we had our first $1 million revenue day online. While in the U.S., mobile has grown to almost 50% of the traffic to our site and represented 23% of e-commerce revenues in the fourth quarter. Consumers continue to look for us in multiple places. We will be wherever they are, whether it is on a device or in physical doors.", "Globally, we continue to drive both awareness and revenue growth as we expand our retail footprint outside the United States, closing out 2015 with almost 3 times as many doors in total from just a year ago. 10 years ago, we had just entered Europe and our international business was $6 million, primarily driven by our partners in Japan. Today, international has become almost a $0.5 billion business, with our brand being sold in more than 60 countries.", "Last week, I visited our Amsterdam office that has served as our European headquarters for the past 10 years, located in the historic Olympic Stadium, where the energy and enthusiasm has me more confident in our team and their ability than ever before. In 2015, every region, every category and every channel exceeded our plans for our international business, driving 70% growth in the fourth quarter and 69% growth year-over-year. Two years ago, our international business was 6% of revenues. Today it is 11%. By 2018, as we said on our Investor Day, we expect it to be 18%. Our brand certainly translates.", "10 years ago, we had not sold a single pair of shoes. Today, footwear represents 17% of our business, closing in on $700 million in revenues. This past quarter, our footwear revenues grew 95%, driven in part by the success of our expanded running line which will feature eight different offerings all over the $100 price point compared to the four lines offered in the previous year.", "Also driving our growth and more importantly creating an incredible connection with our young consumer is our Stephen Curry signature basketball shoe line that launched almost a year ago today. The sell-through on the Curry Two was like nothing we've ever seen before. The same words that people tend to say after watching Stephan play live.", "We're just beginning to see what partnering with the right athlete, like Stephen Curry, can do for our business. It is difficult to underestimate the power of having the best sell-through of any signature basketball shoe this past season. It clearly lifted our brand in the mall channel and positioned us for aggressive growth, not only in signature but overall with this most important consumer base.", "Footwear and to be clear, premium footwear, continues to be an accelerator to our topline and a huge part of our growth story. With our sights set on building $1 billion plus footwear brand, it is becoming a bigger and more important component of our business. The result will be a more balanced blend of apparel and footwear within UA. Posting a 57% growth in footwear for the full year in 2015 is evidence of our ability to resonate with the consumer and provide them with a breadth of products unmatched in years past.", "The strength of our footwear product, coming from our expanding team of designers and developers, helped us elevate our business above $100 at retail by 1,000% this past year. We're even more excited and proud of the product that is coming out in 2016. We're seeing what Stephen has done for our basketball business, what basketball has done for our footwear business and from there, what footwear has done for our brand.", "This story is being told in our numbers but is also being told on the courts, fields and pitches around the world. Show up at any Golden State Warriors game, home or away, it doesn't matter and you will see the thousands of people who show up early just to see Stephen Curry's warm-up routine. That, as I have described to you before, is the power of sport.", "Speaking of our MVP's, we're continuing on last year's theme of UA Ambassadors dominating their respective sport, thanks to our roster of athletes who continue to win on the world's biggest stages. Since the last time we have spoken, in baseball, Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals was named the Major League Baseball MVP in the National League. In tennis Andy Murray won the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time in 79 years. In boxing, Canelo Alvarez became the WBC Middleweight Champion of the World with his victory over Miguel Cotto. They joined Stephen, Jordan, Misty and others in our Year of Champions, solidifying UA as the home for winners.", "Now, with the Super Bowl just over a week away, we will see yet another UA MVP, Cam Newton, compete at the highest level his sport while representing our brand. Cam has been a critical driver of our footwear success, with the Highlight Cleat. The Super Bowl will introduce him to a brand new set of consumers. It is a platform where companies pay $5 million to air a simple 30-second TV spot during the broadcast, while our guy will wear his UA cleats throughout the entire three plus hours of the game.", "Finally, we ended 2015 with a key personnel announcement. Last month, we announced Brad Dickerson's successor as CFO will be Chip Molloy. Chip comes to us with significant financial executive experience in the consumer retail sector, having served as EVP and CFO for PetSmart from 2007 until 2013 and where in 2011, he was named Institutional Investor's CFO of the Year for Specialty Retail.", "Chip is a Maryland native and a graduate of one of our partners schools, the United States Navel Academy. He also graduated from Navy Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun as it is known, where he served for 15 years in the United States Navy. With my new partner in place, Chip will work together with Brad over the next month to ensure a smooth transition. So that is how we closed 2015.", "Now, let's talk about how we kicked off 2016. We started this year off with a bang at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, unveiling a suite of products that will change the way athletes live. Many of you have heard me talk about Connected Fitness on these calls or at our Investor Day. In the past three weeks, we have seen the vision of this platform truly come to life.", "First, we announced the launch of UA Record, one of our four mobile app platforms that collectively are earning more than 130,000 new users a day since just the beginning of the year. UA Record is the digital dashboard that displays everything you need to know about your health in four quadrants, sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition. Combined with your body weight in our own cognitive measurement of how do you feel, it collects and displays a complete picture of your health in the easiest, most simple way possible.", "Second, we introduced the Under Armour Health Box, the world's first complete Connected Fitness system which consists of a band, a heart rate strap and a smart scale, all in one package. Built in partnership with HTC, these tools work together to capture data pertaining to your health and fitness. Again, doing it in the easiest, most simple way possible. Because music is such an important part of how people exercise, we also partner with Harman Kardon JBL to launch bluetooth-enabled wireless headphones, including an updated version to be released later this year that will also read heart rate in lieu of a strap.", "Finally, we launched our first smart shoe, with the Gemini 2 RE which stands for record equipped. This shoe tracks every step and uploads data including time, date, duration and distance directly into our platforms. This cutting edge footwear provides an untethered experience and allows the athlete to run device free. There is no start or stop button. When the shoes are on your feet, it is ready and tracking. One of the coolest features of this shoe is that it tracks it's own lifespan and will send a notification when it is time for a new pair.", "All of these products feed into UA Record, as well as more than 400 different connected devices to create the ultimate open platform destination to measure your health and fitness. Additionally, we announced our partnership with IBM and their Watson platform to help build the insights capability for Under Armour Record. Wearables have been effective in telling you how many steps you took or the hours you slept, but they haven't been effective in giving you proactive information on how to utilize that data to make your life better. Put simply, there was no call to action until now.", "IBM's Watson, a platform that executes cognitive thinking, will provide personalized insights in real-time to the user based on the information we collect through UA Record and will take the experience and service to a whole new level. By adding Watson's insights to UA Record, we deliver directions to help you reach your personal goals, whether you want to lose 10 pounds or simply just feel better. This is what differentiates UA Record from the rest of the fitness tracking apps and what gives us confidence in the consumer experience we're building to help change the way athletes live.", "Now let me complete the vision for Connected Fitness. Beyond enriching lives, it will propel our business forward. This is not a tech initiative. This is a digital transformation and therefore, a business transformation for Under Armour. Before Connected Fitness, we only had retail transaction information for less than 10 million people, that's stores and e-commerce combined. Now, we have daily activity level data from our community members, who logged nearly 8 billion foods and 2 billion activities last year alone.", "Not only do we have people going into our stores and visiting our e-commerce sites, but we also have a deeper understanding of our consumer based on information collected using Connected Fitness including sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, weight and how do you feel. This gives us an unparalleled view of their life and needs. I refer to it as our math house during our last call, but we're also calling it the single view of the consumer. All of this is possible because of the near 10-year partnership we have established with SAP.", "The single view of the consumer is something we're building with the team at SAP that combines global point of sale, e-commerce and transactional information through a single sign-on capability together with our Connected Fitness business to create an insight engine that will inform and guide our decisions to help grow and scale our brand. This will build on our existing SAP platform as we double down and continue to make big bets with big partners. We believe that this unique technological advancement will position UA as a best-in-class real-time digital enterprise.", "At Under Armour, we focus on creating products you don't know you need yet; but once you have it, you won't remember how you lived without it, just like our very first t-shirt. Some great examples of this are the types of innovation we will bring to the market that will further elevate and diversify our product and continue to distinguish Under Armour. For example, this year, we will launch microthread, a new cooling technology comprised of elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar LYCRA construction.", "Then on the heating side, there is Reactor, an insulation that combines warmth and breathability, to keep you comfortable without overheating. This is in addition to many other new innovations, like CoolSwitch and on the footwear side, Slingshot. New innovations like the ones I just mentioned bring new opportunities for growth which lead to revenue driving platforms. Our goal is that these new innovations will develop as strongly as some of our key revenue driving platforms from prior years, like ColdGear Infrared and Armour in apparel and the signature Curry line in footwear.", "Our relentless pursuit of innovation is just that, relentless. It never stops. When I first began Under Armour 20 years ago, I didn't set out to make just another t-shirt. I set out to make a better t-shirt, one that solves a problem and gives whoever wears it an advantage. With our Connected Fitness business, we're not releasing just another fitness app or tracking device, we're building a complete ecosystem to manage your health and fitness with actual insights to make you better. Finding a better way has been a running theme for us over the past 20 years, whether it is through the products we offer or the way we operate our business. We'll keep finding a better way for another 20 years because we're just getting started. So now, I would like to introduce Chip Molloy before Brad takes us through the numbers. Chip?", "Chip Molloy", "Thanks, Kevin. I appreciate the kind words. Although, I've only been on the job for about 10 days now, it is already abundantly clear that this Company has a tremendous runway of growth ahead. I am also extremely privileged to follow a leader like Brad and inherit the great team that he has been instrumental in building over his time with the Company. In the near term, I'll be focused on living and learning the business and look forward to meeting many of you beginning late spring. Now, I will turn it over to Brad to run through the numbers.", "Brad Dickerson", "Thanks, Kevin and Chip. I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results followed by our updated outlook for 2016. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased 33%. For the full year, net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 billion which compared to our most recent full-year guidance of $3.91 billion. On a currency neutral basis, full-year net revenues increased 31%.", "Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew apparel net revenues 22% to $865 million compared to $708 million in the prior-year's quarter. With our efforts to build a more diversified business, we posted impressive growth across channels and categories despite well-documented weather challenges. Our focus on building brand equity around the globe through elevated product and experiences was evident in the strong growth of international and direct-to-consumer in the quarter. We also saw success around our continued expansion in key product categories like training, running, golf, team sports and basketball.", "Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 95% to $167 million from $86 million in the prior year. Broad-based footwear strength has been the consistent theme in 2015, though the exceptional performance of our Curry Two signature basketball line was clearly the fourth quarter standout. Our accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 23% to $97 million from $79 million last year, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our line of bags.", "Our global direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 25% for the quarter, representing approximately 36% of net revenues. In global retail, we entered the fourth quarter with 191 owned stores, including 161 factory house doors and 30 brand house stores. With our retail business still heavily weighted to North America factory house doors, we did experience some of the similar weather-related challenges as our overall apparel business; however, our strong e-commerce business continues to diversify how we reach global consumers. We continued to capitalize on our investments in mobile and international, where we more than doubled our in-country websites during 2015.", "Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 26% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $808 million in the prior-year's quarter. On a currency neutral basis, North American net revenues increased 27%, accelerating from the growth rate posted last quarter despite the warm weather backdrop. This strength demonstrates the diversity of our product mix including accelerated footwear growth and consistent apparel performance, as well as channel mix between our wholesale partners and our direct-to-consumer businesses.", "International net revenues increased 70% to $139 million in the fourth quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency neutral basis, international net revenues increased 85% for the period. In the EMEA region, our heightened focused on the UK and Germany continues to drive momentum in these two core markets. While growth remains strong across all channels, our e-commerce strategy including nine new in-country sites launched in 2015 is playing a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region.", "In Asia Pacific, we continue to see tremendous demand for the brand, driving triple-digit growth across greater China and our Southeast Asia distributor led by the success and expansion of our brand house stores. In Latin America, we're building momentum with many of our recent country expansions like Chile, more than offsetting the well-documented macro challenges in Brazil.", "Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 190 basis points to 48% compared to 49.9% in the prior-year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business. Second, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Third, higher inventory liquidations negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.", "Before I move on with other elements of the quarter, I wanted to provide a quick snapshot of our gross margin performance for the full year. Our full-year rate in 2015 declined 90 basis points to 48.1% compared to 49% in the prior-year's period. Of this 90 basis point decline, 70 basis points resulted from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.", "While we also faced additional gross margin headwinds from adverse sales mix impacts given the strong growth of our international and footwear businesses, higher inventory liquidation specifically in the fourth quarter and higher freight expenses from port disruptions in efforts to better service our business, we were able to offset most of the non-currency related pressure through more favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 80 basis points to 32.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 33.6% in the prior-year's period. SG&A details from the fourth quarter are as follows. Marketing costs decreased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.4% in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the timing of our global marketing campaigns. Other SG&A costs decreased to 24.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 25.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $178 million compared with $146 million in the prior-year period.", "For the full year, operating income increased 15% to $409 million compared to our most recent guidance of $408 million. The two Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015 negatively impacted full-year operating income by approximately $23 million. Interest and other expense in the fourth quarter increased to $6 million compared with $4 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.4% was consistent with the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income increased 21% to $106 million compared to $88 million in the prior-year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.48 from $0.40 in the prior-year's period. The full-year diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.05 compared to $0.95 in 2014. The $1.05 earnings per share in 2015 is inclusive of a $0.10 impact from the two Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $130 million compared with $593 million at December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable increased 55% to $434 million compared with $280 million at December 31, 2014, primarily led to the timing of shipments within the quarter. Inventory for the quarter increased 46% to $783 million compared to $537 million at December 31, 2014.", "Back at our Investor Day in September and again, on our third quarter earnings call, we discussed elevated inventory growth from the 36% rate posted in the third quarter. This growth is largely a result of our strategy to focus on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and thus drive higher fill rates. This strategy includes flowing product to our customers earlier to meet key seasonal floor set dates, as well as strategic investments in auto replenishment products.", "While these efforts are driving much of the elevated inventory growth rates in the near term, they are also delivering meaningful improvements in our service levels year-over-year in support of our revenue growth. In addition, the recent weather trends have led to some excess inventory creation which we will continue to work through across our normal liquidation channels during the first half of 2016. Total debt increased to $669 million as compared to $284 million at December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our two Connected Fitness acquisitions.", "Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $85 million for the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior-year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our SAP platform. Full-year capital expenditures were $325 million compared to our prior guidance range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to timing of our investments.", "Now, moving on to 2016. Based on our current visibility, we expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.95 billion, representing growth of 25% and 2016 operating income of approximately $503 million representing growth of 23%. These growth rates remain in line with the long term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last September and are also consistent with our previous guidance on our third quarter earnings call.", "Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016, as we expect to increase debt levels to support our business and look for opportunities to refinance our debt with more long term financing. In addition, we expect the full-year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $223 million.", "Now, I would like to provide more color on our expected results for 2016. First, with net revenues, we currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full-year growth rate. Specifically looking at the first quarter, we expect the growth rate to be in the high 20%s, led by many of the same factors from our fourth quarter including strength in footwear and international, higher planned inventory liquidations and strategies to better service our customers year-over-year. As is typical at this point in the year, as we gain better visibility on orders, specifically for the fourth quarter, we provide updates on our progress on future calls.", "Next on gross margin, we expect a relatively consistent year-over-year rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate similar year-over-year dynamics as our just completed fourth quarter results, including higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory along with continued currency headwinds. Thus, we expect our largest gross margin headwind for the year during the first quarter; we're planning an approximate 150 basis point decline year-over-year.", "Shifting to SG&A, we expect deleverage expenses in 2016 as our focus remains on making the right investments to drive our long term global success. Looking at the marketing portion of SG&A, we expect to continue to invest across our sports marketing assets, global brand campaigns and retail marketing. In other SG&A, we're focused on key brand enhancing initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day, such as Connected Fitness and global retail, as well as strategic investments -- strategic business areas including category management and innovation.", "With a higher topline growth rate currently expected in the front half of the year, we expect modest overall SG&A leverage in the front half of the year and modest deleverage in the second half of the year. Looking at capital expenditures in 2016, we're currently planning to invest at the midpoint of our 8% to 10% of net revenues target range outlined at our Investor Day. Our investments include our global headquarters, as well as our expanding SAP platform that will serve as the architecture for our future growth, while also driving our insights engine to power our single view of the consumer that Kevin spoke about.", "Finally, inventory. As we previously stated, our focus is on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and improving our customer service levels. As a result, we continue to expect inventory growth rates to be slightly elevated above the revenue growth rate in the front half of 2016, with growth rates expected to level off and be in line with revenue growth in the back half of 2016.", "Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to take just a moment to express my thanks to Kevin and the team. It has been a real privilege and honor over the last 11 years plus to work for Kevin in this great brand and have been part of such a strong leadership team and an amazing group of teammates that now tops more than 12,000. In addition, today marks the 37th UA earnings call I have participated in. I would like to thank the analysts and investors on the call today, many of whom, I have spent time with over the years telling the Under Armour story. I'm excited to pass the CFO reigns to Chip, a proven leader. I am confident that Chip and the talented team supporting him will continue the strong growth for this great brand.", "Now, I like to turn it over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].Our first question is from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.", "Matt McClintock", "My question is, Kevin, there seems to be a lot of debate in the marketplace on several of your strategies. You kind of hit upon some of this in your prepared remarks but, in particular, the competitive positioning of both your footwear and your women's business and then also the potential maturity of the domestic business, I was wondering if you can give us your updated thoughts on those topics? Have there been any strategic changes that we should be thinking about? Thanks.", "Brad Dickerson", "Matt, this is Brad. I'm going to start that question and let Kevin follow up. But I think one of the things that is important, there's a lot of noise this time of year with the weather and so forth in the fourth quarter. I think it was important especially in Kevin's prepared remarks around the track work that we have had with 23 straight quarters above 20% growth. Then even in the fourth quarter in the last six years, a CAGR in the fourth quarter of about 32% growth. Then planning our business in 2016 at 25%.", "There was a lot of growth in a multitude of places. I think there's -- we have talked about this in the past too. I think there is a little bit of a danger in looking at some of the data sets that are out there, specifically a data set like SportScan. It can be challenging looking at our business relative to something like SportScan, where that data is only -- is capturing actually less than 40% of our business specifically in the fourth quarter. It is missing key data inputs like our direct-to-consumer business, our international business.", "It's actually extrapolating some of our key accounts that are pretty large, like the Dick's and the FootLocker. It obviously also includes accounts that we do not service. So utilizing that data as a proxy for our success especially in the fourth quarter, it can be a little bit challenged. As we've seen obviously because we posted another strong quarter, our apparel growing over 20%. So I just wanted to start that answer with, just let's be careful on some of what those data sets set there and understand how they relate to our business in particular.", "Kevin Plank", "I think it is important just to put some context. So let me just take a couple of minutes and address your question. So, let me begin with footwear, then I will do North America and then I will close with women's. So, I think the best place for us to start is about growth. It goes without saying, is that any of these questions come down to, what does our growth look like? In the fourth quarter with 31% growth and frankly, marketing our 23nd conservative quarter of 20% plus top-line revenue growth. Our growth story is strong.", "We remain a growth Company and none of that has wavered. But I also want to give you some context, beginning with footwear about just how our business has changed since really just 2012 and evolving into a true footwear brand. Remember 10 years ago, we celebrated or we went public. We hadn't even launched our first shoe until we launched football cleats in June of 2006. So, we've come a long way from there.", "So beginning with footwear, just going back to 2012 was 13% of our business. Since then, we have added, I don't know, over just a couple billion dollars of revenue. Today, footwear is nearly 17% of our business, representing a 42% CAGR over the last just few years. The diversity, again back in 2012, our mix of product was 33% of our footwear in 2012 was cleats. Cleats today are down to 22%, with plans of being the number one shoe in the market in football. I will get back to that in just a second.", "In my prepared remarks, I mentioned us doubling our running styles over $100. I just want to make for context -- I also talked about increasing over 1,000%. Across all of our footwear, we have more than tripled our footwear styles priced over $100, while quadrupling the volume. Like footwear for us couldn't be more in better position to be truly a premium footwear brand. The best way for me to articulate that, let me just talk about basketball for a second.", "First of all, we have the right athlete in Stephen Curry. He is, without question, the number one basketball player on the planet today. We've got the right product that's led by the Curry Two. To be clear, we launched the Curry One just a year ago at $120 price point. We then came back on a tour that we did with Stephen in the fall, in September and we launched the Curry Two at $130 price point. We've learned a tremendous amount over the last year of what we can do. Primarily, what we can do in signature basketball products and feel incredibly bullish about our ability to continue to raise ASPs going forward.", "In youth, we've heightened our focus to capture the next athlete, jogging a nearly 50% CAGR just since 2012 in youth footwear. Again, building out these departments, building out the teams has never been more important. Speaking of teams, we've more than doubled the size of our footwear team to nearly 230 people, including the recent addition of a dedicated women's team. I want to be clear, we didn't have a dedicated women's team in 2012, let alone 18 months ago.", "So we're certainly not done. We continue to build that team out and growing our presence in Portland with our new headquarters that will be opening soon. So these investments in our team, they all mean that these trends are expected to accelerate in 2016. Again, that is off a whopping 95% in the quarter and 57% for the full year.", "So some of the ways we expect to leverage that success. First, expanding Curry throughout the upcoming All-Star game, the playoffs, hopefully the finals and then the Olympics later this fall. Then ultimately, we will elevate even further when we launch the Curry Three later this year. We're also this year, going to be entering the golf category, with the most exciting player on the planet, as well as the number one player in the world in Jordan Spieth, where we have a new line of footwear that will be debuting around the Masters.", "In addition, we're going to be doubling our running styles prices over $100, led by Slingshot and Slingride, the net offerings that we have. In 2012, we had just one. Today, we will have more than eight over $100. We're also going to be doing things like debuting our first smart shoe, the Speedform Gemini 2 RE which means record equipped. That's going to be at $150 price point, a $20 premium to the standard $130 Gemini price point. Then as I mentioned a little bit earlier and back to our roots of success of Cam Newton, who will be playing next week in the Super Bowl, wearing the Highlight Cleat that depending on where you look is the number one selling cleat in America, at the highest price point, continuing to drive us toward becoming the number one America football cleat in the market.", "Again, a goal thought to be impossible back in 2006. So I want to say it's a small category. It's domestic only. Our brand, our presence, our ability to drive ASPs have never been stronger in North America. I believe that footwear is the best example we have of how we're truly just getting started.", "So let me take a second and just talk about North America. I want to level set the context of how our distribution is aligned. So often, we're compared to our competition. Well, our largest competitor in North America has approximately 24,000 points of distribution just in North America. At Under Armour, we have 11,000. We have the ability to expand that but we haven't. We have stayed committed to our sporting goods, to our mall, to our department stores channel. Again, this doesn't make going anywhere else impossible for us but it certainly makes it an opportunity particularly as we add things like the new merchandising team which just joined and frankly, were just input in Under Armour through 2015.", "To be clear, prior to 2015, we did not have a merchandising team. So our structure has changed and frankly, it has evolved. We talk about North American growth. In the third quarter in North America, we grew 25%. In the fourth quarter in North America, we grew 26%. I don't know if I would call that accelerating, but I would certainly call it strong. So the way this is happening, one simple word -- one simple phrase. When we innovate, we win.", "Bringing new technologies and styles in 2016, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, things like CoolSwitch and microthread in cooling. In the heating side, we have products like Reactor, a new price point that's at around $200, that complements our current -- some more current styles that we have. Also new product items like the Swacket which will elevate our fleece assortment. You'll start to see us move away from things like the big logo hoodie that's been very important to us.", "But again, you will continue to see us learn and you will continue to see us evolve to not just where the market is heading but most importantly, where we're taking the market to. As you think about North America, footwear is such an extraordinary opportunity for us. From the signature Curry products, to running, to kids, we had more styles at higher price points than ever before in 2015. That will absolutely be the case in 2016.", "We have also become the number one brand in many places. Most recently, where we took that title was at Sport Chek in Canada. So across apparel, footwear and accessories, we're the number one vendor for Sport Chek a very important sporting good accounts. We're closing on that in a majority -- in many of our other distributions. So premium storytelling -- this is not just lip service, that we're committed to our existing distribution, our existing base.", "So whether it's storytelling in the way we show off at retail in places like the Armory, with our partners at Champs or the blue-ship chip-shops that we're building at Dick's Sporting Goods, we're going to continue to make investments in premium brand statements with our partners. The way we can do this is that very well, the first handshake that we have with that consumer will more than likely be a digital handshake. Because across the Connected Fitness platform that we've implemented over the last 2.5 years, we now have more than 90 million domestic athletes amplifying our message and driving access to the brand.", "Finally, direct consumer. Unfortunately, this is an area that the market doesn't have purview to until we're able to tell you our numbers. It is the place though that we typically have the ability to tell our pinnacle brand stories. Beginning with e-commerce, meeting the consumer where they want to be met. Capitalizing on investments that we have made to leverage things like mobile trends which now was 50% of our fourth-quarter traffic. In terms of retail, we entered five new brand house stores in 2015. Again, I want to emphasize, we're a wholesale manufacturer, but we do have this direct consumer component that gives us, I think, a great complement to again meet the consumer where they want us.", "Adding five new brand house stores in 2015, with roughly five to as many as eight planned in 2016, including -- looking back at the year, we launched our 30,000 square foot flagship on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, that really I think is one of the best examples of our brand we have ever opened anywhere in the world.", "So to be clear about North America, we still see abundant opportunities across the continent. As we said at our Investor Day in September, we believe that we will double this business by 2018. We say all of this, recognizing and acknowledging, yes, we have poor set places, we can be better. We're certainly not perfect, but we're learning every day. We're putting the team in to make that happen. So we say all of this about our confidence, incredibly humbling as well is that we have work to be done.", "So finally, let me just addressed women's. This business, I want to be clear, is incredibly important to our accounts and it is important to us. While we believe we have huge opportunity to get better, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth in women's, now approaching $0.75 billion in revenue. So 2014 was the year that we defined and we described as the year of the women. We ignited this conversation on the marketing side with the female consumer, that is really taken the brand to a new level of engagement and expectation. We did that through people, through personalities, personalities like Misty and Gisele.", "But we also recognized that our product has got to meet that expectation. But what we learned is that she likes us. She wants to have a relationship with the Under Armour brand. So you have seen our product evolve. Just as importantly, in 2015 for us, you watched our team evolve, as we been investing in our foundation, been investing in our team. Not just any one individual but throughout our product creation engine, our merchandising teams and our new category management with our new leader in Pam Catlett that will be heading up our women's management, who brings over 20 years' experience in the business.", "This will all better enable us to create and deliver a 365 day a year experience for her. 2016 is about execution in both apparel and footwear. To be clear, we didn't even have a women's footwear team just a little more than a year ago. So building out these resources for us to really capitalize on the opportunity where she just like the men want to dress toe to head. So we expect to see improved merchandise assortments across our premium distribution. We also expect to continue to elevate our brand where women want us, in places like e-commerce.", "To be clear, on e-commerce, women's was our number one in largest selling and fastest-growing category that we had, faster than men's and faster than youth. So when we merchandise correctly, we believe we will win. Listen, we understand that her expectations are incredibly high for us. That is exactly where we want them to be. We firmly believe that our women's business should be, as we've said for a very long time, at least as large if not larger than our men's business. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Your line is open.", "Jim Duffy", "Chip, I look forward to working with you. A couple questions on the footwear business. First, as the business and key platforms gain scale, are you making progress on footwear margins? What does the arc of that curve look like? Then Kevin, can you maybe speak to the traction you're seeing with footwear in international markets?", "Brad Dickerson", "Perfect. Yes, Jim, on the footwear margins, yes, we're definitely seeing improvements in the footwear margins in general. Now, obviously even with those improvements, footwear margins are well below our apparel margins. We've talked about that consistently over the years. So we do anticipate still a lot of room on the footwear side, a lot of that will come from our ability to sell, again, more at premium pricing points specifically in categories like running and basketball which are historically, more our higher margin products.", "So as they become a bigger part of our portfolio that will help our margins from a mix perspective. We've put a lot of investment and energy into the sourcing side of our business and the development side of our business in footwear also. So we're seeing some benefit there on the costing side. I think, as Kevin talked about too, the ability to utilize the strength of our brand in these categories too from a pricing perspective. So we do see footwear margins, they have improved from the last few years to today.", "We see them improving in the next few years also. But again, I just want to caution that they will continue to be a lower than our overall apparel margins. That being said though, as we also talked about in the past, that you've got to keep in mind from an operating margin perspective, with the higher price points in footwear and higher ASPs in footwear compared to apparel, you do have the ability to lever SG&A a little bit better. So we do see in the long run, even though gross margins will improve in footwear, but will be below apparel that our operating margins in the longer run should look pretty similar to our apparel business.", "Kevin Plank", "Following up on that, we do see the ability to continue to drive ASPs and improve margin by a true premium product is the way that we will build it out. The one thing we have learned is, Malcolm Gladwell says, 10 years or 10,000 hours to perfect something. So I'm not sure that we've perfected footwear but we really feel strong about our position in the game right now. That begins of course I think with the athletes that make it real and that are winning in our footwear out on field, out on pitch, out on court.", "Whether it is Cam Newton -- what hopefully he'll do in football in the Super Bowl next week, Jordan Speith in golf or Stephan Curry in basketball, as you talk about international, we have no greater global ambassadors than the ones that we have there today. As recent as this past week, we also launched, Duane, The Rock, Johnson, that will be sporting Under Armour as his official brand of choice.", "So what we've built in footwear is impressive but again, we think we still have room to grow. But some of the franchises that we built from Highlight to Speedform to Gemini to Gemini Record, to the new Curry product, the Slingshot, the Bandit. I think we've done a great job of building, as I said, franchise businesses across the sports where we want to win. That typically begins in running and it begins in basketball.", "So we love our positioning there, as I mentioned, eight products above $100. Again, hitting some of those sweet spots for the right distribution that meets again the consumer where they want to be met. So I think we feel very bullish about what we're doing on the international front. Again, some of that evolution too, Jim, has been things like, we'd launch a product in the United States and then it was six months or a year later that we'd launch it on the global basis. So the ability to truly, with Charlie and the team that we have on the international side, of building and launching those things the way we did it, we have done -- I think, we've demonstrated our ability to do, has really evolved our Company.", "A great example again is last year, when I mentioned going on the Curry tour. The purpose of that tour was launching the Curry Two in China, almost six weeks ahead of when we launched it here in North America.", "So, I think that truly becoming a global business means not being a North American Company that sells things in other markets, but truly being a global business that has a global presence and a global position, that sells things at the same time equally. So we're evolving toward that, but we really like our progress and incredibly excited about where we're headed with it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad", "You kept mentioning premiumization, I think specifically to the footwear. Can you just dig a little bit deeper there and then talk about, does this translate over to apparel at some point and we start to see ASPs going up there? Brad, maybe you could comment on premiumization, maybe how it might flow through gross margin over time, especially if you look at gross margin excluding the mix shift drag and the FX drag? What are the really underlying gross margins going to do over time? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "So let me start it and then I'll let Brad finish up. So, first of all, on the apparel side is that, again, a majority of our business 70% plus of our business is still in apparel. So it is our focus. It's our largest team here. Frankly, it is where we have built our brand as innovators. So some of the things that I mentioned on the call, Reactors, Swacket, Cool Switch, some of the product that we have in the apparel offerings, all of that continued to support our existing ColdGear business. We effectively built the $25 price point for heat gear and the $50 price point for cold gear. Since then, we have been evolving those.", "So, as we look, we're a premium brand. One of the other things that I mentioned that, I can maybe go into a little more depth on is just our ability now to have merchandising. You asked about ASPs and price points, again, we didn't have a merchandising team in 2014. It was a category that we started building out for ourselves in 2015. So 2015 for us was about building the team. In 2016, it is about segmenting and playing it out in the market.", "What that means is, again, having the right product at the right place at the right time. Truly, having a team that isn't just selling the same styles to everyone on an equal basis, but being specific and differentiating between what we do in the mall versus what we do in the sporting goods, let alone what we do at Dick's Sporting Goods versus what we do in one of our other accounts. So we want to be incredibly thoughtful about that in the way we drive.", "As we look forward into 2017, we really see the ability to drive efficiency, of really looking at pricing, of really looking at the ability for us to maximize and optimize things like margin, but also again, making sure that it is with the right product and that it sells through. Because some of the things that we dealt with this year is bringing product in and having our floors set in time for January.", "No one can predict things like what happened in this fourth quarter, but I think one of the things we're most proud of is that in spite of what happens with weather, we still have a post of 31% top-line growth. So we would love that to see -- continue to translate and drive margin. It's one of our key barometers that we use here in the Company. I think frankly, as Brad will tell you right now, we're doing a good job and more importantly is the plan going forward, where we continue to drive and demonstrate that premium position in the marketplace.", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes, Omar, on the second part of your question on margins in general. Yes, you are correct. In 2015, that was probably really evident relative to my prepared remarks. When you look at 2015 gross margins going backwards, 90 basis points. The large majority of that, 70 basis points coming from foreign currency impact. A lot of other things going on in the rest of that 20 basis points, but the fact of the matter is, we had some pretty strong headwinds in 2015 relative to air freight, we were looking at servicing our customers during the year and the port disruption earlier in the year.", "Mix, we talked about a lot during the year, footwear, international working against us from a gross margin perspective pretty significantly. We were able to offset a lot of that just through our general increase in improvement in product margin specifically on the apparel side. So as you look forward in 2016 and beyond, you should see continued improvement in places like our footwear product margins, like in our apparel product margins, international even to some degree as we go forward should get better as the businesses in countries we do directly, whether it is through our DTC or through wholesale become a larger part of our share versus some of the distributors we do today.", "So, I think in all aspects of our business, you will see that improve over time. Mix will definitely work against us because these businesses are still footwear international, still lower margin businesses. But to your point, our ability to improve those margins is great. Our ability to improve margins in apparel is not only possible but it is happening right now as we speak.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Kate McShane", "A quick question, not to harp on weather, but I just wondered if you could give a little bit more detail about how you were able to mitigate some of the risk from the warmer weather? How you are going to be liquidating some of the inventory going into the first half? If there are any plans going forward about how to better, again, mitigate inventory risk from adverse one-time type events?", "Brad Dickerson", "Yes. Kate, this question has come up a lot over the last few years in the fourth quarter specifically on weather. We have had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth. Our answer is pretty consistent. Over the last few years, there's obviously going to be a little bit of an impact in weather, there's no doubt about that. It impacts our business too. We've said in the last few years, there's probably a couple percentage points of growth impact relative to weather specifically, one way or the other whether it is warm or cold.", "In fact, there is no doubt in the fourth quarter this year we had a little bit of that impact. We talked about the fact of managing our way through that and liquidating some excess inventory and taking care of that also in the front half of next year, specifically in the first quarter. But overall, from a top-line perspective, it is really only a couple percentage points of growth one way or the other probably. That again, when you look at specifically this fourth quarter, that was more of a North America dynamic.", "Places where you would see it probably impact us the most would be our North America wholesale apparel business and our factory house business. But again, with the diversity of our product lines in apparel, with footwear's strong growth, international's strong growth, there is just much more going on in our business that offset some of those weather impacts which again are probably a couple percentage points of growth one way or the other.", "So going forward, I think continuously being careful how we plan Q3 and to specifically Q4 in years. Not being overly optimistic on weather but being prudent and putting ourselves in the position to be opportunistic if weather behaves for us, I think is really important. To the same extent, if weather doesn't behave, it will impact us a little bit. We can manage our way through that specifically with the strong factory house channel we have.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Kevin Plank for any closing comments.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Thank you all for your questions today and for the opportunity to tell our story. Again, we're incredibly proud of the Company that has been built and most importantly the people that have built it. So first of all, I want to welcome Chip, someone who went to high school less than five miles from here. So I want to welcome him home and college less than 30 miles from here. So, it is great to have Chip back in Maryland. He spent a long time on the other coast. Getting him back to the East is going to be great and what we have going forward.", "I also want to take a minute and I want to thank Brad for 11 great years together, an incredible run that we've built as a Company and most importantly as a team. So you'll be missed here. Again, we wish you the very best in your next endeavor. So I want to thank the market for all the support of myself, Brad, our team and the future support we're counting on for Chip. We'll still be here running forward. So thank you all very much. We wish you all a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.", "I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call to Ms. Carrie Gillard. You may begin.", "Carrie Gillard - Director, Investor Relations, Under Armour, Inc.", "Thanks and good morning to everyone joining us on today's second quarter conference call. During the course of this call we'll be making projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release and in the risk factors section of our filings with the SEC.

After the prepared remarks, Kevin and Chip, along with our Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Dave Bergman, will be available for a Q&A session that will end at approximately 9:30 a.m. Finally, a replay of this teleconference will be available at our website at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Carrie, and first of all, congratulations on your new role. Most of you already know Carrie who's been part of our IR team here at Under Armour for over four years. I'm excited that she has taken this leadership role and I'm pleased to introduce you to those in the UA investment community who you have not yet met. That'll change quickly.", "Carrie is the best person to both tell the Under Armour story and keep our strong shareholder base informed on our business. Congratulations again, Carrie, on this new role for you.", "Now, good morning, everyone. Under Armour is a growth company. The dictionary defines opportunity as a chance for advancement or success and the business of sports provides us with abundant moments where our brand can stand apart among our consumers. But there are times, like now, when this power of sport reaches monumental level, and we find ourselves right now in the midst of a 60-day period where sport transcends its normal place in the conversation.", "Starting back in June with the NBA Finals, the Copa America and the Euro Champs in global football, the U.S. and British Open in golf, the MLB All-Star Game and Wimbledon, and in a few weeks we'll have the global spectacle of the Summer Olympics. Each of those moments provides opportunities for our consumers to experience the emotion and thrill of sports and for the apparel and footwear we make to shine on a global stage. Whether it's Stephen Curry receiving his second MVP and being named the first unanimous MVP in the NBA; Andy Murray taking the Wimbledon crowd in front of the home crowd in London; or Michael Phelps in the U.S. gymnastics team preparing for the Olympic spotlight in Rio next month, these athletes have helped Under Armour achieve a new level of awareness and demand.", "So, as we grow within both our core apparel and footwear businesses, we have steadily and strategically expanded our distribution to reach more athletes who are demanding our brand. We remain focused on helping the world's elite athletes perform at their very best. But our mission is broader, to make all athletes better. So this morning, I want to talk about some of the strategic steps we are taking to reach more athletes in three key areas; channels, categories, and geographies.", "Our second quarter results are strong evidence that demand for Under Armour has never been higher. Total revenues grew 28% with our apparel business up over 19%, footwear up 58%, and international up 68%.", "Chip is going to take you through the key drivers of those growth numbers in a bit, but I want to map out some of the opportunities we're executing against to widen the playing field in terms of access to our brand.", "We have built our business over the past 20 years through great retail partnerships within the sporting goods channel with partners like Dick's Sporting Goods and Academy, and in department stores and malls with partners like Macy's, Foot Locker, Champs and Finish Line. The authenticity we've gained with consumers through those partnerships has helped us become who we are today and positioned us to bring Under Armour to an even broader set of consumers. What you'll be seeing over the next 12 months to 18 months in terms of expanding that consumer access is part of a measured effort to widen the playing field, with each element having been in the works for at least 18 months and in some cases even much longer.", "The first adjacency is UAS, Under Armour Sportswear. The first products from the line will be available this September. UAS is not just a category play or a distribution play, it's about bringing a new consumer into the Under Armour brand. UAS will bring a young, fresh and modern voice to sportswear and reflects the insights we've gained as a performance brand now applied to the everyday wardrobe. This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market. Consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional but is fully executed through fit and style. We don't believe that Under Armour technology should be exclusively for on field. We don't see it as an either/or thing. UAS is forged from the field and built for life.", "Last month, we announced the hiring of Tim Coppens as Executive Creative Director of UAS. Tim's reputation in the fashion world is compelling with his existing line already carried in premium retail like Barneys. UAS will have a narrow range of distribution available in new premium retail as well as a limited range of boutique doors. But UAS is a business that's built for the mobile native consumer. So while we're partnering with select, high-end wholesale partners to showcase a best-in-class expression of the collection, the launch of UAS is predominantly a DTC offering. This initiative represents an ambitious step for our brand and provides a great amount of daylight between it and our existing product range.", "The next step in our strategy to reach new consumers is the partnership we're announcing today that will bring the Under Armour brand to Kohl's starting in 2017. One of the top retailers of activewear in the U.S., Kohl's has a large and loyal consumer base, the majority of which are women shoppers. This decision to reach new consumer through Kohl's is not a channel consideration but a consumer consideration. We want to reach our consumer where they expect to find Under Armour product, and we'll continue to partner with the retailers that provide us the opportunity to showcase the Under Armour brand.", "Great brands are iconic and inspirational storytellers, especially where product meets the consumer. For Under Armour, an important piece of that story is the retail experience we create and drive with our own brand houses. Now, I am incredibly excited to announce today the newest location, the former FAO Schwarz space on Fifth Avenue at the base of the GM Building in New York City. The approximately 53,000 square foot space is one of the most recognized and high-traffic areas in all of New York, and our plan is to build the most breathtaking and exciting consumer experience ever conceived at retail.", "So, in addition to using landmark retail space to help tell the Under Armour story, we are equally focused on creating the best mobile shopping experience as the consumer continues to move to device-based purchasing. Last month we introduced the UA Shop app. It's a way to better navigate shopping for our products through our Connected Fitness platform. With consumers spending 85% of their time on mobile devices in an app, we want to better use the new oil that is data to refine and recommend products based on your activities. We believe this will help drive more frequent shopping, bigger baskets and better conversion throughout the platform.", "Shifting the growth story now from distribution to categories, we've been capturing new basketball consumers almost by the hour with our signature Stephen Curry footwear. Sales of Curry footwear have been extremely strong, and with the Curry 3 coming this fall, we are anticipating our business will continue to post incredible growth. Many of these new UA consumers are finding the brand in Foot Locker doors, especially at Kids Foot Locker, not surprising given Stephen's growing popularity with the younger generation. So while the numbers he is putting up for Under Armour are record setting, we continue to be blown away by what Stephen has accomplished and incredibly excited for what is to come for both of us as a result.", "The third area of powerful growth is in our geographies and specifically in greater China. Our team continues to drive great revenue increases, especially in eCommerce, with year-to-date revenues up 157%. Our growth is driven by consistently being viewed as performance by the Chinese consumer, who actually refers to us as the professional brand. We're accomplishing this through premium brand houses and a full-price business model focused on basketball, running and training. Amid increasing support for sport by the government, the Chinese consumer is getting more serious about training. Our women's business in China continues to over deliver against our plan, with women's apparel currently 34% of total apparel revenues, up from 24% just last year and our men's and women's running businesses combined has more than doubled compared to last year.", "And not surprisingly, Stephen Curry's growing global awareness continues to help drive our business in greater China. The social media impressions for Stephen during the NBA playoff reached over 2.7 million during that time. It helped drive extremely high sell-through rates in the Curry 2 throughout the first six months, making it our top-selling item in China year-to-date.", "This is a great example of what the opportunity and what the future looks like for UA in greater China, great product and great marketing that is laser-focused on the consumer combined with the hottest athlete in the NBA. We're planning our second tour of China with Stephen later this summer and remain incredibly bullish about the future for both Stephen and our brand.", "One of the key vehicles for our dialogue with consumers is our Connected Fitness platform, and we continue to make great strides in delivering insights that make athletes better. With a growing community that's now over 175 million registered users, with continuing over 100,000 users signing up each and every day, we are learning more about our consumer every single day.", "Mike Lee, the founder of MyFitnessPal, who joined us in early 2015, is now leading our strategic vision for the Connected Fitness business, and our team is becoming more knowledgeable every day about our consumer. With areas like sales, merchandising and product innovation now utilizing single view of the consumer, we are just getting started at implementing these powerful insights to drive every aspect of our business.", "Some small but important wins for the brand have been our ability to, number one, quickly tailor our communications and content to our consumer based on their activities, giving us the opportunity to tweak our product mix and to get it more precise to the consumer showing up at our stores.", "Secondly, utilizing the data to create a heat map of run activity around a consumer's location, just a drop of what's to come in terms of personalization.", "I mentioned up front that this 60-day window of global sports activity culminates next month with the Olympics in Rio. Our presence will be significantly higher than it was in London in 2012, with four times as many athletes representing national governing bodies from more than 30 different countries competing in Under Armour apparel or footwear, and in some cases, utilizing our great Connected Fitness platform to measure their performance.", "In addition, we sponsored some of the visible icons in Rio like Michael Phelps, recent Wimbledon champ, Andy Murray, and the U.S. gymnastics team. We also have a great story in Olympic gold medal winner, Natasha Hastings, who will be running the 400 this summer in Under Armour footwear.", "In Europe, we're making some great strides in Global Football as well with Tottenham Hotspur qualifying for Champions League play this coming season, and our new signing, Southampton, who'll be playing Europa League football in their first season in UA kit next month.", "We also announced that one of England's storied clubs, Aston Villa, will be wearing Under Armour when the season kicks off in August, and we will have another high-profile player, Granit Xhaka, in our boots when the EPL season starts. In one of the largest transfers in club history, he joined Arsenal Football Club and last month went on to lead his national team, Switzerland, to the round of 16 at Euro this year.", "The great news is that our marketing efforts are paying off in the UK, where revenues more than doubled in Q2 year over year. I should add, the UK is far and away our largest market in Europe, so we're driving awareness to the places that move the needle for our business.", "Driving brand awareness where we can benefit most is a key initiative for us, and here in North America we've been most challenged from a regional standpoint on the West Coast. That's critical for us because if California were a country, it would have the sixth largest GDP in the world with roughly 12% of the United States population.", "We recently signed two sports marketing deals with great iconic brands in key North American geographies, specifically Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Bringing both the UCLA and Cal Berkeley athletic programs into the Under Armour family raises the profile in California that we already have through great partners in sporting goods, mall, as well as existing and even new department store partners like Kohl's, which has over a 100 stores in California. This is a great example of how we are thinking all the way through, all the assets that we could bring to bear to get after the opportunity in that very, very key market.", "When we add Cal Berkeley to the existing assets that we already have in the San Francisco area like Stephen Curry, Buster Posey and one of our Connected Fitness offices with over a 100 employees and growing, you can see how we're planning for the long runway of growth that exists for the Under Armour brand.", "And in UCLA, we are partnering with one of the most recognizable brands in college sports, not only the alma mater of the great Jackie Robinson, but the school with more championships than any other in the history of NCAA. UCLA has won a total of 113 national team championships, including 11 in basketball, more than any other school.", "So, as you've heard me say consistently for over 10 years now as a public company, Under Armour is a growth company. Now more than ever, we appreciate the challenge of growth and believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand our access to more consumers around the world, and that's what makes us extremely proud of our record of 25 consecutive quarters of 20% plus revenue growth.", "Fortunately, our formula is well defined. We will maintain our long-term vision of making all athletes better and continually approve on our execution of strategy around channels, categories and geographies.", "With that, I'll pass it over to Chip. Chip?", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time on reviewing our second quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. Our revenues for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% to $1 billion. As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the retail landscape, the consistent growth across our diverse product lines and channels delivered another quarter of strong results.", "During the second quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 27% to $635 million. Our direct-to-consumer revenues grew 28% to $321 million, representing approximately 32% of total revenues for the quarter. During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 16% to $21 million, and Connected Fitness revenues grew 73% to $23 million.", "On the product category front, apparel revenues grew 19% to $613 million compared to $515 million in the prior year's quarter, led by many of the same factors as the first quarter, as we continue to see new innovation platforms like Micro Fit gain momentum in key categories like running as well as continued growth in men's training, women's training and golf.", "Second quarter footwear revenues increased 58% to $243 million from $154 million in the prior year's quarter. Our basketball category, led by the Curry signature basketball line posted another quarter of strong growth. Beyond basketball, we continue to make strong gains in our running and cleated products within our golf and team sports categories, as we remain focused on providing premium, pinnacle products for our customers in more styles and price points than ever before.", "Our accessories revenues during the second quarter increased 21% to $101 million from $83 million in the prior-year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of bags and headwear. On a regional basis, North American revenues in the second quarter increased 22% to $827 million compared to $681 million during the same period last year.", "Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 160 company-owned stores, comprised of 146 Factory House stores and 14 Brand House stores.", "International revenues increased 68% to $150 million in the second quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenues increased 72%. Within our international wholesale business, the store count at the end of the quarter included 239 partner stores. Within our direct-to-consumer business, our company-owned international store count at the end of the quarter included 52 stores, comprised of 26 Factory House stores and 26 Brand House stores.", "Looking at our international regions, starting with the EMEA, we continue to grow our presence within key sporting goods accounts and expand our direct-to-consumer business with second quarter openings of new Factory House stores in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In the Asia-Pacific region, we now have more than 230 stores comprised of both owned and partner stores, as we look to continue to drive our premium positioning as the performance brand in the market. And in Latin America, we remain focused on building and expanding our distribution.", "Moving on to margins, second quarter gross margins decreased 70 basis points to 47.7% compared to 48.4% in the prior year's period. Sales mix negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately 130 basis points, primarily driven by the continued strength of our footwear and international growth. Partially offsetting this negative impact were continued favorable product margins, benefiting gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 32% to $458 million, which includes the previously-announced impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation compared to $347 million during the second quarter of last year. In addition to the impairment, growth was predominantly driven by investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses, both retail and eCommerce and overall head count to support our growth and strategic initiatives, such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 20% for the quarter.", "Operating income for the second quarter decreased 39% to $19 million compared with $32 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the $23 million impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation.", "Interest expense for the second quarter increased to approximately $6 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year's period. Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $3 million versus a slight gain in the prior-year period. This loss was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the company tax rate in the second quarter was 40.5% compared to 46.7% in the prior year, largely due to a one-time tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions.", "Our second quarter net income decreased 58% to $6 million compared to $15 million in the prior-year period.", "In the second quarter, we completed a $59 million one-time stock dividend to our Class C shareholders related to our shareholder litigation, which resulted in a different earnings per share calculation for the quarter for our Class A and B stock as compared to our Class C stock. The dividend was allocated only to our Class C shareholders, resulting in a different numerator when calculating EPS for the Class C stock. Our earnings release included a non-GAAP presentation of EPS backing out the impact of the dividend. This is a one-time event and will only cause a difference in earnings per share for the three classes of stock for this quarter and year-end.", "On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $121 million compared with $171 million at June 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 30% to $1.1 billion compared to $837 million at June 30, 2015. As we noted last quarter, we are beginning to anniversary the strategic inventory investments that we implemented in the second quarter of last year and expect the growth in inventory to remain relatively in line with sales throughout the remainder of the year. Total debt increased to $1.2 billion as compared to $712 million at June 30, 2015.", "During the quarter we completed our first public bond offering of a $600 million investment-grade notes, which was well received in the market. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver borrowings.", "Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was $149 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year's period.

Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%.", "Gross margins for the full year are expected to be down slightly compared to last year, and based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is still expected to grow approximately 28%, as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success.", "Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $32 million in 2016. In addition, we now expect a full-year tax rate of approximately 36.5% and fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 448 million.", "For the third quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20% as we begin to lap our strategies to better service our customers and as we navigate through the impact of the Sports Authority liquidation. In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to decline slightly compared to the prior year. For the third quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $180 million to $185 million, representing 5% to 8% growth versus the prior year.", "We'd now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings quarter, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two per person, so we can get to as many of you as possible.", "Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Quick technical question. On the Kohl's announcement, I know you said 2017. Any of this \u2013 is that \u2013 do any of the shipments come this year or does it really all start \u2013 the shipments start next year? I just wanted to make sure we're understanding the timing of when that rolls out.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Some of that'll be a little bit of mix, but we're looking to be set by the time they start their first quarter. So, you'll see nothing out of the ordinary or extraordinary, but this is a 2017 initiative for the brand.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Cool. Thanks. And then on the Sportswear piece, I thought it was an interesting hire as well for that. Can you let talk a little bit about the styling, the aesthetic? You kind of mentioned, Kevin, there's a big amount of daylight between what the Sportswear is going to be and the kind of current offering. Help us think through how that product is going to look and feel and be different than the rest of the offering? What are the key kind of value-added components to it?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well first off, it began with the consumer. I think people are asking and trying to figure out how to wear the brand beyond the pitch, the field, the court. We've just seen that over and over and over again. And when we look at the market opportunity, our two competitors claim that their sportswear businesses are somewhere between 20% to 30%, so the aggregate number there is roughly $50 billion, so we assume there's about a $15 billion market opportunity that today Under Armour is playing just a few percentage points for overall growth. So, we think there's a massive opportunity, there's massive appetite for those in our space to really be effective in sportswear.", "We also recognize that I think there's a shift that's happening in the consumer workplace right now, and I don't know how many people in the call have people in their offices that are wearing suits and ties. And so there's this massive shift to casual and comfortable, and I think what we've done to establish our brand is that our shirts aren't just \u2013 they don't just look great, but they actually do something.", "And so whether that's wicking, moisture management, stretch, washability, all the things that I think more practical than the way we frankly have dressed ourselves to this date. So I think our taking advantage of that opportunity and that shift is very, very important for us.", "And the way we want to do it is a couple of ways because what UA Sportswear is meant to be is more like a flag in the ground that's placed out there, and we think there's frankly a little bit of room for us to fill in over time between where we're going with that flag and where we are today.", "And so it'll be a bit of an evolution. You'll see that, number one, through things that are branded UAS or Sportswear, and you'll also see us being more aggressive with some lines that we have in some of our more proactive and aggressive retailers as well. So, the lines you'll see us at Foot Locker and things that are more street-ready wear, as well as things we'll be doing in our traditional sporting goods distribution.", "So we see styling in the company being more important. Of course we're not going to give up on what we've done to establish ourselves as authentic and on-field, on-court, et cetera, but we do see there's an opportunity for us, for kids not just to wear us when they're playing sports, but to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions.", "So, getting Tim Coppens on board is a big deal. He is a big deal, and with it we're creating this \u2013 we're moving to the sport category focus. We actually have nine or 10 divisions now. Sportswear is going to be one of them, and very important to us, headed by a guy named Ben Pruess, who is an industry veteran and someone who knows how to do it.", "And this is also answering just the signature athlete lines that we've had. All of a sudden, we woke up one day and we recognized that we had athletes like Stephen and Jordan and Cam and Tom and all these household names, and what are we really doing to leverage this? So we think there's a bigger opportunity on the signature side. We think there's a specific opportunity in sportswear that we can play in, and we think, A, we can take market share as well as the ability for us to grow that what we think is somewhere about a $15 billion pie today, as we think about it, at least.", "So we think there's \u2013 we're really excited about it and frankly I'm sitting here wearing Under Armour Sportswear today, and I think I look great. Working on it.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Do you think the logo will be a big part of it, Kevin, or is it really more about the materials, the technical performance with a street look?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think the story is going to be the biggest part of it, meaning that everything does something. So we're not just going to start making stylish clothes, they have to be stylish clothes that do something. You'll see some of the features, whether it's a button-down that actually has a sleeve that has a spandex in it or elastic in it, so you can pull your sleeves up without having to fold them, a bit more ready-wear, wash-ability, but everything will have the Under Armour DNA in it. That's most important. Whether it is stain resistance, or waterproof or some of the other things you'd expect from us. A little more stylish.", "You'll see the branding, and I think, what I'd challenge the team to do is, lean on the brand when you need to. And the first reaction is that, we don't need the branding anywhere, but I think the consumer \u2013 again, this will be a journey, and as we get there, you'll see the brand.", "But the UAS will have its own unique distinctive brand, and from time-to-time, particularly in things like the footwear, you'll see some more starting use of the logo. But the logo will be on every piece just whether it's on the inside of the collar or the outside of the collar is bit of a question.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks. That's really helpful.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Omar.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Kevin, just a follow-up on Kohl's; I was wondering if you can maybe discuss your product segmentation strategy as you think about entering new channels such as Kohl's? And thinking about addressing the women's category more broadly, what other distribution points or channels or other ways can you reach women that you're currently not in today? Thank you.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, women is a great \u2013 it's a great segue for that. But I want to be clear, as we talk about Kohl's, first and foremost, we have an amazing distribution group of partners that have enabled us to get to this point. And I think we've been incredibly prudent with the way that we've rolled out our distribution. It has been thoughtful, it has been patient, it has been 20 years in the making. And I want everyone to know that, first of all, Kohl's is \u2013 there's nothing reactionary about Kohl's. This is a proactive move for us that has been in the work for the last several years. And you're right, the thing that allows us to be in this position is that we have built a merchandising expertise in the building that frankly, really just a couple of years ago we didn't exactly have, not specifically.", "The goal and the role of merchandising when we brought Kevin Eskridge, who heads up our merchandising now back from China and gave him that task for us more than a year ago, it has us really in this position that we think we're ready for it in 2017. And so we're very thoughtful about our existing distribution, because the differentiation in the lines is critical. Number one, as we become more expert at differentiating within channels, so differentiating our existing retailers as well as between within their own partners, as well as we look at between the mall, between department stores and between sporting goods. And so we think Kohl's is a great evolution for us. We think that the female consumer that she's there, she's shopping and she's buying. We think there's a big opportunity.", "But at the end of the day we think, again, as I said in my comments, this is a consumer decision. It's not really a channel decision. We believe that there's a massive opportunity with the consumer that's walking into those stores and looking for the Under Armour brand. And frankly they just haven't been able to find it. And so we think we'll continue to have the elevated product in there.", "The goal is that from a price point standpoint we continue to \u2013 we'll, of course, be aggressive, but we think that there's a consumer that's looking for our brand and we think there's a great market opportunity. And we don't anticipate a big impact to the balance of our other businesses because of the merchandising time and effort and energy that we put in. So, we think we're ready for this moment and we're incredibly excited about it, but again, this is just another part \u2013 one of the single chapters in our larger growth story.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good, thanks, Camilo.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "So, following up on the Kohl's topic, Kevin, I wanted to get your sense to, does this expansion into Kohl's allow you to expand your product offering in pre-existing department store relationships? Previously you've been pretty measured in how you've assorted those stores like at Macy's and Belk and some of the other, Lord & Taylor sort of relationships. So I'm curious to know all the segmentation work that you've done for Kohl's, does this offer an opportunity to equally expand your presence in your pre-existing relationships?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think one thing we have done in the last year is we've added over 200 women shops within our existing department store distribution. So I don't know if it's new doors as much as it is new opportunity. When we give door counts 11,000 in North America, I think a lot of times the saturation level is a bit misunderstood with how we fare against, say, our competition. So we do believe, when we talk about North America, we're bullish on North America. We continue to see opportunity and expansion within existing doors and that's a story that we see, of course, in apparel. But frankly, when we look at things like footwear, we're barely scratching the surface there. So we see really great, great opportunity for us.", "And as we think about distribution for us, across all of our channels, all of our partners, all of our \u2013 everywhere we do business, our job is to be important as an iconic brand. And when I say that, that really speaks I think, talking about the things we're opening in the future, and again this won't be for a couple of years, but taking over the space, the old FAO Schwarz space at Fifth Avenue, I think it's definitive of the brand that we expect to be for consumers, creating environments that are unique and unlike anything else that anyone has ever seen or experienced before.", "So I think as we think about what defines the brand, our job is to be iconic, and the consumer's going to have places where they choose to interact with our brand, where they choose to purchase our brand. Our job is to meet them at that transaction. And one thing we know is certain, particularly we've learned over the last 12 months or even shorter than that is that moment in time, that place will always be shifting. And so we need to be ready for that. We need to be prepared for that.", "We certainly don't want to limit the opportunity that we have, and we feel pretty good about the way that we're set up with some of the new announcements that we're making today. And be it a Kohl's or be it talking about something like Fifth Avenue and frankly, not to be forgotten, this is the continued double down that we continue to do in our existing distribution from sporting goods to the mall to department stores.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. And then just to understand a little bit about the pace, can you just talk about \u2013 are you going to be in all doors in Q1, or is there going to be more of a measured rollout? And I'm assuming that it's apparel then footwear, so is there any sort of margin implication as we should think about that new department store channel coming online?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll be in about 600 doors or so to kick things off, and then beyond that...", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're not going to see any margin implications.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "You shouldn't see any margin because the mix is generally going to be in line with the mix of the company.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Understand. All the best, guys. Thanks.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. Kevin, can you talk about athletic inventory in the channel today? It sounds like inventory for you guys will be in line with sales by the end of this quarter. Nike expects to be clean by August. I guess are you comfortable with the promotional backdrop you see out there today? And then larger picture, what would you say to those calling for a top in the athletic cycle out there?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'm not going to say I'm comfortable with the promotion out there in the market today, but I don't know if that's different than what we've seen in the last several years either. I mean when you look at holiday these days, it's an incredibly \u2013 it is promotional environment out there.", "And so what we all have found is the barbell effect continues to really accentuate itself with either going to one or two extremes; either, A, the consumer chasing price, and you'll see that with obviously some of the digital pure plays out there, or you'll see it with \u2013 or people finding that at retail or they're chasing premium, they're chasing brand. And so we of course expect to be on the right side of that barbell, and I think we've continued to define that for the consumer as to where they find us.", "I don't think it's a top out, I think there's a shift happening. I think the way the people are dressing is changing, and it's altering. And so I don't know if it'll be as extreme as just women's buying black tights and whether people can make a career out of that, and obviously there have been a lot of people jumping in the boat on women's, specifically in the athleisure trend.", "But the good news is that we're not grounded in trend, we're grounded in sport. That'll keep us here, and the trends will come and go. But we're also watching our core base continue to grow for us as well.", "We see women's as a burgeoning opportunity for us, and one thing I just want to be clear about our women's business, I think people look and say, are we taking enough advance? Are we taking the opportunity? We've done some great things in the women's space, beginning with the fact that this year we're going to hit a massive milestone.", "We have a billion dollar women's business. Just our women's business alone, a $1 billion this year, and to be clear, that is primarily women's apparel. So, just a few things about our women's is as I mentioned going to the sport category, women's is going to be specifically one of those sport categories, and of course they'll be involved across the other nine categories directly. But we need a driver for that. We want a leader for that, so we hired industry veteran Pam Catlett, who has been here about six months and really doing a terrific job just coordinating the pieces and applying merchandising and marketing and product and sales and really getting everybody on one page is, because what we recognize is that we are competing against people that are only in the women's space, there's a bigger opportunity for us there.", "And so we feel like we're incredibly well-positioned right now, and I mentioned apparel, but I'd be remiss if I just didn't give you a sort of climb into the women's conversation here. Just talking about women's footwear, so much of our business is that we are a young business. While we turned 20 this year, and we're incredibly proud of that milestone as a company, we are really just getting started when you look at the things that we're doing.", "I mean women's footwear is a great example, and I say this and I'm not proud of it but just \u2013 not even two years ago, the same person who handled women's for us also handled our outlet merchandising supply as well as our Youth. It was one person. She was incredible, and she did an amazing herculean job, but if you look at any of our competitors, there's probably 60, 80 to 100 people that would have those three collective jobs.", "So since that time, we've actually split them off. Our women's today, we've got roughly half a dozen people in our women's footwear team, and the fact is we need about 20. And so we're in investment mode, but what you'll see is that first line from that women's footwear team will be delivering in spring of 2017.", "And so, I don't know if people have seen the best stroke from Under Armour yet from a women's standpoint, but what we can tell you is we're incredibly proud of the points we put on the board. And that's echoed by the sheer size and scale of that billion dollar women's business. But what you will see is you'll see a continued concerted effort for us to be premium and for us to be number one in women's. And we're proud of what we've done, but there's meat on the bone and we expect to go attack it.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just a follow up; on gross margins, your guidance for this year implies material expansion in the fourth quarter. Could you just walk through some of the drivers of the inflection in the fourth quarter? And then as we move to next year, is it fair to think about a return to expansion of gross margin? Any help on the near term and multiyear puts and takes on gross margin would help.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Matthew. This is Chip. So I'd think about it more in the medium to long-term is we are going have a headwind called mix in front of us. As we continue to outgrow our business in footwear and we continue to grow internationally at an accelerated pace, that is a headwind. On the flip side, it's our job to improve the cost side of the house and bring product to the table so that we can offset that headwind. So I think in the longer term, that's our job, and we're probably looking at a push. In the near term, as it relates to this year, we are looking at some meaningful impact in Q4. We have less of a mix challenge as the year progresses, and we will see notable improvements in the actual product margins in Q4 and anniversarying a negative number last year.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Best of luck, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the North American wholesale business. And maybe you could give us an update on how you're thinking now that we've moved a little bit further in the year, how the Sports Authority dynamic is going to affect your sales for the year. If there was any change to your thinking on actual dollar impact, reverse cannibalization and the timing of that?", "And my second question is on looking at North American operating profit for the quarter, which was relatively flat despite pretty good sales growth, and how we should be thinking about incremental margins for that division across the year?", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "It's Chip. On the TSA side, so the TSA, we did ship product in the first quarter and the second quarter to TSA. It is in fact predominantly in the back half of the year. It is about 300 basis points to 400 basis points of our growth in the back half of the year without shipping to TSA. We have made up some of that, but not all of it.", "And then as it relates to North America, when you're looking at the segment, there have been some costs that have moved from Connected Fitness. There were head count costs on the marketing side of the house for Connected Fitness that are more for the overall North America segment or all-in segment, and those costs have shifted \u2013 approximately $5 million have shifted from Connected Fitness to North America. So that's why that segment looks that way.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's an annualized number for Connected Fitness?", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Two, Dave?", "David Bergman - Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance", "That was Q2. The $5 million relates to the Q2 impact this year versus last year.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And how should we be thinking about the margin drivers for North America for the second half of the year?", "David Bergman - Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance", "Well, for the second half of the year, the margin drivers I would go just at the corporate level, since North America is predominantly our business. So in the back half of the year, you're going to look at the third quarter, we're probably going to be slightly down again. And then in the fourth quarter, we'll see some material impact. Mix is a challenge throughout the year, with \u2013 once again, with footwear growing at 2x apparel, you have higher margins there. That's going to be a challenge. But then, on the product side, we're going to see improvements on the product side, which should help the margins product cost side, especially in Q4.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Robbie.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Kevin, I was hoping you could talk a little more about China. It sounds like things couldn't be going better for the brand. Can you guys talk about the outlook for store growth and maybe accelerating it?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, of course. So China, as we think about the opportunities we have, we've got about \u2013 opening over 150 owned partner stores in 2016 as we look at it. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. So we feel like we found a really \u2013 it's an interesting model. And as you look at the way they do it in China, you're either, A, going with a partner or you're effectively \u2013 you're running space like a landlord in a larger department store. So China, for us, is something \u2013 just recounting some of the history, we spent a long time trying to figure it out. We started manufacturing there in 2000 and we started selling there in 2010, where we did $1 million, $1.2 million or $1.3 million out of one store. By 2012, that was $3 million, and then we really amplified it by, I think, bringing in great senior leadership and really defining a point of view for ourselves in the market. And from $3 million in 2012 to $7 million in 2013, to $30 million in 2014, to $80 million in 2015 to this year, we're looking at north of $150 million business. And so, really, we're seeing that inflection point for the brand in China.", "We have great leadership on the ground over there. We have seasoned leadership on the ground. Our office, our headquarters in Shanghai. And we think there's a really good momentum. We're going to be following up on some of that momentum at the end of next month or the beginning of September with another Stephen Curry tour that we'll be taking through Asia. And really, it's a bigger story than just Stephen. I mean, again, as I said in my comments, Under Armour is known as the professional brand in China. So grounding ourselves in authenticity is one of the formulas in any market we've gone to around the world. We found where it really is required for us to win. It's beginning with that authentic approach, having the consumers see us there, start really at the tip of the spear, and then, really creating a bit of that trickle down.", "So, I think we're getting some of that net effect, and then you add in some of the star power with some of our global superstars, and whether it's this month being able to highlight Michael Phelps, whether it is what we're doing with Jordan or Stephen, but the brand is definitely known in China. We're not as famous as we will be, but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made and big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution.", "And the other thing is our eCommerce over there. Our eCommerce in China has basically exploded for us as well. And so this is not just a bricks-and-mortar story. And frankly, China may actually end up being the palette that we're able to write the script of what is that balance. Because I think, one of the questions that everybody is having in this space right now is, where \u2013 some of our competitors specifically, they talk about the power of their growth in terms of the number of retail stores. I think that's one indicator for it, but I'm not sure that all the retail stores that are open today are going to be open in the future.", "And so, I know the best ones will survive, and we think that eCommerce can be a great supplement to that. And so, we're pretty bullish on China, and I'm looking forward to that second Stephen Curry tour in a few weeks.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That sounds great. Thanks very much.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Robby.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the New York City store, just in terms of when it opens, and also just since it is a fairly expensive real estate and there'll be remodeling, how long will you be paying rent and investing in the building before the store opens?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So thanks, Kate. We expect to be in somewhere around 2019, end of 2018, beginning to the middle. So it's a little unclear, but we've been open with the landlord. But probably by the middle of 2019 at the latest, in doing that they've got \u2013 someone else is going to go and use the space as temporary space for a period of time and then we'll be taking over.", "So again, I think that, that space for me, it solves lots of things for the brand. Number one, I think it's a flag in the ground for, first and foremost, our product teams. Putting out there for our teams of telling them the way, and telling every designer and putting the world on notice and every designer and every builder and every product manager that once we build the greatest product for the corner of Main and Main of beyond the United States, but really the world. And so, being there at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of Fifth Avenue, we think it's a great platform for the brand. We're really going to be able to define ourselves of the company that we expect to be. So there's going to be a lot of imagineering that's going to happen as we look at this, experiential. It's going to be at the pinnacle of what we're going to try to create here, and really, how we drive retail. And we think, as we continue to add retail stores, we finished the year with some 400, again, opening over 150 this year, we think that as we, it is, whether we like it or not, we are retailers at some level, and we never want that to be competitive with our existing wholesale distribution base, but we think the more excellent we become as retailers, the better wholesale will be as well, and that'll end up being a net effect for all of us.", "And again, driving the idea of iconic, what I said is I made some bold statements in my written remarks about how big I think this idea of the store can be, but effectively, the goal that we have to build the greater \u2013 the single greatest retail store in the world. And we know that's a big statement with a big company. But I think that, that's opportunity that we have and I expect to put together an incredible team of people that'll help us think through what that means, and I think it'll really position the brand, again, in the iconic place where we believe that we belong.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my one quick follow up question is just with regards to your long-range guidance. How does Kohl's fit into that? Was that already kind of figured into your long-range guidance, the revenue growth that you gave in September? Or can we be expecting an updated figure over time?", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "This is Chip. So long-range guidance was given last year in 2015 and as we said, 25% top line, 23% bottom line growth. As part of that, there's always going to be things that are going to go in that long-range guidance, points of distribution expansion overseas, et cetera, so I would suggest that Kohl's would be part of that long-range guidance.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Carrie Gillard - Director, Investor Relations, Under Armour, Inc.", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a very tough quarter. One quick modeling question, could you \u2013 Chip, would you mind helping us think about how FX will impact the gross margins in each of the next two quarters, just so we can kind of compare it where we were in the first half?", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, sure. Hold on just a second on the FX side. So FX in the last \u2013 back half of the year is going to be slightly negative for the back half of the year, a little bit more in Q3 and Q4.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, Kevin, obviously, it is a very tough quarter for U.S. athletic retail with the Sports Authority bankruptcy. It sounds like you guys have figured a plan to kind of plug that hole in distribution. But if we look at the guidance for revenue to decelerate to 20% here in the third quarter, you called out we're lapping some fulfillment strategy we put in last year and then the Sports Authority thing, again, sounds like you have a plan.", "But then you're going to be launching big retailers like Kohl's that'll get into 2017. As we just kind of think about the cadence or how our models now start to transition in 2017, should we look at that slowdown to 20% heading off to a growth rate closer to the 25% long-term growth rate that you guys have outlined, as we get into the first half of next year? Or any other color you can help us try to think about the shape of \u2013 because I know next time we hear from you, on the third quarter call, you guys traditionally like to give us the 2017 numbers, so just trying to think about our model for a little bit longer term here?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, no. I think we're going to have a much better picture in 90 days, to be clear, to give you guys, and we want to be as close as possible to that. But I think the first thing that \u2013 when you just look at the strength of the brand is that, we're not \u2013 the hardest thing is accepting a question that says, tell us about decelerating revenues. And we're still projecting; we're 25 quarters north of 20% in a row. Over six years of doing that, we see that trend continuing for us, number one. We do continue to see it to project 25% plus growth for the full year. So I just kind of want to level set that.", "And if I can really just sort of think about how we're looking at the world these days, I think this quarter, it really is \u2013 it's illustrative, I think, of the brand that we built. With 28% top-line growth, and if you look at how it's coming for other brands in this market, we're incredibly proud of the ability to put that number up. 58% footwear growth, 68% international growth, 19% apparel growth, launching Under Armour Sportswear this quarter, expanding meaningful distribution by having built out a merchandising punches that puts us in position to do that, creating statement retail and signing something as ambitious as Fifth Avenue that I think will elevate the entire industry in addition to our own brand, and you will see people look and get worried and concerned about what we're going to build there without question.", "All the way down to the athletes we've signed and without beating them over the heads of all the first names from Jordan and Lindsey and Misty, to Andy Murray's win at Wimbledon recently and then, anchored by the Cal and UCLA signing. So, I think that we're firing on all functions as a company right now. I think that regardless of what the tape looks like outside, we still expect to be the rising tide that's with all the other boats, and we expect to be one of the highest boats in the room.", "So from a record standpoint, this is a growth company. There's a reason why I typically start my scripts with that and end my scripts with that, is that we think growth is incredibly important. We have an opportunity to put ourselves and really separate ourselves from many into a very exclusive company that puts Under Armour, I think, in the stratosphere of where we belong. But look, it's not God-given. We got to go to work every day. Hopefully, you see and feel that from our brand. We got an unbelievably committed team that's doing that each and every day here in Baltimore and in our 26 offices all over the world. And the global expansion that we've been able to enjoy, something we're really excited about. We expect to be a global brand. We're proud of what we've done in North America, we're proud of what we've done in apparel, but things like footwear, things like women's, things like global and international are all going to be the hallmarks of what are we defining for Under Armour going forward, so we're just getting started.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "If I could sneak one in, since you're talking a little bit longer term, I know, a couple of years ago, you laid out a big mapping exercise that you did in North America that showed where the opportunities were regionally. It seems like a lot of the moves you've made on the West Coast lately between UCLA and Berkeley, and obviously, Golden State, can go a long way shoring up maybe productivity on the West Coast versus the East Coast. I think sportswear is a much important category on the West Coast. Have you guys \u2013 is there \u2013 I mean, can you help us think about how big of an opportunity that is, if I'm still right that that's an opportunity from the mapping analysis we saw a few years ago. Seems like kind of the marketing assets are moving in the right direction for a pretty meaningful opportunity there for you?", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, of course. So, we think there's a big opportunity. One of the challenges that we had being primarily a sporting goods wholesale account, there wasn't a large sporting goods presence in the West Coast. The exception is Sports Authority, which had 63 doors that went away. And so, one of the things, frankly that, even we see in Kohl's is that they've got over 100 doors in the State of California.", "So we look at California as an opportunity for us. Again, it is the world's sixth largest economy, and something that we don't feel that we had been aggressive enough on. And so that's why you saw us make two very bold bets in terms of a new partnership with Cal and a new partnership with UCLA.", "And so those are about as certain as things get when you talk about investing in \u2013 really in the community. And so, Northern and Southern California in one fell swoop, backed up, of course, with what Stephen Curry is doing there. And then, one of our key Connected Fitness officers, where Mike Lee, the Head of Connected Fitness is based out of in San Francisco as well. And we've got a new 50,000 square-foot office being built there right now also.", "So we're in the State of California. We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also \u2013 that is a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad, too. So, we like the opportunity, but again, many of these deals that we made recently were really the deal about geography as much as anything else, and we feel like we accomplished that point. So, now we have to prove it out and there's work to be done. So you'll watch our team run hard.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. Great quarter.", "Kevin A. Plank - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much. Appreciate it.", "Chip Molloy - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's Q&A portion. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carrie Gillard for closing remarks.", "Carrie Gillard - Director, Investor Relations, Under Armour, Inc.", "Thanks for joining us on our call today. We look forward to reporting to you our third quarter 2016 results, which tentatively have been scheduled for Tuesday, October 25, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, and good morning to everyone joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s second quarter 2017 results. Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.", "During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning\u2019s release. We use non-GAAP amounts to lead into some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with U.S. GAAP, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables including the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.", "Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment to welcome Patrik Frisk to our team. Patrik joined Under Armour as our President and Chief Operating Officer in July. In this role, his responsibility is for our overall go-to-market strategy and will partner with myself and the rest of the executive team to ensure successful execution of our long-term growth plan. His experience working with global iconic brands meaningfully strengthens our capabilities as we enter into our next chapter of growth. Nearly a month in, from sales, strategy and supply chain to product marketing and global operations, he\u2019s digging in. Patrik?", "Patrik Frisk", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kevin and the board for the partnership and trust that they\u2019ve given me in taking this role at Under Armour. While understandably I\u2019m not yet in a position to share my initial observations in great detail, what I will underscore is the absolute single-mindedness of this team, the culture and the DNA. The relentless pursuit of innovation, the attention to detail and the outright grit that goes into making all athletes better permeates from every corner of what this company does, and driving it is an infectious, authentic and entrepreneurial energy unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced before.", "So in my first few months as I travel to our offices and distribution centers, meet with our biggest partners and spend time with industry influencers, I\u2019m learning as much as possible about our brand, our consumers, our customers and the opportunities before us, opportunities that capitalize on our strengths: product innovation, connection with our consumers and customers and our largest growth opportunities including our direct-to-consumer, our international, our footwear, women\u2019s and lifestyle businesses. And opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness: our speed to market, operational processes and digital capabilities.", "Putting all of this into better balance will undoubtedly strengthen our ability to execute against our long-term growth strategy and create value for our shareholders.", "And with that, I\u2019m greatly looking forward to the journey ahead. Kevin?", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Patrik. At the halfway point of 2017, Under Armour continues to show resilience in the face of a highly competitive retail landscape in a dynamic global environment. Consumer trendlines are accelerating quickly with consideration, preference and purchase behavior constantly evolving. In this evolution, consumers remain steadfast on their expectation for a brand\u2019s ability to deliver innovation, performance, style and value with a strong point of view.", "As the world\u2019s third-largest athletic company, we are fiercely proud of the incredibly strong brand that we\u2019ve built, one field by industry-leading innovation and a truly unique intimacy with our athletes and consumers.", "Our path has included very rapid growth. In fact, over the last three years we\u2019ve more than doubled our revenue from $2.3 billion to $4.8 billion and nearly doubled our number of teammates from 8,000 to nearly 15,000 global employees.", "To achieve this growth requires significant investment and resources across the organization. It\u2019s been a fight since day one. It was a fight to get to $1 million and to $1 billion and $5 billion. There is no let up in our team, and make no mistake: we are squarely in it. We are in this fight.", "That said, the playbook that got us to $5 billion is only part of what will deliver our next chapter of growth. Like an athlete always striving to do better, Under Armour trains and competes and is constantly searching for ways to become stronger, faster and smarter. Balance is crucial to success. The mental and strategic plan must be aligned with the physical and tactical execution to ensure consistent, predictable performance.", "The landscape is evolving quickly. Therefore, we too must evolve quickly. This evolution requires a pivot, and we\u2019re doing just that. We\u2019re pivoting from a product company to a consumer-led and category-managed brand, from predominantly men\u2019s to distinct collections for men, women and kids; from U.S. mostly apparel-centric to a global apparel, footwear, accessories portfolio; from mainly wholesale to a more balanced direct-to-consumer offering; from a historically top line driven P&L to return-focused more disciplined financial model; and ultimately pivoting from good to great operations. Once balanced, these pivots will work together to build a more efficient, thus more effective Under Armour.", "Let\u2019s provide a bit more context starting with our move to category management. Nearly two years into our realignment around key sport categories, and we continue to make solid progress. Using 2017 to further empower our team structurally, we are focused on a sharper, consumer-led approach that will drive authenticity within each sport category. In this respect, we\u2019ve identified five primary categories that represent the largest and fastest-growing opportunities based on innovation, consumer demand and market capacity. They are for us men\u2019s training, women\u2019s, run, basketball and lifestyle.", "In direct support of this strategy, we are building a relentless product engine while optimizing our merchandising, demand creation and distribution capabilities to ensure our overall go-to-market gets sharper and more agile.", "Specifically, we are reengineering the UA System to be clear and more efficient internally, including product design, lead cycle times, samples, procurement processes, cost structure and the overall use of digital. From a designer\u2019s rendering to the consumers\u2019 closet, we are addressing redundancies and stall points so we can become stronger, faster and smarter.", "We\u2019re also streamlining our organizational structure to be more efficient on how we work across the matrix of the category, product and regional teams. Working in concert with our shift to category management, our product innovation and consumer connectivity. This trinity; category, product and consumer, backed by Under Armour\u2019s unique DNA and culture, fuels our growth and defines our brand.", "Delivering great product that\u2019s unexpected to our consumers is at the heart of our brand promise. Great product must also be backed by terrific storytelling and it must happen often creatively and inspiringly. To touch on some product highlights, let\u2019s start with footwear and the few launches that we expect to help drive our second half.", "Our customized footwear program known as Icon launched in June. With just three initial styles, consumer reception and results have exceeded our expectations and show outstanding potential in the second half as we add new lifestyle and basketball options. Next, we celebrate the launch of the C1N, Cam Newton\u2019s first signature training shoe that blends performance and lifestyle. With positive reaction from consumers, sneaker heads and sports media, we look forward to building momentum on this great new product.", "We also recently launched the Harper 2, our latest Bryce Harper signature model, which significantly pushes innovation once again for one of the sport\u2019s biggest rising stars. And between Bryce Harper and Aaron Judge getting the top All-Star votes in their respective leagues, we\u2019re building great brand heat momentum ahead of hitting the field as the official outfitter of Major League Baseball in 2019.", "In the fall, our footwear portfolio gets even stronger with the launch of the Bandit 3, Threadborne Push for Women and the Curry 4. One in the NBA Finals by Stephen Curry early reaction to the Curry 4 has been quite positive, so we\u2019re excited to bring them to market in a couple of months.", "On the apparel side, we\u2019re focused on staying lighter, longer. Two key innovation platforms; Threadborne and Reactor will see extended offerings this fall. The story around Threadborne continues to evolve with increased comfort and breathability, including a new Lightweight Fleece option. And Reactor, an insulation technology that features temperature and airflow management, as worn by Jordan Spieth just a few Sundays ago, sees a meaningful expansion with additional styles, silhouettes and price points across key categories.", "Last year, we learned a lot in the fourth quarter. The pace at which things can change, and what consumers value in certain environments. We\u2019ve seen that movie, reviewed the tape more than a few times, have learned from it and adapted very quickly.", "This year we\u2019re in position to be proactive as necessary. Our core sets are more diversified, less key item focused and better balanced between lightweight and heavier-weight products to accommodate changing weather conditions. Additionally, we\u2019ve amplified our assortment with more lifestyle silhouettes, including our Unstoppable collection, to drive better product flow and newness in the holiday season.", "Further strengthening our story is the addition of some new distribution, a diversification that allows us to reach and bring new consumers into the Under Armour brand. We also have stronger capabilities around our pricing strategy, driving much clearer product segmentation and distinction into the mix. Clear segmentation is an absolute priority for us, and something we\u2019ve made meaningful progress versus last year. We\u2019re in a much better position to protect and fight for our brand while serving the changing needs of our consumers going forward.", "Turning now to consumer connectivity and a few brand highlights. First off, a huge congratulations to Jordan Spieth for winning the British Open and securing a historic third grand slam leg, as the second youngest golfer ever to achieve that milestone. After an incredibly-difficult 13 holes in the final round, many thought he was out of it. Yet, with the heart of a champion, he stuck to his playbook and found a way; a phenomenal moment for Jordan Spieth and for the Under Armour brand.", "On the marketing front, we\u2019re also pivoting with respect to approach, construct and point of view. While the intersection of digital, social, and traditional continues to blur lines, success is now measured in terms of months, weeks and even days. Engagement and intimacy requires consistency, saturation and showing up whenever and wherever a consumer engages our brand.", "Consumers demand authenticity and our newest women\u2019s campaign, unlike any, delivers exactly that. This globally innovative 100% digital campaign with more than 300 pieces of content celebrates the unparalleled accomplishments of female athletes that have shattered the status quo in their respective sports. Through collaboration with spoken word artists unlike any shines a light on the remarkable talents of Under Armour athletes, including Misty Copeland, Alison D\u00e9sir, Natasha Hastings and others. As one of the most integrated efforts we\u2019ve ever constructed, in just a few short weeks, we\u2019ve seen millions of online views and significant spikes in relevancy and engagement rates.", "Next, with tours through Asia in just the last few months featuring two UA athletes, Tom Brady and Stephen Curry, interacting with thousands of fans through training sessions, retail appearances and product launches, we continue to build an authentic connection with our global consumers. These trips underscore our increasing global brand heat and how we are truly just getting started in Asia.", "Shifting gears back to our pivot list. We\u2019re in the process of strategically and proactively addressing efficiency and effectiveness to build a stronger UA system. Having grown so quickly over the last three years, we developed certain muscle groups really well while underserving others. Starting in January this year, we began a comprehensive formal review of our business to assess how well our resources align strategically, financially and operationally. As detailed in this morning\u2019s release, we\u2019ve developed a restructuring plan that identifies multiple opportunities to drive toward operational excellence.", "While Dave will go into the financials of the plan a bit deeper, from an architectural perspective, this was a holistic evaluation that covered product, marketing, supply chain, geographies, our customers and the broader market landscape. By identifying specific opportunities to reduce complexity and streamline processes, we are working to position a more responsive organization, capable of fueling and self-funding our own growth more effectively. As you\u2019ve heard me say a few times today: stronger, faster, smarter. That\u2019s the goal. That\u2019s our objective.", "So what specifically are we focused on? First, driving a stronger go-to-market strategy, directly led by Patrik, all aspects, team, process, tactics, execution, digital and interconnectivity with all relevant internal players from product design to sourcing to marketing and retail; second, increasing speed around market discipline, better managing supply and demand with an evolving distribution model, ultimately maintaining the highest possible levels of brand presence, health and desirability; and third, becoming smarter to ensure that resources are aligned and leveraged strategically against our annual and multiyear planning processes with increased accountability to drive the highest return opportunities.", "Another pivot, one that is central to our move toward efficiency and effectiveness, is prioritization within our financial model. After six-and-a-half years of more than 20% top line growth that ended in the fourth quarter of last year, we are clearly operating in a different environment, particularly in our largest market, North America. With our largest growth drivers including international, footwear and DTC continuing to scale but still not yet large enough to offset the magnitude of North America on our overall business, the terrain has changed and so must we.", "As we execute against our restructuring plan, there are three main disciplines we are underscoring across our operations. First, we\u2019ve restructured the company around category management with the goal of streamlining operations to increase speed across all parts of our business. Within this, we are building an integrated global model with shared accountabilities between regions, categories and corporate functions. Second, we\u2019re implementing clear and broad-based SG&A savings initiatives and embedding new practices to encourage stronger stewardship of how, when and where our investments do or don\u2019t align with our growth strategies. And third, building into this stewardship are an elevated focus on return on investment and the cost of capital to safeguard that we are seamlessly linking and matching priorities with financial plans and targets.", "As our model evolves and we establish more flexibility into our P&L, our goal is to be able to invest most heavily against our highest growth, most profitable areas of our business. This will in turn drive our top line and ultimately create leverage elsewhere in our expense structure, setting the stage for operating margin improvement.", "We are not standing still. In addition to streamlining our organization for greater operational efficiency, we\u2019ve already taken proactive steps throughout the first half of 2017 to address our short and long-term opportunities, enhancing, upgrading, restructuring and leadership. They play out like this: enhancing merchandising across pricing, style and assortments; upgrading our ERP system with SAP's Fashion Management Solution to increase our speed, visibility and efficiency across the organization, giving ourselves the tools to get even closer to our consumer; restructuring our organization around category management to maximize our go-to-market strategy as well as aligning the entire company around digital; and finally, strengthening our leadership team by bringing on a new President and COO.", "All of this enables and inspires our team to consciously pivot toward becoming a stronger, faster and smarter brand and company. We have line of sight and are committed to taking all actions necessary to capitalize on our existing strength to address opportunities to run an operationally excellent company and position Under Armour to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and returns for our shareholders. We are in this fight. Dave?", "Dave Bergman", "Thanks, Kevin. Before we get into the quarterly results and our updated outlook for 2017, I\u2019d like to provide a bit of context around the restructuring plan that we announced this morning and the one-time items that will impact our full year P&L.", "In conjunction with this plan, we anticipate taking pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $110 million to $130 million in fiscal 2017, including up to $70 million in cash related charges consisting of approximately $25 million in facility and lease terminations, $15 million in employee severance and benefit costs and $30 million in contract termination and other restructuring charges. And up to $60 million in non-cash charges comprised of approximately $20 million of inventory related charges and approximately $40 million of intangibles and other asset related impairments. With respect to timing, we anticipate taking the majority of these charges in the third quarter.", "Moving to our second quarter review. Revenue was up 9% to $1.1 billion. This was slightly stronger than our outlook due to timing shifts we cited on our last call associated with upgrading our enterprise resource planning system. To give a quick update on that effort, in early July we went live with SAP's FMS or Fashion Management Solution. This system, along with our evolving category management structure and Connected Fitness business, creates a powerful unique and data-driven connection with our consumers. One month in, we are pleased with our progress so far.", "Back to revenue. Let\u2019s take a look at how the 9% increase breaks down. By product type, apparel revenue increased 11% to $681 million driven by strength in men\u2019s training, women\u2019s training and golf.", "Our premium innovation platforms led by Threadborne, combined with our focus on improved assortments and newness continue to resonate with our consumers around the world.", "Revenue for our footwear business was down 2% to $237 million as we lapped a 58% increase in the second quarter of last year, which had significant strength in basketball sales. Additionally, our efforts to manage inventory appropriate to the North American marketplace negatively impacted us in the quarter.", "Revenue for accessories increased 22% to $123 million in the quarter with solid results from men\u2019s training, women\u2019s training and youth performance.", "Looking at revenue by channel, our wholesale business was up 3% to $655 million reflecting strength in international, partially offset by an uneven North American business.", "Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 20% to $386 million with growth in all three concepts; factory, brand house and e-commerce and in each region around the world. As a percent of total, DTC was 35% of global revenue in the quarter. Our licensing business grew 20% to $25 million in the second quarter driven primarily by strength in our sock business.", "On a regional basis, the dynamic and promotional retail environment in North America tempered results to be in line with last year\u2019s same period. As previously noted, we are proactively managing our inventory levels in our largest market, while continuing to protect brand health as we navigate the uneven consumer landscape.", "Our international business delivered strong topline results posting a 57% increase in revenue to reach $235 million, or 22% of total revenue in the second quarter. Currency neutral revenue was up 54%.", "Clicking down into our international geographies, EMEA revenue was up 57% to $104 million, driven by balanced growth across wholesale and DTC. Here, we continue to drive strong momentum in our key markets, the UK and Germany, while also expanding our presence through newer markets for the brand, including Italy. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 89% driven by strength in China, Taiwan and Korea as we continued to see our brand resonate with consumers across key categories like run and basketball. Our Latin American business was up 10% led by strong growth in our DTC channel. And finally, our Connected Fitness business was down 2% to $23 million.", "Turning to margins, second-quarter gross margin was down 190 basis points to 45.8% due to continued inventory management efforts, air freight and foreign currency impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by channel and product mix, which included a lower composition of liquidations.", "SG&A expenses increased 10% to $503 million as we continued to invest in our long-term growth drivers, DTC, international and footwear. This increase was better than planned due in part to expense management efforts and some timing shifts and demand creation and other expenses.", "Second quarter operating loss was $5 million and interest and other income expense was $11 million. Our tax rate was 21% in the quarter compared to 41% last year due to discrete items taken in certain foreign markets. Taking all of this to the bottom line, we had a net loss of $12 million in the second quarter or a loss of $0.03 in diluted earnings per share.", "Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was up 37% to $166 million. Inventory was up 8% to $1.2 billion, closely in line with our revenue growth. Accounts receivable was up 31% due to timing of shipments around the company\u2019s ERP implementation and comparisons against last year's same period, which included the bankruptcy of one of our largest wholesale partners. And finally, CapEx was down 45% to $82 million.", "Turning to our full year 2017 outlook, we now expect revenue to be up 9% to 11% for the full year, reflecting the expectations for our North American business. To provide a bit of color on our quarterly revenue cadence, in the third quarter, given last year\u2019s strong growth comparison, as well as shift of revenue into Q2 due to our ERP implementation, and into Q4 due to timing of shipments, we expect Q3 revenue to be essentially flat against last year same period. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be up at a low to mid 20s percentage rate. This imbalance between Q3 and Q4 is based on several key factors. Let me take you through them.", "From a distribution perspective, new North American distribution is extending our ability to reach a segment of consumers not previously serviced. And, internationally, we have expanded distribution of both wholesale and DTC, and we are seeing strong sell through in comps. From a product perspective, we believe new launches, improvements in our assortments and segmentation position us competitively going into this holiday season. From a channel perspective, the fourth quarter is our largest DTC quarter and is expected to deliver measured growth. Within marketing our focus and approach is sharper and our frequency is increasing. Undoubtedly more spend, more presence, and a stronger more consistent brand voice will be heard from us in the second half. And finally, we\u2019re up against our lowest quarterly comparison from 2016 in this year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Moving to gross margin, due to the higher expected growth of our footwear and international businesses, which carried lower margins than the overall company, we expect mix will be working against us in the second half of 2017. This, combined with our increased actions to manage our inventory, should more than offset benefits from improved product costs. We expect these factors, along with impact from our restructuring activities, should cause our gross margin to be down approximately 160 basis points in 2017.", "Excluding the restructuring plan, full year adjusted gross margin is expected to be down approximately 120 basis points with about a point decline in each of the third and fourth quarters. With respect SG&A, due to timing shifts and spending around marketing campaigns, international retail investments and other expenses, on an absolute dollar basis excluding the restructuring plan our spend in the third and fourth quarters should be fairly equal.", "Turning to operating income, our team remains committed to maintaining the right level of investments to protect the long-term sustainable growth of the brand with an eye towards streamlining processes and driving towards a leaner and more responsive organization.", "That said, operating income is expected to be approximately $160 million to $180 million in 2017. Excluding the restructuring plan, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $280 million to $300 million. Interest expense and other expense net combined is expected to approximate $40 million for the full year, with the third quarter being the largest quarter. We\u2019re expecting our full year and third quarter tax rate to be approximately 31% to 32%. Taking this to the bottom line, we expect full year diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.21. Excluding the impact of the restructuring plan, full year adjusted diluted EPS is expected to reach $0.37 to $0.40. And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be approximately $350 million down from the $400 million we cited in January.", "So in closing, with a restructuring plan and an updated outlook based on moderated expectations for our North American business we\u2019re confident we are taking the right steps in the long run to become stronger, faster and smarter.", "With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi. Good morning.", "Kevin Plank", "Morning, Bob.", "Bob Drbul", "I have two questions, I think, the first one is when you look at what\u2019s happening with the business and some of the trends especially the top line, can you just give us an update where you think the brand health is and the vision for the business today? And I think the second question that I\u2019d like to ask is, when you look at the Q4 assumptions, you know, the breakdown between Q3 and Q4, will you have wholesale growth ex the new distribution in that third quarter and fourth quarter?", "Dave Bergman", "Yeah.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Bob. Let me take the first part, and I\u2019ll let Dave take the second. As far as what we see for our business and what we\u2019ve got out there, we\u2019re incredibly proud I think of what\u2019s been built and it\u2019s a brand that\u2019s basically been built on performance and authenticity has become a bit of a clich\u00e9 word, and a lot of people talk about going for authenticity and there are some companies that are just authentic. And we really view that as being a strength of our business and our brand. What we know though is that being built on performance, and frankly we\u2019re not going to apologize for our performance heritage and where and who we are, but continue to innovate while bringing more wearing occasions to our business.", "So we think there\u2019s a lot more places that people can wear the Under Armour brand and it\u2019s a matter of us getting the right product to consumer at the right place at the right time. The one thing we know though is that it is all about the product. UA is special because we\u2019ve represented performance, and that gives us permission to go into lifestyle and we feel that there\u2019s a lot of people that are in our space and category right now that don\u2019t exactly have the staying power, the ability to be there. We see our performance heritage as a benefit not a hindrance. Authenticity actually is the hard part, and meanwhile we\u2019re bringing lifestyle into our assortments across the brand.", "This isn\u2019t a new division or just one line that we have coming out, but style, innovation, lifestyle, things that look like people want to wear are the things that we\u2019re driving across our brand to make us a better business. And of course, making products for consumers that especially kids want to wear. When you look at the brand, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of products that we\u2019re proud of. I mentioned in my script, the Threadborne and the Reactor, then you have exciting things like the Curry 4 on the footwear side, exciting things to come. But when we think about our business as a whole, we absolutely, we see incredible opportunity, and we\u2019re not pleased with where we\u2019re positioned right now. But we see that what today\u2019s actions are and a lot of things we\u2019re doing are putting us in a position for the long term is how we\u2019re thinking about 2017.", "With an international business that\u2019s grown more than 50%, with the roster of athletes we have from Jordan Spieth winning the British Open, the Super Bowl MVP in Tom Brady, the former NFL MVP Cam Newton, Misty, Lindsey, Stephen Curry, two-time NBA MVP, the number one ranked tennis player in the world, boxing champs, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, and frankly, kids everywhere is probably my favorite MVP.", "The partnerships we have with more than 40 all-school deals that will be taking the field this fall across the United States including Cal Berkeley and UCLA that we\u2019ll just kick off relationship this year, and then setting us up for our new deal with Major League Baseball coming up in 2019. We have all the pieces in place. It\u2019s a matter of our execution. And so I think what today is about is laying out a plan of how exactly we\u2019re going to do that with the confidence that we have to march forward for our business.", "So I can\u2019t tell you exactly how people feel, but what I do know is how our athletes, our team, our partners and I feel about the future and the brand that we\u2019ve built. We certainly have a lot of work to do, but we have this incredible base. And now today as we sit here as the world\u2019s third largest athletic brand, it\u2019s up to us to execute and deliver on that. Our performance heritage, it\u2019s an asset for us, and we need to bring the easy things to bear into the forefront. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now. David?", "Dave Bergman", "Yeah. And I think, Bob, relative to the question on wholesale growth without new distribution, it\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t really give that level of detail on channels, but you can assume that within North America, our wholesale expectations aside from new distribution is tempered in our forecast. However, international wholesale growth is still very strong. So, hopefully that helps you a little bit.", "Bob Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.", "Matt McClintock", "Yeah. Good morning everyone, and welcome, Patrik. Kevin, there\u2019s a lot going on here. I was curious about the industry backdrop as you execute this restructuring. How do you think about the North American environment as it stands today, particularly given your more moderate outlook? And then maybe since you\u2019re changing up your game, can you give us your updated thoughts on the ongoing evolution of retail as a whole and how you\u2019re positioning yourself to address that shift? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Thanks, Matt. 2017, it\u2019s a unique moment in time for retail, and I think a lot of the things that we\u2019ve seen and the lessons that we\u2019ve learned so far this year, and really going back over the last nine months or so, have really given us pretty great perspective. And we\u2019re using 2017 frankly as the opportunity to position ourselves for the long term. It\u2019s the only way for us to think about our business right now, is there\u2019s a lot of sort of short term in this, I think, that is happening, but we need to be understanding of that. And we need to be \u2013 react to it, and more importantly, we need to be proactive about what we\u2019re doing there.", "In 2017 though, we\u2019re really focused on, I used the words, stronger, faster and smarter, and we\u2019re doing all those things to remind people, all the while adding about $0.5 billion in revenue at the same time. Now admittedly making less money, but we\u2019re using that to invest in our business. We want to be a business that has a lot more flexibility, I think, than we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, is that going from being a North American business to being a global business, an apparel business to being a footwear business, a men\u2019s business to being a women\u2019s business, a performance business to being a lifestyle business.", "So all these strokes are things that we believe we have developed muscle for them. They just need to get stronger. So when we talk about being a better business as well, we\u2019re really focused on that this year, and we\u2019re going to focus on the executional opportunities that we have in the near term, I think, while building a bigger engine for the long term. And so I want to just sort of lay out how the first half of this year we haven\u2019t been standing still, and this is nothing that is hopefully perceiving catching us by surprise. It\u2019s something that we are taking the proactive steps to move forward.", "And whether it shifts on July 1 having flipped the switch on our new SAP Fashion Management Solutions system that just upgraded all of our systems to put us in position of scale for the future, the new organization structure that we announced, breaking out a go-to-market strategy with a clear digital strategy as well, driving through category management which will put us through to the consumer, which has been going from apparel, footwear and accessories organization to truly having leaders that are over top of our running business, our women\u2019s business, our training business, our basketball business, et cetera.", "And that\u2019s something that again puts us in position for the future. Streamlining our organization [audio gap] one of the things that we outlined on the call today of just how we can get lean to be in position to grow and do it in the best way and the most efficient way, and then I think just from a leadership standpoint and having Patrik join the team and a little less than a month on board, but we feel really good about the direction. We spent a lot of time going through in the conversations of getting to this point. And so none of these things, I think, are reactionary. I think we are ahead of it, but I think we\u2019re just seeing some of it come out right now.", "And finally, if there\u2019s one thing I could say just about the current environment and sort of where we are is that Under Armour is a great brand, and we also have an executive team that has certainly been battle tested. Of course, the ones that you know, but many that you don\u2019t know that are behind the lines on this team, and I think that we\u2019ve demonstrated through any undulation in our business our ability to persevere. It\u2019s been a fight all along as we sit here in our 12th year as a public company, and reminding people back to what it was like in 2008, 2009 and 2010. But this environment is certainly different, and I want people to know that we\u2019re ready and we\u2019re emboldened with our new structure, our clarity and especially our leadership. So, we\u2019re ready to march forward, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re certainly in this fight.", "Matt McClintock", "Thanks for all that color, Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies.", "Randy Konik", "Yes. Thanks a lot. So I really appreciate this added focus on the cost discipline and the efficiency. So I guess, Kevin, what I wanted to ask you is you talked about the word empower and the leadership bench that you\u2019ve built here, and you\u2019ve continued to build out with Patrik, et cetera. Can you give us some perspective on how you\u2019re thinking about delineating the responsibilities of the different areas of focus?", "And what are like the three or four yardage markers that you\u2019re going to be looking at on a \u2013 I don\u2019t know, if it\u2019s a weekly basis or monthly basis, or whether it be inventory turns or some other metric? What do we \u2013 what are you looking at to try to make sure that this \u2013 the firm is getting into a better place from an execution standpoint, so that we can and the market can get that greater confidence in what you\u2019re building there? Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Yeah. Thanks, Randy. Well, first of all, I\u2019m sitting with two partners that are going to help me do that, so it\u2019s nothing I\u2019m going to be doing by myself. I think, it\u2019s the most important thing is reliance on the engine that\u2019s built this company has been team all along. But when I look at where we need to go, the operational I think people would say is it\u2019s probably some of the easier things to do. And I think what I highlighted in some of my earlier answers were more about the difficult thing is having the stable of athletes like we have that we\u2019re so proud of. It\u2019s having the positioning of being an authentic brand. It\u2019s having the list of assets that we have across teams and leagues that we\u2019ve put to place. But at the end of the day, it comes down to one very simple thing, and it just comes down to product.", "I mean, we think about how we\u2019re going to grow, and what we\u2019re looking forward as a company. There\u2019s three real important things that matter. It\u2019s, of course, product, the storytelling that we do, and the way and where of where we meet consumers. So, from a product standpoint, I think it\u2019s important to understand that we have always demonstrated one of the strongest points of view in our industry and the product combining innovation with style in things like Unstoppable, a new line that we crashed this year that we\u2019ll be rolling out exclusively with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, for instance.", "Our Reactor, Threadborne, sleepwear, Bandit, the Curry 4 that\u2019s coming out, and so many more in the back half of the year. And so the one thing that we need to do is ensure that we are a product engine, that when we look at our business is that we just have this relentless flow of innovative products. And I can tell you I\u2019ve been spending the majority of my time inside of that pipeline and am incredibly enthused by what we see and the things that we have coming out.", "So in doing that all with beyond just the performance eye, but doing it with the stylistic eye as well. And so ensuring that that happens for us; and then, of course, making sure that the consumer just loves what we do. You know, updating our assortments, and particularly, I know, a big word for us has been segmentation. I want to be clear that we feel really good about the product that we have and that we\u2019re putting in the marketplace and we\u2019re excited that it gets better and better every single season. And so our job is to take the consumer to a place that they didn\u2019t know that they could expect a athletic brand to be for them, and I think, we\u2019ve done that throughout our history and we\u2019re excited about what the future looks like for that happening as well.", "I also wanted to say, in the near term, how we\u2019ve adjusted the balance of product that we\u2019ve had, which is decrease many of the core and key items that we\u2019ve had. We used to have \u2013 we\u2019re a very much a key item focused, a big logo hoodie and things in-store, and now we\u2019ve got a lot of balance of that around versatility, layering, newness, and then also, frankly, what happened to us in the fourth quarter of last year and one of the things I\u2019ve been watching really closely is just how we\u2019re proactive with things like our pricing strategy out in the marketplace. It\u2019s that \u2013 it\u2019s been a competitive environment and that people have been basically predatory out there, and we feel the ability that we weren\u2019t in a position to fight. And so, while we feel good about the products we\u2019ll have in the marketplace, we have lots of levers, and we will not be caught off guard, that is for sure.", "From a storytelling standpoint, I want to overemphasize is that a large part of what we\u2019re talking about today is how we will be investing in this brand. We will be telling our story in the back half of this year, and you\u2019ll see increased brand heat coming from us, frankly spending against that. Of course, those are things as obvious as spending against social and digital to create the more always-on experiences like we just did with our Unlike Any Campaign for Women, featuring Misty Copeland, amongst a number of other athletes.", "But it\u2019s also going to be the storytelling that we have around some of these moments in time that occur, with Jordan Spieth going for the Career Grand Slam as the youngest golfer to be able to do that, are some of the extraordinary things we have. I mentioned the teams that we have taking to field this year with the fall sports, and then, of course, some of our new athletes coming on.", "So I think, we feel like we are positioned to give you some of what \u2013 we can play a little bit of free bird, when you think about Under Armour marketing is that there are things where people come back that they\u2019re looking for and they\u2019re expecting from us, and we also know that it\u2019s our job of delivering them, and part of that what they expect from us is delivering them the unexpected.", "Finally, what I\u2019d say as I look at the back half of the year is just monitoring what we\u2019re doing and thinking how successful we are from the segmentation standpoint with our distribution. Just looking and making sure is that I\u2019ve said for a while that we are officially out of acquisition mode in activation mode. That\u2019s never been more true than anything around our distribution to grow wholesale distribution, and how we are out in the marketplace. We feel really good about it, and our job now is just making every place we do business great. And if our consumers \u2013 if our customers win, Under Armour is going to do just fine, and that\u2019s how we view the world.", "And then, we also have, I think, this opportunity with our international growth from EMEA, where we\u2019re seeing great growth in Europe right now, and then China continues to be a bit of a juggernaut for us. So, the North America imbalance that we have of 80% of our business roughly coming from this continent is something that we look to build that diversity, just like we look to build diversity to lifestyle from performance, and from men\u2019s to women\u2019s and from footwear to apparel. So we feel like we\u2019re just getting going and really just beginning there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.", "Kate McShane", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In your guidance, I was just wondering how we should think about Footwear growth in the second half, especially ex the increased distribution with your new customers. And then, just a couple of other questions in terms of better understanding what drove the acceleration in DTC from Q1 to Q2. And then, finally, with regards to inventory, how should we think about the inventory management efforts, and where you expect to be by the end of the year.", "Kevin Plank", "Hey, Kate. This is Kevin. Let me take the Footwear question first. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to give a bit of a broader answer, so I can just expand a little bit about where we are and how we see Footwear. So Footwear remains frankly our largest opportunity, and we talked about lifestyle being a major opportunity. Obviously, Footwear is a part of that, but having our Footwear engine intact and having it ready to run for us is where our company has been focused.", "And what we can tell you as we sit here and what seems like year 11, although we spent the first 6 of those introducing new categories from football cleats, baseball cleats, training shoes, running shoes, basketball shoes, et cetera is that we\u2019re now finally in a place that we have position, we have design, we have supply chain, merchandising, style and influencers like we feel like we are in that position to do it; we just have to execute on it.", "We built global innovation centers around the world that we have now innovation centers where we\u2019re making products, as well as innovation centers that we have here in Baltimore, including our new headquarters that we just opened up in Portland, which is something that we\u2019re using to really be able to tap into the talent pool that exists there.", "We remain now, as we talk about positioning, very much a performance brand, and we continue to build momentum there in some of our on-field, on-court categories like running, basketball, cleated, but we\u2019ve also learned a lot of lessons, particularly in some of those hardcore places like run specialty is we\u2019re a business that where the majority of our distribution was focused below $100 in price points, $80 to $100, we are more focused on $100 and above.", "It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to continue to target to make that best-in-class product, and we believe that we have some incredible things in the pipeline that are coming in the fall, and frankly, in the spring of 2018, but it means we also have to right-size, I think, the product that we have in the distribution where we\u2019re selling it.", "We\u2019re still going to be building high-end premium product with again those exciting launches; things like Curry and things like Bandit that we have. But I think it\u2019s important to understand the positioning that we want to do to just be a better footwear company with how we align and the places where we\u2019re selling, with the best product for the consumer. But blending that true performance with lifestyle is something that we understand. We\u2019re not sitting here tone deaf saying we\u2019re just going to make cleats. Like we understand what the market is asking for and I think a good answer that we have, especially most recently is something that was pretty well received was the C1N, the Cam Newton new training shoe that we have, with a lifestyle bent to it but absolutely something that works in the gym. And so what we\u2019re not going to do is tear up the script on what\u2019s made us an authentic brand and allow us to be able to position to move forward.", "So, in Footwear, let me maybe basically sum it up by \u2013 there\u2019s three things we\u2019re focusing on is innovation and building great product, first and foremost. Connected shoe that we launched this year is something that we see has the ability to continue to get better and be able to build a market there. I talked about the UA Icon, the customization, personalization side for the kid who is saying I want to be different, just like my friends. We think we can now answer and have a position in that style and that stroke for the consumer.", "And then, of course, lifestyle remains this massive opportunity for us with styles we have like the 24/7, the Encounter, the Threadborne Shift and several others that you\u2019ll see coming out from our UAS line as well. At the same time, we\u2019ve also done a pretty good job of building some franchises and something we think we can build on with that, like Gemini and Slingflex in running; the Highlight and Spotlight in cleated; the Curry and Drive in basketball; things like the C1N as well as the Dwayne Johnson, the Rock Delta shoe that we have coming out. And finally, we positioned ourselves in Footwear, and there\u2019s one of two decisions: either being a small company or going for it. And the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is the reason that we\u2019ve expanded the distribution that we have, it particularly affects us on the Footwear side.", "We\u2019re going to make a meaningful number of pairs of shoes this year that\u2019ll give us the attention and the scale that we need in order to be a long-term player in this space. And so a lot of what you\u2019re hearing today is how Under Armour\u2019s positioning for long-term and I think that plays out in no category more so than Footwear.", "Dave Bergman", "And, Kate, this is Dave. Relative to your questions on DTC and inventory, DTC Q2 versus Q1, in North America some of that growth is from North America Factory House with some new doors and also I think with some more proactive pricing approaches there. And also North America e-comm did pretty well in Q2. But then there\u2019s a big push within international. We\u2019ve got a lot of new doors internationally, especially in Greater China that are doing phenomenal for us. So it\u2019s really a combined effort across all of those areas. And then when you look at inventory growth, obviously in Q2 we\u2019re pretty in line with revenue growth for the quarter.", "As we move forward through the year, Q3 inventory growth will be a little bit higher than revenue growth. We talked about this three months back around our strategy of taking some more returns, keeping the floors a little bit fresher and then having to process and move that inventory through brand-right channels for us. And sometimes that means holding it over from a season perspective. So some of that impact you will see in Q3. And then as we get into Q4, you\u2019ll see a little bit of that as well but you\u2019ll probably see inventory growth a little bit more in line with Q4 revenues as we get to the end of the year.", "Kate McShane", "Thank you.", "Dave Bergman", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird,", "Jon Komp", "Yes, hi. Thank you. Kevin, a bigger picture question on the commentary around shifting to more of a returns-focused and disciplined financial model. I would assume even most growth companies kind of long term are at least cognizant of returns. So could you maybe just comment more specifically on what that shift means for Under Armour? And maybe beyond 2017, does that mean you\u2019re expecting kind of a permanently slower growth rate as you prioritize returns, or how to think about that?", "Dave Bergman", "Jon, this is Dave. I mean, I\u2019ll take that. I mean, high level, and we talked about this a little bit three months back as well. But again, as we look at working with our accounts and really wanting to make sure that we\u2019re keeping the floors as clean as possible and renewing with fresh product and making sure it\u2019s season right and whether right product, we\u2019re just being a little bit more proactive in bringing that inventory back.", "And then also looking to move that more through our Factory House stores as we bring it back, and a lower percentage of that going to third-party liquidation. Again, continuing to protect the brand as much as we can and work down kind of that made-for-outlet percentage in our Factory House stores going forward. So as we move forward into future years, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor and make sure that the stores are fresh and we\u2019re giving them new product. But I wouldn\u2019t think that that has any real significant impact on long-term growth rates.", "Jon Komp", "Yeah. And sorry, just to clarify, I actually meant more along the lines, one of the six pivot areas you mentioned from a financial returns model, more from kind of a P&L driven focus to ROIC returns driven focus. So maybe if you could address that topic.", "Dave Bergman", "Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I apologize. From that perspective, we are definitely evolving. It is a pivot for us. Not that top line is any less important, but there\u2019s definitely a more significant focus on profitability and on return in investment in every way we look at our business and being much more strategic from that perspective.", "And I think with Patrik and I working together, we\u2019re going to continue to drive that with Kevin\u2019s partnership, and we\u2019re pretty excited about what that can mean. As we work through this restructuring plan this year and think about the go forward of that and how we move forward, we are pretty excited.", "So I think whether it\u2019s looking at different aspects even just on our balance sheet relative to working capital improvements, relative to more strategic prioritization of CapEx and really trying to move that return on invested capital needle back up, but then also again looking at how we spend, where we spend and making sure that we have the ability to reallocate spending to the right places that are really going to support the long-term sustainable growth of the company in areas like digital, in areas like international, women\u2019s, lifestyle, our new SAP system, et cetera.", "So some of it is about getting leaner and focusing on profitability, but some of it is also trying to free up as much funding as possible to reinvest in the rights areas for the longer-term growth while maintaining that improved profitability.", "Kevin Plank", "So that renewed focus too, Jon, it\u2019s not likely we were running blind before. None of this was ill-intentioned or some of us being irresponsible. It was just a matter of taking a new lens on it, of taking stock of what we have today, I think the assets that we have today, the assets lists that we have today and just saying how can we run it more efficiently. So there\u2019s a lot of good reasons as to why we got to sort of how we\u2019ve been operating in the past.", "But frankly, now that you just look and saying our position is the third-largest brand, the $5 billion-plus in revenue, I think just the cost structure that we\u2019ve built and the opportunities we have, there\u2019s a chance for us just to be a much better company, to be able to create and drive more through the bottom line I think while delivering more to our consumers because everything for us comes back to one basic thing, and that\u2019s the brand, the brand, the brand. So as long as we protect that, as long as we drive that, there\u2019ll be a lot of growth in front of us, and we see I think delivering back to the kind of growth to consumer, that our shareholders would expect from us.", "Dave Bergman", "And, Jonathan, one thing I would also add to that is as we continue to grow extremely well internationally, that percentage of our business is increasing significantly each year. And with that scale and with that leadership, those regions are becoming much more profitable each year as well. So as that mix of business continues to help with our growth rate overall as a company, it\u2019s also going to be helping us become more profitable as well and that\u2019s a bigger part of the equation in the future years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David, just one quick housekeeping question. Can you add some color on the wholesale revenue shifts that you mentioned that impact third quarter, please? I think you mentioned some shifted into Q2 out of 3Q and some into 4Q out of 3Q. Would you mind helping us put some context to the dollars associated with those shifts?", "Dave Bergman", "Yeah. I mean we won\u2019t give the exact dollars, but as we were approaching the SAP FMS go-live, we were proactively talking with accounts and making sure everybody was comfortable with the transition. And even though the transition has gone very well as planned, some of those accounts obviously have some angst maybe from other partners that have gone through transitions, and they wanted to get some of that product early in case there would end up being delays in July or August because of the actual conversion.", "So that was part of what drove the Q2, Q3 conversation there. And then also as we\u2019re ramping up processing in our distribution facilities in North America and in Europe, which have now gone live on SAP FMS, we\u2019re trying to be prudent around processing and making sure we\u2019re going through that in the right way with the new system. And so that\u2019s involved as well in whether or not there\u2019s going to be a little bit of that that ekes into Q4 from Q3. So those are a couple different factors that get into that Q3 growth rate that we discussed.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. And I guess, just to focus on one thing that as we look through the numbers here, the international business has certainly been a bright spot and very resilient. You\u2019ve talked with us a little bit through the quarter about profitability in that business. It\u2019s moving along a little, but it\u2019s really hard for us to assess from the outside with all the moving parts. Can you talk to us about how you think the margins in that business scale based on the plan you have in front of you today for the international side?", "Dave Bergman", "Yeah. I mean, in general, again, from a top line and then we\u2019ll talk about bottom line, top line has been very, very strong for us. I mean, international has grown over 60% last three years in a row. We\u2019re moving to over 20% of our business in 2017, exceeding $1 billion mark this year is where were heading. So growth rate has been great. I think when you break it down by region, Asia Pacific has been really strong for us. China growing very well. We\u2019re adding in Korea. Taiwan doing very well. And it\u2019s also one that\u2019s becoming the most profitable for us, so the combination of that high-growth rate and the higher profitability and fairly-decent gross margins there is really giving us some momentum on the bottom line.", "Also, when you look at EMEA, they\u2019ve had almost a renewed or re-accelerated growth rate as we\u2019re going into Q3, Q4 with some of the partnerships and relationships that they have. And really also gaining a lot of traction with the right marketing investments there with the EPL teams, as well as offices in Amsterdam, Manchester, Munich and also getting France online. So we\u2019re seeing increased brand awareness there and increased profitability.", "You probably didn\u2019t see it as much with EMEA in Q1 and Q2. We had some costs that came through in Q1 relative to moving to a subsidiary in one of the countries from a distributor. And then, in Q2, with their go-live of SAP as well, they had a little bit of heavier cost of goods sold due to some airfreight and timing to be ready for that ERP system implementation. But when you think about full-year profitability for EMEA, it will be increasing significantly over 2016.", "And then, when you look at Latin America, which is our newest international market, it\u2019s going to take time, but we\u2019re going through a lot of great steps there to drive forward. They\u2019re gaining momentum, and they are increasing from a bottom-line perspective, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time there versus Europe and Asia Pacific.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. Thanks for all the help, guys.", "Dave Bergman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Plank for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Plank", "Yeah. Thank you. To close it out, I just wanted to tell you we enjoyed hyper-growth for several years, and I want to be clear that we still believe we remain a growth company. The restructuring plan that we spoke about is a demonstrative sign that we\u2019re not standing still, but acting quickly to evolve Under Armour to become a stronger, faster and smarter company.", "The decisions we\u2019ve spoken of today support our vision of building the best athletic brand in the world. Some of the growing pains that we feel while difficult are the ones we believe necessary in securing the infrastructure, systems, processes, leadership and discipline to realize the full strength and potential of the Under Armour brand.", "Reinforcing and building the Under Armour brand remains a vision for our company, and we\u2019re in this fight. We\u2019ve got a couple of competitors in front of us, there\u2019s a number behind us, and you\u2019ll see us continue to separate ourselves as we move forward in building the brand that we believe is the brand of the future.", "Thank you all for your time today. We look forward to talking to you next time in 90 days. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s third quarter 2017 results. Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.", "During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning\u2019s release. We use non-GAAP amounts to lead into some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with U.S. GAAP, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables including the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.", "Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the disappointment that we feel about our financial performance in 2017. We understand the issues that put us in this position, and we\u2019ll speak to you today about how we\u2019re addressing these challenges and how we\u2019re proactively working to move our company forward.", "On our last call, we detailed a number of strategic initiatives and a restructuring plan geared at aligning our resources to make us a better company. Essential to this ongoing transformation is balance, strategic, financial and operational. In 2017, our equilibrium has been out of sync with our long-term expectations.", "We\u2019ve not performed to the level we originally aspire to. Some of this imbalance is due to things in our control like product, consumer connectivity and structural changes and some things from out of our control, like the macro environment and shifting consumer behavior. Amid this backdrop, 2017 has been a reset for Under Armor and while certainly a challenging year, it is a time that has taught us invaluable lessons, strengthened our results and will prove to be a year that helps redefine us as a brand company and culture.", "Before going into our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year, I think it\u2019s useful to put our story into context and chapters, where we\u2019ve been, where we are today and the actions we\u2019re taking to position this brand for the future.", "Chapter one was a basement start up. There was a scrappy, hard-fought fight that established our DNA and laid our foundation.", "Chapter two is about expanding into women\u2019s and International, while driving the product innovation engine, drilling consumers and taking to the limit of what was possible as a private company. Then we went public in 2005 and entered Chapter three, a period anchored in the idea of getting big fast and rapidly expanding our business to gain scale, scale and innovation, product, sport categories and global footprint ultimately scale to be able to compete.", "We hit $1 billion in 2010, which kicked off a 6.5-year run of greater than 20% plus quarterly growth getting us to nearly $5 billion by the end of 2016, a run that certainly met our strategic objective. Along the way, we\u2019ve built the world\u2019s third largest athletic brand, a performance brand, created with an underdog, fighting DNA. While the scrappy never went away, the fight has never been stronger. And while we sit here today writing the early pages of Chapter four evolving to become a truly operationally excellent business. We are proud of the speed to size we\u2019re able to achieve.", "Yet for as much as this rapid growth, realize amazing milestones, stories and accomplishments, we are now dealing with issues related to that growth. In the past few years, while we delivered industry-leading innovation, built an amazing roster of athletes and assets, accelerated our footwear business, expanded DTC in our wholesale distribution, while gaining traction in our International business, our operations have become increasingly more complex.", "So with three chapters behind us, here\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about 2018 and beyond. Right now, we\u2019re sitting squarely at the intersection of two concurrent events. The first is an uneven macro environment highlighted by geographic variance, retail disruption, competitive undercurrents and changing consumer preferences. For Under Armour, this is played out in a binary manner geographically.", "Our International business by every cut continues to exceed our expectations strategically and financially. However, our North American business predominately on the wholesale side has gotten progressively tougher since the fourth quarter of last year amid a greater retail landscape that remains pinned in a multi-year struggle to evolve past its legacy architecture.", "A confluence of events that have occurred in the North American athletic sector, including bankruptcies and store closures, declining productivity, traffic and shifting fashion preferences has contributed to what has now been more than a year long promotional environment.", "Strategically, while we try to manage the brand as best as possible in this environment, the pace of sector-wide inventory work through has sustained at a much slower pace than we anticipated. This continues to contribute to lower demand and consequently contracting wholesale revenue for our business.", "As we look to close out 2017, we do not expect these conditions to improve. And although too early for us to provide an outlook for fiscal 2018, our initial assumptions anticipate continued strength across our International and DTC businesses, contrasting with a difficult environment in our North American wholesale business well into next year. Appropriately, we are assessing our distribution model within this key market and working to identify opportunities to optimize our strategic wholesale partnerships along with our own DTC business during this transformation.", "Independent of macro challenges in North America, the second side of the intersection are the growing pains that came as a result of such rapid expansion. As detailed on previous calls, we\u2019re well underway with a strategic transformation designed to simplify our go-to-market, correct our inefficiencies and take advantage of the scale and infrastructure we\u2019ve built to better serve our consumers.", "In the midst of standing up our category management structure this year that includes distinct leaders, strategies and teams. We\u2019re ensuring that our product and story connects with the consumer, fulfilling the promise of what they expect from a brand like Under Armour.", "By building a stronger ecosystem with consumer at the center of a disciplined go-to-market strategy, we\u2019re in the process of improving our ability to drive better consistency, consistency with respect to product, demand creation and the ultimate goal of creating a more predictable pull model capable of delivering financial flexibility to drive back into the business, while delivering value to shareholders.", "Again, we are incredibly disappointed with our 2017 performance. Yet given the uneven choppy environment in North America as a $5 billion company with the scale, resources and conviction to get through it, we know who we are, how we got here and our confident in our path forward.", "Our eyes are wide open and we\u2019re well invested in the strategies that will leverage our strength to emerge stronger, faster and leaner, but this will take sometime. In 2017 and 2018, as we work to reset and strengthen our underlying business, we have three main goals: operate, fuel and innovate. As we define the issue in our business right now, we see two contributing factors, tough conditions in our largest market and complexities as a result of rapid growth.", "To address this issue, we must operate a better company, from design, sourcing, process and planning, the speed-to-market, consumer connectivity and innovation, we already have multiple strategies in play to right-size and amplify the business throughout our portfolio.", "Walking hand-in-hand with this is the need to address our cost infrastructure, which is built for a much larger company than we currently are. In light of this, we have a restructuring plan in place and continue to dig deep into all areas of our business with an eye toward creating underlying operational leverage. The difficult aspect is that, a large part of our cost structure is committed from our asset build over the last few years. So lower top line expectations will moderate short-term leverage.", "That said, we are working to engineer multiple levers across our P&L by optimizing our supply chain, employing pricing volume strategies, prioritizing and deemphasizing investments based on ROI and utilizing more efficient global operating models to create better flexibility for the long-term. Flexibility is critical to driving and funding the virtuous cycle of invest to grow and grow to invest and ultimately, what will fuel this brand.", "Essential to fueling the brand is innovation, making the best product possible and storytelling through demand creation, amplifying our message of making you better, it\u2019s the reason that we exist. Every product deserving of a UA logo should perform for the athlete for our consumers. It should make them better whether it makes them faster and stronger through efficient cushioning, temperature management or architecture, or the style, design and finish that powers a creative expression of one\u2019s unique personality, Under Armor must make you better.", "With products like Threadborne Fleece, seamless and ColdGear Reactor, along with footwear like Curry 4, the Patriot and a brand-new cushioning platform known as HOVR, which Patrik will detail in just a bit. We\u2019re fulfilling that promise and look forward to amplifying it even greater in 2018 and beyond.", "Of course, innovation is about much more than product, it\u2019s native through our DNA, and what we believe to be the reason we\u2019ll become a better company. We will run a better business by innovating our way through this, innovative product, storytelling, speed-to-market, supply chain, merchandising, customer relationships, all becoming sharper. This means, putting the consumer at the center of everything we do and what Patrik is driving with our new go-to-market strategy.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrik, a leader that in short order has bought an incredible amount of perspective, process and professionalism to this transformation. He, Dave and I are partying together with full transparency and result to impact both short and long-term strategies to increase our ability to drive more profitable long-term growth. Patrik?", "Patrik Frisk", "Thanks, Kevin. In the past four months, I have traveled to Europe, Central America, Canada and all around the United States, meeting with many of our top retail accounts, manufacturing partners and the Under Armor team, and even working the floor in our own stores engaging with consumers.", "Following strategic deep dives in the areas I have direct responsibility for strategy, supply chain, product, marketing and sales, we have absolute clarity around the challenging impacting the company. The related root causes and the steps necessary to address them. It\u2019s a new time and a new time requires a new playbook. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here. And what I see here is an incredible team, a team that\u2019s used to winning. And I also see an incredible brand, a brand that is winning, but one that is not fully optimizing its strength or potential.", "Today, I\u2019ll detail some initial observations and put context around our strengths and opportunities. As Kevin mentioned, we have numerous work streams in place to address our current challenges and structural complexities. Our year-end call in mid-February will provide even more detail on our plans and we\u2019re working toward a comprehensive Investor Day next year.", "To build on the operate fuel innovate construct, let\u2019s start with innovation and the importance of making great product, because our success must start and end with making great product that lights consumers, distinct, authentic, and unbelievably high-quality product, it\u2019s our reason for existing. Blending high-performance innovation with function and style has been and will continue to be at the core of who we are. Under Armor is a performance brand.", "Looking back over the last few years, we\u2019ve been inconsistent with this promise, that inconsistency stops now. Going forward, you\u2019ll see us accelerate our purpose as a performance brand by doubling down on innovation and creating even deeper connections with our consumers, underscoring how Under Armour makes you better. That\u2019s not to say, there\u2019s a pause in our current pipeline though.", "So now I\u2019d like to take a few moments to review some highlights for the rest of this year and into early 2018. Starting with apparel, our focus on investment around staying lighter longer has resulted in a more diversified, less key item focused assortment. New silhouettes, styles and expanded offerings in key technology platforms like Threadborne and Reactor combined with our growing sportstyle product continues to show solid demand.", "With our Threadborne platform from lightweight highly breathable T-shirts in warmer conditions to our fleece, seamless, and ColdGear Reactor collections for cold weather, our execution has never been sharper. This is an early, but good example of becoming consumer led, listening to their needs and delivering a layering solution that doesn\u2019t sacrifice function for style.", "While we remain focused on continuing to lead with our performance positioning, another category showing strong traction is our sportstyle product. And although not yet approaching meaningful scale, these products along with early reads in our Unstoppable collection gives us confidence that we\u2019re taking the right steps towards creating balance and our performance sportstyle offering to better align with ongoing trends.", "Switching to footwear, our year-to-date performance has fallen short of our expectations with results being negatively impacted due to lower demand in our North American business, especially the sports specialty channel and the continued overhang in basketball. Accordingly, we are working diligently to proactively fine tune our footwear playbook and ensure we deliver the right innovation, style and price to value equation at the right place and at the right time.", "To touch on a few highlights, we launched the Curry 4 Basketball shoe earlier this month, first in China and then around the world versus its predecessor, the Curry 4, used a much more direct design process taking steps to vision and ideas and bring them to life through elevated design and functionality. We\u2019ve also revamped our flow and scarcity model in a very different approach than past versions. Less than a month in, the response has been incredibly positive from consumers, retailers, influencers and media.", "Moving to our largest footwear category and biggest long-term growth opportunity running, we remain focused on delivering innovation, innovation in manufacturing and innovation in functionality and performance. Starting with manufacturing, we\u2019re excited to announce our limited release, UA Charge Patriot footwear in November.", "The Patriot is the first footwear to come to market from investments in our advanced manufacturing Lighthouse center right here in Baltimore. Available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles, it\u2019s an important step in driving design and innovation closer to market with every shoe assembled here in the United States. And very exciting for us is the spring 2018 launch of our new cushioning platform called HOVR, that\u2019s HOVR.", "The new HOVR cushioning system features the rare combination of superior energy return and impact absorption. They wrapped the HOVR cushioning in Under Armour\u2019s energy web technology to control and direct energy right back to the runner stride. The goal here was to give runners a zero gravity feel and that\u2019s exactly what HOVR accomplishes.", "This new platform becomes our third distinct cushioning technology along with Micro G and Charged and further demonstrates our commitment to running as one of our largest growth opportunities. And the technology in these shoes is not only limited to cushioning.", "Our first shoe using HOVR also features our next generation embedded connected sensor that tracks distance, cadence, pace and shoe life. This ties into our overall Connected Fitness strategy connecting runners to our global community through our run apps. The HOVR launch demonstrates the first true manifestation of digital, meaning physical, providing runners with advantages that make them better, smarter and capable of more than they ever knew possible.", "Our Connected Fitness strategy stretches beyond connected shoes with an ecosystem of nutrition, sleep, activity and fitness. With more than 220 million registered users and growing, we continue to lead in digital health and fitness from athlete performance to athletes recovery, driving brand awareness and ultimately selling more shirts and shoes.", "Moving to operate, an area where I\u2019ve been spending the majority of my time. This is where I believe I can have the largest impact to establish more consistency and our ability to delight the consumer, strengthen our brand and deliver sustainable profitable growth. In order to drive stronger operational discipline, I\u2019ll break it out into three key areas, structure, process and go-to-market.", "From a structure and process perspective strategically and mechanically, I see a company that has in many ways willed itself to get to where we are today. Our approach has certainly been successful in many fronts, but inefficient in others. While we stand up our category management structure, we\u2019re making real-time course corrections to improve our speed, efficiency and quite frankly, our profitability.", "In this effort, we\u2019re in the weeds, working to create dramatically better synergy between how design, supply chain and our segmentation approach is supported by our merchandising, demand creation and distribution structure. Within our quickly evolving matrix organization, it\u2019s just about that organization.", "From standardizing everyday procedures like planning, business reviews and the use of data and analytics to establishing a team, capable of making business and brand right decisions quickly, we\u2019re optimizing our ability to commercialize and make our business stronger and faster.", "We\u2019re also executing on our restructuring plan to narrow our focus and shift our privatization into areas with the highest opportunity for growth and profitable returns. And we have implemented systems upgrades, including the July 1st launch of our integrated ERP Business Solution. This includes our point-of-sale, warehouse management, inventory control, merchandising and product allocation systems in both North America and Europe.", "And while these enhancements are designed to enable us to more effectively and efficiently operate our business and ultimately enhance productivity for the long-term, the implementation caused disruption in our supply chain operations during the quarter. This led to delayed shipments and loss of productivity, which negatively impacted our third quarter results.", "During this system migration, we have encountered a number of change management issues impacting our workforce and manufacturing partners as they adapt to the new platform and processes.", "That said, while this is a key factor impacting our fourth quarter and full-year outlook, we\u2019re seeing improvements to our service levels and expect them to begin to normalize through the balance of the year. And finally, we\u2019re managing our brand to the marketplace by adjusting our inventory strategy to work toward a position, where we can better protect the brand and drive healthy growth in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.", "In total, once the structure is set and the processes in place, that becomes the core of our go-to-market and GTM strategy. This end-to-end approach then becomes repeatable ensuring a more consistent and predictable outcome. Crucial to a successful GTM strategy is consumer insights, an area that we see as a tremendous opportunity to both strengthen and elevate.", "In this respect, we\u2019ve begun to work on a consumer segmentation study, targeting more than 20,000 people from around the world, coupled with tens of millions of active users in our Connected Fitness community. The combination of this rich data set will help to more clearly define our global consumer target.", "Defining our consumer will further enhance our ability to maximize our GTM strategy from product design, development and manufacturing to marketing, segmentation and merchandising. At the end of the day, addressing our structure process and go-to-market opportunities is an engineering undertaking that becomes an incredibly powerful tool as we look to reduce the friction in our current 18 to 20-month product calendar down to about 12 months.", "When well done efficiently and repeatedly, it yields flexibility, flexibility for choices and strategies to fuel this brand and to \u2013 and our ability to engage, maintain and grow our consumer base. And on the macro level, what\u2019s happening right now is a change in the consumer, how the consumer chooses to engage with our brand and how they choose to shop our brand. Achieving our growth potential means, we need to continue to fuel the brand to maximize our connection with consumers.", "We have one of the most unique brand communities on the planet, the relationship we cherish and never take for granted. As consumer behavior shifts, we must ensure that we are delivering compelling, creative and inspiring content as quickly as they are moving. The speed and relevancy at which we can promote our brand ethos through our storytelling is critical to our success and ensures a seat at the table and consumer\u2019s intent to buy. Category management, digital and obsessing the details of product will enable Under Armour to continue to deepen and strengthen our connection with the consumer, while we continue to delight and inspire them in new ways they have never experienced before.", "Before handing it over to Dave, I will close by saying that in 2017 and 2018, we are slowing down to speed up. What does that mean? It means that independent of the macro factors compounding the outlook for our North American wholesale business, we are simultaneously reengineering our foundation, sharpening the organization and learning what it means to operate as a big company.", "Based on my 30 years in this industry, I\u2019m resolute and optimistic about the opportunity for Under Armour. Within use we\u2019re delivering today, it might sound a little bit out of sync. But I assure you, we are clear headed and well aware of the issues at hand and a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. Nearly a year into what we believe will be a two-year journey, the strength of this global team are accelerating global scale and share willingness to evolve and become a better company is undeniably confidence inspiring. Dave?", "David Bergman", "Thanks, Patrik. Before we get into our results and updated outlook for 2017, I\u2019d like to provide some more context around the restructuring plan and the one-time items that impacted our quarter. In the restructuring plan announced on August 1, the company detailed expectations that we\u2019d incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $110 million to $130 million.", "In the third quarter, we recognized $89 million of these charges, which includes $29 million of goodwill impairment related to our Connected Fitness business. The goodwill impairment, which was not included in the originally estimated range was a result of the reduction of expected future cash flows for the Connected Fitness business due to a decision to deemphasize certain ancillary revenue streams, including connected hardware and related web and mobile app development. Including this goodwill impairment charge, we now expect to incur approximately $140 million to $150 million of total charges, with substantially all occurring in fiscal 2017.", "However, we are continuing to dig in and we may uncover additional opportunities that could be realized in 2018. With respect to anticipated savings and what that means for run rates moving forward, because we are executing real-time against this plan, we are not currently prepared to share that information. We anticipate providing greater color on our year-end call in mid-February.", "Moving to our third quarter, revenue was down 5% to $1.4 billion. As noted in our call today, the operational challenges we faced from our ERP system implementation and related service levels, along with lower North American demand negatively impacted our third quarter results.", "Clicking down further into revenue, let\u2019s start with product type. Apparel revenue decreased 8% to $940 million as growth in Golf and sportstyle products was more than offset by declines in our outdoor women\u2019s training and youth categories. Revenue for our footwear business was up 2% to $285 million as strength in running and outdoor was tempered by declines in basketball and youth. Accessories revenue was up 1% to $123 million in the quarter, driven by strength in golf and men\u2019s training tempered by a decline in outdoor.", "Looking at revenue by channel, our wholesale business was down 13% to $880 million, reflecting operational challenges in the quarter, as well as lower demand in our North American business, particularly within the sports specialty channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 15% to $468 million with growth in both our retail and e-commerce businesses around the world. DTC in total was 33% of global revenue in the quarter. Our licensing business grew 16% to $34 million, primarily driven by new and expanded licensing relationships within North America.", "By region, revenue in our largest market North America was down 12% to $1.1 billion as continued promotional conditions lower overall demand and operational challenges meaningfully impacted results. Outside North America, our international business continued to deliver strong results posted a 35% increase in revenue to reach $305 million or 22% of total revenue in the third quarter. On a currency neutral basis international revenue was up 34%.", "Clicking down into the international regions, EMEA revenue was up 22%, driven by balanced growth across our wholesale and DTC channels. We continue to expand our global presence through new market entries like Russia, while also driving increased presence in key markets like the UK and Germany. Revenue in Asia-Pacific increased 52%, driven by continued strength in China, Australia and Korea as we see the UA brand resonate well with consumers across key categories like running, training and basketball.", "Our Latin American business was up 33% led by balanced growth in our DTC and wholesale channels across the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and Chile. And finally, our Connected Fitness business was up 16%, driven primarily by new partner relationships.", "Turning to gross margin, we saw 160 basis point decline 45.9% in the third quarter. Excluding the restructuring, which contained about 30 basis points of inventory impact, adjusted gross margin was down 130 basis points to 46.2%.", "Clicking down into the components of the decline, the negative drivers included approximately 100 basis points from continued actions to manage our North American inventory, including pricing and higher composition of third-party off-price sales, 50 basis points from higher airfreight expenses and 50 basis points of regional mix headwinds due to challenged results in our North American business in contrast to the continued strong growth of our international business. These pressures were partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of product costing improvements and 20 basis points of tailwind from changes in foreign currency.", "SG&A expense was flat compared to the prior year, it was better than planned due primarily to expense management efforts, lower incentive compensation expense, and timing shifts in demand creation in other expenses to the fourth quarter.", "Third quarter operating income was $62 million. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income was $151 million. Interest and other expense was $11 million. Our tax rate was negative 5% in the quarter, compared to 33% last year, primarily due to challenge results in the North American business resulting in a higher mix of international pre-tax income, as well as impacts from the restructuring.", "Excluding the restructuring, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29%. Taking all of this to the bottom line, net income was $54 million, or $0.12 in diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Excluding restructuring, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were $100 million and $0.22, respectively.", "Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were up 43% to $258 million. Inventory was up 22% to $1.2 billion, partially resulting from operational challenges from our ERP system implementation and related service levels, which delayed some shipments into the fourth quarter. Total debt was down 1% to $1.1 billion, and finally, capital expenditures were down 28% to $52 million.", "As we look to close out the year, we now expect full-year 2017 revenue to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate, reflecting lower demand in our North American business along with residual impacts from the operational challenges experienced in the third quarter. Clearly, this is a much different profile from the fourth quarter and full-year than we discussed 90 days ago.", "On that call, we outlined several key factors we thought would come to fruition. And while still relevant, demand and operational challenges in North America significantly altered the terrain. To reconcile these factors, I\u2019ll walk through them again.", "From a distribution perspective, although new North American distribution is exceeding our original expectations, it\u2019s not enough to offset lower than planned wholesale demand, particularly in the sports specialty channel. Internationally, we continue to execute against our strategy seeing strong growth in all regions and channels.", "With respect to product, while we believe our pricing, segmentation and assortment strategies have put us in a better position to compete in this highly promotional environment, demand and service level challenges are expected to negatively impact the balance of the year.", "And finally, in DTC, continued traffic pressure and a greater promotional environment mostly in North America caused us to temper our expectations in this channel. Although we typically don\u2019t provide further breakout to our revenue, given the magnitude of changes, we thought additional color would be helpful. Thus, for the full-year, we now expect North America revenue to be down at a high single-digit rate and our International business to be up 350%.", "Apparel and footwear revenue are both expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. DTC revenue should be up at a high single-digit rate, in contrast to our wholesale business, which we\u2019re expecting to be down at a low single-digit rate globally.", "Moving to gross margin, due to increased pricing and other actions to manage our inventory, including higher airfreight, along with the higher expected mix of sales coming from our International business, which carries lower margin than the overall company and the impact of our restructuring activities, we expect our gross margin to be down approximately 220 basis points in 2017.", "Excluding the impacts of the restructuring plan, full-year adjusted gross margin is expected to be down approximately 190 basis points. Given our revised top line outlook, we now expect our reported full-year operating income to be approximately $0 million to $10 million in 2017. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income should reach $140 million to $150 million.", "Interest expense and other expense combined is now expected to approximate $35 million for the full-year. Excluding certain tax-related effects in the restructuring plan, we expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.", "Our updated adjusted effective tax rate projection is lower than previously planned, due to our challenging North American results, coupled with continued strong profitability within our International businesses, thereby driving a favorable international mix to our pre-tax income.", "Taking this to the bottom line, excluding the impacts of the restructuring, we expect full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.20. And finally, we expect full-year CapEx to be approximately $300 million, down from the $350 million we cited in August, as we prioritized spend against the current environment.", "To close, in the short-term, we are disappointed, we\u2019re not delivering to the level we said we would. As we finish 2017 and continue to work through challenges in our North American business in 2018, the same result that got us this far is becoming even sharper, more efficient and more effective. With a long-term goal of creating a more profitable and predictable trajectory, we\u2019re confident in our ability to create the fuel necessary to emerge a stronger and better company for consumers, customers and shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp of Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jonathan Komp", "Yes. Hi, thank you. Kevin, want to dig in a little bit more on the North America backdrop and especially wholesale, which has gotten progressively tougher. I know you highlighted three different areas, bankruptcies, declining productivity, shifting fashion preferences as the sources of pressure externally. And I\u2019m just curious, in the past, it seems like the brand has been strong enough to stand on its own and perform, while despite whatever is going on in the environment. Clearly, the pressures are more intense now. But I\u2019m just curious if you could kind of give more detail on why you think it\u2019s more impactful now, and just broadly, the overall health of the brand as you see it today?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, let me begin with North America and I\u2019ll get Patrik actually weigh on this, and so we\u2019ll get full perspective. Let me just say, again, in my own words just how disappointed that we are in the 2017 results. And you\u2019re right, I think, the brand has always been able to stand on its own two legs.", "And hopefully, that still comes across today, we\u2019re just doing it as a much larger organization that\u2019s going through a shift. And I think, as we\u2019ve demonstrated throughout our 12-year history as a public company what we\u2019re telling you today is exactly how we ever expect to deliver for the market, our shareholders for our business.", "So today that we are using 2017 as a bit of a to reset, it\u2019s a reset for our business and our brand as we look to get and run and operate as a bigger company. We\u2019ve been evolving our structure throughout 2017. We\u2019ve talked about the things we\u2019ve done is that hopefully which you feel is that, we\u2019ve been making decisions and being proactive throughout really the balance of this year from since the beginning of this year from standing up our new category management, which gets us closer to the consumer, the restructuring that we went through this year implementing our new system.", "So we\u2019ve placed a lot of pain sort of on to ourselves, and none of it was meant to be self-inflicted, it was all meant to be thinking about the business that we\u2019re going to be. And so from a brand health standpoint, number one is that, we have great confidence. I think in the company that we are and the consumer that has a relationship with our brand that we have a relationship as well. But there\u2019s several things that are going on right now. So maybe just dig into the map, I can let Patrik talk about some of the contributing factors that led to that.", "Patrik Frisk", "Yes, I think \u2013 thanks, Jon. I think, Jonathan, we have a couple of different things going on. We look at it really from an internal and an external perspective. We certainly have seen some effects of the \u2013 what Dave talked about as well, the ERP implementation and how we dealt with that internally and how it actually affected our service levels. We\u2019ve also not been spending against the brand to the extent that we think we should have in 2017, as the environment has become more challenging.", "So there\u2019s a couple of internal things that we believe has not helped drive the brand. And that from an external perspective, we mentioned the bankruptcies before, but there\u2019s also a lot of traffic pressure. The promotions in the environment currently are still ramp and we believe they\u2019re going to continue throughout the remainder of this year. And that creating a lower demand in general is, because we haven\u2019t done as good of a job as we believe we could have, it\u2019s also hurting the brand at this point in time.", "So I would really, for us, look at this is kind of a perfect storm at the moment, both internal and external factors hitting us really hard in Q3, and it\u2019s going to remain affecting us in Q4 unfortunately.", "Kevin Plank", "And if I can finish with that, too, as you know, we want to be clear that we\u2019ve certainly got some places where we\u2019ve got significant challenges, particularly in our North American wholesale business that represents about 50% of what we do with specialty sporting goods. But we also have a lot of places \u2013 several places where we\u2019re doing really well and we want to make sure that that is highlighted, that there is a consumer that is out there looking for our brand, but some of things we\u2019ve seen from the shifting consumer preferences, performance which represents 90% of what we do as a business, you are obviously seeing that shift to lifestyle, so we\u2019re answering that move and I think we\u2019re there, but when you look at sort of the big movers, when we talk about opportunity for this company, it comes down to footwear, international and our women\u2019s business. And obviously our international business is kicking really well for us, but footwear and women\u2019s is a place where we feel like we can be and do a much better job.", "The last thing that I\u2019ll say Jonathan is that, as difficult it is to give you the news on this call, we have a really clear line of sight, I think we have a really deep understanding of who our consumer is, with what we are doing with the leadership in place, the structure and the strategy that we\u2019re putting forward as well. We feel that we\u2019re fortunate to be going through an instance like this as a $5 billion brand has the ability to absorb and more importantly drive forward and so we\u2019re incredibly focused on the future and we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s ready to run and march forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color towards how the way we are thinking about North America right now.", "Jonathan Komp", "Yes, it does, thank you. And just a follow-up on the last point and really tying the broader outlook, partly relates to 2018, but more broadly. I know on this year you are on pace to be a low single-digit operating margin business. As you think about that normalizing to something higher over time, I\u2019m just curious are there enough levers in terms of the operating efficiencies you are starting to see, the more normalized pricing environment that you think you can get to a more normalized margin or is there a sense that you need to maybe shrink the revenue base that it is today and then grow from a more profitable base, I\u2019m just curious to hear how you are thinking about that dynamic?", "David Bergman", "Jonathan, this is Dave, it\u2019s great, great question. Obviously as we look across North America and look at the wholesale side, we\u2019re going to continue to look at our distribution and prioritize how we work with our accounts, but relative to going forward in operating margins and efficiencies, we\u2019re not at this point going to be sharing information on 2018, we love to do that in the February call, but obviously as I mentioned in my script, we are digging deep in the cost structure and we\u2019re going to continue to look at opportunities everywhere we can. So we\u2019re going to keep driving forward to make sure that we can look for long-term sustainable profitable growth that\u2019s my mission and we\u2019ll give more color on that in the mid February call.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Randy Konik", "Yes, thanks a lot. I want to have a two-part question, first I want to just dig into apparel and after the response can I just go into footwear. I guess Kevin, on apparel, if you think about your Golf business and then everything else ex-Golf, your Golf business has done very well on its own in terms of the product that\u2019s out there, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 there is \u2013 it\u2019s immune to promotions by others, it just \u2013 really just performs very well.", "So, when you think about how your Golf business is performing and then you kind of think about everything else, and you said the words, there\u2019s two things going on there, so promotions going on in the environment and then there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s sounds fashion shifts more towards lifestyle. If you were to assess what\u2019s impacting more the business ex-Golf, do you think it\u2019s more promotional related or is it really more shift in preference towards the lifestyle offerings and in that regard, do you believe that \u2013 how you think about changing pricing architecture or assortment architecture going into 2018 and 2019, that\u2019s my first question.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, thank you. I think there is a lot of things that come into play is, number one, you\u2019re right, our Golf business is doing really well, maybe it starts to top with externally, you know we\u2019ve got a representative like Jordan Spieth out there that makes it easy for people to see Under Armour as an authentic Golf brand. And the trend line there is, it\u2019s incredibly basic, look, it\u2019s about pants, polo shirts and quarter-zips. And so I think what you can learn to expect from us is that, we\u2019ll continue to be pushing the narrative of how we are going to be driving categories we\u2019re already doing and having finding success like golf.", "What we see though is that where our in-line product that we\u2019ve seen across the brand and we just think about what\u2019s the positioning of the consumer preference of the kids today. How do we speak to them? Because a generation of kids have grown up in love with this brand, seeing us as their authentic on-field, on-court, on-pitch brand.", "And as we have watched them grow up, they actually \u2013 they\u2019ve continued to evolve and so what we need to do and what you\u2019ve seen us really take action beginning going back to the fourth quarter of last year as we started seeing some of the softness, especially with the heightened promotional environment is that shift of preference away from performance that really went to lifestyle.", "The kids still wants performance, I mean they still want us on field, they\u2019re designing additional wearing occasions and we believe that our authenticity and our credibility that we have as a performance brand, it gives us license to make categories in other places. Meaning every owner of our product does something, that something is really special and important for us and that the consumer continues to come back to us for that reason.", "But I believe that you\u2019ll continue to see our lines move, Patrik talked about the speed at which we can move our supply chain and when you\u2019re in a 18 to 22 months supply chain, it\u2019s very difficult to be able to impact. We\u2019re 12 or 15 months in the decisions that we\u2019ve made of moving with this market and we seem these things come, it just takes us a little bit more time, but I think you\u2019re starting to see it in the fourth quarter for sets. I think you are starting to see it in some of the layering that we\u2019re putting out in the marketplace and the way that we\u2019re addressing style across men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth.", "And so we\u2019re certainly not standing still taking these blows and saying, we accept this at any level, this is a proactive move forward brand and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with our merchandizing right now, so Golf is a \u2013 it\u2019s a great highlight for us, but it\u2019s about us really winning in men\u2019s and women\u2019s training is where we\u2019re really focused on having product that\u2019s trend-right, style-right, fit-right, color-right et cetera and being there in the right place at the right time at the right price.", "And so I feel that all those things reconciling, it\u2019s a really promotional environment, it\u2019s basically where we are right now which is why we\u2019re giving you the sort of the look that we\u2019re giving in the Q4 is just making sure that we\u2019re contemplating everything, but we feel good about the plan we have in place and how we\u2019re coming back strong through the balance of 2017 and through 2018 as well.", "Randy Konik", "And just to clarify, do you feel that from an apparel standpoint more changes are going to be made on the product architecture rather than the pricing architecture of that apparel? And then separately on footwear, you\u2019ve done \u2013 you\u2019ve gotten very high remarks on the Curry 4 from an aesthetic look perspective, so what are the learnings from that Curry 4 product line that we could potentially anticipate being put forth in the traditional running categories et cetera on the footwear side?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, when I look at 2017, I don\u2019t think that we were frankly differentiated enough for our consumer and so in no way, shape or form do we anticipate changing the pricing model that makes Under Armour special and unique is that \u2013 we invented the $25 T-shirt, we\u2019ve pressed the balance as to what consumers will pay for apparel of thinking about it as a piece of equipment and so that\u2019ll continue as that no one is looking for Under Armour to have the $25 hooded fleece, they want Under Armour at the $75 and $100 price point.", "And so we\u2019ll continue to push and to drive there from an innovation standpoint, but you\u2019ve seen us get caught and so we\u2019ve been more promotional this year reacting to a broader market and so to ensure that we\u2019ve got a differentiated product and again with a price-to-value relationship of that product is something which is \u2013 it just got to carry. We catch and stick a logo on it and expect the consumer to buy it because they like the logo, so you won\u2019t see that happen from us, it\u2019s always been in the DNA of our brand and they\u2019ll continue to be going forward.", "As far as footwear goes, we\u2019ve got a tremendous opportunity with a franchise like Curry. One thing I think it\u2019s important to put in perspective is just the sheer scale of our footwear business which is over $1 billion. And so when you have these marquee franchises like Curry, like what Patrik spoke to as well about our new HOVR midsole cushioning technology that\u2019s coming out in the spring as well, how that connects into our Connected Fitness of truly driving differentiation. You know you look for the spikes of these really high super aspirational products that will position to consume \u2013 to sell a lot of product that is more in the wheelhouse of where we can push.", "We\u2019ve talked in the past about \u2013 I think we probably were a little braggish about things like the number of styles that we\u2019re selling over $100. And the fact is, when you look at some of our key distribution, from our mainline sporting goods is they are selling footwear at $90 and so we\u2019ve done \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done the best job of being in position with the price-to-value of where we sell and how we sell and identifying that consumer, which goes back to understanding our consumer being consumer led at the center of everything we do. At the same time you\u2019re right, we have some incredibly bright spots.", "The Curry 4 is something we\u2019ve applied the lessons from Curry 1, 2 and 3, and we put them in a Curry 4. And so we\u2019re seeing incredible demand. You\u2019re seeing sellout type of approach on the products. And frankly, we\u2019ve applied that going forward in the Curry 4, the 5 and 6 upcoming 2.", "So this is the long-term strategy one that positions really well in basketball, but more importantly, I think, it helps position our overall footwear franchise that we have as being and identifying ourselves as a footwear brand. So with only 20% of our business being footwear today where it\u2019s more than 50% for our chief competitors, we see a massive runway of opportunity for us there.", "Randy Konik", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Edward Yruma", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, two parts. First, on U.S. wholesale, obviously, some challenges and made especially sport stores put some strength in your new doors. I just set back how do you think about overall door count? Are there places where you think you could exit? And then on the direct front, from a store comp perspective, should we expect to see you slim that out? And then finally, on ERP, how long will it take to get mitigation kind of in place? Thanks.", "David Bergman", "Yes, this is Dave. I\u2019ll just jump in a real quick. Relative to doors, as far as our own doors, we\u2019ve really been adding more in China than anywhere else and a lot of those are going to be partnered doors. So we\u2019re probably going to be adding about 300 doors this year in total globally, and we should be ending the year closer to 900. And again, most of those are are going to be the partnered doors that we have in China.", "But relative to the SAP implementation, what was your specific question around that?", "Edward Yruma", "Well, just how long until you can kind of get service levels back to an acceptable level?", "David Bergman", "Okay. So, the SAP implementation, I think, as we look at that, there\u2019s a couple different pieces to it that we\u2019ve been working through. I think, one of the aspects was the change management, that\u2019s been a little bit tougher than we expected, including working even with our inventory partners, our vendors, trying to get them up and trained on the system as well and just getting all the things in place.", "So right now that \u2013 the system is operating well, it\u2019s stable. But the change management in the learnings and the reporting is what we\u2019re still working through here. So, we expect that in Q4, we won\u2019t have the same level of impact that we had in Q3, but they won\u2019t be completely gone yet. We\u2019ll continue to work through it, and they continue to fine tune as we move into 2018.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, and maybe I can add some color on the wholesale there as well in terms of number of doors in our distribution. We\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at right now, and we will not be adding any additional distribution in our wholesale channels going forward the way we look at it at this point in time. But again, as the environment continues to change out there, we\u2019re going to continue, of course, to evaluate where the brand is going to show up in the future, but there are no plans at this point in time to expand any distribution further.", "Edward Yruma", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan of Cowen. Your line is now open.", "John Kernan", "Good morning, guy. Thanks for taking my question.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, John.", "John Kernan", "Kevin, could you talk about how comfortable you are with the inventory of 22%, given where the U.S. wholesale trends are running, and where that inventory is located by category and geography? Thank you.", "David Bergman", "Yes. John, this is Dave, I\u2019ll take that one. I mean, relative to our inventory, it is a little bit larger than we would like it to be in Q3. Some of that was the impact of the service levels and the implementation challenges that shifted some things out to Q4, that was probably 2 to 4 percentage points of growth there. And when you look at the inventory between North America and our international markets, the international inventory growth rates are significantly higher as we\u2019re expecting a very large Q4 revenue for international.", "So the inventory growth rates in North America are definitely small. We\u2019re continuing to manage that down. I also want to just remind you that, 9 days back we talked about how we would be carrying over some core styles internally to be able to move through our factory house relative to keeping the wholesale floors and partners a little bit cleaner and bringing in returns a little bit more. So we\u2019re seeing that as well and not a carry through in the year-end as well.", "So you will continue to see a little bit elevated inventory levels probably in those low-20% range, as we get to the end of the year as well. And then we\u2019ll be moving through more of that inventory in the front-half of 2018 and working that down as we move forward.", "John Kernan", "Okay. And then just one final up \u2013 follow-up. The direct-to-consumer guide for high single-digit for the year implies a pretty enormous deceleration in the fourth quarter. Is there anything going on there? Are you closing doors and how does domestic DTC in international DTC play into that guidance? Thank you.", "David Bergman", "Yes, John, I mean, when you look at Q4, it\u2019s not necessarily around closing doors, it\u2019s more around continuing to kind of watch the environment and wanting to make sure that we\u2019re playing prudently relative to the traffic patterns that we\u2019re seeing both on e-comm and within retail and also our factory house doors.", "So, we\u2019re tracking against that everyday, and we\u2019re continuing to try to make the best calls and want to make sure that we\u2019re protecting the brand in the right way and not going too far on discounting relative to the environment. So really it\u2019s more just about the most prudent planning we think for Q4, it\u2019s not really about closing doors.", "John Kernan", "Okay. And then just one final question. The international sustainability\u2026", "Kevin Plank", "Coming in and out.", "John Kernan", "Sorry, guys. Just sustainability of international growth into next year, obviously, that highlighted the whole portfolio at this point. Can you just talk to the sustainability of 20%, 25%-plus top line growth into next year in international? Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I can take this one. So I\u2019ve had the opportunity to travel around and I\u2019ve been both in Europe and Latin America and also up in Canada over the last four months. And we\u2019ve been digging into understanding the distribution that we currently have and what we\u2019re looking at going forward.", "And I think, the components of where the growth is going to come from differs a little bit depending on where you are. We believe we still have a big opportunity in Europe, for example, both in wholesale and direct-to-consumer. As we continue to roll out our e-commerce platforms and opening up more wholesale in Europe, we see a continued opportunity in Asia Pacific to grow in partnership stores and some owned direct-to-consumer, as well as e-commerce as well. And in Latin America, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix, depending on whether you\u2019re in Central America or in South America.", "But the fact is that, we only have about a $1 billion of our business in international. And if you compare that to the opportunity that\u2019s out there, we believe we have an enormous runway for international, and we\u2019ll give you guys a lot more color on that as we go into the Investor Day next year, and a lot of work to be done to quantify all of that. But in terms of my experience and what I\u2019ve seen before, that\u2019s currently an enormous opportunity for us, and it\u2019s different depending on where you\u2019re looking in the world.", "So, the great thing is, we have the capability and the capacity to expand into that either one of those different distribution channels. And what we\u2019re really spending a lot of time doing now is making sure that we\u2019re also building our category management to be able to segment ourselves into that kind of a structure and also in international, not just here in North America.", "John Kernan", "Okay, thanks, guys. Best of luck.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Matthew McClintock", "Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin, just to follow-up on some of the comments just the magnitude of the inventory build, as well as the continued promotional environment in North America wholesale, how do you think about launching new innovation into that kind of dynamic? And I guess, more broadly thinking, it doesn\u2019t seem like the North America wholesale environment is going to get much better anytime soon. How are your thoughts of all being using the DTC channel to maybe shift more into where you can control the environment a little bit better? Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, I\u2019ll take that one. So, hi, Matt. I think, when we think about our ability to manage the brand across our distribution channels, Dave highlighted that how we\u2019re going to think about our inventory positions differently thing going forward. We have a lot of different levers to still pull there. One of the things that we\u2019re, of course, also doing as we look into the future is thinking about how we actually plan our business, which I think we could do a little bit better in terms of where we\u2019re building inventory and how we think about our go-to-market strategy.", "Ultimately, we believe that by tuning our go-to-market strategy and dropping the innovation into the go-to-market in a commercially ready way at regular intervals, building actually our innovation funneled to be connected to the go-to-market for our commercial business is part of the key and unlock to us being consistent in delivery. And at the same thinking about how we build our inventory through our planning. Those two things in combination, they\u2019re working together.", "So when we think about our process here, we think about three components of that process. We think about our innovation process, we think about our go-to-market process, and we think about our S&OP or Sales and Operations Planning Process.", "They all three work together and we see opportunity in doing a better job with all three making sure that we\u2019re dropping the right innovation into the commercial funnel at the right time and then planning our business, so that we don\u2019t build as much inventory as we have previously and actually also supporting the innovation in a better way and then ultimately being able to deliver that product and innovation on time to the right place. It\u2019s going to be the job, of course, of our back-end. I see opportunity in all those three and putting it together is, what\u2019s going to ultimately drive a more efficient machine for us.", "Matthew McClintock", "Thank you very much.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.", "Robert Drbul", "Hi, good morning. Two quick questions, I think. The first one is, in the quarter, you called out declines in the youth business, I think, both in footwear and apparel. So I was just wondering, the initiatives in place to recapture growth in that segment, I think, would be appreciated?", "The second question is, can you just give us an update on your Amazon business and how that\u2019s been trending for you this year especially? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Thanks, Bob. Let me maybe just jump at the top and sort of give an overarching, where we think we are right now from a consumer standpoint. So youth is always a great indication for us and one we\u2019re really excited about the future of youth. We\u2019ve had great indications and we\u2019ve looked forward to some of our lines.", "But really where we believe the brand is right now is that, we believe we have a bit of a pool problem. A pool problem for us is just what we\u2019re doing to entice the consumer to ensure that they\u2019re desiring the Under Armour brand. And there\u2019s three ways that we\u2019re thinking about doing that.", "And first and foremost, it begins with product, delighting consumers with product that just exceeds our expectations and has them saying wow, 90%-plus of our service have been focused after \u2013 at performance. And as we continue to move ourselves in a sportstyle that\u2019s something that\u2019s not exclusive to just men\u2019s and women\u2019s, but it does go all the way down in the kids.", "We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re going to double down on our performance heritage is something we\u2019re really proud. And frankly, we think it\u2019s what gives us the ability and the capability to sell to this kid and make sure that we remain incredibly compelling to them.", "Secondly, a segmentation, particular around something like youth. With our new distribution, I think, that we could have done a better job from segmenting our product lines, but we believe that consumer is very much there for us. Our current composition is something that we feel good about.", "As Patrik mentioned about our distribution, we believe we\u2019re in the right doors as we\u2019re talking to this kid. We just can do a much better job of how we show up and the way that we execute that play.", "Third and finally is around demand creation. As we said, we\u2019re a pretty quiet brand in 2017, and we\u2019re looking to continue to add that up. As that relates to our youth business and this is much more of a holistic answer just across the brand is that, we\u2019re looking at 2017 as a year that we use and focus on internal growth and deciding for ourselves what we\u2019re going to do to truly be a \u2013 an externally focused company that is talking and telling the story of what this brand is, which is what makes us unique. And the reason for us being is that, every product does something and makes you better. So we are going to make sure that comes true and comes out in every single product that we build.", "Amazon Bob?", "Robert Drbul", "Yes.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, sorry, Patrik you want to go ahead?", "Patrik Frisk", "Yes, I think, we continue to make good progress with Amazon, and I would actually include other pure players in that, too. I\u2019m thinking now about Zalando in our International business, as well as ASOS in the UK and Zappos in North America. So I think, in general, that\u2019s where we see a lot of growth and continued opportunity going forward in our business, of course.", "As the consumer decides to move differently in their purchase journey, we want to make sure wherever they decide to shop with the right content and with the right tone of voice. And as you guys know, we\u2019ve been with Amazon for a while now and we believe that it\u2019s part of our distribution footprint. And we continue to make progress in the same way that we\u2019re also making progress in our own e-commerce.", "And we\u2019re also very excited about actually the work that we\u2019re doing currently to roll more of our e-commerce out in Europe, where we see great traction for our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. Hope that helps.", "Robert Drbul", "Thank you very much. Yes, thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Jay Sole", "Great. Thank you so much. Kevin, my question is this, yes, it\u2019s been very promotional out there. And Under Armour had just kind of play a part in that. You\u2019ve always talked about how Under Armour has the brand equity to endure. But where do you draw the line, where you just have to say, we have to stop promoting, we can\u2019t participate with what else is going on in the environment, because otherwise we risk doing the long-term damage to our brand that will be a very difficult to recover from. And what we get into say stop, we\u2019re just going to stop promoting and we\u2019re going to start to think about the very long-term future of this brand of the 5 and 10-year long-term gain? Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes, thank you, Jay. I think, we\u2019re really saying that right now. I think, that\u2019s a lot about this call in this quarter. The way that we\u2019re looking at our business and our brand thinking about it long-term. You think about through the sort of the streak of growth that our company had, I hate ever thinking that we were sort of caught up or compelled by trying to manage something just for the sake of we did at the quarter before.", "We really are thinking long-term and globally. The business is balanced between $1 billion women\u2019s business, $1 billion footwear business, $1 billion International business, so all combined into business that\u2019s still today though is 80% or close to 80% done here in North America. Balance is incredibly important for this business in this brand.", "And hopefully, you always get that thought from this for us \u2013 from us about the way that we\u2019re thinking it long-term with the brand. I \u2013 as I said earlier, we\u2019re not thrilled with things like what we\u2019ve delivered from footwear, where we have product that will delight, incredibly excited about our new upcoming HOVR running launch that we\u2019ll have this spring, incredibly excited about the demand driven around Curry. We just see the ability for us to just be better to be better across the organization, to be better across the brand, and that\u2019s what 2017 was really about us doing is focusing on the internal growth to put ourselves in a position for long-term scale, and to be able to exercise across those.", "So we\u2019ve never had to pull the pricing lever. You\u2019ve seen with the promotional environment that began in the fourth quarter of last year, that has caught us by a bit of surprise and found us reactive and as that extended with not policies basically going away from the competition, made an incredibly promotional environment.", "And so there\u2019s places where we just frankly had to play, we believe that. But long-term, particularly as we look at the relationship of what\u2019s happening with wholesale versus what we\u2019re doing with our own digital, and our ability to really be able to segment that product and differentiate that product as we become a brand that moves beyond A, cold-geared mock or A, heat-geared T-shirt where we have true diversity in our line.", "I think, you\u2019ll see us the ability to do that. And so we don\u2019t want to claim \u2013 Under Armour was never intended just to be at a really expensive product that was sort of out of reach was meant to be affordable luxury. But it was also meant to be full price affordable luxury. And so hopefully that comes across in everything that we do, and we don\u2019t expect to see for sale signs on our brand.", "2017 has definitely taught us that we need the capability of that stroke when we\u2019re clearing product. But for the most part, we want to be smart, we want to be prudent, and we want to be product that\u2019s been built to sell at full price.", "David Bergman", "I think it\u2019s also a change in culture internally from being a sell-in to more of a sell-through mentality. In other words, being more of a direct-to-consumer mentality versus just a wholesale mentality. And I think that\u2019s important and Kevin and I both recognized the importance of staying closer to consumer in the current environment, so that means, planning your business. So, that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re really looking at to ensure that we plan into less promotions as we go into 2018 and beyond.", "Jay Sole", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Jay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one to ask. Kevin, you mentioned early in the prepared remarks about kind of reprioritizing and deemphasizing certain investments. I was hoping maybe you could give us some insight into the internal management process for capital allocation and resource allocation, and how that\u2019s evolving from kind of yesterday, today, tomorrow? How you think about making those investments? And maybe some anecdotes about where you\u2019re shifting your investments from and to? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Omar. I\u2019m going to let Dave jump on that one.", "David Bergman", "Yes, Omar, I mean, we are looking at it from a lot of different angles here. I mean, we\u2019re prioritizing the new CapEx to ensure everything aligns with a long-term strategies. We\u2019ve got a great capital committee that focuses on that. In that, we\u2019re doing some things around. We talked about flowing down North America Brand House builds and tempering some of the North America wholesale fixture buying just keeping really an eye on the market and investing where the best return is going to be.", "Also looking at relative to our DTC and office and distribution center expansion space and trying to be as prudent as we can relative to when we need to do any of that, continuing to review our operational structure and how we can simplify and add it better there, continuing to address real estate, looking at store locations, looking at our office space and distribution center space and how we have tight and operational effective there as we possibly can be, continue to dig in on other SG&A, professional service fees, T&Es and all the customary areas there.", "So we are kind of looking at that across the board and looking at it much more within ROI lens than we\u2019ve done in the past. But at the same time, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re protecting those areas of long-term growth. So making sure, we\u2019re protecting and prioritizing international expansion, e-commerce development, footwear design development, areas like that, while we continue to dig in deep and kind of right-size the cost structure.", "So, there\u2019s a lot of different angles that we\u2019re looking at it right now. But again, trying to making sure that we\u2019re looking at things from an ROI lens and really driving all the way down through to ROIC is what we\u2019re trying to do.", "Kevin Plank", "And Omar, so we\u2019ve always had, I think, that ROI approach, it\u2019s obviously coming through a different lens, as Dave says. But that\u2019s what the addition of Patrik being here sort of the trinity of Dave and Patrik and myself of really making sure that they were partnered working together that we have a clearly articulated strategy that\u2019s understood by the organization throughout the company and that we\u2019re driving that through and putting money on the things that will get us to return.", "So we\u2019ve got a lot of low-hanging fruit. You hear me say sort of anecdotally women\u2019s footwear international, the places that we\u2019ve invested in, we\u2019re there. We just put the right kind of smart spending we can win. So, I\u2019ve used the saying is that, we can do anything. We just can\u2019t do everything that\u2019s ever been \u2013 ever more true. We\u2019re really focused and I think really thinking about through the things that will get us the biggest return.", "We don\u2019t need anything else. We don\u2019t need to buy anything else. We have plenty of real estate. We have plenty of assets. We have plenty of categories that we\u2019re in, we just need to focus on becoming excellent everywhere that we do business. And so that\u2019s hopefully one message that comes across in this call is our commitment, our teamwork, the strategy that we have in place and the way that we\u2019re looking at just go run the play in 2018 put this company in firm footing and allow us to storm and march forward and get us back in that growth pattern. Right now, we\u2019re going to be internally a great operationally excellent company.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks, guys. Thanks for all the detail today.", "David Bergman", "Thank you, Omar.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Omar.", "Kevin Plank", "That will conclude our call today. Operator?", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations for Under Armour. Sir, you may begin.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's call to discuss Under Armour's fourth quarter and year end 2017 results.", "Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning's press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found in our website at uabiz.com.", "During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning's release. We use non-GAAP amounts as the lead in some of our discussions because we feel it more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view why this information is useful to investors.", "Joining us on today's call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman.", "Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks, Lance and good morning everyone. On our last call we spoke at length about our strategy of getting big fast and the rapid expansion of our business to gain scale. Scale and innovation product, sport categories and global footprint. All gear helping us to become one of the world's largest athletic brands.", "We also detailed some of the operational inefficiencies as a direct result to this growth, including an inconsistent go-to-market process, change management related to shifting toward a category based construct. In the mix match in our cost structure that was built to support the expectation of being a much larger company by 2018.", "These issues along with some macro challenges in the North American market including retail consolidation, changes in consumer preference and intensified competition, created a tough year for our company in 2017.", "It was tough, but also an opportunity to begin the work to transform ourselves into an operationally disciplined organization, capable of supporting the powerful global brand that is Under Armour.", "Over the past year, we've made strategic and proactive decisions to advance our systems, reset our structure and recalibrate our leadership in an effort to simplify our go-to-market address our inefficiencies and utilize the scale and infrastructure we built to better serve our consumers and retail customers.", "As we slowdown to speed up and simplify everything we do to become smarter, faster and stronger, our team is collaborative, humbled and hungrier than ever. Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year end 2017 results, relative to where we are in our journey in the offensive and defensive strategies we're employing, let's take a moment to review some full year highlights, which were fairly in line if not a little better than the outlook we gave in our last call.", "Revenue was up 3% to $5 billion. Our wholesale business was down 3% and DTC revenue was up 14% driven by low double-digit growth in our own stores in a high-teen increase in our e-commerce business. In total, DTC represented 35% of our global revenue for the full year.", "By region as expected, North American revenue was down 5% and our international business was up 46% driven by continued strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Having crossed the $1 billion mark, so could quadrupling in the past three years at 22% of global revenue, the size and scale of our international business is on the freshness of being able to deliver more meaningful return on the large investments we've made over the past several years.", "By product type, full year results for apparel, footwear and accessories were also in line with our outlook up 2%, 3% and 10% respectively. Full year gross margin was down a 140 basis points to 45%, a decline due primarily to inventory management initiative and heavily promotional environment that we operated in North America throughout much of the year.", "Looking at SG&A we continue to be challenged by highly committed cost structure and asset for over past few years when that levers mathematically even higher due to the change in our top-line trajectory.", "In 2017, our SG&A spend was up 14%, which was 41.9% of total revenue. The fact that there is a four in front of this ratio is unacceptable to us and we are working to address it as quickly, efficiently and as brand right as possible.", "In this respect, we're making progress. SG&A dollars were up 22% in 2016, they are up 14% last year, respected fee up at a mid-single digit rate in 2018. So over the three years stack we'll basically have the growth rate percentage each year. In short, it's very difficult to unpack five years of investing to scale in just five quarters.", "But, we are completely committed to improving this ratio toward industry best practices. In addition to SG&A across the whole business we are working to engineer additional areas for longer term leverage.", "Last year we announced a $140 million to $150 million restructuring plan intended to help better align our resources against our biggest long-term growth drivers. For the full year, we recognized a $129 million of pre-tax charges under that plan.", "After going deeper, broadening our scope and recalibrating our leadership with even greater financial discipline, we've identified additional opportunities to improve our operations. Accordingly, our board approved expanding our restructuring efforts to include approximately $110 million to $130 million of additional charges expected to be recorded in 2018.", "Dave will provide more details on the 2018 plan later. So to finish at our 2017 results, adjusted operating income of $157 million and adjusted EPS of $0.19 were also in line with our outlook. In summary, 2017 was a year we reset and reorganized our business at a level and pace unlike anything we'd ever executed.", "To finish out the year in line with the outlook we provided in October should be taken as an indicator there are actions that we're going to take hold and our efforts of putting the brand in a much healthier position to move forward.", "In 2018, we are anticipating more stable operating environment for Under Armour. The year that should financially prove to be similar to 2017 and that's perhaps for the similarities end, because within the context of further strengthening our foundation during this fiscal year, we are constructing our long-term operating model, cauterizing the strategies to support it and architecting precisely how we will ensure a more consistent predictable path to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.", "To caps on these efforts we're working toward an Investor Day in the second half of 2018 that we'll be announcing soon. At this inflexion point, there are two simultaneous connected efforts that we are working on an operational transformation and our long-term strategy.", "Patrik will give more detail about our operational transformation, but at the highest level there are currently several major initiatives that we are tackling with the goal of putting the consumer first, simplifying our operations and driving sustainable, profitable growth.", "With respect to our long-term strategy, the position strength and creativity of our brand is job 1. To support this, there are four foundational pillars that have served and will continue to serve to fuel the brand through Under Armour's unique personality and performance based point of view, product, story, service and team.", "So, let me start with product. In 2017, we moved to a category management structure to ensure that our understanding of athlete needs is central to everything that we do. We take deep athlete consumer insights and innovate to solve their problems and inspire them to push the boundaries of what is possible.", "In order to do this consistently to elevate innovation and be a product machine, we are completely reengineering our go-to-market by focusing on our design approach, revamping the process, counter and structure and prioritizing being premium at every price point all within the consistent margin structure.", "Much of this process began at the first half of last year and with the 12 to 18 month lead time; we've already begun to see some success with product like our ColdGear Reactor and Unstoppable apparel collections. In the carry for speed 2 and UA Hovr Phantom and Sonic running shoes that we just launched just a couple of weeks ago.", "Second is all about bringing product to life helping globally relevant stories and connecting through social platform supported by go-to-market approach that promotes growth and scale. In 2017, we were a loud company and quite brand. In 2018, our plan is to be quite company and a loud brand. Getting to that point is our Hovr launch.", "Starting with strategic seating thus fall to the release this month in the ongoing efforts throughout this year, you will see and hear a lot about Hovr for marketing PR and social to athlete, pacemaker and consumer touch points, the saturation of this effort has created a significant amount of buzz for our third cushion platform which joins Charged and Micro G.", "Through a combined product and story lens Hovr is a fantastic example of Under Armour firing on all cylinders. As a product, Hovr is an Under Armour DNA tri-sector of style, performance and fit. And from a story perspective without comparison, the story telling that supported around UA Hovr is the largest and most comprehensive campaign that we've ever done on a global basis and this is just the beginning of some of the amplified story telling you'll hear from us in 2018.", "Next about is service, and putting our consumer athletes at the center of everything we do, always from start to finish and back again. No exceptions. Constantly serving our consumer athletes whenever and wherever they choose to engage our brand.", "As we elevate our gain and validate some of our assumptions along the way, while digging it even deeper to truly understand the consumer decision journey. I believe that our perceived short-term weakness, our focus on athletic performance will ultimately prove to be our greatest long-term strength.", "Our product must of course drive style, but we will continue to invest in being an authentic athletic performance brand, that's us. This focus along with global operational discipline will ultimately ensure we are able to deliver a seamless consumer and customer experience time and time again.", "And finally our team, the DNA that fuels the bones, muscle and blood of Under Armour is our people. It's been a tough year in this team; our team is resilient and ready to win. The best part of my day is walking the halls connecting with the teammates that are building this company from the Rookie cost center teammate to the season industry veteran. From Portland, Austin, San Francisco and Hong Kong to Amsterdam and New York and Baltimore, we are single minded in our passion, purpose and commitment that articulates through our new mission statement which is Under Armour makes you better.", "That means in every way we connect through the products we create, the experiences we deliver and the inspiration we provide we simply make you better. In summary, we see you and we hear you, know that we're heads down stabilizing, prioritizing, executing making measured incremental progress for the company we know we can be.", "It takes time which can certainly be challenging on both sides externally and internally. Yet we have the patience, plan and fortitude to see this through methodically and successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrik.", "Patrik Frisk", "Thanks Kevin. On our last call, I spoke about operate fuel innovate at the central construct of Hovr strengthening our underlying business. Thing accurate in product story service team, today I would like to detail some of the major initiatives we're working on within our operational transformation.", "This transformation has three main objectives, put the consumer first, simplify our operations and drive sustainable profitable growth. And its core starts with the consumer, as we work to significantly sharpen our knowledge and connection with our consumer athletes, it's critical that research and design, innovation engagement and does our overall go-to-market are based in consumer insights to create a demand centric growth model.", "To base this work, we've finished our global segmentation study targeting more than 20,000 people and gained an even deeper understanding of how consumers engage our brand; use our product and one and why they shop Under Armour. Within this consumer decision journey we are using both quantitative and qualitative attributes to further strengthen our building to analyze existing market spaces and identify unique areas of wide space where we might play.", "Now part of every seasons consideration, this data and analytics that serves to inform and support the tough decisions we have to make with respect to resource allocation and the financial discipline necessary to provide high returns.", "High returns then provide more agility for our business. Playing the central part of the strategic planning process, this enables us to refine our positioning, prioritize product, pricing and segmentation and ultimately unlock additional value drivers and growth levers.", "Second, following many years of rapid growth and infrastructure build, we are in the process of simplifying our operations. To reset, state well said earlier it's challenging to unpack 5 years and 5 quarters, but we are making progress. As we work through this transformation, we're focused on keeping structure process and go-to-market continuously aligned to ensure repeatable outcomes.", "A lot of the foundational work and touch decisions that team has implemented along with the expansion of our restructuring plan that we announced this morning, are direct yourself that our team digging in deeper and narrowing our focus even more directly to ensure we have greater operational agility.", "And it is this agility that allows us to align against the largest opportunity for growth and profitable returns. And at the highest level, what does this look like, while from a channel perspective its optimizing our direct consumer business amplifying e-commerce and demonstrating first hand that this is an amazing experience for consumers to engage Under Armour and for us to tell our brand story.", "From category perspective, replacing a high level of focus on men's training, running and women's training. The areas with brand strength the largest market opportunity and most consistent growth. It's also about being a product machine and turning out consistent innovation to delight the consumer from sketch materials and production to discovery purchase and the entire lifecycle of the product.", "We are 100% focused on the consumer and creating the world's best performance products. With this respect to geography it's strategically managing our business in North America through better segmentation aligning inventory to ensure brand health and continuing to evolve our distribution relative to the quickly changing market.", "Internationally, it's continuing to build our footprint and scale leveraging the investments we have already made and distorting toward more profitable hyper growth markets like China and the Greater Asia Pacific business as an example.", "As we continue to transform toward a more efficient global operating model we are also evaluating opportunities to redefine key processes and simplify the ways of working to optimize work streams and productivity. Assessing organizational responsibilities and designing key functional and cross functional processes to drive faster decision making and in very tight partnership with Dave emphasizing and driving accountability and financial discipline throughout the organization.", "With our operating structure and processes and the alignment, the go-to-market now falls into place allowing us to make great strive in several areas such as shortening the curve go-to-market calendar and moving from biannual to quarterly cadence that will see continuous improvement going forward and will reach its full effect by early 2020.", "From an innovation perspective, it enables us to redefine the criteria for innovation platforms to transition from concept to in line and powering the development of seasonless innovation which is central toward driving that shorten go-to-market calendar and skew optimization which is really about doing more with less.", "With greater structure and process and alignment, we anticipate that our full 2019 product will have 30% to 40% skews than our 2017 assortment. We're also getting much sharp with demand creation, storytelling and our overall ability to connect even more deeply with consumers. We want to be a loud brand and quite company in 2018 like Kevin said.", "To support this, we are simplifying and focusing our marketing PR and social elements to better leverage the brand equity that has already been built while creating strategies drive high returns for our efforts. And a few of the things that we're working on include significantly evolving our marketing return on investment to determine exactly what the best makes of sport, social, traditional and digital best supports are building for Under Armour to make you better.", "Next is an absolute acceleration manifestation of digital, how the intersectional product Connected Fitness and experienced interfaces with the ultimate goal of getting the world's best performance products to our consumers. Having assessed our digital capabilities, we are executing pilots and constructing a repeatable quantitative and qualitative playbook which is a significant improvement for the brand.", "Now in this respect, moving from seasonal and one time brand moments to a continuous horizon conversation with our consumers telegraph the same passion we live and breathe inside these walls. So to close it out we are making measurable progress against our transformation.", "By putting the consumer at the core of everything we do having a more frequent innovation cycle, increasing our speed to market, executing holistic launches and better segmenting our product at the channel and store level, we're setting out to be a loud brand and operationally disciplined company in 2018 and beyond.", "And now I'll turn it over to Dave.", "David Bergman", "Thanks Patrik. Before we get into our fourth results and our outlook for 2018, I'd like to provide some more contexts around the 2017 restructuring plan and one-time items that impacted our quarter as well as the 2018 restructuring plan that we announced this morning.", "On our last call, we provided an update to our restructuring plan that we expected to incur approximately $140 million to $150 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges in 2017. For the year, we recognized a total of $129 million in charges against that plan, including $37 million in the fourth quarter.", "As we move into 2018, we have uncovered additional opportunities to more closely align our financial resources to drive operational discipline and effectiveness. To that effect, we approved the new 2018 restructuring plan which is expected to include $110 million to $130 million of pre-tax restructuring and other related charges.", "This plan anticipates up to $105 million in cash related charges consisting of up to $55 million in facility and lease terminations and up to $50 million in contract termination and other restructuring charges. As well as up to $25 million in non-cash charges comprised of up to $10 million of inventory related charges and up to $15 million of asset related impairments.", "In 2017, we made several strategic decisions to drive toward a more efficient and effectively operated company. We are proud of the work we have done thus far and we use 2018 to further drive efficiencies and streamline our business to become more profitable.", "Based on our restructuring efforts in 2017 and 2018 we anticipate a minimum of $75 million in savings annually from these efforts as we move into 2019 and beyond. We already reviewed some of the full year highlights, so let's take a few minutes to review our fourth quarter results before turning to our 2018 outlook.", "Revenue was up 5% to $1.4 billion clocking down let's start with revenue by channel. Our wholesale business was down 1% to $733 million in the quarter reflecting lower demand in our North American business particularly within the sport specialty channel.", "Direct to consumer revenue grew 11% to $575 million driven by continued strong results in our international businesses. DTC in total was 42% of global revenue in the quarter. Licensing was up 10% to $33 million primarily driven by strength in our Japanese business.", "By region revenue in our largest market North America was down 4% to $1 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Outside North America our international business continued its strong momentum posting a 47% increase in revenue to reach $317 million or 23% of total revenue in the fourth quarter.", "On a currency neutral basis international revenue was up 43%. Clocking down into the international regions. EMEA revenue was up 46% driven by growth across our double sale and DTC channels. One highlight in the quarter was the opening of our first brand house in Europe which is very exciting for the team and the future of DTC in this region.", "Revenue in Asia Pacific increased 56% driven by strong growth in our DTC as we continue to drive both digital and physical touch points with the consumer. Our Latin American business was up 36% led by balanced growth in DTC and wholesale across the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and Chile as well as our recent entrance into Argentina.", "And finally, our Connected Fitness business was up 31% driven primarily by new partner relationships. Turning to gross margin, we saw a 150 basis point decline to 43.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the restructuring which contained about 10 basis points of inventory impacts, adjusted gross margin was 43.3%.", "To walk through the components of the decline, the negative drivers included approximately 160 basis points from certain inventory management efforts including promotions and affray and 50 basis points of channel and product mix due to a higher composition of half price and footwear sales.", "These pressures were partially offset by 50 basis points of tailwinds from changes in foreign currency and 40 basis points of product costing improvements. SG&A expense increased 41% to $591 million driven primarily by timing shift and demand creation from the third quarter low incentive composition in the prior period and continued investments in our DTC footwear and international business.", "With respect to incentive compensation, recall that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we've reversed the substantial amount of full year incentive compensation. So that impacts the year-over-year comparison.", "Fourth quarter operating loss was $37 million, excluding the restructuring adjusted operating income broke even. Interest and other expense was $12 million. And turning to taxes, our fourth quarter and full year tax expense included $39 million of expense related to the December 2017 U.S. tax act. This included $14 million for tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings as well as a $25 million non-cash charge to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the change in U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.", "There were no cash impacts in the fourth quarter related to these charges. However, the charge associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings will have a minor impact on future cash flow.", "All in, the impacts of tax reform made for an effective tax rate of negative 80.8% in the quarter, on an adjusted basis which could exclude the impact of one-time charges and changes due to the tax reform; the quarterly tax rate was 94.8%.", "Taking all this to the bottom-line, net loss was $88 million or a $0.20 loss in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Excluding restructuring and one-time tax reform impacts adjusted net loss was $1 million and adjusted diluted EPS broke even.", "Turning to our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were up 25% to $312 million. Inventory was up 26% to $1.2 billion; important to the inventory story is the split between North America and our international businesses. In North America inventory was up at mid-teen percentage rate, while our international inventory was up nearly 50% supporting the strength of this business. Total debt was up 12% to $917 million and finally capital expenditures were down 20% to $74 million.", "Let's now move to our initial outlook for 2018, which we believe will end up looking similar to 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue to be up at a low single digit percentage rate. Anticipating a mid-single digit decline in North America where we believe strength in our DTC business will be more than offset by wholesale contraction.", "Building on a strong momentum in our international business which passed the $1 billion mark, we're expecting growth to be north of 25%. Many of the macro factors that we experience in 2017, we expect to carry over into 2018. Thus for the full year, we expect apparel, footwear and accessories revenue to each grow at a low single digit rate.", "DTC revenue should be up at a mid to high-single digit rate, in contrast our wholesale business which should be down slightly to flat. Moving to gross margin, for the full year we currently anticipate about 50 basis points of improvement compared to 45% in 2017.", "Primarily due to a higher percentage of DTC in the channel mix, changes in foreign currency and lower product cost. To note, we are expecting meaningfully lower promotional activity in the back-half of the year of 2018, compared to the back-half of 2017.", "As discussed earlier, we are currently executing in several initiatives that address our overall operating structure, many of which are geared specifically getting SG&A into better alignment over the long-term.", "In 2018, we're expecting our SG&A to grow at a mid-single digit rate with higher growth rates in the first half primarily due to the timing of marketing support for our Hovr and training campaigns.", "To be clear, SG&A to revenue percentage is not where we wanted to be in 2018. But following the step down from 22% to 14% over the past two years and given the magnitude of committed and fixed cost within this line item, we believe we are making meaningful progress.", "Also keep in mind that concurrently it remains a priority to support our growth in our DTC and international businesses, which require continued investments. So, we're balancing that in the mix appropriately. Thus I want to emphasize this is not just the cost cutting right sizing only exercise.", "Kevin, Patrik and myself along with the entirety of Under Armour are aligned that this is about running a smarter, leaner and more efficient organization that gives us constant agility and ability to generate sustainable returns to invest in our brand and drive shareholder value.", "Back to our P&L and taking this through to operating income. We're expecting to generate about $20 million to $30 million in 2018. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income should be approximately $130 million to $160 million.", "Interest expense and other expense combined is expected to be approximately $45 million for the full year, with respect to tax while corporate reform in the U.S. will provide a benefit over the long-term. In 2018, due to our challenged U.S. results we don't precede benefits from the rate reduction and we'll instead see some unfavorable tax impacts due to new base broadening provisions and limitations on certain deductions, coupled with unfavorable tax impacts due to our stock performance over the past year.", "These negative impacts will be primarily offset by the beneficial accompanying of larger valuation reserves recorded in 2017. Longer-term as we execute on our operational initiatives in U.S. income growth, our effective tax rate will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate rate. Excluding the impacts of one-time restructuring charges we expect our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range. Taking this to the bottom-line we're expecting full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19.", "Turning to a few items on our balance sheet; due to the revision of our North American revenue trajectory in the second half of 2017 we anticipate that our inventory growth rates will be fairly consistent with our year end growth rate through the first half of 2018. And then should move more in line with revenue.", "Demonstrating our focus capital strategy, we expect full year CapEx to be down more than 20% to approximately $225 million compared with $275 million in the 2017. And finally, with respect to leverage for the year, we are expecting some quarter-over-quarter fluctuations that combined with the cash impacts of our restructuring plans on our trailing 12 month EBITDA will cause our leverage ratio to flex above historical levels during parts of 2018.", "Accordingly we are in a process of seeking an amendment to our credit agreement to address this short-term issue. Lastly, to give a little more color on our outlook. We're expecting our second quarter revenue growth rate to be the highest of the year as we work through elevated inventory in North America.", "With respect to the first quarter, we currently anticipate revenue to be flat to slightly down versus the prior year. First quarter adjusted gross margin is expected to be relatively flat and adjusted operating income is expected to be a loss of approximately $15 million, which puts adjusted EPS at a loss of $0.06 to $0.07. Also important to note that we anticipate the majority of our restructuring to be completed in the first half of 2018 with the second quarter seeing higher than the first quarter.", "To close out our call today, we remain committed to driving a more efficient and effective company throughout 2018. As we continue to optimize our North American business and our operating model, our result remains unwavering and we believe our long-term goal creating a more profitable and predictable growth trajectory is intact. We are confident in the work we've done, in the work ahead and our ability to build fuel and feed Under Armour into emerging as a stronger and better company for our consumers, customers and shareholders.", "With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Randy Konik", "Yes. Thanks a lot. I guess I had couple, two questions. My first question is for Dave. Dave there is a lot of moving pieces to the gross margin, I think the good news here is the gross margins moving up in 2018. Can you give us some perspective on some on the tailwinds that would be more sustainable to the gross margin beyond 2018 such as you mentioned some improvements in costing that you guys are seeing as well as, you mentioned that the promotional environment should be better in the back-half of 2018. So, I'm assuming that in tax, your gross margin in the front half of the 2018, so I want to get some perspective on how we should be thinking about long-term gross margin opportunity not maybe get the number, but you know some of the factors that you are looking at that kind of driving full gross margin on a, more than 12 month basis as we look out into the medium-term? Thanks.", "David Bergman", "Sure. And we definitely feel good about the 50 basis point increase. I think the start and maybe just understanding that some of the past headwinds are definitely diminishing. So, we are assuming less promotion in the back-half of 2018 versus 2017. That's a planned perspective, a brand protection perspective and we feel pretty good about that. So, you will see a little bit better basis point improvement in the back-half versus the front-half.", "But also as far as some of the headwinds that are diminishing, international is no longer headwind for us, that's trending favorably especially with when you think about Asia Pac being our highest growth region and also with are now highest gross margin region as well. So that's helping. We also expect less airfreight as we are not maneuvering through a major ERP system implementation this year, which created some elevated airfreight last year.", "And then also when you think about FX after years of headwinds, this is now shifted to a slight tailwind and then we're also as you mentioned seeing some early success from some of the sourcing initiatives, Colin Browne on the supply chain working really well with our vendor base, working on various initiatives there, but relative to visibility negotiation consolidation et cetera. We're seeing some benefits of that in the back-half of this year, but full year benefits in 2019 and beyond.", "And then I think, as some of the past headwinds are diminishing some of the past tailwinds are continuing. So, if you think about channel mix, we should continue to see positive impact there primarily driven by the higher DTC growth. So, in summary we feel pretty good about the 50% basis points and what that could mean for 2019 and beyond.", "Randy Konik", "Yes. It's really helpful. And then Kevin, congratulations on this Hovr technology, I guess what I wanted to ask around that is, since it's been, it looks like selling really on the website and new stores. What if you learned from, you are not just the technology, but the esthetic of what the product actually looks like, especially Phantom and success you had with design improvements? So, what we kind of take away that you guys learn and bring forth either and continued in the footwear or even in the apparel category or whether it would be on product design or marketing around these products going 2018 and beyond? Thanks.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Thanks Randy. I think one of the best things about our industry is as simple as it is at the end of the day. When it comes down to it, the consumer as a very basic expectation and we've defined that we call the tri-sector the Under Armour, and its style, performance and fit and that what makes us unique as a brand and I think what really makes our product differentiated is that when we deliver on those three things, first and foremost it looks great, number two, it's got performance through a technology in it which is what makes it Under Armour and as a reason and purpose for being. And then also just the comfort and the fit that goes into the product I think that's one thing that Hovr really exemplifies for us and our brand.", "It also it's a simple story, I think it falls on what we call a franchise, is that the consumer can look for, they know what it is, it was a program that we're able to execute globally, all around the world including we got a, we have one of our UA Hovr houses which will be kicking off in Los Angeles this week and then the All-Star Game, we've been and, uniquely been in Shanghai, so the team has really done a great job as our first two global launch. But I think it says it's very challenging it's that, the consumer comes to Under Armour for first and foremost great product that's delivered in design right way. But they also want to easily communicate it through a story.", "So, we believe we have massive opportunity, I think in footwear for us a brand and we think about footwear women's in the international being our three big growth drivers all that are now above $1 million for us and give us the ability to look to lean on. But, it really comes back, I think to just make it sure that the product is right.", "We've learned a lot of lessons in 2016 and 2017, there is nothing that says I think for any brand we'd be able to show up, put a logo on our product and assume we'll sell. It's got to hit that tri-sector and we feel pretty good about what we're doing. And beyond the fact is, the point of best thing about Hovr is just the discovery factor. A), it looks great, number two its probably one of those, one of not the most comfortable shoes ever put on your foot, I would look for the latter and number three hits also connected shoes. There is a technology in it that allows you to have this community clock that you can run with yourself and against friends and against seeing how many people having, how many miles have been logged on in that as well.", "So, it really is the first product that, I think really drives the manifestation between the digital and the physical what we've been doing with our Connected Fitness business and our teams in Copenhagen, San Francisco and Austin. So, like I said, that product is just a home run and I think you can look to see more of those type of franchise types of approach on a clearly communicator way going forward from this as well.", "Randy Konik", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Komp", "Yes. Hi. Thank you. Kevin, you've done a good job of really summarizing a lot of what's going on currently to address some of the issues, I want to take a step back, I know you've talked about the recovery is being really a two year journey for the company, and I love it, if you can maybe take some time to talk about specific examples that have given you more or less confident Matthew.", "Patrik Frisk", "I think I'll take this one -- this is Patrik here. I think some of the things that are giving us real confidence. Kevin touched on the Hovr story here, but I think it's the way we're now approaching everything that we're doing putting the consumer at the center of what we do. We've just completed as I said a major global consumer segmentation study as well as some other interesting work in the space where we compete which is giving us more insight into understanding where we can be competitive in the space. We're coupling that together with the process improvements that we've made around our go-to-market and are driving now a much more coherent calendar if you like which is also giving us a line of sight into improvements in the calendar as it relates to speed to market.", "So the teams are really starting to work much better together. And the reason, we're referring so much to Hovr is because it was the first time we were able to execute a 360 degree campaign a few weeks ago across the world simultaneously at the same time. And we clearly see that when we do that the consumer responds. So for us it's kind of the first showing if you like inside the new go-to-market. And that's one of the big things for us as we look into 2018 and beyond which gives us a lot of confidence.", "And the second thing is also as you think about efficiencies inside of the work we're doing around SKU optimization for example. The fact that we're driving 40% less SKUs more or less over a two-year period and 25% just in 2018 to 2019 alone also shows that when we put our mind to it and when we really understand the consumer in the space we're able to make those difficult decisions of what not to do as well. So that's giving us a lot of confidence in our team's ability to execute in this new environment that we're in.", "Kevin, I don't know if you want to add something to that maybe.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. I think it's important that as a company we really focused on scale over the last several years. And I think it's probably one of the most debated topics, if is it right, is it wrong, as you hear there. It's a decision that we made and frankly really glad that we're able to go through I think what many companies are facing especially what we're seeing right now is $5 billion brand. So having built that and one thing we know is, they're building a brand is frankly much more difficult than becoming streamlined the way we want to be in operations and so we feel like we've done one. What you're hearing from us is that we have a heavy focus to what we're going to build into we've done in 2017, what we're building into 2018 and we're not done and we're not going to probably take either one easy. We're going to focus on continue to be a great brand but, of course, getting operationally excellent.", "And the good news about this as Patrik said is, this journey began back in 2017. We made a lot of really hard difficult decisions from modifying our structure of going from a head of apparel footwear and accessories to category management with distinct categories that really like running and Soccer and Golf and training et cetera.", "We also upgraded our ERP systems with SAP and something that we're continuing to see the fruits of what that's going to mean for us going forward. And then, of course, bringing in the leadership with Patrik joining our team. So we have to say all three of these things are about seven months into it right now. And so 2017 was about us getting started and 2018 is about us really optimizing. And I think you'll see us do that. But we want to be clear there's a lot of work for us to do in 2018. But as I think hopefully you're hearing from us is that we feel very confident with the strategy and the plan that we have in place, so we'll keep running on that.", "Jonathan Komp", "Great. If I could follow up specifically on the cost efficiencies and SG&A reductions and I'm curious if you could share a little bit more on the pay scene of some of the benefits you expect. I know the guidance is for at least $75 million of savings by 2019. Will you be getting some of that this year? And then also, longer term when you look to get the G&A ratio back below 40%. Does that sound like a one year or a three year, a five year type aspiration, just curious how you think about kind of the duration of the path to get there?", "David Bergman", "And this is Dave. I'll give you a little bit of feedback on this year and what were driving through. I think we'll hold future years to our Investor Day, which will be excited to talk about later in the fall. But relative to what we're doing now first it's really just driving through a lot of it is the fixed cost and the committed cost that we're working on. If you think about it North America is deleveraging due to top line that's really distorts and imbalances SG&A even more.", "But, within the fixed cost area we've got global distribution center 3 PL expansion. We've got offices, facility run around the world, the FMS and IT systems. We've got pretty significant depreciation expense from previously higher CapEx years. Just to name some of those order areas. So it's not easy to slow down or turn off quickly. But we've made meaningful progress in 2017 going into 2018. When you think about those fixed costs they were growing well, well ahead of revenue in 2016 and 2017 and we're getting them much closer in line with revenue growth in 2018 which is great.", "And then, when you look at the variable expenses we've got to continue to prioritize there because we want to be able to support the growth in our DTC and International which are SG&A intensive. So it's definitely something that we're balancing in the mix appropriately. It's all about running smarter, leaner and more efficient.", "So when you think about the benefits from the 2017 restructuring, there are definitely benefits that we're already seeing in 2018, the benefits are bigger -- be bigger in 2019 and beyond. You're not really maybe seeing externally those benefits from the 2017 plan as well mainly because they are partially masked by those higher fixed costs and also the SG&A intensive international expansion and DTC growth that we're going through.", "So again, it's a little difficult to unpack the five years in five quarters, but we're driving hard and we're excited about what it means for 2019 and beyond.", "Jonathan Komp", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Edward Yruma", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like some strong enthusiasm around international results this year and your guidance for next year. You also talked about improving profitability there. So would you help kind of quantify how we should think about international profitability and the trajectory?", "And then as a follow up there's been a little bit of noise around covenants, so kind of comfort around your debt and the covenants that you have. Thank you.", "David Bergman", "Sure. This is Dave. From an international perspective, you're right. I mean we've been doing extremely well there. The teams in these international regions are simply amazing. I honestly I hope they're listening to this call and I'm sure they are because they've just been doing a phenomenal job growing in each of those regions and doing it in a brand right way.", "We've been exceeding 40% growth in the international regions for the last three years. When you look at Asia Pacific we're very bullish especially in China and Korea. We have the highest growth, but also with the sport and performance becoming more important culturally there. So we're uniquely positioned I think to capture and gain that momentum.", "Also in EMEA there's great strides and traction there with some of our larger wholesale partners along with accelerating DTC growth and helping to drive improve profitability there. Latin America, which is our most recent and the smallest international market right now, but quickly become a significant contributor to the international portfolio. So they have balanced growth in DTC and wholesale.", "To your point around profitability that's probably just as exciting or if not more exciting. From my position is that after years and years of investment in these international areas they are really turning the corner at this point and becoming profitable. And take an example like Asia Pacific becoming very profitable and really starting to contribute back to the consolidated pre-tax income of the company which is great to see, which we're also excited about what that means for future tax rates as well.", "So again, international up and down doing very, very well for us. Those teams have been amazing. We continue to drive on that together.", "On your other comment relative to leverage and the debt covenant. This is really a short-term issue partially it's the math with the 12-month trailing EBITDA. But due to the combined impact of two-year pivot period that we talked about with a little bit lower profitability and roughly two years or in total $250 million in potential restructuring charges. However, we do anticipate having over 50% available within our revolver even at our peak leverage points in Q2 and Q3. And we have line of sight to being free cash flow positive by year end.", "So we're in good shape but we do have some short-term pressure on the leverage ratio driven by the forecasted EBITDA. So we've been in discussions with our banks and we're in the process of obtaining an amendment to alleviate those short-term pressures. And we expect to execute quickly. So we feel like we're in a good spot to work through that.", "Edward Yruma", "Great. Thanks so much.", "David Bergman", "Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Jim Duffy", "Thanks. Good morning. My question is on inventory management, what are the key steps to bring inventory growth more in line with revenue growth and what are the expected consequences to the margin in doing so. There are a lot more clearance and discounting that you'll need to see before the back half of the year.", "And then, building on that what are the plans to improve inventory turns to more industry appropriate levels in the future and some of the steps necessary to get there?", "David Bergman", "Yes, Jim. This is Dave. I will start and then pilot Pat chime in as well. I think first just make sure we have the context around that fact that if you step back to October 31, we took over $300 million out of our top-line plan for 2017. And obviously, at that point a lot of that inventory had already been produced was either on its way to us or was already within our distribution facility. So there's definitely some overhang coming into 2018 that we're dealing with and we're going to be actively moving through that in a brand right way through our own outlet stores but also through our third-party off price partners which have been great as well.", "So we're going to get after that pretty hard in the first half of the year. We expect to be much more in line towards revenue growth in the back half of the year. And that's part of the reason why you'll see gross margin improvements a little bit more in the back half versus the front half. But as far as a lot of the different levers, I can turn it over to Patrik can give a little more color on that as well.", "Patrik Frisk", "Yes. I think it's for us very much also planning the business correctly right. So for us going into 2018 especially the back half we've thought about our planning differently. We talked a little bit about this SKU optimization that we're implementing and how we're now thinking more holistically around our inventory levels across our distribution, across our segmentation and that's going to continue into 2019 as well. So we feel that we're more in control if you like in terms of how we think about inventory across the world across our channels of distribution. And we feel that we're planning our business much better and that will accelerate through the back half of 2018.", "Jim Duffy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi. Good morning. The questions I have are around -- it's just different segments in the business. Can you talk about where you think you are in women's and in the youth businesses and how they trended in the fourth quarter and the expectation for 2018?", "Patrik Frisk", "Yes. I'll take that on here. This is Patrik. I think in terms of how we think about our opportunity for growth going forward we still believe that women's is a tremendous growth opportunity for us across the world. Together with of course footwear and we talked also about our international business. We believe youth continues to be a very, very important part of our business and an area where we want to actually increase our market share going forward.", "We have a lot of engagement especially in North America with youth and travel and club organizations. We have contracts with over 400 of those organizations across our business. We currently deal with about 1000 high schools directly with contracts out of the 16000 that exist and we sell through another 1000.", "So as we think about our youth business, it's currently in a state where we feel that we're going to be really having an opportunity to grow that also as we expand our direct-to-consumer and our e-commerce and digital business going forward. So we feel very good about our youth business.", "Our women's business we continue to invest into this. And remember we're about seven months into our category management where we really stood up our women's business in a stronger way. And as we're coming out of 2017 and heading into 2018, we feel that our assortment and our distribution is now much more put together and getting sharper. And that's what Kevin said before the SPF factor, the style performance and fit factor is getting that specific Under Armour point of view across much, much better in the back half of 2018. So we believe that as we look into 2018 and beyond with the category management that we put into place. With the understanding -- the deeper understanding of the consumer, with a deeper understanding of the segments where we're competing into, we're going to get a stronger and stronger business for women as we move forward across the world.", "Kevin Plank", "And if I could too Bob, if there's one thing about this brand is that kids love this brand. This brand was built because of the aspiration that the little boys and little girls put on our products, apparel and footwear and make them feel that they could jump a little higher, be a little stronger, run a little faster. And so that's something you'll continue to see as double down on.", "As far as the women's space again to echo what Patrik just said, we can just be better. So we're invested there. We're positioned there. But what you'll see from us is a brand that gets and understands that what we need to do for her is simply deliver on fit, style and color. And I think you'll see that coming up from us in a progressive way as we continue to get better and better in our women's business. But we believe in it, we're focused and we think that she likes us. We just have to do a better job, give them more reasons to buy Under Armour that's head to a toe statement as well.", "Bob Drbul", "Great. I guess the second question I have is, you talked about I think its 30% to 40% reduction in SKUs in the fall if 2019. Can you talk about your segmentation of product by channel with a lower number of SKUs and sort of where you think you are from that perspective?", "Patrik Frisk", "Well, I think it's really thinking through our distribution across the world right and every channel and understanding our positioning in each segment. And as we stood up category management about seven months ago as we've said here today and we've coupled that now also with a deeper understanding of the consumer and as well as our channels. We're getting just more pointed and we're getting a stronger point of view. We're taking out the noise if you like in terms of the SKUs that we believe should be driving our business going forward ensuring that every product that we put into every channel has the right price value equation, has the right SPF, style performance and fit equation.", "And we just looked honestly at ourselves and said listen what do we really need to drive the business in the brand appropriate way for each channel. And we made those hard decisions and that's what just you're going to start seeing from Under Armour going forward, us making those really hard decisions.", "Bob Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open.", "John Kernan", "Good morning everyone. Thanks to my question.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks John.", "John Kernan", "International seems to be obviously a real point of strength, Asia Pac was up over 60% in 2017. What are you learning about China besides that market, we can all see that the popularity of Steph Curry in China, two of your biggest competitors generate operating margins north of 30% in that region. So just want to know what you're learning about that market and how big you think it can be for Under Armour?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. I think I'll take it. I will go. Okay. So I think what's interesting for us in China is that if you compare us to most of our competitors we're still relatively small. And we're very premium. We've definitely come in at the upper end of the marketplace. Most of our distribution right now in terms of the direct-to-consumer business that we have there is positioned in the Tier-1 and into the Tier-2 cities. We believe we have an enormous amount of opportunity to continue to grow our brick and mortar business there. But what we also see is an expanding digital e-commerce business that is really resonating with the consumer.", "So we believe like Dave said earlier that our teams have done an incredible job in terms of positioning the brand in that marketplace. We're fortunate to also have some of the best athletes on the planet to support that business especially inside of the basketball category. And for us that's of course a great asset. I don't know, Dave if you want to expand on the gross margins.", "David Bergman", "Yes. I guess I'm just adding a little bit to that. The Asia Pac region is definitely going to be or continue at least in the near term to be one of our highest growth areas. But it also is becoming one of our most profitable. Their gross margins are strong and now that we've actually over the past years been building up the distribution structure that we need, the office structure that we need a lot of the foundation has been laid.", "So now Erick Haskell and his team in Asia Pac are really driving forward hard. And now that we've got some scale we can really start returning some of that profit to the bottom line. So we might not be driving right away to the profitability that some of our competitors have in the region, but I think we're trying to make sure that we go with the right pace to stay in line with the brand and make sure that we're working with the best partners out there and we're going get a good steady pace that's right for Under Armour and we'll continue doing that.", "Kevin Plank", "And just again to pile on sort of the energy excitement we have around Asia as a whole that started with Japan a relationship that goes back nearly 20 years now for the brand. So we've been there for a long time. China since 2010, but really amplified in the last couple of years due to the leadership that Dave mentioned. But we have a terrific team on the ground hundreds of doors opened in China last year. We'll repeat that again this year. There's a tremendous amount of capacity. We're now over 60 cities right now across China. And we see the ability for us to begin to backfill and obviously there's many more cities that we have the opportunity to go to as well. We just opened our largest store in Asia over 20,000 square feet. So I mean in Beijing.", "So we feel like we're in a really good position and really proud I think of what this team has put together, I think the opportunity that we have so great things. But international again we talked about going for scale in the last several years really doubling down and getting behind our international business is something that is paying dividends for us today as we are able to manage through North America right now and be able to lean on what we have coming in from the international markets.", "John Kernan", "Okay. Thanks. If I can just ask a quick follow-up on a North American wholesale market. Dave, what's was embedded in your guidance for North America wholesale as we go through -- go into the back half of the year when compares obviously.", "David Bergman", "Yes. I mean I guess a couple of things we mentioned a lot of the same factors that drove business in North America in 2017 are going to carry into 2018. I do think that we're going to be challenging ourselves to make sure that we're brand right and potentially tempering some of the promotional activity in the back half of the year and we plan for that accordingly.", "We expect there's going to be a little bit of additional contraction in the U.S. market as we continue to optimize our distribution there. There is a little bit weaker consumer demand driven by a variety of factors there that are impacting us that we talked about over the past. So we're not expecting a miraculous turnaround in North America.", "Again that's why we've been kind of talking about 2018 being fairly similar to 2017 and we're continuing to maneuver through that in the most strategic way.", "John Kernan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kevin Plank", "Thanks John.", "David Bergman", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad", "Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to ask about the comments you made early on about evolving the creative process that the product design and development process. Maybe you guys can elaborate on that and what your aim is and what you think the outcome will be in terms of elevating the company's ability to produce better products that are more relevant. Thanks.", "Patrik Frisk", "Hi, Omar. This is Patrik, I think what we're referring to there is the entirety of the process. And we're now starting out with the consumer first. And that goes for all of the teams that we have engaged. And the idea is that they're not just starting with the consumer first, they are starting out with the consumer first inside of the space where we're competing. So it's about purpose ultimately and making sure that to Kevin's earlier point the SPF factor, style, performance and fit is part of that equation all the way through. But it's being more purposeful in other words we're cutting SKUs, we're being focused on the consumer. We understand the space that we're going to be competing in. And as a consequence the design teams and the product development teams are being more focused around their execution. We believe that this will ultimately drive better product from us in both the short-term and the long-term. If you couple that with a great go-to-market process, we're actually both marketing and product start out together.", "We're having the teams joined at the hip as they go through the process that enables us to better build out our 360 degree approach to the consumer truly understanding the consumer journey as the consumer moves through the purchase journey and understanding each touch point for the consumer what they they're expecting from us at each touchpoint. And then, understanding what we are best delivering against that expectation for each touchpoint consistently time and time again.", "So a lot of it is about consistency and a lot of it is about the process itself enabling our teams both from a design product development and marketing perspective to learn and how to better [indiscernible] right in terms of incremental improvement for each season that goes by that gives us a lot of confidence going forward. I don't know Kevin, if you want to add on to that something may be.", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. Omar, I've got a pretty unique perspective of 21 years in this company, 13 now nearly as a public company in sort of the difference in being the ability to be an entrepreneur to be able to move from when there's a problem you just you go sit on the problem for a day, a week, a month until it's fixed. And the size and scale that we've been able to get through as a company, I think it's a real testament to the team and the hard work that we put in. But it also requires the process that we need. And while Patrik was such a great fit to be able come and help our organization as the industry experience and just the understanding really in the go-to-market process of being able to drive all the way through, to drive the calendar discipline and to put the things in place that as a growth company that was could build and just maybe make a few SKUs and put it in aisles and have second high and let it fly. That's not the case.", "Our competitors are very good and are the expectation, the shopping experience is incredibly competitive and something that we've got to be great at. And that means, we need to be great with a product that we put into the existing distribution, we did make sure and ensure that distribution is segmented. And so now because it translates and crosses over so many different languages, we've got to be simple in that messaging to. And so it really is a bit of a process that really has us rethinking the way that we bring product to market as a company.", "Our job is simple -- again it's not to be over complicated. Our jobs unlike consumers' where product exceeds our expectations. And we got to be able to tell in a really simple way. And one thing we know is that when we innovate we win and I want to be clear too for the call is that, while you'll see us talk about how incorporating style and of course to be Under Armour, let's have performance and the fit and comfort must be great. But, we do believe in our performance heritage. We do believe that the current perceived weakness of performance is something that's going to prove to be our long-term greatest strength.", "So we are not going to back off of that. You will continue to see us double down. But I'd probably use again Hovr as the archetype for as we make this definition of what is our brand. Our job is to make you better. And that's frankly where our new mission statement says. So every time [indiscernible] just going to make you little bit better.", "Omar Saad", "Kevin I was going to say it feels a little bit like as I listen to you guys talk about the brand and where its core competencies are and you mentioned I think focusing on running and men's training and women's training. Is it's hard to interpret from you guys that there's a little bit and I don't want to say back to basics, but back to the core and origins of what the Under Armour brand has stood for albeit on a global scale in a much bigger platform. Is that the right way to think about it, especially in the construct of the market seems to be moving so much towards lifestyle and sport fashion. Are you really kind of just carving out the Under Armour positioning in the marketplace as a performance leader, is that fair to interpret it that way?", "Kevin Plank", "Yes. We are not ignoring the market and I want to make sure people understand. We're not tone deaf. We just understand who we are and who we are as what's built this company that we have today. And I think what's exciting for everyone here and the reason that our team came to work in this brand to begin with is because the belief that they had that we could make athletes just a little bit better. And so there's a lot of people that are running the play right now. What it means to turn strictly to our lifestyle and frankly ignoring performance at some level. So what we're saying is that we get it. But we believe that every product that we make yet, it has to look great, it has to be stylish, but it has to have the DNA that makes it Under Armour.", "So again, when you see it, you should start with wow what an amazing looking product and b) wow is that Under Armour and c) is wow, if it's Under Armour what to do. That's the thing that makes it the DNA for our brand. And we won't be able to answer that with it's not just a normal sweatshirt, but you can wear this thing in a rainstorm.", "We want to be able to say that, it's not just a pant, but it's a golf pant with super stretch and you can spill on it or you can take mud or dirt and wash in the wash and that after the dry cleaners. So the things that make the DNA, the amount of science and technology and time that goes into the products that we build. I don't think we've got enough credit for. And I think other people are trying to enter our categories and not get and not probably do the homework that we do in order to put the products out in the marketplace that we do.", "So Under Armour special, when you see an Under Armour logo it means that the product does something it's doing something to make you better. And so we're going to make sure a) that comes through in every product that we have. We're going to make sure because I don't think we've been as emphasized on design as we can be to take credit because all of the cost and the structures been in the fabrications. So we're going to make sure that we're not going to back off on the fabrics, but you're going to see a bit more thought and a bit more finish and things are completely relevant to what we do. But it'll be marketing trend right and something that you'll continue to see us evolve into.", "Omar Saad", "Thank you. That's helpful to hear.", "Kevin Plank", "Thank you, Omar.", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's question-and-answer sessions.
