Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, April 26 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by giving you some high level commentary, Terry will then provide more detail in the first quarter results and some forward-looking guidance, and after that, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "In the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Slide 3 of our presentation provides a summary on the quarter. As is typical in the first quarter, seasonal factors impacted sequential results. However, on a year-over-year basis, we reported solid growth in revenues, earnings, loans and deposits.", "Turning to Slide 4. I would like you to focus your attention on profitability and returns. In the first quarter, our return on average assets was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.3%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.6%. We are proud of these industry leading results and we continue to focus on enhancing our performance. We expect our return to shareholders and our efficiency ratio to improve throughout the year as we gain market share in core business lines and benefit from the funding advantage afforded by our high debt ratings and superior deposit franchise. We expect to do this while maintaining the same expense and credit risk discipline our shareholders have come to expect from us.", "The U.S. economy continues to improve. Interest rates are finally in an upward trajectory and consumer sentiment reflects optimism for potential actions by the new administration. So, there is a lot of change and potential opportunity on the macro front, much of which could be to the benefit of the banking industry. I believe we are well positioned for this next phase of the cycle. During the first quarter of 2017, commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry. Our large corporate customers tell us that they are optimistic about the future, but are awaiting more clarity regarding potential changes in tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure spend and trade policies. Additionally, some of our clients are actively accessing the capital markets, which pulls some financing from the bank lending arena or result in reduced line utilization. However, we expect commercial loan growth to be better in the second quarter versus the first and we expect more robust commercial loan growth in the second half of the year.", "Let me talk more about profitability and returns. We are not interested in growing just to get bigger. We are focused on profitable growth. And that mindset is deeply ingrained in our culture. As a result, we are willing to forego volume growth to maintain an appropriate level of profitability. We have been doing this for years in our company. In the wholesale bank, we often acquired new customers by allowing them to utilize their balance sheet for some amount of time, but if we can transition that into a more profitable relationship, we call the relationship. That strategy has translated into client growth, higher revenue per client and better profitability. We apply this same logic in our payments business and every business line for that matter. High volume, low margin business can impair profits. So as an example, we are purposely allowing less profitable business in [indiscernible] to runoff. In the near-term, that\u2019s a headwind to top line merchant acquiring services sales and revenue growth, but those clients are being replaced by more profitable relationships. And that transition is setting us up well for the future. Terry will give more detail on merchant processing revenue during his remarks.", "Turning to expenses. Our efficiency ratio remains best-in-class, but it\u2019s higher than we would like it to be. As we said last quarter, we expect expense growth to moderate as certain risk management programs are fully implemented later this year. We are committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2017 with the support of top line revenue growth, careful management of expense and reduced cost pressures from compliance programs. And we will deliver that positive operating leverage without pulling back on prudent investment spending. We remain diligent on the topic of risk management. We feel very good about our credit quality and the overall credit environment. Our net charge-off ratio continues to be stable and the non-performing asset ratio improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis in the first quarter. But we will never take our eye off the ball or fool ourselves into thinking we will be able to predict when the churn in the business cycle will come.", "Finally, our capital position remains solid. We haven\u2019t been burdened by an excessive amount of capital that has weighed on the returns. That said we have sufficient capital to support growth, effectively manage through periods of economic stress and continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our tangible book value per share of $19.13 at March 31 was up 6.6% versus a year ago.", "With that, let me turn it over to Terry to provide details on the quarter.", "Terry Dolan", "Thank you, Andy. I will start with a balance sheet review and then discuss first quarter earnings trends. Slide 5 shows our loan growth trends. Average total loans outstanding increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis and grew 4.1% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Strong linked quarter growth in retail leasing and residential mortgages was essentially offset by modest declines in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lending. As mentioned earlier, the commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry during the first quarter. Our commercial loans declined slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the seasonal decline of corporate card balances, which are included in our commercial loans, our commercial loan growth was positive 0.2%. Somewhat offsetting this headwind in the first quarter was strong growth in middle-market lending across many geographies. Loan growth in commercial real estate reflects our own prudent approach in lending to certain CRE segments, such as multifamily and retail given current market conditions.", "Turning to Slide 6. Total average deposits declined 0.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting typical seasonal trends and lower funding requirements given the slower loan growth in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, average deposits increased 11.0%. Following the March interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit beta is about 20%. As future rate hikes occur, we model that the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level.", "On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality remained relatively stable in the first quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 50 basis points in the first quarter, up slightly by 3 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and 2 basis points higher than a year ago. Non-performing assets declined by 6.7% compared with the fourth quarter, and NPAs as a percentage of loans plus other real estate decreased 4 basis points to 55 basis points at March 31. Improvement was driven by commercial loans, commercial real estate, residential mortgages and other real estate.", "Slide 8 represents some information on two areas that have received a lot of attention lately by the investment community: auto lending and retail industry exposure. First, on auto, we are a prime lender in the space and we do not originate sub-prime auto loans. The average FICO score for originations in 2016 was over 770. Our credit metrics remain very stable in auto lending. The second area is the retail industry segment, given recent pressure, as consumers alter their buying habits. Commitments related to the retail industry totaled 3.4% at year end 2016. A little over half of that is direct C&I exposure to retailers, two-thirds of which are to investment grade or equivalent clients. We have minimal exposure to retailers who make their malls. We are watching this retail segment and are comfortable with our portfolio, given the relative small exposure, geographic diversity and high quality of customers.", "I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income of $1.5 billion was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, but was up 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter is impacted seasonally each year and this quarter was no different. Turning to Slide 10, total revenue declined by 2.0% on a linked quarter basis and grew 5.7% compared with the year earlier. The year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth funded by strong deposit growth and strength across our fee businesses.", "Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.0 billion in the first quarter, essentially stable with the fourth quarter despite fewer \u2013 two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest income was up 3.7% compared with the prior year, reflecting earning asset growth from a year ago. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income, which decreased by 4.2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and a decrease in mortgage banking revenue of 14%. The mortgage revenue decline was in line with our guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased by 8.4%, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue.", "I will highlight a couple of items within non-interest income. Trust and investment fees increased 8.6% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and improved market conditions, along with lower money market fee waivers. Credit and debit card revenue increased 9.8% on higher credit card sales of 8.5% and total card sales volumes of 6.2%. Credit and debit card revenue increased 6.8%, excluding the impact of an acquired portfolio. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher equity investment income. Merchant processing revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes. This is a slower pace than we have seen in previous quarters and reflects several factors, including the impact of higher EMV related equipment sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016, the margin impact of certain interchange caps implemented in Europe in late 2015 and our decision to exit certain high volume, low margin merchant relationships last year. We are growing merchant relationships in this business, but the impact to volumes and revenue is being muted somewhat by these factors. We expect this masking effect will begin to dissipate in the second quarter. By the third quarter, merchant acquiring revenue is expected to return to a more normal rate of growth, a trajectory of same-store sales plus about 2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes.", "Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense decreased 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects, professional services expense and marketing and business development. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 7.1%. Growth was driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses, reflecting the impact of merit increases, higher variable compensation, including performance based incentives and stock based compensation and hiring to support business growth and risk management programs. The increase in marketing and development expense reflected investment in the brand and various business initiatives. Other expense was up 6.2%, reflecting the impact of the FDIC surcharge, which began in the third quarter of 2016 and an insurance recovery last year.", "Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. In the first quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.", "I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. In the second quarter, we look for modest growth in net interest income on a tax \u2013 fully taxable equivalent basis, driven by improved loan growth compared with the first quarter and slightly higher net interest margin. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth are seasonally stronger in the second quarter. Additionally, we look for improved commercial loan growth in the second quarter as well. However, the timing of anticipated policy changes are difficult to predict. Also, given the current yield curve and rate expectations, corporate clients are continuing to access the capital markets, which may impact that growth in commercial loans in the short-term. Therefore, we think meaningful acceleration in commercial loan growth is more likely to occur in the second half of 2017. Finally, we remain disciplined in lending to the CRE market and growth in that category will likely remain muted in the near-term. We look for mortgage revenue to increase compared with the first quarter.", "The second quarter is seasonally stronger, as home sales strengthen in the spring and we are well positioned to gain share in the purchase market over time. Industry refinancing activity is projected to continue at lower levels, reflecting higher mortgage rates. Expenses will be seasonally higher in the second quarter, but as previously mentioned, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. Given the underlying mix of quality of our loan portfolio, we expect credit equality to remain relatively stable in the second quarter and we expect the loan loss provision to increase in line with loan growth. The taxable equivalent income tax rate was 27.0% in the first quarter compared with 28.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease reflected the impact of new accounting guidelines related to stock based compensation effective for the first quarter of 2017.", "We estimate the taxable equivalent income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 will be approximately 28%. Finally, in the first quarter, we provided notice to redeem all of our Series G preferred stock and issued $1 billion of Series J preferred stock. The total quarterly dividend \u2013 preferred dividend \u2013 the total quarterly preferred dividend for the quarter was $69 million. Included in the determination of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 was an additional charge of $10 million related to the Series G issuance cost. Looking to future quarters, given our current capital structure, the level of preferred dividends will be about $63 million in the second and fourth quarters of each year and $70 million in the first and third quarters of each year. Of course, the $10 million issuance charge will not reoccur.", "Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Terry. So to summarize, we feel good about where we are and how we are positioned and even better about where we are headed. I look forward to leading this company through the next phase of its evolution. Our Chairman and former CEO, Richard Davis\u2019 leadership has set us up well for the future. And I am grateful for his guidance and partnership over the last 10 years that we have worked together. Our businesses are strong and our culture of innovation is intact. So as I transition into my new role, you should not expect major changes to the strategic direction of this company, given our industry leading performance. You should expect an ongoing focus on innovation, continuous improvement in our customers and employees.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning John.", "John McDonald", "Good morning guys. I am wondering about the expenses Terry, what kind of step-up in expenses should we kind of be thinking about for the second quarter and just remind us, where does that seasonality occur, which lines?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. So if you end up thinking about the second quarter, we are going to typically see it growing probably 3% to 4% in the second quarter relative to first quarter. As John, we have talked in some of our investor conferences, we still expect pressure with respect to risk programs, at least through the end of the second quarter, with the trajectory of that growth starting to slow as we get later into the year. So when we think about positive operating leverages as far as expenses are concerned, we are pretty confident that we are going to deliver on positive operating leverage for the full year.", "John McDonald", "Okay. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t expect efficiency ratio improvement in the second quarter and it probably gets better late in the second half?", "Terry Dolan", "That\u2019s the way that we are thinking about it. I think it\u2019s going to probably start to plateau and then as it gets later into the year, it\u2019s going to start to come down.", "Andy Cecere", "So, John, this is Andy. I do think we are sort of at our high level. It will be flattish in the second quarter and then start to come down as we achieved that positive operating leverage in quarters three and four.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And Andy, what kind of loan growth outlook do you have nearer term? How much do you think you can get better in the second quarter and what drives your confidence that we could accelerate further in the back half of the year?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. So first of all, our starting point is a little higher versus where we ended the fourth quarter. Secondly, our pipelines are stronger. As Terry mentioned, a lot of our corporate clients were accessing the Capital Markets, so that did put a bit of a damper on loan growth. But the seasonality on home equity, what we are seeing on auto and what\u2019s going on with the corporate loan growth tells me that the second quarter is going to be stronger than the first quarter, but probably not as strong as what we achieved some quarters last year, but I do see acceleration here in quarter two.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then last thing, Terry, can you just give us some thoughts on the net interest margin? What are the puts and takes going forward for next quarter and how much improvement could you see? We got the March hike. And what do you think for the second quarter NIM?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. I think net interest margin as we said is going to end up expanding, but it\u2019s going to end up expanding slightly, I think in the second quarter. We do see growth in the net interest margin as we get into the third and fourth quarter. Part of the growth in the first quarter of 5 basis points, some of the factors that will help us as we go into second quarter is we are starting to see that inflection point in terms of the investment security portfolio, so that will help us a little bit. Cash balances will be a little bit higher, which will put some pressure on it. When we end up looking at kind of all of those, the growth quarter-over-quarter is going to be in the basis point or so.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari", "On the \u2013 back to the loan growth expectation, I know you indicated that as the capital markets weighed near-term, but you expect that could be strengthening. What type of annual growth rate do you expect for this year in overall loan growth? And then as you look into a more normalized macro improving type of environment, what is the go-forward loan growth that you think USB is capable of for next year, for example?", "Terry Dolan", "Right. So, one of the things that we talked about last quarter is that we thought that loan growth for the year would probably be in the 6% to 8% sort of range. And certainly, as we look at where the first quarter has occurred, that\u2019s going to be hard to achieve, but we think it\u2019s going to be middle single-digits, if you will, for the year. We also do believe that second quarter is going to start to get stronger and that\u2019s going to start to accelerate as the year progresses. And so as we think about 2018, we certainly believe that, that 6% to 8% is very reasonable as we think about the future.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then back to the expense topic. Appreciate the color you gave, but just looking at the efficiency ratio, more of on a long-term basis as well. I know you are sitting there at 55.5% for the quarter. How could we expect that, that will trend as we look into \u201818, if you can give a little bit of color? Thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "So John, as we have said, we expect our efficiency ratio to be in the low 50s and that\u2019s still our goal and our target and that\u2019s what we are planning to. I would say, again, that this quarter was at our highest level, our high point and we are going to start to achieve downward trend, particularly in the second half of this year and I would expect the same trend next year as we achieve positive operating leverage.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. And then lastly on the credit side, I know you indicated you don\u2019t originate sub-prime auto, but do you have a component of your auto book that is sub-prime that is migrated that way?", "Andy Cecere", "No. I mean, obviously, if somebody goes delinquent and they get scored out, they will wind up with a FICO below 620, but that\u2019s just normal migration. So \u2013 but I mean, we have a very high-quality auto loan book. The origination FICOs are 770 plus. On the leasing side, it\u2019s even a higher credit quality portfolio. FICOs are over 780. So anybody that winds up with a 620 or less FICO is just somebody that\u2019s probably lost their job and has payment issues.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Terry Dolan", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Matt.", "Ricky Dodds", "Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team. Just a quick question on the professional services line down quite a bit on a linked quarter basis, I was just wondering how should we be thinking about that line going forward and If the first quarter number is a good starting point to sort of model off of? And then maybe another question on the other fees line item, obviously that line item is a little lumpy historically. Wondering if you could remind us maybe what is in that line item that makes it so lumpy and then perhaps provide a good run-rate going forward? Thanks.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. So, let me take the professional services fee piece first, Ricky. And if you end up thinking about that, that is an area where a lot of business initiatives comes through and a lot of expense related too, for example, some of the risk compliance programs. It\u2019s also very seasonal. It\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s seasonally high in the fourth quarter. First quarter comes down to the levels that you are seeing and then it starts to ratchet up as business initiatives are put into place and as the year kind of progresses. So, we do expect that it\u2019s going to be a line category that is going to go up. As we get later into the year and especially as we kind of start getting into 2018 though I think some of the pressure related to professional fees as is related to risk management compliance programs is going to start to alleviate. And so I think that is an area for opportunity as we start looking at next year, but second quarter definitely is going to be seasonally up third quarter and then fourth quarter is usually the high watermark for professional services fees. In terms of other revenue, other revenue is a combination of a whole variety of different things. It ends up including equity investment income, some trading income, sometimes syndications \u2013 part loan syndications is a part of that, retail product revenue, insurance product revenue. And so it can be very lumpy depending upon what\u2019s happening that particular quarter. Year-over-year, it\u2019s up a little bit, but relative to the fourth quarter, we had some CDC syndication fees that were a part of that. So, it tends to be a little bit lumpy.", "Ricky Dodds", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.", "Saul Martinez", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. First, sort of a bigger picture strategy question. I know, Andy, you mentioned that you shouldn\u2019t expect any meaningful change in strategy, but wanted to ask about your branch strategy specifically. You haven\u2019t, since the crisis, really changed your branch count that much, especially relative to peers. You have also had very strong deposit growth over this time period and continue to. So maybe that\u2019s playing a role. But going forward, how do you think about the ideal network size, especially given changes in consumer behavior and frankly some pressure to achieve positive operating leverage?", "Andy Cecere", "So Saul, you are right. The branches are a great source of deposits. We recognize that. And I think that will become even more important as we move into a higher interest rate scenario. At the same time, you are also right that transactions in our branch are reducing. So, 60% of transactions today are done digitally outside of the branch. So what we have done and we will continue to do is change the footprint of the branch in terms of reducing the square footage and we have done that for the past few years and we continue to focus on that. We have also had some reductions in the number of branches and I would expect that to continue. So, overall, the footprint space, so to speak, in our branch network will come down. The number of people handling transactions will come down, but it does continue to be an important source of deposit growth. And for that reason, we will have branches as we do, but fewer square footage, fewer branches, less space.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. Do you give any sort of magnitude or sense of the magnitude of how much you are reducing square footage or the proportion of branches that are being refurbished or remodeled?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. From the number of perspectives, we have been calling branches in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 last few years and I would expect this to continue for the next couple of years.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it. And then a more specific question on credit quality, credit card specifically. The charge-off rates didn\u2019t move up, 37, I think a year ago, it\u2019s 32.6. So, obviously, there is some seasonality component quarter-on-quarter, but year-on-year, there is some increase, and I know you talked about retail and sub-prime auto, but anything there? What\u2019s driving that, anything to be worried about in terms of the trajectory on your credit card book?", "Andy Cecere", "Short answer, nothing to be worried about. As you recall, we have grown our \u2013 all of our loan portfolios throughout this cycle. So we do have seasoning impact there. We have had good \u2013 that acquisitions. We have had good organic growth, especially out of the branches. So there is nothing there that \u2013 we saw the same seasonal patterns and delinquencies, so we see nothing that concerns us. It\u2019s all within expectation. We expect that the latter half of the year, those rates will come back down depending upon the balance.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it, right. Okay. Can you remind me what you \u2013 I think you mentioned in your Investor Day, but what the through the cycle charge-offs are for your credit card book?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. I think we tagged that. It\u2019s either, like, 4.75 or 5, somewhere in that range.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. So you are still well within that?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes.", "Saul Martinez", "Alright, very good. Thanks a lot.", "Terry Dolan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Terry Dolan", "Good morning Ken.", "Amanda Larsen", "Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about the pushes and pulls on balance sheet growth, average earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in many years and I guess that balance sheet size the product of deposit growth in the opportunities that growing loans, but you remain out of cash into loans and securities also shrinking the balance sheet this quarter and I am wondering if this is \u2013 if this will be more indicative of your future plans and lower deposit, lower growth quarter as you focus on profitability over volume?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. I mean, so if you are all looking at just kind of the shifting of earning assets, I mean we are holding a little bit more cash balances than what we have in the past and that\u2019s for things like liquidity purposes, etcetera and the fact that we have had stronger deposit growth over the course of last couple of quarters. In terms of loan growth, I think we have kind of talked about the mechanics of that. Our investment securities is really going to grow in line with what our liquidity requirements are at any particular point in time. From a deposit standpoint, in terms of pricing, we are just really looking at being very competitive with respect to deposit pricing. But right now, deposit beta has been fairly inelastic. So we don\u2019t see a lot of changes relative to where we are at. I think it is fairly indicative in terms of what you are going to see going forward.", "Andy Cecere", "And Terry, I would say most of the fluctuation occurred in the fourth quarter was function of cash levels. And that can be volatile given the deposit flows and given the loan growth. So if you look at our loan portfolio that was up 7.2% [ph]. Our securities were relatively stable. And cash from around a bit, probably up a little bit more cash as we were before.", "Amanda Larsen", "Okay, great. And then fees were good across the board, can you talk about pipelines and commercial product revenue and also some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the payment line, it looks like corporate payment products may turn into growth, but that merchant processing slowed?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. No, I think that is true. I mean we did see really nice growth with respect to credit card. And one of the areas that I would also kind of focus on is in the commercial payments space. We saw some very nice growth. Linked quarter is about 4.7%. On a year-over-year basis is about 5.3%. It\u2019s one of the things we are seeing and we started making some business investment in that, a little over a year ago in terms of technology. We rolled out kind of virtual card offerings and innovations. And we are also seeing a little bit of a tailwind as a result of fuel prices getting a little stronger. So that\u2019s some of the things that are benefiting us. In terms of commercial business sort of spend, in that particular category. And then in the first quarter, we are starting to see government spend expanding a little bit up, which is a little bit unusual for the first quarter. It was up about 2.2% year-over-year. And we are seeing stronger defense spending in the sense of the election, it\u2019s maybe the way that we would categorize that. On the merchant \u2013 merchant acquiring and merchant processing revenue, I did talk a little bit about it. But again, the drivers behind the 1.3%, part of that is the foreign currency, so that gets you to about 2.7%. We, as part of the kind of chip and PIN sort of rollout in the whole \u2013 in that whole topic, our EMV equipment sales were strong at the end of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. But relative to the industry, we are more penetrated in terms of chip technology with about 66%, 67% penetration at this particular point in time relative to the industry, which is closer to about 40%. And so in the first quarter of this year, we are kind of just continuing to see that. Now, that will abate as we get into the second quarter and into the third quarter as well. And then I think the other thing that\u2019s been \u2013 the other two things that\u2019s been impacting that is that we just have margin compression that\u2019s been occurring in Europe because of the interchange caps that were put into place in late 2015. That\u2019s getting close to the end, which is good to see. And then as we said, we have been exiting some high volume, low margin sort of merchants. And so that has impacted revenue a little bit, but it certainly has impacted volumes. And so when we think about merchant acquiring revenue for the second quarter, we do believe that, that is going to get stronger as some of these factors start to abate. And it\u2019s going to become more normalized in the third quarter. And we think about that \u2013 we usually think about it in terms of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of what the revenues should look like.", "Andy Cecere", "And Terry, let me reemphasize something you said. The corporate payment systems in the past few years seems to have had a headwind either in the government side because of lower government spend or on the corporate side as some large corporations slow down their expense spending. This was a quarter that we actually saw growth in both. And that was very positive on the corporate side [indiscernible] some of that innovation on the government side because some of the increased spend. And we continue to expect growth in both of those. So that\u2019s an important turn in terms of the growth trajectory for corporate payment systems.", "Amanda Larsen", "Okay. And just one last one on the commercial product revenue thinking about pipelines into 2Q, I know you had a good quarter this 1Q, but then also last year 2Q is seems like a tough comp, so what you are seeing on that [indiscernible] activity, is it possible you can post year-over-year growth next February? Thank you.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. Well, certainly, on a year-over-year basis, we do believe that. The second quarter tended to be a little bit stronger last year because of some of the Brexit things in terms of second quarter. But the pipeline, in terms of syndication and fixed income capital markets, continues to be strong. We do expect, given the current rate environment and just kind of some of the things our large corporate customers are doing, that they will continue to access the capital markets. Our capital market revenue was up very strong in the first quarter. We would expect it to stay at higher levels going into the second quarter. So we think that that\u2019s a pretty good outlook. And of course, by those large corporate customers accessing the capital markets, that has been impacting our loan growth to some extent. But we do see that continuing.", "Amanda Larsen", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi, good morning.", "Terry Dolan", "Hi Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "So just wanted to ask a question on the trajectory of deposit costs from here, as you mentioned, deposit betas remained quite low, I did notice that there was a 10 basis point quarterly up-tick in money market savings and I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on perhaps a different competitive dynamics of the different deposit products and also you mentioned an eventual 50% deposit beta, but what is the realistic trajectory in 2017 if we only get one or two more rate hikes?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. So let me kind of talk about it. Again, betas overall, if we end up looking at December of \u201815, December of \u201816, March of \u201817, typically what we have seen and we are pretty much on track on this is well in terms of the March hike, is that deposit betas have been up about 20%, 20% to 25% kind of in that ballpark. We have a strong retail deposit base that represents about 50% of our overall deposits. And the pricing from that particular standpoint has been pretty inelastic thus far. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement in terms of retail deposits. And certainly for the next rate hike, I don\u2019t expect that we are going to see a lot of movements. There may be a little bit more pressure, but we still think there is room and opportunity there. On the wholesale side, which represents about 30% of our overall deposits, we are seeing kind of what I would say, selective competitive pressure and the deposit betas with respect to that or closer to the kind of 25% to 30% kind of in that ballpark. And then our corporate trust business, which will be unique to us, represents about 18% of our overall deposits. That tends to be a little bit more sensitive to interest rates. And so we are seeing pressure in terms of movement of interest rates is going to be in that space. As we think about kind of the rest of the year and certainly, the next rate hike or so, that 20% to 25% deposit beta probably starts to migrate to 30%, 35% and that would be \u2013 what I would think we would see kind of through this year. It\u2019s really going to depend upon how many rate hikes and how quickly they come. I just want to point out is that when we model a rate hike movement, certainly as we get a few rate hikes out, we are going to see deposit betas. There is going to be just more competitive pressure there in the future. So that\u2019s kind of how the way we think about it.", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you. And just as a second question. Andy, we totally get the message as a marketplace that it\u2019s going to be business as usual and no large change in strategy, I am wondering if you could remind us on how U.S. Bancorp, over the next 2 years or 3 years is thinking about inorganic growth in terms of use of its excess capital, especially in a world where your consent order is listed or you don\u2019t have any [indiscernible] restrictions in terms of inorganic growth?", "Andy Cecere", "Right. So we have \u2013 as you know Erika, we have been doing some portfolio deals, credit card transactions, some payments transactions as well as trust and fund services. So those types of things, we are not precluded from doing. They are high return, low capital usage businesses and we will continue to focus on them. We are precluded from branch transactions until we are out of the consent order. And we will look at opportunities there to increase market share, our depth of participation on market as that presents itself. But we are well positioned with both organic growth that we have today and our opportunities for acquisition with the current model. So we are not really prohibited from what we want to do.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of follow-ups on those questions that have come up, Andy can you remind us where you are in terms of your expectations for timing on when you get out of that anti-money laundering issue?", "Andy Cecere", "So there are three components with the concenter and I am going to ask Bill to fill in the details. But the way I think about it simply, there is the people process side and that we are done with that. The second is the technology component, which will be done this summer. And the third is the sustainability component, which is really a function of the regulators improving the sustainability. And that one has a little bit more in terms of uncertainty of timing.", "Bill Parker", "So Andy hit on it right. We got it late 2015. We had already been working on it for well over 1 year. So last year was a year of build, this year is a year of installing some of the new technology enhancements. We are pretty much at a full staffing level. So towards the end of the year, we expect to be able to demonstrate sustainability. And then from there, it\u2019s getting all the external parties comfortable with validations and etcetera. So that\u2019s how we think about the timing.", "Vivek Juneja", "Do you think you get out of the whole thing from the regulators by end of this year, early next year, any sense of where you think the timing lands?", "Bill Parker", "Yes. Again, towards the end of this year is when we will be demonstrating sustainability. So that\u2019s \u2013 after that, it\u2019s up to the auditors and regulators.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, great. Separate question, other income, which was up 16% year-on-year, you have mentioned in the release that higher equity investment gains, can you give us some perspective that\u2019s pretty nice jump in other income, what is the run rate of equity investment income and what is the dollar amount of equity investments?", "Terry Dolan", "I have never gotten into the dollar amount associated with equity investments simply because other revenue represents the whole bunch of different categories, I will tell you that as we think about the second quarter Vivek, that we do believe that the equity investment income is we are \u2013 going to be pretty consistent based upon anything that we see right now, pretty consistent with the first quarter. So we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of movement up or down in terms of equity investment.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Lastly, auto lease residuals, can you talk a little bit about that, there has been some concerns about that item, given concerns about lot of leases coming off in the next couple of years?", "Andy Cecere", "So Vivek, this is Andy. That has come back. So as you know, that was in the $700, $800 level last year, migrated down to about $200 of gain in the first quarter. But I will tell you in April, it\u2019s back up to the $800 to $900 level. So it\u2019s bounced back. Part of that it because it will slow down in production, which has eased the pressure on used car prices, so that has bounced back.", "Vivek Juneja", "Alright. Thanks Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, a couple of questions and follow-ups, one is on the deposit rates that you showed on your slide deck where for time deposits, you did increase this past quarter, but there was some outflow and I am just wondering, I know for quite a while, you have been shrinking time deposits, not necessarily most efficient way of gathering deposits, but I am wondering, from here on in is that strategy still hold or should we expect that you are going to try to regain some activity there?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. From a time deposit standpoint, that\u2019s really kind of a function of what sort of funding we need in order to be able to support loan growth. So in some respect it\u2019s kind of a function of how much loan growth we end up seeing. If we do continue to see rising rates, that we may have kind of change our pricing strategy a little bit with respect to time deposits, especially as we get into a period of time I don\u2019t know whether it will be the next rate hike or the following where retail deposits become more sensitive to rising rates. Then you may see us kind of shifting that strategy in order to kind of lock in some of the deposit pricing associated with time deposits. But right now, based on what we are seeing in the relatively inelastic retail deposits, I don\u2019t anticipate that we would change a lot.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then my other follow-up is on the commercial real estate, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not really looking to grow that line item and in fact strength of it being conservative, maybe just you can speak to some of the reasons why and touch on if any of that has to do with regulatory reviews or CCAR process, etcetera?", "Bill Parker", "Betsy, this is Bill. Last part first, none of it has to do with the [Technical Difficulty] regulatory or CCAR process. If you look at the CRE line and you look at the two pieces, the piece has been declining is the standing loan or mortgage loan part. So that\u2019s as other banks have offered long-term fixed rates or not interested in doing that, loving non-recourse. We are not \u2013 we have our set appetite for that. And then just the insurance markets, etcetera. So that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s been declining. On the construction, we enjoyed fairly rapid growth there for a while. That has slowed, but that\u2019s in part because of our own client base. They are getting more cautious on multi-family side and obviously, we follow our clients. So we do look at the high asset values in some of the CRE markets right now, some of the different markets. So our borrowers are cautious, our customers are cautious, we are cautious. But we still anticipate construction, both to grow, just not at the same rates that they used to.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just lastly on the C&I, I saw the comments around how large corporates are refinancing in the capital markets driving pay downs, a little bit of pressure there on the C&I loan balance, but what about the mid-market side, is that \u2013 are you seeing the same thing there and what degree of interest do you think there is in increasing loan utilizations, just separating out large versus mid?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. So when we end up looking at loan growth, C&I loan growth, we did see good growth in the middle market space. And so on a year-over-year basis, middle-market was actually up about 8.7%. And on a linked quarter basis, it was up about 2.5%. It represents about 13% to 15% of our overall portfolio. We are seeing that type of growth across the whole variety of different markets. We have seen good growth in places like Nevada, Utah, Colorado, here in the Twin Cities, Kansas City, Wisconsin, just kind of across the board. So as we kind of talk to our folks, we talk to our clients, we are not seeing the same level of access to the capital markets. So that impacts really more on the large corporate space. And we would expect the middle market to continue to grow. The other thing I would say is as we look into the second quarter, part of the middle market is our community banking space and we typically see lift in the second quarter as the ag lending starts to kick in and so both of those would be areas that we would look for opportunity as we think about the second quarter.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Yes.", "Andy Cecere", "I was just going to add one other thing that in the first quarter, we did see several hundred million of pay-downs in our energy portfolio and we don\u2019t expect that to repeat as the portfolio is stabilizing and improving, but we did have large number of pay-downs in the first quarter, so...", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just lastly the definition between middle-market and large corporate for you?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. It\u2019s kind of based upon size. It\u2019s about $10 million.", "Andy Cecere", "$10 million in sales, Betsy.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, the middle-market is the $500 million, above that\u2019s the large corp.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, super. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time today. Just a quick follow-up on the auto side. Given the decline we have seen in used car prices, I was wondering how you are thinking about the residuals on your auto lease book and how they might be performing relative to your expectations, in particular, just maybe you have increased the depreciation rate on those leases and just really how you are mitigating the residual risk on that book?", "Andy Cecere", "So Kevin, I mentioned before that the residuals have actually come back here in the early second quarter, back to the normalized levels, I would say. They dipped down in the first quarter. You are absolutely correct, but they did come back. We are already very conservative in the way we think about residuals and the way we book them. So we are not changing anything there and the market has come back.", "Kevin Barker", "Great, thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Andy Cecere", "Hey, Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Can you guys share with us the AHA data as recently as this past Friday showed the home equity loans continue to shrink for the industry. Yours have pretty much held in flat now for a year. Can you tell us what your guys are seeing in their frontlines, why this portfolio is not growing faster since housing prices have obviously come back quite a bit from the lows of the crisis?", "Andy Cecere", "Well, couple \u2013 I mean, we still \u2013 we have actively originated our product out of our branches throughout this whole cycle. So, we still have $1.5 billion, $2 billion of originations every quarter and we do pull our folks on what their intended uses are. And it is as you would expect on a traditional home equity, people want to improve the kitchen or whatever. But as home prices have really rebounded, a lot of folks are able to refinance out both first mortgage and our home equity line, lock in a new lower fixed rate. So I think that\u2019s what we are seeing right now is a refinancing of all, both the first and second loan, but our origination volume has held in there very steady.", "Terry Dolan", "And the growth in the utilization, I think, will drive growth.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, right.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Very good. You guys have been very steady and predictable on the amount of capital you return to shareholders. What kind of environment would have to develop where you may lift that number closer to 100% of earnings or slightly above it?", "Terry Dolan", "Well, Gerard, we are in a good spot right now. Our capital levels are such that \u2013 and our returns are such that our capital formula works. In other words, we are able to generate enough to return that 60% to 80%. We are at the high 70s right now and still accommodate balance sheet growth. So, I don\u2019t see a scenario that we are getting to that 100% as far as the near-term as long as we are continuing to achieve balance sheet growth, which is what I expect. And again, we are in a good spot. We are not sitting here in a big excess position today.", "Gerard Cassidy", "No, I agree. I totally agree. And then finally, when you guys are talking about the inorganic growth acquisitions, obviously, depositories are off the table for the time being. Are you \u2013 would you consider \u2013 or can you purchase a wealth manager if you felt that fit into your current wealth management strategies?", "Andy Cecere", "Components of the wealth business, we could do that and it is a level of \u2013 area of interest for us. Wealth is one of our growth businesses. We are doing a great job organically already, but if there are opportunities that present themselves, we will take a look.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. And Gerard, what I would say is that in that particular space, we are not interested in what I would call traditional asset managers, but where we found a good fit in terms of a real wealth manager, I think those are things we would take a look at, because culturally, that would be a better fit for us.", "Andy Cecere", "Exactly.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Brian Klock", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, Brian.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, Brian.", "Brian Klock", "It\u2019s a follow-up question. And actually I missed I had to jump off a little bit so I might have apologized if I answered this already. On the loan growth side and thinking about the NII growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, I mean, should we be thinking about last year\u2019s second quarter, you had a really strong 1.5% on annualized growth in total loans. Like with the commentary about maybe some slower rebound for the second half of the year in commercial, should we be thinking about with overall 1%ish maybe loan growth into the second quarter on a linked quarter basis? And does that sort of drive the NII growth quarter-over-quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "So Brian, we achieved 2.2% in the first quarter. What we said is given the pipelines, the expectations of some seasonality we expect that to accelerate into the second quarter, but not likely to get to that 1 and 1.5. So the way you can think about it is sort of 0.2 to the mid 0.5 somewhere in that area.", "Brian Klock", "Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess kind of follow up on the auto leasing side. There has been some pretty strong growth year-over-year. Just thinking about if there is the issues around the residuals and how that may impact the amount that\u2019s financed by the purchaser. I guess, you guys think that you may see some slowing growth in that \u2013 the auto leasing book?", "Terry Dolan", "Our leasing group is doing a great job. They are taking share. They have a great product. They have been consistent in the marketplace, good turnaround time. So I think that continues to be an area of opportunity for us. And as a reminder, everything we are doing there is prime. So, it\u2019s good business and it\u2019s good credit quality business.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. Brian, the other thing that I would end up saying is that if you end up looking at the competitive landscape, we offer both the retail leasing as well as the auto lending. And so when customers come into the dealership then we also have very strong relationships with the dealership. So when they are coming into the dealer make a decision upon about buying a loan or buying a car or leasing that car, we have the ability in that prime space to be able to go either way. And I think that\u2019s, from a competitive standpoint, one of the reasons why we see the growth.", "Terry Dolan", "With longstanding relationships.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes.", "Brian Klock", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for your time guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Brian.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. Thanks, Brian.", "Jen Thompson", "Okay. Well, thank you for listening to this review of our first quarter results.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight time through Friday July 22nd, and 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. ", "Jennifer Ann Thompson", "Thank you, Mellissa. And good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard David, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results and to answer your questions.", "Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbanc.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking statements are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Jen and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with the summary of reported highlights on slide three of the presentation. I\u2019m pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. ", "The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally we recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and the $40 million charitable contribution. I\u2019m very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both a reported as well as a core basis.", "Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses. While we saw a reduction in our linked quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis.", "Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year, and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. Credit quality was stable for the second quarter as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year. And we recognized a modest improvement in non-performing assets, which was driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits. ", "Slide five provides you with a five quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry.", "Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The industry continues to face headwinds from low interest rate environment and the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. ", "The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second half results, if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would that given the current yield curve and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near-team, that the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. ", "Expenses excluding the notable items increase 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range. And our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. As projected, quarter two expenses included a linked quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance related costs. ", "As we look out to the second half of the year, we\u2019d expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked quarter growth reported in the second quarter. ", "Turning to slide six, the company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sales, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee based businesses, including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses.", "We also saw strong results from our capital markets business, as we were well positioned to provide product and services to customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility.", "Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015.", "Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in the held for sale in the second quarter of 2015 loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year.", "In the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition.", "Finally, home equity loan growth continued reflecting the year-over-year increase of 2.7%. On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6% meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.3 billion, or 2.4%.", "We currently project linked quarter average loan growth in quarter three to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarters. Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and were up 3.9% on a linked quarter basis.", "On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low cost deposits, which includes our non-interest bearing and low cost interest checking deposits and more than offset the run-off in higher cost time deposits.", "Turning to Slide eight, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remain relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-off increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year, and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis.", "Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. Compared with a year ago non-performing asset increased $95 million or 6% mostly due to the down grade that occurred in prior quarter due to recent energy credits. Linked quarter non-performing assets improved 3% or $47 million driven mainly from improvements in our energy credits.", "Slide nine provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments were to customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the completion of our spring borrowing base redetermination on reserve-based loans within our energy portfolio.", "During the second quarter criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million principally driven by pay down. Finally credit reserve associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for our energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio we expect linked net charge-off and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016.", "Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable period. Second quarter net income excluding notable items increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. On a linked quarter basis net income excluding notable items decreased by $114 million or 8.2% mainly due to the seasonality in certain fee businesses partially offset by higher non-interest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense represents our brand advertising.", "Turning to slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1 basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate offset by lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.", "Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans was offset by a 4 basis point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.", "Slide 12 highlights non-interest income, which increase $100 million or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increase in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased capital market fee -- which was mainly due to increased capital market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.", "Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired portfolios. Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7% reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial freight platforms.", "Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3% excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes. Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent volatilities. On a linked quarter basis non-interest excluding the Visa Europe sale increased $223 million or 10.4% principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payments mortgage banking and desposit service charge fee category.", "Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3% and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0% primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Commercial product fees increased $41 million or 21%, mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was inline with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volumes. We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter three.", "Moving to slide 13, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased $160 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis; higher compensation expense mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation. Higher professional service expense principally related to compliance activity and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. ", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost again reflective of the investment in brand advertising. Higher professional service fees -- expenses principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.", "As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year however at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we\u2019ve reported for the second quarter. Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but so let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC search charge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into third quarter. These two items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth.", "In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked quarter increase is reflected of recent preferred stock issuances with a semi-annual dividend payment that will repeat again in quarter four. ", "Turning to slide 14, our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29th, we announced that Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced the $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1st and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.", "Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirements. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30th, representing 10% increase over the same quarter of last year and 3% over the prior quarter.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Kathy. I am proud of our record second quarter results. We maintained our industry leading performance measures and we reported an 18.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However we remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to grow revenue and prudently manage expenses while strategically investing in our business to create value for our shareholders. ", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Hi, John.", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning guys. Richard I was hoping if you could provide a little bit color on loan growth. What\u2019s gotten better and what\u2019s keeping you the confidence the expected trend to continue? It sounds like you might expect more of the same maybe little bit more color there.", "Richard K. Davis", "Sure happy to do it. And we\u2019re expecting more of the same pretty much what we\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters. I\u2019ll have Andy to give a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses. But I will say it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter-after-quarter. Where on the wholesale side, you\u2019re seeing increased capital markets activity that in fact move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A related activity.", "So on the wholesale side, we\u2019re not still not seeing the kind of organic growth we\u2019d like to see, but we are pleased as we said in our comments that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn\u2019t use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the capital markets.", "On the consumer side we\u2019re seeing all areas moving slowly, but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit card to home equity. And then we particularly have good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area.", "So it\u2019s a lot of the same John, but everything has got generally positive slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity that wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see that gets evidenced in a more healthy and robust economic environment. Andy, do you want to add some color there?", "Andrew J. Cecere", "Richard, I\u2019d add in that. So we did see record revenue in our commercial products groups and you saw that our credit fixed income, or FX or municipal products all were up at record levels, somewhere between 40% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, and again, that\u2019s reflective of a tremendous bond issuance that was occurring here in the second quarter. We did continue to see strength in auto lending as well as residential mortgages again principally due to the rise in the jump [Inaudible] and commercial real estate also grew a bit this quarter also, which is a little bit of a reversal of the trend.", "John McDonald", "And maybe Bill can follow-up. You had good credit results this quarter, I think the outlook was for a relatively stable, I was just wondering, if you might need to build some reserves, if the loan growth remains healthy here?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, I mean, we\u2019ve started that. So we are adding, we\u2019re done with the days of releasing and we are adding to our reserve. So we are mindful of that. As I said for quite a period, there is still probably room in the existing portfolios, specifically residential, home equity, where we do have -- we continue to see improvements in home values, et cetera. So that could allow for releases out of those portfolios, which does help offset some of the loan growth. But we are in a position, where we feel it\u2019s prudent to be adding to our overall reserves.", "John McDonald", "And is this quarter a pretty good indicative pace for now Bill?", "P. W. Parker", "For now.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And in terms of the NPAs and charge-offs can you just repeat what your outlook is there?", "P. W. Parker", "Yeah it\u2019s pretty -- very stable really across the board. I mean, if you look at each of the asset classes C&I is surprisingly low in this quarter, we had -- we felt we were very got out ahead of the energy issues in the first quarter, and this quarter we had no material energy charge-offs, in fact we have nice recovery on one of our credits. So we feel like we\u2019ve got the energy with $50 a barrel anyway, that we have the energy issue behind us. And if you look at the other asset class, it\u2019s all very stable.", "Richard K. Davis", "Just add to that, Bill I would add, we marked our portfolio at $35 a barrel for the second quarter. And we have no intention of releasing that reserve for some time and we see sustained higher levels of value on oil, but we do have at 8.8%, we think sufficient coverage and provision, and we\u2019re quite pleased with how that portfolio is behaving at this point.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital.", "Richard K. Davis", "Hey, Jon.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe Richard, a question for you, expenses. Maybe about a year ago, you gave the chin up bar analogy on rates remain low; you might have to be tougher on expenses. I appreciate all the guidance, it looks like maybe professional services can start to moderate a bit maybe marketing to maybe there is some other offset, but maybe your latest thoughts long-term expense management, efficiency if the rate environment remains challenging.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah, I appreciate that. So a picture of the bar fell up there, promising [ph] like crazy. Both knuckles are white, but we\u2019re hanging in there. A couple of thoughts Jon, I want to start by saying, I\u2019ll give you guys forward looking view that we intent at this point, at least for the second half of the year to stay in the 54% range. 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio.", "And I\u2019m giving you that, because I don\u2019t know exactly with no interest rates, flat -- very flat yield curve and that can move either than can move anytime and it seem to be very volatile. We\u2019re not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it\u2019s getting a lot harder. And I\u2019d rather just tell you guys that we\u2019re going to stay at the same current level and we\u2019ve been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I\u2019m saying is we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program.", "We\u2019ve got an FTE hold in the company that look for any growth items and areas of compliance. We haven\u2019t added those now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the non-critical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is it\u2019s right up to the line, where it would start to impair our new growth. And you guys invest in us not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long-term, and we\u2019re going to be very careful not to over react. And we have been careful so far not to do that. ", "So our expenses will go up as we said less than the 3.4% linked quarter, next quarter would be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will in the FDIC premium cost and in the CDC, which typically has higher expenses in the second half. So rest is just core part of adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts it did peak this quarter starts to come down. So I\u2019ll tell you it comes down very slowly. So it\u2019s not a big measured improvement. But it is at least a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter I hope on record.", "So that gives you a little more color and I think the 54% range that gives us enough room to have surprises during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we\u2019re not going to do something it get to 52 and I don\u2019t see this thing moving into 55s or 56s.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe quickly just an update on the consent order and once lifted what really changes in your mind?", "Richard K. Davis", "Sure. So the consent order as you know is preclude us from whole bank transactions particularly things with branch banking and as we go through this consent order it takes quite some time not only to get things where they need to be, but to sustain and improve that they stay there and we are in those processes now. So I have no idea what the exit time will be, but we are working closely with our regulators to make sure that we have permissions particularly to be released from any part of the consent order first if that\u2019s helpful to us to get back into the traditional M&A business.", "However, I remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities none of those are precluded under that order and those have been exactly the things we have in the last five years consistently as part of our M&A.", "So we haven\u2019t been precluded from doing what we wanted to do and as I said before there hasn\u2019t been a bank deal or a branch deal that we wanted since the Citizens Chicago deal that we\u2019ve included from. So our goal is to get out of it as soon as possible so we don\u2019t have any barriers on our options. But for now it\u2019s not impairing any of ability to run the company or find opportunities to acquire.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Miller with FBR and Company.", "Richard K. Davis", "Good morning, Paul.", "Timothy Hayes", "Hey, guys. This is actually Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. What is your view for mortgage revenues in the second half of the year given where interest rates are today, are you guys seeing any pick up in resize yet and do you think that\u2019s a tailwind to fee income from lower rates could offset the detriment to margin?", "Andrew J. Cecere", "This is Andrew replying. So our second quarter mix was about 65% new purchases and 35% refinancing. So I would expect that to go closer to 60-40 in the second quarter and given that coupled with the normal seasonality I would expect mortgage fees to continue to increase in that 20% to 30% range.", "Timothy Hayes", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Andrew J. Cecere", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "Richard K. Davis", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari", "Good morning. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on the merchant processing revenue it looks like a little bit light from where I was looking for this quarter, I just want to see if we can get some of your updated trends that you are seeing on the merchant side? And then separately for the payments business just overall revenue trends that you can expect here I know we\u2019ve seen a pretty good rebound in that business, but wanted to get some color on your outlook. Thanks.", "Andrew J. Cecere", "Okay. This is Andy again. Let me start with merchant and you are right there are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same store sales. And same store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8% and in Europe they were up about 5%. So globally up about 2.6% and what you typically see from us is same store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. ", "What happened this quarter is while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis if you exclude FX that\u2019s up 3% that is also now flattening now revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up, they are sort of leveled up, we\u2019ve lapped that so to speak.", "The other things you will see are transaction volume is down and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did have impact on transaction volume, but as you saw not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarter I would expect again same store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume.", "You asked about the other payments business so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding fidelity we were up about 6% and that\u2019s driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7% and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally on corporate payment systems, very good story there is that we are seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat our corporate fee income is growing, transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6% and that\u2019s a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong.", "Richard K. Davis", "I\u2019ll add to that, this is Richard. Just if you are going to bring up proxy question I\u2019ll help you out here. For Brexit, first of all it\u2019s not material and it\u2019s pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere it shows up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall those of you who followed us for a decade, we started our business merchant acquiring business in the UK that\u2019s where it\u2019s actually headquartered. So a disproportion amount of business is in the UK. And actually if there is a lot of prognosis I believe there will be a lot of travel and visits and spending over the UK which is net positive for us.", "And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail, hoteliers and airlines that could be quite positive as well offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption. So we\u2019re seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to not material to maybe even little bit positive. ", "As it relates to our employees, we have a few hundred employees that are working in the UK and or in around Europe that would either have to have past reporting circumstances change for them because they\u2019re either UK employees working in Europe or European employees working in the UK that\u2019s something that will roll over the next couple of years. There is no rush to it and there has been no reaction there we\u2019re not changing any of our strategies as a result of that.", "John Pancari", "Okay great. Thanks for all that color, it\u2019s helpful. And then just separately on the commercial real estate portfolio, pretty good growth this quarter and looking actually at the construction piece saw a pretty good jump there. So wanted to see what you\u2019re seeing on the commercial real estate side in terms of where the growth is coming from? And do you expect any moderation from regulatory scrutiny around CRE trends right now at all. And then lastly any credit concerns on that front because we\u2019re hearing a little of that too? Thanks.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah I will go first, I want to go first on that. CRE has got as you know for our company is one of the areas we want to be particularly conservative in much as we love it and we\u2019re very big in it. And so the scrutiny it\u2019s high in the industry I\u2019m quite comfortable that the scrutiny will not be placed here because we\u2019ve been conservative for a decade and we continue to be underwriting. I\u2019ll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity. And our guys are filling it with a lack of buyers coming particularly from the life insurers has affect the refinance and purchase activity, which only serves to say that there is a reduced pace to payoffs.", "So part of the increase is actually good news we\u2019re keeping the customers we have. But we\u2019re not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or at pricing change. I think the portfolio will prove itself more overtime.", "Andy and Bill can add little color about where the growth is and where we see the pockets of strength. But we love this business; we\u2019re very good at it. But I promise you we\u2019re just not going to get greedy at a time like this in the marketplace on terms or underwriting. Because it\u2019s easy to do and it\u2019s not going to happen here. So Andy you might go first.", "Andrew J. Cecere", "Well to follow-up on Richard\u2019s point. If you look at our construction loan activity, you see that that\u2019s been increasing fairly consistently over the last five or more quarters. What\u2019s changed is that commercial mortgage or standing loan permanent loan where the attrition has declined and actually reversed this quarter, very slight increase. And that was what Richard was highlighting. I mean the strength has been it continues to be on the coast especially the West Coast for us and through a lot of our REIT clients they have been very active.", "P. W. Parker", "And that's what I was going to say. California, Pacific Northwest is where we\u2019re seeing insurance activity. ", "John Pancari", "Great, all right. Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Siefers", "Good morning, everybody. Richard I was hoping either you or Kathy could extend upon your comments on the margin from the beginning of the call. First I want to make sure I understood it correctly. I think when you characterize they\u2019re down 3 to 4 basis points. I think you were talking about the second half, but is that three to four basis points per quarter in the second half or in the aggregate for the second half. And then I guess the broader question there is, at what point would you guess that margin compression would stop in this kind of pressure grade environment? Because I guess there are two big issues with the securities portfolio reinvestment risk and then there is still kind of wide gap between your loan and deposit growth. But just curious to hear your thoughts on both of those phenomenon.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah thanks, Scott. I think we got to question five before we got to NIM, that\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ll be very clear, what we said it was in quarter three which is all we can see into. We have a 3 to 4 basis point prediction of NIM decrease. I have no idea what quarter four would be. As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September, 36% for December. Better than zero worse than it was when we talked last time. So we\u2019re not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also the 10 years above 150 again thank god. That is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there is an equal impact on the income statement based on that. ", "So if we can manage through these very worse time which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low tenure. We can manage through just about anything which is how we\u2019re building the lower for longer kind of term around the company.", "So for one quarter we can see that pressure. We can\u2019t predict beyond that. I\u2019ll have Kathy talk a bit more about the sequencing and the importance of the refinancing that occurs in the securities. And the fact that we\u2019re actually seeing stable performance in most margin areas for compression as it relates to competitors.", "Kathy Rogers", "Yeah. So well he is exactly right. We\u2019re looking at into the third quarter and we are down about -- we are projecting that we\u2019re going to be down in that range of 3 to 4. But I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s going to be a lot more of what you\u2019ve seen. So as the rate curve has kind of flattened although some signs of improvement here most recently. That\u2019s going to continue to have an impact on our securities portfolio. So we\u2019ll continue to see a decline in that. ", "And then the rest really you have to look to our loan growth to the extent that we continue to grow our wholesale loans little bit stronger than our retail loan that\u2019s also going to put a little bit of compression going forward.", "Richard K. Davis", "So Scott, let it be said at the end, we remind you that net interest income will increase in quarter three. So we can out [ph] on this in the outset growth, but it\u2019s going to be continued more challenging until we get interest rate increases around that.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay, terrific. Thank you guys very much. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Houston with Jefferies. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Hi, Ken. ", "Kenneth Houston", "Hey, good morning everyone. Just as a follow-up on just the balance sheet mix, with still have a really good loan-to-deposit ratio. You\u2019re still growing deposits and I see you\u2019re able to remix from the short-term borrowings this quarter. Given that low rate scenario we\u2019re dealing with, at what point do you decide to just try to remix just more into loans less into securities given and understanding that you need to keep LCR. But does anything structural change with that thought process around just asset liability management?", "Richard K. Davis", "No it doesn\u2019t Ken. And we\u2019re nowhere near those lines. I mean we take what the market gives us and then make sure that we apply it appropriately to the balance sheet and therefore the income statement. But there is no -- we're not near any of the line where we\u2019re evaluating the value of even deposits. We're self-collecting deposits and happy to take them because they will be more necessary in the future. And we\u2019re pricing loans at the right level to win the high quality and the securities portfolio is kind of a result of all of that. But it wouldn\u2019t be a driver it would be a follower. And there is nothing in our strategy that\u2019s going to change at this stage. And there is nothing that\u2019s getting us close to edge where we have to sit down and strategize on our balance sheet as it relates to a mix or an area of that appetite that we haven\u2019t already demonstrated.", "Kenneth Houston", "Understood. And then on the deposit side, I think a lot of banks are starting to still see a modest tick ups on the deposit pricing side. What are you guys just seeing in terms of customer behavior in terms of product choice and any cost that you have to hand along even though we\u2019re not really getting it on the left side of the balance sheet?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yeah, we really haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of shift. Really the consumer has really no rate change whatsoever on the consumer. We talked previously that we did have some repricing on our wholesale side some of that was just contractual that happened to other if as we work with our customers. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s been relatively stable as we look into this quarter.", "Kenneth Houston ", "Okay. Last one real quick one, the preferred dividend Kathy, does it go back to the first quarter 57 in the third quarter?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yeah. So it\u2019s a quarterly payment. So first and third quarter will be at the lower rate, second and fourth quarter will be at the higher. Yeah about 60 I would say, 60 in the third quarter, about 80 in the fourth quarter. ", "Kenneth Houston", "Okay, thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis", "I am glad you asked that because that gotten just neither didn\u2019t telegraph well or just gotten missed in a lot of the models. And it\u2019s real money and it's also real value. So I\u2019m glad to have that clarity. Thanks for asking it. ", "Kenneth Houston", "You bet. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. ", "Mike Mayo", "Good morning, Richard. So in the battle Richard Davis, first the tenure I think you\u2019re kind of getting obliterated.", "Richard K. Davis", "I think so. They are definitely winning, I\u2019ll tell you that. ", "Mike Mayo", "On the other hand, you do have some accelerating loan growth. I know you talked about loan growth here. So originally you\u2019ve mentioned economic growth couple of years ago accelerating, improving and then tenure goes down and that\u2019s why I brought the comment initially. So if you look at the tenure you\u2019re really loosing, if you look at your accelerating loan growth maybe you\u2019re winning a little bit more. So I\u2019m just trying to make sense of as the markets for you do business improving or not?", "Richard K. Davis", "Mike it\u2019s a great question. They are improving slowly, but I\u2019ll tell you what, I wish I\u2019ll be here 10 years from now to prove that, but we are taking market share, swear to god honest Injun. We are taking market share. We have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio it\u2019s still growing, albeit slightly, but that\u2019s been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans we\u2019ve never got not of it, so we are selling it big, leasing or now one of the few players literally quite capable at it we\u2019ve been doubling down on credit cards and you are seeing some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it\u2019s mostly in market share, there is not a market that\u2019s actually weaker than it was a year ago, but for intents and purposes there is not a market much stronger than it was either.", "And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident and I don\u2019t mean the original old unconfident we\u2019re always uncertain. But things with a Presidential Election in the offering things like Brexit uncertainties we don\u2019t need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America a reason to just wait and but for M&A and for restructuring their balance sheet corporate America is not organically doing big things at least not needing banks in that process.", "So that\u2019s when the thing really starts to take-off. But in the meantime we are all getting it out in the trenches, trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have. And I just think the right answer as much as it\u2019s hard to prove is that we are doing it in our case with market share growth.", "Mike Mayo", "And so the answer to my question -- that is helpful. But if you strip all that away do you think things are improving generally or not or it\u2019s just kind of the same old?", "Richard K. Davis", "I think I meant to say every market is a little stronger than it was last year. So yes, but not very much.", "Mike Mayo", "Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Richard K. Davis", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could share a little bit of color on the CCAR results. I was a little bit surprised how the regional banks faired in terms of their stress ratios or PPNR assumptions relative to last year. I am wondering if there is any color that you could share with your investor base on that? And also Richard I\u2019m wondering if the CCAR results and how acquirers were treated in this year\u2019s results at all impact your thinking about future acquisitions?", "Richard K. Davis", "Let me say first of all we were very pleased with our CCAR results. I always joke at the stress test and it\u2019s effective because we are stressed the whole time. Also be reminded we haven\u2019t had the final exit exams on all the details and you also know we\u2019ll never know exactly how the model works. But I\u2019ll remind you that in this particular cycle the negative interest rate scenario was added and that\u2019s hard for any of us to predict exactly how that fair for each bank. But I know that that had an impact on what was likely the PPNR for every bank.", "As you know we continue to be at the top on the PPNR bearly in this case we are slightly below break even, but in the years past we\u2019ve always been above and I think on a relative basis we even performed better. So I\u2019m not concerned about trying to predict that and I think that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not on a most stressed scenario we would be okay.", "Acquirers had more limited capital distribution and so we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor to us because it\u2019s not as relevant to us as it will be some others. But I think as you look at the stress test results and you apply it across different kinds of companies it\u2019s not unusual to see different distribution model based on both what we are starting from, what the stress test would do to us and where we would end.", "Erika Najarian", "So essentially it doesn\u2019t impact how you are thinking about understanding that you have a consent order in place. But it doesn\u2019t impact your thinking about how to manage capital for future acquisition.", "Richard K. Davis", "No, I mean emphatically no, in fact it doesn\u2019t have any impact on it at all. What we wanted to do is we want to continue to understand the best methodologies that they use in stress testing the loan portfolio. So we can better understand what mechanics are in there so we can predict those better than we have in the past. But we also continue to outperform on the PPNR as it relates to their satisfaction in the model with how much money we\u2019ll make. So it works both ways but every year we get smarter every year we go back and do our best to evaluate it and as I said we are a little bit early on getting any formal feedback which we\u2019ll be getting in the next couple of weeks between this and the next time we talk.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And just as a follow-up question. Really appreciate the color on how to think about payments revenues as we think about forecasting. Could you give us a sense of how much of your payments revenues are generated in pounds so we can think about translation risk?", "Andrew J. Cecere", "The translation is rather limited. So if you think about every 1% change it\u2019s about $1 million it\u2019s not a big number, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it, thank you.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Richard K. Davis", "Hi, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi. Couple of follow-up. Firstly on CCAR, your current cost are at the high end compared to last year, can you comment on your thoughts on the results that are showing up there?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. And I think really where you see that is particularly within our wholesale portfolio. And that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working on for quite a few years. I think we have tended to be on the higher side -- the Fed has been a little bit on the higher side. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of input into -- insight into what some of their modeling routines are, as you know it\u2019s relatively a black pot. But perhaps, we\u2019re thinking perhaps that, if you think about where our utilization rates and so forth that could have a play we\u2019re relatively low on a utilization side, but we are actually, as you notice, we project a lot lower risk in a downturn environment than the Fed and we\u2019re just going to continue to share to work through that and try and figure out where the differences lie.", "Richard K. Davis", "So Vivek, this is a point of frustration for me, because we in the first couple of years, I was really worried, if we were different than them how bigger deal could that be. I will say that history is probably now better dictate than testing itself. And if you look in the last seven years, which is exact timeframe that we\u2019ve got the stress test our commercial portfolios outperformed almost everybody and done very, very well.", "And so, I\u2019m not challenging the test, I\u2019m just challenging that we\u2019re never going to figure out what they put in, Kathy gave you a hint. We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody, well in addition to our loan growth. And I think if they take a model where all the commitments go to 100%, and they go to charge-off, that could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business, which if they take a 90 day late pay and take the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it.", "And as simple as it sounds, we\u2019ll never get the answer, even to those questions I just offered. So what we will do is continue to watch our own performance as you should measure the dictate on how well we\u2019ve actually done in charge-offs and non-performs over the course of time. So we\u2019ll just do our best to get closer on that test. But we don\u2019t understand exactly ourselves, how it test like it does, when the results themselves show that way.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, thanks. One more, capital markets, you have grown very strongly Richard. As you continue to do that, does that shift what you\u2019re thinking in terms of -- so that\u2019s been one of the strongest fee growth driver this quarter, and you\u2019re trying to grow underwriting. Does that shift what you are thinking from a capital standpoint, where especially when you look at peers, et cetera?", "Richard K. Davis", "Vivek, I would say it doesn\u2019t shift, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s occurring in the market. We\u2019ve had traditionally two strong growth areas in fees, trust and our payments group, and it\u2019s great to have this third area come in and started taking what the market gives us. And given this low rate environment and the volatility, things like credit fixed income FX are very strong as well as derivatives. So it\u2019s great that we have these businesses, which in fact 10 years ago we didn\u2019t have. So it\u2019s a positive add to the fee businesses that we have. ", "Vivek Juneja", "Right. But given that it\u2019s a higher volatility business would that not mean that as you think about economic capital, but when you\u2019ve talked about 8% or 8.5% in the past that that starts to migrate slightly upwards.", "Richard K. Davis", "No. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to have any impact on our capital ratio at all.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, thanks.", "Richard K. Davis", "Sure. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Richard K. Davis", "Hi, Bill.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. Richard, I had a question on your P2P money transfer product. How are you thinking about the potential disintermediation risk that clear exchange could pose to the revenues that you generate on the card issuing side of your business? Or are there any restrictions that you could put in place to prevent potential disintermediation?", "Richard K. Davis", "Good question, Bill. First of all, we are clear exchanges [ph]. So we\u2019re going to be on either side of that transaction. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the same answer I gave three years ago with Square, when Square started coming out big with Starbucks, and at least for now not for long-term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking money out of this, cash out of the system not other card, debit or credit transactions. There is still so much cash in our system, in our society, there is plenty of disintermediation of cash a long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses and that\u2019s what we are all planning for in the near-term and that could be a couple of years.", "But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful and your question is right on the money, as it relates to what\u2019s the evolving relationship between real time Pay-to-Pay, card, card not present, and the mobility of people moving money about in the different environment. ", "Remember we\u2019re still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there is still a big disconnect and we have those things to fix systemically, before we get to a real time payment. But for now, disintermediation is mostly seen on cash and that\u2019s a net positive for us in the other banks, because that we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part, we do when it starts to monetize itself in the form of the payment. ", "Bill Carcache", "Right. But maybe just as a follow-up, I guess the nature of that product is really for clear exchange where P2P money transfer between individuals not necessary to conduct a payment transaction. But I guess to the extent that you were and given your position as both acquirer and issuer you would be in a very good position to see to the extent to which people who are using the product to actually conduct payment transactions in lieu of USB credit card. And if that were the case is that something that you would expect to be monitoring and rack to as appropriate to the extent that we\u2019re having a revenue impact.", "Andrew J. Cecere", "I think the principle -- this is Andy. I think the principal activity today is as Richard mentioned is cash and is also check individual-to-individual. I think the second category that will occur is for people to pay bills. And the bill payment again is going to be a replacement for check and or online checking. So it is in the bill pay so to speak. So in the interim or in the immediate timeframe I don't think there is any negative at all and we\u2019ll continue to monitor as Richard said over the long-term. I think the other thing to consider as how this migrates to the wholesale side of equation in the business. And that\u2019s also something we\u2019re very aware of. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah that\u2019s right. So think about this is P2P right. Then there is P2B, people are paying their bills and there is a B2P where people are trying to business are reaching out to you and giving you reason to buy things and send money back. And then there is B2B which we\u2019re all working on including block chain. And then we\u2019re working on all of those alternative most of those are so nascent. I think as a banking category those are just all upside for us, because there is so much opportunity and much less to see remediation.", "But you\u2019re on to something, Bill and there will be a time. Right now babysitters you go home and you pay him cash, you write them check. Now you\u2019re going to start doing it in real time between you and the 17 year old and the money moves. We\u2019re assuming remediating something that\u2019s right now not a debit or credit card. But overtime this is something we have to put the whole universe together and figure it out. And I\u2019ve said this before I\u2019ll say it again the banks as a collaborative are working better together than we ever have to make sure we work together and create a better circumstance for all of our clients. And I think that\u2019s a big plus in the last couple of years if we see payments emerge as a real time issue. ", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s great color. Thanks gentlemen. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "Thank you very much. Good morning. In regards to your commentary around the Brexit and your real positive commentary around that. Could you dig in a little bit on the impact of the Brexit in regards to your payments business in particular?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah that\u2019s generally where it\u2019s going to be. Because we\u2019ve got the merchant acquiring activity, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit here before. So I think we\u2019ll make -- we'll call it neutral for now based on what you can Kevin just because we have such a UK influence. I think there is a positive in UK enter UK and there is probably side negative enter Continental Europe. But we\u2019re going to say that to be net to favorably positive on the payment side. ", "Terry you got the trust side, you got a lot of employees in the Brexit impact there, you might talk about that. ", "Terrance R. Dolan", "Yeah in our corporate trust business which is that we have in Europe at least recently we\u2019ve seen just a little bit of a tick down with respect to deals that are being done as people kind of pause during that timeframe. But the impact that it had on the long rate of a curve so the tenure actually is probably going to stimulate the deal flow in terms of debt issuances. So the overall net impact of that over the next quarter or two, I would actually anticipate would probably be positive. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah deals aren\u2019t getting allowed they\u2019re just being come in the new ones... ", "Terrance R. Dolan", "In Europe they\u2019re be in deferred, but in the United States the yield curve impact is actually stimulating some growth.", "Richard K. Davis", "Is that helpful Kevin?", "Kevin Barker", "Yeah that\u2019s very helpful. And then in regards to your marketing spend and professional services spend obviously that can be volatile quarter-to-quarter depending on the business conditions and what your planning for the future. But given the uptick you\u2019re seeing there, would you expect that to decline over the next few quarters just because of the spend we saw in the second quarter?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah good question. In my 54% range of efficiency we\u2019re holding steady to finish what we start at this year on our marketing and branding campaign because there is a value and stability and sustainability in messaging. As you know people have to do things seven times to remember them once. So we\u2019re not going to give up on that and then the cost of third-party assistance on compliance as I said starts to tick down slowly.", "So those are both sustainable for the rest of this year. But trust me everything we can control continues to be in our gun sights. And marketing is one of those things that if it has to go it has to go, but I\u2019d love very much to not cut it off just a bit too soon if in fact we\u2019re on the advent of some times here what we can afford to do what we want to do and grow the company greatly. ", "Kevin Barker", "Thank you for taking my questions. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Yeah, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. ", "Richard K. Davis", "Good morning, Nancy. ", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, Richard, how are you?", "Richard K. Davis", "How are you?", "Nancy A. Bush", "Good. Thank you. I have a question that sort of encompasses a number of these interest rate questions that have been asked before. If you look at the JPMorgan Chase results yesterday, there is nothing in those results that says recession. If you look at your results, there is nothing that says recession. I\u2019m about to go onto Wells Fargo call. I assume there is nothing there that says recession. But the talk is about recession. And when you listen to Janet Yellen speak, it\u2019s about global softness. And I mean, there is just a massive disconnect now between what we\u2019re seeing at the micro-level in the banks, and what the experts are talking about at the macro level. Can you help me reconcile this before I bang my head into the wall?", "A - RichardK. Davis", "Yeah. Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to join you more than because I agree with you. But I will tell you, we are what we see. And I\u2019m going to say two things that Fed is it has a different lens on this. They are looking at different things and looking usually later than we are. But on a real time basis, which we live in everyday, we are seeing a slow recovery. And it\u2019s a small nuance on a word, but a recession as things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that.", "On the other hand, because we\u2019re balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is in the wholesale business, we\u2019re all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we\u2019re waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real organic, old-fashioned way, and we\u2019re also not seeing that. But they\u2019re not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up.", "And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. About the business side, they\u2019ve got reasons and they\u2019re informed and they\u2019re waiting. But on the consumer side, it\u2019s a little bit better every quarter and it\u2019s not a recession. And I would disagree it if someone is saying that at Fed level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. They\u2019re savings is at a level that they are comfortable. They\u2019re using their credit cards and they\u2019re paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it actually make sense to me. But for the words recession being standard about lately by a lot of parties, we don't see it.", "Nancy A. Bush", "Okay. Secondly, I had a question related to the consent order. You mentioned that it prevents you from doing branch acquisitions. Basically, branch institutions. Does it also prevent you from opening any new loan production offices? Is that something you're thinking about? And which markets do you -- are there any markets that you need to be in that you're not in right now?", "Richard K. Davis", "Good question. The answer is no. It doesn\u2019t impair our ability to open loan production markets. And the answer is we don\u2019t have any new markets to get into, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to show you guys just how many markets we are in out of our footprint. So 25 state footprint where you see us on the street and you drive by us every day. And the other 25 states, for the most part, for commercial real estate, corporate trusts, middle market and large corporate, we\u2019re in all of those states. We just really have never taken the time to show you that.", "So I\u2019ll make this a note to do that at the Investor Day in September 15th to make sure we show you where all of our loan production offices are outside of what would be the footprint. Because when I show you, you\u2019ll see wherever we want to be, and so the answer to the expansion is no, because we\u2019re already there.", "Nancy A. Bush", "Okay, thank you.", "RichardK. Davis", "Yes, thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.", "RichardK. Davis", "Hey, Terry.", "Terence McEvoy", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Trust and investment management fees, looked to be up 6% or 7% if I just based off the trailing four quarter average. In the release, you talked about account growth. Could you give a little bit more color about that business in 2Q as well as maybe the outlook for the back half of the year?", "Andrew J. Cecere", "Yes. So if you ended up looking at the second quarter or if you look at the first half, the first quarter was a little bit slower simply because of the market spend. But in the second quarter where the market starting to recover, we\u2019re starting to see nice growth again with respect to new accounts, both on the corporate institutional side as well as within wealth management itself. So we end up looking into the second half of the year. We would anticipate that that sort of growth would continue just given the rebound, for example, in the markets where they are at today.", "Terence McEvoy", "And then just a quick question for Kathy. Could you run through your mortgage banking outlook for Q3? And then just so I am cleared, does that include your best guess on hedging, gains losses and MSR changes in fair value?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. So for mortgage fees, we are anticipating that that will have a linked quarter increase of about 20% to 30%. That does include all of our assumptions around hedging and so forth, so that\u2019s all in. And as Andy indicated earlier, I do think that we\u2019re going to see a little bit of a shift between -- in our application base from purchase -- between the purchase and refi. As he indicated, we\u2019re kind of 65-35 this quarter. I think that that\u2019s likely to go more towards the 60% purchase, 40% refi as we move forward.", "Terence McEvoy", "Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Terry.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over for closing remarks.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thank you for listening to the view of our second quarter 2016 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review US Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during our prepared remarks.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2013 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp [reported] recorded net income of $5.8 billion for the full year of 2013 or $3 per diluted common share. We achieved industry leading profitability with a return on average asset of 1.65% and return on average common equity of 15.8% and efficiency ratio of 52.4%.", "Total average loans grew by 5.6% and average deposits grew a strong 6.3% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve at a 30.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 13.2% decrease in nonperforming assets excluding covered assets. Our capital position end of the year stronger with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.4%, in total, we returned $4 billion or 71% of our 2013 earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.", "Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $0.76% per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by year-over-year by 5.7% and as expected 1.5% or 6% annualized, on a linked-quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 5.4% over the prior year and 1.8%, or 7.2% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.", "Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 4.9% from the prior quarter, while total nonperforming assets declined, linked quarter by 7.9%. We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated using the final Basel III capital regulations was 8.8% at December 31 and we returned 65% of our earnings to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and the repurchase of 13 million shares of common stock.", "Slide 5 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be ranked among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.62%, and return on average common equity was 15.4%.", "Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.40% as anticipated a few basis points lower than the third quarter. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.9%, higher than previous quarter due to the seasonally higher expenses and the impact of accounting presentation changes related to investments and tax advantage projects. These changes did not impact net income attributable to U.S. Bank and Andy will discuss them in more detail in a few minutes.", "As we have stated in the past, our goal is to maintain an efficiency ratio in the low 50s by continuing to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses. And we do expect the efficiency ratio to return to the low 50s in 2014.", "Turning to Slide 6. The company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $4.9 billion, a 4.4% decrease from the prior year and essentially equal to the third quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue as well as a decrease in net interest income. Linked quarter, a decrease in noninterest income driven again by lower mortgage banking revenue was offset by seasonally higher revenues in other business lines and an increase in net interest income.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.7% year-over-year and 1.5% on a linked quarter basis. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.3% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter. ", "Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 7.8% year-over-year and 1.3% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loans growing by 6.7% year-over-year and 2.1% linked quarter.", "Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 17.6% year-over-year and 3.2% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan category average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were both high year-over-year and linked quarter while average home equity lines and loans continue to decline. The rate of decline in this category however has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.", "We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers, new originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $50 billion in the fourth quarter up 4% linked quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a faster rate than loans increasing year-over-year by 10.1% and 2.7% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization edged down slightly again this quarter to approximately 23%.", "Total average deposits increased by over $13 billion or 5.4% over the same quarter of last year and by $4.5 billion or 7.2% annualized on a linked quarter basis. With growth in low cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to slide eight, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $16 million or 4.9% from the third quarter of 2013 while non-performing assets excluding covered assets decreased by $67 million or 3.6%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the fourth quarter declined to 0.53% from 0.57% in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter we released $35 million of reserves, $5 million more than in the previous quarter and $10 million more in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Given the mixed and quality of our portfolio we currently expect total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2014, while we expect the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the first quarter of 2014, as commercial and commercial real-estate recoveries declined relative to the current quarter.", "Andy will now give you few more details about our fourth quarter results.", "Andy Cecere", "", "Thanks Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS was $0.76, was 5.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and equal to the prior quarter. ", "The key drivers of the Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings are summarized on slide 10. $36 million or 2.5% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of lower producing for credit losses and well managed expense partially offset by lower net revenue.", "Non-interest income declined year-over-year by $50 million or 1.8%, the result of 2.3% increase in average earning assets which was more than offset by 15 basis point decrease in net interest margin. The $7.3 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and investment securities. Offsetting the portion of the growth in these categories was a $5.8 billion reduction in average loans held for sale reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year and a $3.8 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the reconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the third quarter of 2013.", "The net interest margin of 3.40% was 15 basis points slower than the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower rates on investment securities as well as growth in the portfolio and lower rates on loans partially offset by lower rates on deposits and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt. Non-interest income declined by $173 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to mortgage banking revenue, which reflected lower origination and sales revenue.", "Lower corporate payments revenue, products revenue the result of lower government related transactions also contributed to the decline. Government spending was down about 18% year-over-year. Growth in several free categories help to offset these unfavorable variances, including growth in retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue and investment product fees.", "Non-interest expense declined modestly year-over-year by $4 million or 0.1%, the modest decrease was primarily the result of lower professional services expenses due to a reduction in mortgage servicing review related cost and the positive impact from an $80 million mortgage foreclosure related regulatory settlement accrual in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "These favorable variances were offset by higher benefits expense primarily pension related and higher tax advantage project cost, including the accounting presentation changes in the current quarter. In the fourth quarter we changed the presentation of some tax credit related items in our income statement. These changes were not significant and had no impact on EPS. The impact of the changes is shown on the chart on this slide.", "These changes in addition to our favorable conclusion on some state tax matters reduced the effective tax rate to 23.8% on a tax equivalent basis in the fourth quarter. This new presentation will continue in future periods. However in the first quarter of 2014 we also expect to adopt new accounting guidance recently issued by FASB, which will move non-interest expense on certain tax credit investments to tax expense. Including all of these changes, we expect our tax rate in 2014 to be about 29% on a tax equivalent basis.", "Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $12 million or 0.8% primarily as a result of seasonally higher expense partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher as the $4.5 billion increase in average earning assets was only partially offset by a modest decline in the net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets was the result of growth in loans and securities partially offset by a reduction in average loans held for sale. The net interest margin of 3.40% was 3 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to the growth in lower tax investments, lower rate investment securities as well as strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher cash balances at the [bank].", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $21 million or 1%. Again, this unfavorable variance primarily reflected the decline in mortgage banking revenue as well as seasonally lower corporate [payments] revenue. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in retail payments, trust and investment management fees, commercial product revenue and other income.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was up $117 million or 4.6%, driven by higher costs related to tax-advantaged projects including the accounting presentation changes, seasonally higher professional services expense and the timing of marketing and business development projects. Given normal first quarter seasonality and FASB's new accounting guidance related to tax credit investments, we expect first quarter 2014 expense to be similar to the third quarter of 2013.", "Turning to slide 11. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules for the Basel III standardized approach, we estimate that our common equity tier 1 ratio at December 31st was 8.8%, up from 8.6% at September 30th. At 8.8%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.", "In the fourth quarter, we returned 30% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and 35% through the repurchase of 30 million shares of stock for a total return of 65%. Our tangible book value per share rose to $14.41 at December 31st, representing an 11.9% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 4.3% increase over the prior quarter. In early January, we completed and submitted our 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We are now waiting for regulatory approval to raise our dividend and continue our stock buyback program in 2014.", "Finally, slide 12, provides updated detail on the company\u2019s mortgage repurchase related expense and reserve for expected losses on the repurchases and make whole payments. The record warranties repurchase reserve was $83 million at December 31st compared with a $176 million at September 30th. The decline in the reserve reflected the December agreement with Freddie Mac that resolved substantially all repurchase obligations related to reps and warranties made on loans sold to Freddie Mac between 2000 and 2008. The $53 million settlement was reflected in net realized losses for the quarter.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Andy. I\u2019m very proud of our 2013 results. We achieved record earnings while we manage through a challenging economic environment and a significant pullback in mortgage banking activities as well as in an environment of regulatory and legislative change and uncertainty.", "We continue to invest in our businesses throughout 2013, both organically and through acquisitions. For example, we added a small Municipal Bond Trustee business in March, strengthening our position as the number one provider to municipal trustee and agency services in United States. And in November, we announced the acquisition of Quintillion Limited an Ireland-based full service hedge-fund administrator, further expanding our alternative investment servicing network in Europe.", "And we began the New Year with an announcement of the purchase of the Chicago branch franchise owned by RBS Citizens Financial Group. This investment while nearly double our market share in this great market within our footprint strengthening our position and adding product, services and convenience for new and existing customers as well as value for our shareholders. These acquisitions, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative product enhancements, services and people has enabled us to continue to grow our balance sheet and our fee-based businesses and gain market share.", "U.S. Bank\u2019s performance metrics continue to be best in class. We are focused on the future, building our company to perform as we have in the past, producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. ", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America ", "Yes, good morning.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America ", "My first question is on the loan demand outlook for this year. Richard, it\u2019s clear that your bank has been a market share taker over the past several years. But as you look out into this year, are we at an inflection point in terms of loan demand picking up based on what you are hearing from your corporate customers and the activity level that you may be seeing on the consumer side?", "Richard Davis", "Erika, I believe that\u2019s true, and I\u2019ll tell you what. I think it maybe a tale of two halfs of the year. I think 2014 starts well looking a lot like 2013 where people continue to husband cash and kind of a hold-off until they see some of the earlier spring sentiment that comes about and whether or not consumers are going to spend and therefore corporations are going to invest. I will tell you as you know the first trigger in that transaction of people spending is the deposit actually going down and our deposits grow and I\u2019m glad they are for the extent that we\u2019re getting more customers. But to the extent that they use their deposits first, they\u2019ll then use our line of credit second and they will extend more credits later in that cycle. And we\u2019re not seeing as much of that yet as we like to at the early stages. The sentiment however is completely different. The sentiment is stronger than it\u2019s been in all these last January\u2019s people are much more willing to talk about future investments. I think consumers are starting to think about doing things to add to their house or spend more money for improvements and may be some discretionary items they hadn\u2019t before. And so my intuition tells me we're on the verge and advent of an increasing sentiment for consumer spending, but I think we'll see it second half of the year and I think this spring will really tell the tale. ", "In our companies, in order to offset the expected and predicted reduction in mortgage refinances, we're continuing to spend energy on becoming a market share leader on purchases. And we've also as you know introduced that we're doubling our indirect lending and leasing program over the next few years and even already we're seeing a significant increase in the auto loan volume that we would have otherwise at even over a year ago, up over 30% from fourth quarter of \u201912. So, I believe that our ability to offset the mortgage and predicted mortgage change, keep market share positions there and add other consumer products like small business, credit card and indirect.", "I think we're positioned quite nicely, I just think it\u2019s going to be the second half where you will see the most likely balance sheet impacts that will follow the sentiment we're hearing today.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America ", "Got it. And as a follow-up question for Andy, could you give us a sense of where you stand in terms of complying with the LCR proposals as they are currently written and how we should think about potential balance and margin impacts further balance of the year?", "Andy Cecere ", "", "Yes, thanks, Erika. There are still some questions with regard to the final roles and the interpretation but I'll tell you that we increased the securities portfolio to 80 billion in the fourth quarter and we are expecting to increase it to 85 billion by the end of the first quarter. That will impact margin a few basis points similar what you saw this quarter and that again is our current expectation. We're still working both sides of the balance sheet; the right and left hand side and working through the questions, but right now 85 billion under quarter one.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. So, I just wanted to run through the discussion that you had, it was pretty quick on the accounting changes, may be you could help us understand why you chose to take the accounting changes at this quarter and then you have a follow up in first quarter.", "Andy Cecere", "So, Betsy this is Andy. So starting in the fourth quarter we moved the amortization of some guaranteed tax credits, from tax expense to non-interest expense. And then we also moved some third party share of losses, we moved the entire third party share of losses on syndicated cash credits to non-interest expense where the related losses are reported. And then finally in the first quarter of 2014 we're going to move some low income housing cost from expense to tax. So the net of all that is what we talked about on page 10, the impacts you see there which lower our tax rate and increase our expense but you'll see a little bit of a reversal in the first quarter. So, when all said and done, our TEB rate for next year will be about 29% and our expense in the first quarter we expect to be closer to what it was in the third quarter of this year.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, all right. So, this is really [fortune], is really a transitory towards a new normal which is similar to your old normal.", "Andy Cecere ", "", "Correct, that\u2019s correct Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then secondly I had a question on the [Amex] partnership that you announced recently. I did want to just understand how you are planning on leveraging that and can you list the [Amex] partnership, get to that closed loop for the carts that you would be working with them on to a greater degree than you even have?", "Richard Davis", "", "Yes, this is Richard. It\u2019s a marketing and sponsorship partnership for our customers on the high wealth category who have many times said that they have both cards in their wallet. They've got the U.S. Bank Flex card but they also have the [Amex] card. We also wanted to recognized this, I am not trying to get into their close loop, so it's not a transaction activity, it\u2019s not a system activity for U.S. Bank, it\u2019s more of a brand. So, you will still have the U.S. Bank branded [Amex] card for our top customers. It will have the ability to have the very high end treatment that an [Amex] customer receives but also be able to do brand U.S. Bank and receive some of the products and services they receive now as our top customers. So, it\u2019s a little bit more than branding but it\u2019s a lot less than anything more sophisticated than you might think as it relates to trying to work with close\u00a0loop or trying to change tracks if you will. ", "We'll still a VISA MasterCard originating company but for this very small core customers. We actually think sometimes if you can\u2019t beat them, join them and Amex has a particularly exceptional product, it\u2019s the very highest end for services even in and above the credit card needs of customer. So, I think it was the right thing to do. It\u2019s not going to move the needle a lot but we're satisfied with the early stage announcement and I think our customers are happy with this as well.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just while we are on card I know that on your website, you are very vocal about the fact that you're tracking fraud and everything else but you\u2019ve also been very vocal as a firm with regard to your taking fraud prevention forward, so I don\u2019t know if you could comment at all on what you're thinking, in a post target world around moving towards tokenization or EMV.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I am a big supporter of progress in all those protective areas, also as being mature to the clearing house we're working on tokenization and cloud use for some of those protections and encryption. I guess what I would say to you is it\u2019s disappointing that with the retailer fraud that's occurred, it certainly is a burden on the banks because we have most of our customers as well that are affected if they use, in this case, some of those merchants that were affected. ", "And so we are moving to reproduce all new cards for those customers. We are doing it through methodical process were those who had fraud or we know they had fraud, or where they had fraud, they\u2019re getting card reissues immediately, both credit and debit to the extent that we eventually track every customer who we think could have been affected by that time in period. We are reissuing all of those cards. We are not announcing it as a broad event, we\u2019re just indicating to our customers that as it goes we want to make sure they are protected and that their information is not in the open, say a year from now, when people aren't paying attention.", "More germane to the issue Betsy, is one of my concerns is chip at EMV is not necessarily the end point, it's just another step in the journey. And as you get to mobile banking, and you look at cloud, and the other encryptions, it will be interesting to see whether or not we have to stop now and go back to chip EMV or if we really want to leap frog that and get to the more, I think provocative outcome which is going to be the necessary standard, not many years from now. And whether the marketplace reacts and how they react to the breaches that have occurred at some of the more recent merchants is going to be yet to be seen. ", "So banks will be at the ready, you know as the bank merchant partnership; merchants would have to change their terminals and their willingness to spend the money to have chip receiving cards. We have to reissue cards on chip. Every one of our customers who travels overseas has been getting a chip card for years, because it's necessary over in Europe and some places in Canada. But I think that story we told in the next couple of months. Ask me again in April and we'll just see how it's settled but I think there is one [small dot] that says let's spend all of our energy on the more sophisticated endpoint of mobile banking and cloud encryption. ", "Others might say we haven\u2019t got the time to waste, let's jump to the chip step and we will end up getting to the other point a later. We'll be open to either one, because we're acquirer or an issuer or deep in the conversation. There is other alternative even that I haven\u2019t mentioned. But we'll do this right, whatever the marketplace wants and as banks have proven with merchants together we'll get the right answer because we all want customers supposedly.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay. In terms of timeframe and spend from your perspective, is it something that is obviously ongoing. People had said that maybe the chip tokenization would be a three to five year timeframe. Do you feel like that might be a little bit sooner and would we see any of this in the expense line or is it too small? ", "Richard Davis", "Yes chip has a deadline of 2015, so it would be in the next couple of years. It's more expensive to issue a chip card for sure than a magnetic stripe, but it's not going to break anybody's back. And the receipt is probably more of an issue on the merchant side where it will have to reprogram all of their terminals, now I'm talking small businesses as well as the large merchants, where they would have to change our terminals. And some merchants buy those terminals, so that's a fixed cost you have to change. Many others would lease those terminals which might be a bit easier for that transition. Those are the kind of fundamentals that will come through the economic review of this. But you and I both know there will be a political and maybe a regulatory view of this that might change those outcomes and either force one solution or another based on the concerns from politicians and the protection of citizens or regulators' concerns for our consumer protection. ", "I think there is a lot of studying to be done because of the simple answer doesn\u2019t just go from one to the other because that\u2019s only one step in a longer journey. But I do think in the next 90 days we'll have a better sense as it's settled and people decide where the risk is. ", "I'll close with this though, to the extent that other information is not card related, gets taken or the fraudulent operator have new information access to things that are more than card related, we should all be quite concerned, because at the end of the day the banks will bear the burden in most cases. 14 months from now, one of my customers has been a victim of some fraud that's [going to involve] data that was taken from a card situation. And all of a sudden my fraud levels are higher in the second quarter 2015.", "I probably will never be able to trace it to any one circumstance that will just be a higher environmental risk, if you like having more breakage off the shelves. So we all have to be much smarter and we are spending a lot of time outside of the card area, watching for fraud behaviors and watching and monitoring activities to protect customers. ", "What that means that is more customers are going to be have to be tolerant when a really good bank has the protection and first and foremost that says I just discovered fraud or potential fraud. I disrupted your environment for a minute because I want to either change your account number or stop the transaction because I feel like you\u2019re going to be a victim if we don\u2019t stop it now. I think the recent episode over the last couple of months might help consumers realize that their precaution really is worth a bit of disruption if it protects them in the long term. So there is some good learning that will come out of this and I think banks and merchants should work together. And you have in the past probably more in the future to protect customers and they can feel we all have their best interest. It could be a while.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbach of Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbach - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. The question that I had is, you talked about -- you\u2019ve been able to improve the capital position of the company based upon the earnings, even though you returned 65% of capital during the full year 2013. How should we think about that, I meant is that -- should that number be higher as we go forward, I mean given that you\u2019ve been able to actually do both?", "Richard Davis", "We've said for as long as I actually can remember that we would return 30% to 40% of our earnings in the form of dividends and 30% to 40% in the form of buybacks. 2013, the full year was 71% the quarter was 65%, and so we\u2019re in that low level range. I will also say to you as a leading follow up question is, as it relates to one of those two measures is currently limited by the federal reserve CCAR process at 30% and at this point we\u2019re going to continue to abide by those general rules and follow the guidance that we\u2019ve been given to stay at that perimeter, it\u2019ll be a time I hope that the fed will say certain banks have earned their permission to go back to along the dividends to be what they think is reasonable and supportable. In that case we probably would float above that 30% level but we\u2019re not eager to do it at this stage and we have plenty of room and opportunity on the buyback side and still stay within that range at 60-80%. ", "We like the 20% left for ourselves because we do be expect to be an acquirer, we expect to take opportunities when something comes along, particularly in trust or payment and I\u2019ll say there\u2019s a great deal of innovation and R&D that we\u2019re spending money on that, much of which will eventually come to bear fruit, some of it will prove that we\u2019ll learn what doesn\u2019t work, but you actually in this environment now, banks that used to be innovators and in this environment you want us to be, you want us to be the leaders of fast followers and work with a lot of other companies and expertise that we might not necessarily have ever had in our legacy. So 60 to 80 is right in the sweet spot, where its 71, and I think right now where we are is a good indicator of where we'll be for 2014.", "Andy Cecere", "And Moshe, I would add as we were at 86 in the third quarter, dropping at 88, a good part of that increase was a reduction in the pension debit which as a reduction to capital, the pension debit went down because rates went up. So that's a onetime phenomenon and I would expect this in 2014 sort to be in that 8.5 range for most of the year.", "Moshe Orenbach - Credit Suisse", "Got you, just kind of as a follow up on the idea, Richard, you touched on the idea of acquisitions and you\u2019ve actually announced a branch acquisition recently, what\u2019s the environment like for those types of acquisitions?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "You know they\u2019re still one up, one up mostly I mean, we are always interested in deepening our debt where we have a branch network, so we like branches as you know and we are going to be probably a net grower, small but net grower in the next year. It might not be in exactly the same place, we might be in partnerships with universities or grocery stores or things, but we like adding branches and the opportunity to double down like in Chicago is worthwhile. If any of our 25 states currently had an opportunity like that we would be interested. I want you to know, I\u2019m not interested in jumping states or getting a handful of branches in a state where you really have not critical mass or even in an NSA where you can\u2019t build enough distinctions to call out market leadership. ", "I also don\u2019t see us doing a full bank transaction unless the transaction is still attractive because of the risks I\u2019ve talked about before that align with picking up the problems and the legacy issues that you may not ever be able to know at due diligence and you simply can\u2019t price for. So I think deals like branch related end market transactions and the two deals we highlighted in our earnings call here today, fund services or even European businesses for payments or trust are things you can expect to see more of and we do have a number of toes in the water in those opportunities that none will move the needle but over time, they add up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Conner at the Georgia Bank.", "Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank", "As you look at the payments business and the fee is worth about 3% year over year, obviously the government fees was a drag, but looking towards 2014 it should be much less of a drag from here. How should we think about the revenue growth in that combined segment, and I am thinking just the payment fees overall much as the government fees.", "Andy Cecere", "Right, good question, now so first this quarter you know we -- a lot of the merchant activities were in the same store sales and same store sales were up about 3% domestically and about 4% globally. So Europe actually outdid the US in that regard. We were way down this year by the government side of the equation as we said in the CARR, government spend was down about 17%, 18% year over year. I think that will begin to stabilize next year and I think you should expect the total payments category to get closer to what is our normal long term growth there but not quite to that level till same store sales has to increase a point or two. So the anchor that we saw this year on a corporate payment I think will begin to diminish as we get into \u201914.", "Richard Davis", "Matt it's Richard, just as a reminder you know, the total payment space for us is about a quarter of our revenue, corporate payments is about 20% of that quarter and government is about 20% of that space. So it\u2019s not a big driver but we like it, we\u2019re going to stay with it. I don\u2019t believe that we have the same kind of future trajectory, a negative trajectory that we\u2019ve seen in the last two years of both the sequester and the ending of the work, so for us, we'll be glad we stayed with it, we had it carried across the trends and at the same time mortgages, fees were falling but I think that they both have some stability going into 2014 and I think we\u2019ll be glad we stuck with it, but it\u2019s not as big as it looks, it's more of a headline but if we\u2019re staying with it, because I think it starts to turn the corner in \u201914.", "Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank", "Okay then just separately, the Chicago branch deal, have you talked about the -- either the potential earnings impact from that or I\u2019m sure there's both some cost savings and some investments that you might be making, how all that nets out.", "Andy Cecere", "For 2014, Matt, it\u2019s not material to our number.", "Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank", "Okay.", "Richard Davis", " ", "But there\u2019ll be a little branch consolidation, but for that it\u2019s really an opportunity to be more present in a really big city and what I\u2019m hoping for is that the synergies to the 100 branches we have will be as powerful as the ability to insight kind of new growth of the 100 that we're picking up and it will be just be a little more pervasive across Chicago and it\u2019s a great market for us, we've got great leadership there and we've actually kind of been managing over our sleeves a little bit in terms of our exposure, our marketing and our visibility. And I think we now have a chance to catch up to it and if I can grow more there I\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank", "I guess the infrastructure that you have now in the market and you\u2019ve been doing that it\u2019s all scalable, there is not going to be an expense kind of ramp up as you, okay.", "Andy Cecere", " ", "No, there will not be.

Going back to your loan portfolio, one of the areas that you\u2019ve really done a great job as your residential mortgages and I believe most of them are jumbos, can you talk a little bit about and I think they are arms, am I correct? How is the jumbo markets because we\u2019re hearing that it\u2019s very overheated definitely coming out of the west coast where a large banks out there competing very aggressively in that market?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "So, Paul, actually most of our growth is in a product called smart refinance in the high quality branch originated refinance product for our core customers and that is what\u2019s driving and a lot of that is a short, it's not a 30-year product, it\u2019s a shorter product. We are seeing a phenomenon occur just like you\u2019re seeing in the total mortgage business refinancing activity is starting to go down. So that volume will start go down but on the flipside home equity line of credit activity is increasing. So those are the trends I think you\u2019ll start to see into the next few quarters.", "Bill Parker", "Yes and we are active in the jumbo space, we have done all long and it\u2019s pretty much started it towards our private client type customer and many of those are arms.", "Paul Miller - FBR", "So is that mainly coming out of your private client product mix what I guess.", "Bill Parker", "A good chunk of it, some of it comes out through the branches in states like California where you have such high home values.", "Paul Miller - FBR", "And then on your securities portfolio, you talk about that you want to grow that to about $85 billion, what type duration with a new product, with the new stuff coming on are you shooting for?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "While we\u2019re keeping at pretty short about half floaters half fixed and you can think in the term of three and three half years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "The question just big picture as far as revenue growth and operating leverage, slide 6 of the deck shows that the year-over-year revenue growth has still been easily negative largely because the mortgage comps and the payments, but as we look ahead and Richard to your point about getting the efficiency ratio back down towards the low 50s, can you help us understand the dynamic? Do you think, how close are we to the point of getting that year-over-year comp and revenues back deposit and then how also do you think expenses can kind of trend along with that?", "Richard Davis", "So you know we do kind of manage the company, the governor is revenue, and when we put our profit plan together late last year, we worked from the bottoms up and we figured out what the revenue growth would be and as I\u2019ve told you before, the plan would be the expenses will be less than that. So I can tell you that our intent is to have positive operating leverage, I won\u2019t take one quarter time because we\u2019re fairly heavy second and third quarter positive and then without government in the fourth quarter we have that's fall off in quarter one and tougher quarter just because of New Year expenses. But we are looking for positive operating leverage first and foremost Ken, in 2014. ", "Now, the other thing I said the quote for that though is since we\u2019re not expecting revenue growth to be overlay robust, we expect to be at least as good if not more what you\u2019ve seen in the last year or two. We\u2019re going to watch our expenses and we have a good run rate of expenses to start with. We've been part of some regulatory consent order to mortgage which was a fairly expensive task that we\u2019ve now used some of those monies and reallocated to other compliance activities.", "We are not seeing an undue increase in expenses in order to run the company run safely, but at the same token, but for merit increases and necessary capital expenditures finishing what we\u2019ve started. This will be a year that we've left some of our investments follow through just on fruition and we won\u2019t start a lot of new things, that\u2019s U.S. Bank's way of logging expenses. They don\u2019t cut expenses because we'd never get over our sleeves. We don\u2019t go out and create an environment where we have consultants come in and give us a program and start reducing people, our working force.", "We typically just watch every single 30-day and make sure we don\u2019t do something that the revenue won\u2019t allow us to. So you have to trust us. We\u2019re going to continue to deliver positive operating leverage because it's how we grow the company, it's how you end up making the success that you can count on predictable. But as each month goes, we\u2019ll adjust as we always do but I think we\u2019re expecting revenue to be strong enough to allow for some expense growth. So we\u2019re going to watch our nickels and dimes until this environment is surely on its feet and there is a recovery well. And we don\u2019t see that quite yet so we\u2019re just going to watch everything we do.", "I really appreciated the questions early on regarding the non-bottom line impact of the accounting changes we talked about with our -- some of our tax credits because we want you all to know that\u2019s not material, it\u2019s not all impactful to bottom line and it\u2019s more of a landscape they should record it for. We are committed to staying low in 50s and efficiency because we\u2019re going to let revenue growth faster than expenses, so nothing has changed, I guess I am trying to say. But for this little bit of blip, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver for you all but, I'll say as over a year probably not this one, when revenue is going to really take off, for a lot of reasons, and while the expenses were a little higher than they might this year but they are still well below that and the way to you all\u2019s heart is to keep efficiency positive and make sure operating leverage is the way you drive the bottom line and I am feeling pretty good about it.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Okay, great. And just a question within the expenses, and one little one on the tax thing, you mentioned, Andy, the benefit in the pension side on the capital side. Are you going to see a pension benefit and is that built into your expectation for the first quarter expenses for this year?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes and yes.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "All right, can you help us understand the magnitude of that?", "Andy Cecere", "So, the increase that we saw from \u201912 to \u201913 is going to almost go back to the level it was in \u201912 in terms of the pension expense. It went up 140 million or so and it will go down about that same range.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Okay. And then just on the last thing on the taxing. So the minority interest piece, I don\u2019t think you talked about that. That kind of had been running at a minus 40. So does that now also continue at the same plus 15 range given those changes?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, there will be no further change in the minority interest piece.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "So it is kind of safe from here. Okay, great. And credit -- your comment about first quarter charge-offs being up and reserve releases a little bigger this quarter. Can you just talk to us about how do you continue to expect any more reserve leads to go ahead?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, we do -- we had strong improvement in credit in the fourth quarter, and anticipate we\u2019ll have continued improvement in credit in the first quarter. Losses will be up a little bit really not because of the charge-off side but really because of the wholesale recovery side. We\u2019ve had some significant wholesale recoveries in the last few quarters, and it\u2019s unlikely that those will continue.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey.", "Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Just a couple of questions please. The first is your GAAP assets look like they went up a little less than 1% but your Basel III risk-weighted assets went up a little over 1.5. Can you just explain what accounted for the difference?", "", "Andy Cecere", "Commitments, off balance-sheet commitments.", "Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Got it. Primarily lending commitments I assuming?", "Andy Cecere", "Correct. And as we talked about the fact that our commitment levels are growing more rapidly than our outstandings, which is a good thing in the long-term, and on a 10% annualized basis and that\u2019s a principle driver.", "Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great, thank you. And then you and several other institutions have announced the discontinuation of deposit advanced products. What -- how should we think about the influence of that on either the fee or NII line items?", "Richard Davis", "", "This is Richard, I will go first. I will let Andy talk about the financial impact. It\u2019s not significant, first of all, but I am disappointed that the product has gone because it was probably the most popular customer product I think I ever had as a banker. In that it was very transparent, was very clear but it simply just didn\u2019t meet the [cadence] of the regulatory view of total API on a certain calculation and the general sense that people otherwise are being harmed. So of course we moved along and followed the guidance and we\u2019re now ending the product even at this month and we\u2019ll wind it down in the next couple.", "What's I am more interested in is trying to find a replacement of such products so that we can find something for those consumers that will otherwise stay in the protected banking industry where there is over sight in protections which I support greatly. And we\u2019re working now with the regulators primarily the OCC to see if we can develop some kind of a replacement product. It\u2019s too new to have that so we haven\u2019t got that built into our plan. So as we really expect there will be a second half loss and most of the impact falls to spread income, but I\u2019ll leave Andy to give a little more dimension.", "Andy Cecere", "Right, so as Richard said, we would expect very little impact in the first half of the year given that our -- are going to continue with our current customers until mid-year. In the second half of the year the product earns approximately $50 million a quarter because through a lot of these are net interest income. And that would be the impact if the product in of itself on the way but as Richard mentioned we\u2019re working on alternatives and we\u2019ll keep you updated on the impacts as we work through those alternatives.", "Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks, and just following on, and this is my last question. Given the influence of this change, as well as the liquidity guidance that you provided earlier in the call, how should we now be thinking about the net interest margin over the next several quarters?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, the net interest margin absent the CAA issue that we just talked about and the securities bill is relatively stable. So the principle change will be the securities bill. The securities bill impacts net interest margin the rate has no impact on net interest income at all. It comes down with fairly neutral spreads. So we\u2019ll continue to update you on that. I would expect the build in the first quarter to impact just by about 3 basis points similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "", "Could you just touch on the strength that you\u2019ve had in the commercial products this quarter and the sustainability of that?", "Andy Cecere", "So it\u2019s across many categories. We had a good quarter in high grade underwriting. We had a good quarter in order of credit activity, FX, just across many categories. I attribute this back to some of the investments we've made over the years in terms of building those capabilities both with people, products and services and technologies. So that is a real positive story for us and I would expect it to continue into 2014.", "Richard Davis", "Every once in a while you get that moment you can actually prove something and so here we were three or four years ago talking about taking our wholesale bank and moving it from regional to national, creating scale, hiring people in New York and Charlotte. And you'll say, well one year we see the benefits, this is a great example [indiscernible] of where that\u2019s starting to show up and coming in more consistent basis. We\u2019ve always been a bank to a large number of large customers, Fortune 100 customers but we always didn\u2019t have all the products and services. The last few years we\u2019ve got a chance to become more important in the syndicated line of credit, we moved up in their view of being a trusted partner and now we get the fee businesses as well more often than we used to and that\u2019s exactly where this kind of benefit shows up years later.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay, thanks. And then can you give us some color on the magnitude of any equity gains for this quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "It was minimal. So if you look at the other income line you actually see an improvement but that was more a function of the third quarter having some negatives, the fourth quarter was relatively neutral.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay, thanks. And then just lastly on the repurchase reserve and repurchase cost going forward. How should we think about this \"more normal run rate\" for that line item?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. So we have the 753 million with Freddie here in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re down to a level that -- we're probably still a little bit higher than what we would be over the long term but we\u2019re starting to get to a level that I think is more normal in terms of historic level. So we\u2019re not quite there but it\u2019s going to be a material change on a go forward basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Andy, first I\u2019ve got a quick question for you on expense given the guidance for a first quarter being closer in line with previous third quarter, does that imply that there was a good bit of pull forward of business development and marketing expenses that occur this quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "No, not necessarily a pull forward, it\u2019s just a seasonal impact that we typically see. So if you look at the expense increase from third quarter to fourth quarter, about half of it was the tax related and then about half of it was things like legal and professional and marketing and expense. And if you look at our history Chris you\u2019ll see that the fourth quarter is seasonally higher in those categories and then seasonally comes down in the first quarter.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. Bill, my question for you is, could we see, going back to the reserves for a little bit and I think I ask question almost every time I see you, can we see the pace of reserve releases actually pick up from here? It\u2019s been pretty steady around $30 million to $35 million or so. I mean I had a bank yesterday that released more reserves in terms of taking the reserve ratio down in one quarter than you guys have done in four quarters. And BofA now has a lower reserve ratio than you do. So I was kind of wondering given the continuing improvement in credit quality, could the pace of the reserve releases pick up in \u201914?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, I\u2019ll speak for our bank, right. I don\u2019t think so. What we\u2019re down, what we\u2019re left with is really improvement in residential mortgage and home equity. Those are really the only two portfolios where there is still work to be done in terms of the fallout from the recession. So absent that I would say we\u2019re steady as you go for the moment but there is probably not loss of reserve release.", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard. One thing I hope you guys like about is we\u2019re not that interesting and volatile and it's a great example. We didn\u2019t have anywhere near the same credit issues in the first place. We didn\u2019t have to build the reserves in the first place and we\u2019ve been very steady and methodical and thoughtful all in line with regulator views and accounting views to make sure that we\u2019re not living on and counting on these reserve releases and you shouldn\u2019t either because it\u2019s not sustainable. I think you\u2019ll see a lot more of what we\u2019ve done in the past it's how we get to a point of stability where all of a sudden and we\u2019re all going to start having reserve releases. And in a forward view there should be a day when banks have growing loans, balance sheet is growing and we\u2019re adding to our reserves at a level equal to and higher than the current day because those are for future loan charge-offs. So I think we\u2019re probably closest to most of new basic inflection point but this year we'll have a little bit more but we haven\u2019t relied on it because at this point we\u2019re not counting on it to get through this year or the next one.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Rich I kind of agree with you, but it just gets a little frustrating when I see bank stocks go up on reserve releases and you guys are more prudent going for the full cycle and you don\u2019t get credit for the quality of earnings but in any event that\u2019s a\u2026", "Richard Davis", "I hadn\u2019t noticed.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "If I can just follow up one with Bill, so from your comments it seems like the new belief that reserve for loan ratio for your individual bank will be higher than it was previous to the crisis whether it\u2019s from the re-regulatory process or what have you, so whether it was one in a quarter to 150 previous to the cycle we\u2019re going to be somewhat higher than that?", "Bill Parker", "Right, the first thing is you have to look at the difference and mix so and we do have a fairly large card portfolio relative to the size of our balance sheet relative to our peers. So that\u2019s obviously going to keep parts a little higher. And then again as Richard said we just didn\u2019t go up as much so we\u2019re just not going to go down as much.", "Richard Davis", "With that Chris over the course of time 1.53 charge-off right, we think over the course of time the long time this bank is a 1% charge-off and with FAS 114 in other areas we want to make sure we stay aligned with that and for investors we think to the extent we can stay within the balance of all the rules and not create these volatilities that were occurred at giving away too much than build it back when we don\u2019t need it. But again the line with rules and regulation, we would love to stay as steady as we can and have the appropriate level. It actually serves another form of capital if you have a good reserve portfolio for loans that could go bad but for reasons we all know, I don\u2019t think any bank is under where there are long term run rate will beneath them we know in the last few years if we didn\u2019t take risks as an industry on loans when we shouldn\u2019t have, but we probably have record low position and we are going to start building that back. So don\u2019t anyone be disappointed when charge-off rates start to move up, provision releases stop and provision build starts, that\u2019s actually a pretty good sign that we're all getting back to doing what we\u2019re supposed to do which is make loans to qualified people and every once in a while one doesn\u2019t get paid back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS. ", "Steve Scinicariello - UBS", "I just want to circle back to the Chicago branch acquisition for a moment. I'm just curious as you kind of look at the long-term potential opportunity there, do you see the greatest potential benefit over the long-term from ramping up loan growth or cross-selling and further penetrating a customer base in that market? Just kind of curious how you look at that long-term potential benefit, where is the biggest source of opportunity for you? ", "Richard Davis ", "Steve, good question. If we had had our druthers we started from the bottom we would always be top one, two or three in every market in terms of consumer, small business and wealth management. First of all because you're pervasive enough to matter, you are in someone\u2019s life, at where they are near their work, near their home, in between and now on mobile technology; you are pervasive to them, that\u2019s our goal. I am not kind of get out of markets where I am sixth or seventh, that we are still good for the shareholders but I would love to move up in every market to top three. ", "Chicago is going to take a while, so we\u2019re are going to move up now at seventh or eighth. In terms of branch distribution we might get in the top five and we can find other deals to couple together maybe more grocery partners and things we could get into the top three or four, that\u2019s really what we are headed towards, then the scale matters. Right, so every time I run an ad in the Chicago Tribune and we do something on mobile technology or Chicago land we do a sponsorship of something and partner with the city or some of the suburbs, then all this go so much further and so much deeper and so much better. Employees are more enthused, we get more of a kind of a reputation build. And it\u2019s one of the greatest cities in the country, so it\u2019s also worth investing there for a long-term because it\u2019s pretty loyal market. ", "So, for us it\u2019s a step towards getting into top most pervasive companies and the two or three really, really big companies that are legacy and we are legacy in a couple of other big markets and legacy always has to worry that they are going to get old and become part of a kind of an old-fashioned paradigm and we are going to try to protect ourselves when we are really big, and when we are not big we are going to be that really vicious competitor that comes up and tries to reset the paradigm and get people to pay attention to our self. This deal was perfect on all accounts, financially it just accrues because its scale and because it allows us to extend in a market that\u2019s going to grow because Chicago will grow.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS", "Well makes total sense but I know you said you are more than willing to look at more of these types of transactions in other markets. The question I have is do you think you might get the opportunity? Just curious what your thoughts might be on that.", "Richard Davis ", "I know more -- I think we're considered a disciplined buyer and so the deals you will never know are the ones that came and went because we said there is no way we are going to pay that for that. But every once in a while one comes along where the motivations of the seller and our interest is high, the price is good for both parties including all the shareholders and this is one of those that came together. So, we if those circumstances align again, we'll do more of these deals because we think it\u2019s the right way to take advantage, especially in an unfinished kind of unsettled market where until things are normal again, some people have the need to shed assets, others like us will be interested in acquiring assets where it make senses and kind of jumpstart the organic trip that otherwise happens in normal time. So, if we don\u2019t do another deal, the branches will be fine, but if more come along on these terms we'll take them.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "I was trying to gauge your conviction level that loan growth is coming back. On the one hand, Richard, you're expressing optimism that we've heard from several other bank CEOs on the other hand what I think I heard you guys say is that loan utilization declined down to 23%, that your customers aren't drawing down their deposits, which is a leading indicator, that you don't expect a whole lot of loan growth the next quarter or two and that you yourselves are still watching your nickels and dimes a lot given some uncertainty. So I know you've been more conservative than most over the years and we're all trying to figure out the pace of loan growth. What sort of leading indicator is sentiment or is this just informal? Is this a gut feel? Just any other color on loan growth. ", "Richard Davis ", "Yes, so Mike, Erika\u2019s question number one, I think I said it was a tale of two halves and I was confessing that it's solely sentiment from my customers and my bankers that tells me that things are better than they have been. It is not on the balance sheet, it is not evidential at all which is why we do not agree with you that first deposit get used, then lines that are already outstanding get used and then new lines get created and we haven\u2019t seen any of that. So, it is purely sentiment and perhaps it\u2019s a lot of just pent-up long overdue demand to get things move moving. ", "But sentiment is always the leading indicator, right and so I think as I said before, Spring will tell this story more than most springs and the second half will be what the sentiment yields as will results or it will be nothing more than sentiment and we'll be talking in April and again in July as seen -- well at least we see, at least consistent loan growth of the 6% plus annualized loan growth we've been doing it through the whole recession, the only reason we can\u2019t keep doing it. But at the same time you\u2019ve heard us before we are not going to compete on term, on structure we are going to compete on rate and we can continue to do that and the rates are seeing a little bit at compression. So, we'll be thoughtful about it but, you repeated what I said which is its simply sentiment, I don\u2019t have evidence yet. And when the evidence starts, the best news I'll have for you is the deposits are drawing down, lines are getting used, and people are starting to show an interest and be involved. ", "I said before too that I do think that perhaps different than almost any other recovery coming from a recession that people will not be -- the consumer that blinks first, it will be the businesses, meaning that the consumer is not going to evidence like it always has a real strong sense that we are now ready, get ready we are going to buy. I think the businesses are going to have to find a way to incentivise that interest, they can incentivise the product at creations or innovation or pricing and start pulling consumers across to start investing. As long as they invest consumers are starting to feel better and the products are more interesting and the pricing is more attractive, I think that\u2019s the magic that will pull this one out, that for the first time I think businesses will drive through this recovery, it really has a lot to do with their behaviours, in and above whatever spend and we are hearing from consumers.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And one follow up, you talked about the trade-off between price and loan growth and as a low cost producer you can probably afford to charge lower rates on the loans, but you have seen compression across the board on your loans. Are you close to a tipping point where you say, hey, we shouldn\u2019t charge a whole lot less or as long as you\u2019re growing some NII, it\u2019s okay?", "Richard Davis", " ", "I would say our pricing is going to be relatively stable Mike on a go forward basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.", " ", "Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning, thanks for taking my question.

We've heard from a number of competitors particularly in the southeast that that is a growing area of competition. What\u2019s your sense in your markets as to the demand for commercial real estate opportunities and looking into 2014 and how competitive has the pricing gone?", "Richard Davis", " ", "I will start with demand. I mean we have seen pretty good demand on the coast and in the southeast as you mentioned, that was our -- the southeast was our fastest growing market in the fourth quarter. And we have heard from our clients that they are seeing more demand for their product whether it\u2019s storage or build to suite, more than just the multifamily that we\u2019ve seen in the past several quarters. So, we are seeing a pickup in demand which is positive and then on the pricing, I think to the extent there has been pricing compression, I think that\u2019s mostly behind us. I think the pricing is fairly stable right now. So, we saw good demand in the fourth quarter and expect to continue next year.", "", "Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities", "Then if I can follow up with a question on the capital market side, Richard you\u2019ve been obviously been quite correctly optimistic particularly for your own business over the last couple of years; as we head into a higher rate cycle, there is concerns I think across the broader market that demand for fixed income underwriting may come down a little bit, demand potentially conversely for equity underwriting may increase. How are you looking at that business heading into 2014 in terms of some of the bigger picture trends that are affecting interest rates? ", "Richard Davis", " ", "You know Matt, I think; I still see \u201914 looking a lot like \u201913. You\u2019ve got leverage lending and middle market activity still pretty high. You\u2019ve got syndicated issuance still getting better over time primarily refinancing and that refinancing as opposed to new transactions creates a bit of a downward pressure on yields. We've got loan growth looking seasonally best in the western markets and particularly seasonally high including some of the retail groups. ", "As it relates to more traditional lending, that\u2019s where we would see and expect it by the way everything is performing as we thought it was just kind of slow annuity like, as it relates to the more sophisticated transactions what we are seeing in the capital markets are particularly a deal event, action oriented items where someone wants to buy another company or make a particular transaction in the market to create some additional financing and we are there now where we didn\u2019t use to be. And we can handle those activities but kind of following the conversation with Mike, the sentiment isn\u2019t necessarily any stronger than it was to generate a sense that that\u2019s going to be different in \u201914 but it's not worse than it was in \u201913. ", "It just seems to be kind of a slow steady part of that recovery and I think the very high end of the market reflects exactly what the low end is which is careful, thoughtful, event driven by taking advantage when the chance comes along. And the whole economy is still uneven, so there are people who have something they want to get rid of and there are others who find value in it and that\u2019s kind of where we are until we see something more predictable. Bill, you want to add to that?", "", "Bill Parker", "Well, I think, you know in terms of the capital markets activity, I think \u201913 was obviously a very good year for refinancing and higher rates may moderate that a little bit, but there is still a lot of acquisition activity and that will clearly generate bond activity.

Was that geography and that\u2019s a benefit or a reduction of expenses that\u2019s probably in other expenses, is that correct?", "Richard Davis", " ", "It\u2019s actually an increase in mortgage revenue and it\u2019s a reassessment of reserve levels every quarter and it\u2019s just that what we think is the appropriate level and that\u2019s reflected in mortgage revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research, LLC.", "", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Question, you\u2019ve had a great deal of success over the past few years with your loan production offices outside of your traditional banking markets. And could you just speak to what percentage of your commercial revenues are now coming out of those offices and are there plans for expansion in to other markets?", "Richard Davis", " ", "Nancy, do you mean for the middle market or in corporate?", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Yes.", "", "Richard Davis", " ", "Okay. So we have, what we call an adjacent state program. So for instance we have our folks in one market managing Michigan and managing Pennsylvania, we have others managing Indiana and managing Georgia. And that\u2019s worked quite well for us. So what we\u2019ve done is we have a local in footprint management team that has people also in adjacent space where we have enough of a reputation, a halo, we have people know who we are. At the middle market level if you don\u2019t have branches you have to be valuable to these folks in a different way because you have to get them up on more than cash management, treasury management, products and some of the servicing it would be more technical and more mobile.", "That\u2019s how we\u2019re having success there. It\u2019s probably 4% to 5% of our total. It\u2019s not a very big number. It\u2019s not intended to be because I do think it gives certain level as you get to the point where you have branches. On the larger end we can do business in all 50 states because the corporate customers, it\u2019s not even in the first three questions of whether or not you have branches nearby, they\u2019re not looking for that from a -- and so we\u2019re a full on national provider in both corporate and commercial real estate.", "But as it relates to middle market, it\u2019s probably 4% to 5% impact on our total, and unless and until we were to find a very large branch acquisition in an adjacent space it\u2019s going to stay that way because we are just going to really drill down where people knows us best and have the ability if they want us to use our services on the ground.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA", "Hi, good morning, just a couple of quick follow ups, on the commitment growth you saw I know every business is different, every line is different. But is there any kind of historical rule of thumb you would look to for the typical lag between commitments turning into funded balances?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, this is Bill. I would say we sort of exceeded the historical lag. So normally by this time in an expansionary period you will be seeing these lines being drawn more than they are today. I mean some of our categories are down 10% in terms of normal utilization levels. So I think we\u2019re still all anticipating when this confidence turns into investment.", "", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I would agree with that. And I would say that -- surprisingly they\u2019re all down a lot very much the same in terms of traditional history, commercial real estate which is the last in, last out in terms of problems and in terms of growth and that\u2019s probably the same in this cycle. But if you get anything from small business to commercial real estate specialty products through community banking, they\u2019re all down, in fact even more, I mean bill our collective utilization for the wholesale credits for this company was at 38% kind of level and we\u2019re at 23% and that\u2019s on well over $100 billion so that\u2019s in its own right is just a huge place built at the right we\u2019re in places we\u2019ve never been, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up but in the next month if we go down again we\u2019ll say one more time.", "But I like the fact that it\u2019s pent up opportunity, it is even better, it\u2019s one step better than in an unknown line or loan at this stage because these are people paying for it, they\u2019re paying us to have first have a line, they want have the access to it, the fact they keep growing lines over 11% last year such that they are planning to do something and that kind of feeds my sentiment issue, my answer with Mike Mayo, which is actually that number get stronger, not weaker. So we\u2019ve got a lot of canaries in the mine, they\u2019re all chirping but nothing is happening yet.", "", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA", "That\u2019s very helpful. On the commercial products I guess as a follow up or clarification, when I think I heard you say '14 should look a lot like 13'. We should be working off the 13 full year base, not the run rate from the fourth quarter for that line item, right?", "Richard Davis", " ", "Correct.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA", "And then lastly just as I think about capital and I guess it touches on the question I think Erika asked, RWA growth versus asset growth. I mean when I look at some of the other super-regionals who are in that advanced approach bucket, mega regionals, whatever you want to call them. RWAs have been falling even if assets have been growing for the past two to three quarters. And I wonder is that a pent up opportunity for U.S. Bank or because some of your peers have more punitive noninvestment grade securities and things like that, are they just reversing out of capital penalty you never had to begin with?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "I can\u2019t tell you what others are doing. I will tell you ours is pretty straight forward. First of all, while we\u2019re in advanced approach purchase bank the ratio we\u2019re giving you is a standardized approach because that is your binary constraint that is the lower ratio. So it\u2019s a pretty simple equation, it\u2019s basically commitments that are causing the off balance sheet growth. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Morning guys, two quick follow-ups. Andy on net interest income -- you mentioned the net interest margin outlook for the first quarter. Do you hope to grow the net interest income dollars, just the balance sheet still growing, but you might have some seasonality in terms of the account pressure I guess. What would be outlook for the net interest income dollars?", "Andy Cecere", "Good question John. All things been equal I would expect to be relatively stable, but the first quarter has two fewer days than the fourth quarter. And that in of itself cost us about $30 million - $35 million.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay -- otherwise you expect it to be flattish?", "Andy Cecere", "Pretty close, yes.", "", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then on the expenses you gave the outlook for the first quarter, would you expect the expenses to be declining from the first quarter. In other words are there seasonal items that fight the first quarter expenses as well?", "Andy Cecere", "No, I would say the first quarter is sort of a normal quarter in terms of activity. There are some things that are higher like FICO expense, some things that are lower like legal and professional. But overall it's relatively representative.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. So to the extent the first quarter efficiency ratio it\u2019s below the -- it\u2019s really the seasonal pressure on some of the fee income lines?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, the first quarter is a seasonally low quarter in terms of fees, particularly in payments business, card and merchant. It's the lowest quarter of the year.", "Richard Davis", "There is no holiday, we got the pay downs on the credit cards, so it's always our [weak company] quarter. But that\u2019s when things pick up in quarters two and three.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Could you talk about the non-QM market? Do you expect to participate in it and if so do you expect it to have an incremental uptick in residential loan growth on your balance sheet?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "We are going to participate in the non-QM market and much of it is very similar to what we do today. So again we do offer today interest only loans to private client type customers. We do offer lower loan to value loans that might not meet the 43% debt to income in the QM. So, on a go forward basis it doesn\u2019t have a material impact on types of loans that we\u2019re going to be putting on in balance sheet.", "Richard Davis", " ", "That\u2019s right. And QM-related you're going to find, Kevin, that we really don\u2019t have any kind of impact at all to our origination.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Would you change anything about the product, whether it's term or rate in order to take into account the risk associated with non-QM lending?", "Andy Cecere", " ", "No, I mean we recognize the risk and we've mitigated it with either higher down payments in general wealthier customers that type of thing. So we believe that we have the offset built into the underwriting.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Thank you.", "Judy Murphy", "This is Judy back again. Thanks everyone for listening to our call today and with that if you do have any follow-up questions, certainly feel free to call myself or Sean O'Connor and we will hopefully touch base. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith Murphy", "Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter 2010 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. ", "I'd like to begin on Page 3 of the presentation and point out a few of the highlights from our fourth quarter results. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $974 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 or $0.49 per diluted common share. Earnings were $0.19 higher than the same quarter of last year and $0.04 higher than the third quarter of 2010. Included in this quarter's results were a few significant items that positively impacted earnings per diluted common share by $0.03. We will discuss them more in detail later on the call.", "We achieved record total net revenue of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter. This represented a 7.9% increase over the same quarter of 2009 and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter. ", "Total average loans grew year-over-year by 2%, about half of which can be attributed to recent acquisitions. Importantly, for the second quarter in a row, we achieved linked-quarter loan growth as total average loans grew by 1.5% over the third quarter, the majority of which represented organic growth, as this growth occurred despite a slight reduction in wholesale line utilization. ", "We achieved a strong 9.5% growth year-over-year in average low-cost deposits and 6.4% growth unannualized on a linked-quarter basis. The low-cost categories include noninterest bearing, interest checking, money market and savings accounts, and represent a solid and growing core customer base. As expected, credit quality improved as the net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 5.8% and 6%, respectively, from the third quarter.", "Further, this improvement supported a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, as the company recorded a provision for credit losses that was $25 million less than the net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Our company continues to generate significant capital each quarter, and our capital position remains strong with the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios increasing to 7.8% and 10.5%, respectively, at December 31.", "Slide 4 displays our consistent performance metrics over the past five quarters. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.31%, and return on average common equity was 13.7%. The five-quarter trends of our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.83% was equal to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 and, as we predicted, was lower than the previous quarter's net interest margin of 3.91%. Our fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 52.5%, slightly higher than the prior quarter and above the same quarter of last year.", "We remain the best among our peers in terms of efficiency, and the increase in this ratio reflects both the ongoing investments and the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions on revenue and on expense. ", "Turning to Slide 5. As previously noted, our capital position remained strong and continues to grow. In fact, our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III guidelines at December 31 was 7.3%, above the 7% Basel III level required in 2019. We will continue to generate significant capital through earnings each quarter going forward, even if the economy, which is now showing more signs of a recovery, begins to slow. ", "As I have said before, our company can support a dividend increase for our shareholders while still meeting or exceeding any new capital requirements that may be forthcoming. Increasing the dividend remains the top priority for our management team and the Board of Directors. And, as you know, we are one of 19 large banks that was required to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve System. We have submitted our plan, and we expect to receive a response in late March.", "Moving on to Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $3.9 billion, or 2% year-over-year. As noted on the slide, excluding acquisitions, total average loans grew by 0.9% year-over-year, as the commitment utilization rate of our commercial and corporate borrowers declined from 30% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 26% in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline in the utilization rate was significant enough to offset much of the new loan origination business we experienced over the past year. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, however, total average loans increased by 1.5%, as the demand for new loans from credit-worthy borrowers was more than enough to offset a nominal decrease in the average utilization rate on commercial commitments. In fact, we recorded an increase in average commercial loans outstanding quarter-over-quarter. This is the second quarter in a row that we have shown linked-quarter increases, something we hadn't seen since the fourth quarter of 2008.", "In total, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $46 billion in the fourth quarter, about $8 billion higher than the previous quarter's total and the highest level recorded since before the fourth quarter of 2008.", "New lending activity for the full year of 2010, excluding mortgage production, was over $147 billion, approximately 14% higher than 2009. Total average deposits increased by $9.4 billion or 5.2% over the same quarter of last year. As you can see from the slide, a very small portion of that increase came from acquisitions. ", "Total average deposits also grew by $7.6 billion on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to the higher corporate trust and institutional deposits as well as growth in the Consumer and Small Business area. On December 30, we acquired approximately $8 billion in deposits related to the acquisition of a securitization trust administration business. This acquisition had a minimal impact on this quarter's average balances, but will have a positive impact on the first quarter of 2011.", "Turning to Slide 7. The company reported record total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $4.7 billion. The increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by earning asset growth, strength in our fee-based businesses, organic growth initiatives and acquisitions, muted somewhat by the impact of recent legislative actions. ", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Fourth quarter total net charge-offs of $937 million were 5.8% lower than the third quarter of 2010. Nonperforming asset, excluding covered assets, decreased by $212 million or 6%. As you can see from the graphs, this represents the third consecutive quarter of declining net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, giving us further confidence that these trends will continue.", "On Slide 9, the graph on the left shows continue improvement in late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in early stage delinquencies, primarily driven by commercial real estate loans, a category that continues to be under stress. ", "On the right-hand side of Slide 9, the continuing favorable trend in criticized assets again gives us further indication that we have reached the inflection point in credit quality. Accordingly, we expect the level of both net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to trend lower in the first quarter of 2011.", "Turning to Slide 10. You can see that for the first time since this credit cycle began, we recorded a provision for credit losses less than the total net charge-offs. Specifically, we released $25 million of reserves. Comparatively, the provision for credit losses equaled net charge-offs in the third quarter, while an incremental provision equal to approximately 25% of net charge-offs was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. The reserve release was primarily driven by improvement in credit quality of the commercial and retail loan portfolios.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I'll take a few minutes to provide you with more details about the results. ", "I turn your attention to Slide 11, which gives a full view of the fourth quarter of 2010 results compared to those recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Earnings per diluted common share were $0.49 for the fourth quarter of 2010, $0.04 higher than the prior quarter and $0.19 higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. The key drivers of the company's fourth quarter results are detailed on Slide 12. ", "The $372 million or 61.8% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of a 7.9% increase in net revenue and a $476 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, which included the $303 million favorable change in excess provision expense. These favorable changes in total net revenue and the provision were partially offset by 11.5% increase in non-interest expense year-over-year. ", "Net income was $66 million or 7.3% higher on a linked-quarter basis. A 2.9% growth in total net revenue and a favorable variance of $83 million in the provision for loan losses more than offset the 4.2% increase in non-interest expense quarter-over-quarter.", "A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our fourth quarter results to prior periods are detailed on Slide 13. The significant items called out for the fourth quarter of 2010 were a $103 million gain equal to $41 million after-tax related to the exchange of the long-term Asset Management business of FAF Advisors for an equity interest in Nuveen Investments, net securities losses of $40 million and a $25 million reserve release.", "The two significant items impacting the fourth quarter of 2009 are also highlighted on Slide 13, and include $158 million of security losses and a $278 million incremental provision expense. ", "Turning to Slide 14. Net interest income decreased year-over-year by $139 million or 5.9% due to a $14.5 billion increase in average earning assets. The increase in average earning assets was driven by growth in the securities portfolio, loans held for sale, loans and acquisitions. The net interest margin of 3.83% was equal to the net interest margin of the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower funding costs, offset by growth in lower-yielding assets, particularly residential mortgages and investment securities, as we build our balance sheet liquidity and the impact of CARD Act.", "On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $22 million, the result of a $7.9 billion increase in average earning assets, offset by an eight basis point decline in net interest margin. The net interest margin was lower than the prior quarter due to the growth in lower-yielding assets and the impact of CARD Act. ", "Assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect the net interest margin will decline in the first quarter by an amount similar to the decline we experienced between the third and fourth quarters as we continue to add to our securities portfolio.", "Slide 15 provides you with more detail on the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by $3.9 billion or 2% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, average total loans increased by 0.9%. And as you can see from the chart on the left, this increase was principally driven by a 15.8% increase in residential mortgages, partially offset by a 4.5% year-over-year decline in average commercial loans outstanding. ", "As Richard pointed out, the reduction in wholesale lending year-over-year is primarily due to the lower commitment utilization by our commercial customers, which has declined from 30% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 26% in the current quarter, representing a decrease of approximately $2.7 billion of outstandings. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, the 1.5% increase in average loans outstanding was driven by increases in all major loan categories, as the demand for credit from both our new and existing business and consumer customers continues to trend higher. ", "Moving to Slide 16. You can see the growth to total low-cost core deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $9.5 billion or 5.2% year-over-year. Significantly, low-cost core deposits, non-interest bearing, interest checking money market and savings grew by 9.5%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 4.2%, while average low-cost deposits increased by 6.4%, principally due to corporate trust and broker/dealer activity as well as growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking business line.", "Slide 17 represent in more detail of the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Non-interest income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $206 million or 10.2% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. This variance was driven by growth in payments, commercial products and mortgage banking revenue and the positive change in net securities losses as well as the FAF-Nuveen transaction gain. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower deposit service charges, which reflected the legislative and bank-developed pricing changes. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $112 million or 5.3%. This positive variance was primarily the result of higher trust and investment management fees, commercial product fees, payments-related revenue and other income, which was higher principally due to the FAF-Nuveen Gain on sale and again on the company's investment in Visa Inc.  Offsetting these positive variances were mortgage banking revenue, which declined by $60 million primarily due to a reduction in application volume and lower deposit service charges reflecting the impact of legislative changes. ", "As we have discussed in the past, legislative changes have and will continue to impact revenue going forward. We have estimated that the impact of Reg E, along with the bank-initiated pricing and policy changes on our deposit charge service revenue, without mitigating actions, would be approximately $440 million to $480 million on a full run rate basis.", "The German amendment and the recently issued guidelines for debit card interchange group proposed by the Federal Reserve will also have an impact on our revenue going forward. Our company's debit and prepaid card interchange revenue in 2010 was approximately $515 million. The proposed changes to debit card interchange, as they currently stand, will reduce that revenue by approximately 75% beginning in the second half of 2011. We estimate that in 2011 and 2012, our company will recapture approximately half of the revenue loss from the changes in both demand deposit service charges and debit interchange through product feature and pricing changes.", "Slide 18 highlights non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $257 million or 11.5%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits driven by incentives and commissions, additional staffing for branch expansion and business line initiatives, as well as merit increases. An increase in professional service expense and technology and communication expense related to investment product and projects and acquisitions, which accounted for approximately $25 million of the increase. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense was higher by $100 million or 4.2% due to an increase in compensation related to additional staffing and commissions; higher professional services expense related to technology projects and some seasonality; and seasonally higher investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.", "Finally, the tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with 25.9% in the third quarter of 2010 and 20.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. ", "Our company's conservative credit and underwriting culture, as well as our very disciplined loan origination process has resulted in a lower mortgage origination repurchase volumes and expense relative to our peers. Given the current environment, we expect mortgage repurchase activity to remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters before beginning to moderate downward, with quarterly repurchase expense of $50 million to $70 million per quarter.", "Before leaving the mortgage topic, I\u2019d like to turn to Slide 20 and review U.S. Bank's role as trustee for residential mortgage-backed securities. We are one of the largest Corporate Trustees in the U.S, so our name has and will continue to come up in news reports regarding foreclosures on mortgages held and securitizations, for which we are the appointed trustee. As trustee, U.S. Bank is not the originator, owner or servicer of these loans nor is it the sponsor or depositor for the securitization trust. Our role is to follow very specific administrative duties as outlined in the documents that establish the trust. As trustee, U.S. Bank does not have a role in the servicing of the mortgages that are used as collateral in the trust. As trustee, we do not select the servicer of the mortgages or have a role in the actions the servicer takes in the foreclosure process. We do not hire or direct the lawyers to bring foreclosure disputes to court. Further, as trustee and/or custodian, we do not have responsibility for determining the validity or enforceability of the underlying mortgage documents.", "We are named in these suits simply because we hold the security interest in mortgage in our name as trustee for the securitization trust. It is important for all of our constituents to know that the actions of the servicers and the courts decisions have no financial impact on our company, nor do they imply that we have, in any way, not fulfilled our responsibilities as trustee. However, these incorrect portrayals of our roles or responsibilities as a corporate trustee create reputation risk, and we are fully prepared to defend the accuracy of our actions and to educate the media about the role of corporate trust custodians and trustees. ", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide 21. ", "2010 was a year filled with challenges for all of us in the banking industry. The industry faced and has yet to fully absorb unprecedented legislative and regulatory changes; an uncertain and slow-to-recover economy; and the need to regain the public's confidence and trust. Despite this environment, U.S. Bank's performance this quarter and in 2010 was strong. For U.S. Bank, it was a year filled with opportunities; opportunities to acquire new customers, to improve our processes, to expand our franchise and to build upon a reputation as a trusted provider of financial products and services. We are larger and stronger than we were at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of this cycle.", "We are well prepared to adapt to the changing legislative, regulatory and economic environment. We have a strong foundation in place. We have a proven track record of success. We have launched many new initiatives and made the strategic investments necessary to provide our customers of the highest-quality experience and to maintain our highly engaged employee base. U.S. Bancorp is positioned to win and perform for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and importantly, for our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill Parker and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Basic question around the balance sheet and moving the balance sheet into a little bit more of an efficient set of earning assets, getting the loan growth. Have you outlined significant increase in commitments? Could you just talk through how you are hoping to change those commitments into lines? Because in the slow industry environment, that seems like what you need in order to get to NIM up a little bit?", "Andrew Cecere", "This is Richard. I don't know that we know how to incentivize people to draw in their line except the first and most important step is to get them to line. So I think in the order of things, I'm not surprised that people are either husbanding deposits or getting credit lines for their options that they're going to need as things start to change. And you're seeing some of the larger corporations now moving into more M&A and acquisition space. So I think it makes sense to me that the commitments are moving up. I'm looking forward to the day that the usage will move up. And as you heard us say, it's at record lows now in the wholesale side down to -- actually, just slightly below 26%. But that's the -- I think that in order of things, if we just keep becoming more important to more of our customers and be invited to more of these credit positions that we're now seeing and hold the open-to-buy larger and larger, eventually, based on the needs of our customers, I think we'll benefit from having seen the usage go up. That will just be a bonus when part of it starts to happen. And the fact that we're still growing with -- that going the other direction, I think, reflects the fact we are getting some of the market share growth.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Could you just give us a sense of how typical it is to have an increase in commitments as a borrower? Have an increase in commitments but not take action on those commitments over the course of a year's timeframe?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. So first of all, it's kind of like the, it's the corollary to just holding more deposits, right? So if you're just composite-rich and you see that now, that one is just holding onto their balance sheet for -- their options and their choices, even if it's not efficient for them to do that. If, in fact, they want to have an additional level of safety and comfort, they'll take an extension line of credit, which they'll pay for. The issue is, as and over the course of time, it becomes more expensive to hold an unused line of credit. That might be the next thing we'll see where people start to use it because they've got to get value for it, or they'll stop having either the need or pay for the cost of having the abundance of caution by having the open-to-buy, which they may never use. Now, Bill, I've gone as far as I can in terms of behaviors. You want to add it up in the credit card?", "P. Parker", "Yes, I think coming through this recession, people are looking to have a fortress balance sheet. So they're very interested in having sources of capital for when the economy really begins to move.", "Richard Davis", "I'll add one more thing. We also track the percentage of customers who haven't -- don't use it at all, zero usage. And that's just shy of 50%, which is also a record high as usage of 20% is record low. So there are at least half of our customers that are using our balance sheet as an alternative option without having any use of that line.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "It's just interesting, because clearly drawing or having more commitments during the stress period of the cycle made a lot of sense at this stage. I'm wondering if it's any indication of interest by your customers to actually begin to invest with some of the tax policies that went through recently in accelerated depreciation. Did that spark any incremental commitment generation?", "Andrew Cecere", "Betsy, this is Andy. I think it's as Bill described. There is signs of a recovery. Companies are preparing for further investment and taking out lines, and having that ready and available is one of those actions for preparedness.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "A question with respect to growing the securities portfolio. So you grew it on an average basis by about $2 billion this quarter and indicated you're going to continue to grow it in the first quarter. So I guess two questions: Number one, maybe you could provide us a sense of how much you expect to grow the securities portfolio looking out, maybe in 2011? And then secondarily, what types of securities are you buying in terms of a type and duration? And can you give us a sense of how you're managing that interest rate risk?", "Richard Davis", "Ed, I'm going to give that to Andy. This is Richard. But let me talk about motivation first. Some of our most important actions as management is to protect the shareholders. And in doing so, we were very careful of the cycle not to introduce more capital than the company needed and to not balloon the balance sheet any more than we needed to. And in both cases, we're trying to be as precise as we can by not overreaching. In capital, I think you'd agree we have a sufficiently strong capital base and a great quarterly growth of capital. On the liquidity side, as we start looking at the capital assessments and the requirements being placed on us, we wanted to respond to what needed to be a higher more liquid balance sheet on balance sheet. And yet, not having done it ahead of time and wishing we had. So you're watching us now move back into a more kind of the median space of banks that have appropriate liquidity at their beckoned call and what Andy and I are doing now is starting to build that up as carefully and slowly over the course of time, and still waiting for more guidance so that we don't overreach and have an excessively large balance sheet like we didn't want to do with capital. So you're seeing that process, and it is a journey and it is going to be a 2011 event.", "And now, let me give it Andy to answer the specific questions you gave.", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. So Ed, first let me tell you, our liquidity has never been stronger. We have tremendous loan borrowing capacity. And what we're doing is to put some of that loan borrowing capacity on the balance sheet to meet some of the requirements of liquidity coverage ratio. So that's why we're doing this. Further, I will tell you that the assets that we're putting on the balance sheet are partly Ginnie Mae Securities and partly Treasury securities. So they have zero impact to risk-weighted assets. I will also tell you they have zero or very close to zero impact to net interest income. What they will do, however, is lower the margin a bit, and that's what you saw this quarter and you'll see next quarter. We would expect to add a few $3 billion to $5 billion of securities per quarter this year to again meet some of the requirements in the liquidity coverage ratio. But again, I'll highlight no impact to net interest income and no impact to risk-weighted assets.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "So in that regard, you would say they're pretty well match funded with longer duration liabilities, and that's why they're not really providing much incremental NII?", "Andrew Cecere", "That's correct. We're putting those on in an interest rate-neutral sense, not increasing nor decreasing our sensible liquidity position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "A question for you, Andy. Your comment on the potential to recapture half of the lost revenue on Durbin and Reg E. Did I hear that correctly?", "Andrew Cecere", "That's correct.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do in that regard and how maybe your philosophy on Retail Banking would have changed a bit as this has all come through?", "Andrew Cecere", "I'll start, then I'll hand it to Richard. First of all, let me be clear that remember, our Reg E legislative changes and pricing impacts are in the neighborhood of $450 million. And our impact to the Durbin, as currently highlighted, would be about 75% of revenue, so just over $400 million. So out of the combination of both of those, we would expect to recapture approximately half through a combination of a number of action plans, including changes to  our checking, account pricing, changes to our merchant pricing, changes to our debit interchange, reduction in rewards, perhaps a fee. We have a number of action items in place that will do that, and we'll be introducing those throughout 2011 to offset some of the impacts we talked about.", "Richard Davis", "So John, let me add to that. It's Richard. First of all, I said up until the last call that we will be a laggard in taking action, the kind that Andy mentioned, because of our strong position and because we wanted to watch and see what happens to the marketplace. I'm going to update that and tell you we're not going to be a late follower anymore. We're going to be right in the game. And I'll tell you why. The decision by the Fed to respond to the Congress' question that was asked of them for the Durbin amendment at 12 basis points maximum is so sufficiently and absolutely below the cost of doing business, we no longer have the luxury of waiting, not for our shareholders anyway. Just so you know, I think U.S. bank, Elavon, is probably the low-cost provider in that whole space and we can talk about that another time. But for us, it's anywhere from 40 to 50 basis points for those transactions, which includes improving the transaction of the card, embossing the card, sending the card, managing the relationship, paying for their fraud, all of those things, all of which, by the way, were not part of the question that the Congress asked the Fed to answer. So I take a sidebar here. Many of us in the industry are going to be going back, working with the Congress to explain to them what the unintended consequences will be of this decision. But also we're going to go back and ask them to ask a better question. I think the Fed did a great job of asking the question they were asked, but the question was wrong and it was incomplete, and that's why you have this disconnect between getting recaptured at least the cost of doing business. All of that said means that we, as a bank, will no longer lag. We will see sometime in the early or middle part of this year our own actions and making sure that we have fair pricing for checking products, which are part of what debit includes. We'll be working behind the scenes to see if we can get a better answer out of both the Congress and the Fed. And to answer your most important question, the long-term ramifications of branch banking are now in question. We're not closing any branches. We have over 3,000. We are the most likely purveyor of non-traditional branches in the industry now with about 1,000 of those 3,000 in corporate sites, universities, airports and grocery stores. Those are definitely going to make more sense now than they ever did based on their cost of operation. But a more traditional brick-and-mortar branch on the corner of a very expensive parcel of a shopping center that's not being built anymore, those are going to be rethought as we evaluate really what is the breakeven of a branch when it's not just a deposit-gatherer and a loan-maker, but it's also a fee-provider and I think that is the question that the industry should stop and pause to evaluate. And we won't have those answers until later this year when we see both what the competition does and what our consumers are willing to accept as a price to have a checking account, a debit card or some of the ancillary products that go along with it.", "Keith Horowitz - Citigroup Inc", "Just one follow up from a competitive point of view. Does it make you nervous at all to be in the middle of the pack? Or do you expect competitors to really react in a similar fashion as you're talking?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I don't think, in the scheme of things, there won't be a middle of the pack. It's all going to happen this year. And I don't think a few months doesn't matter. What we'll all learn is what each other is doing, we'll watch our own customers' tolerance. I was actually hoping that we would have a couple of quarters to watch everybody else's actions and learn from them on the other side to see if it was sending business our way or to see what their tolerance was. I no longer want to take that luxury, because I think that's now taking risk. But we'll be right in the game. We won't be behind or below. What you'll see is banks coming up with different ways of characterizing the cost of a checking account, all of which will be slightly different variants, but they will at the end of the day be -- debit card is no longer a free product. There will no longer be rewards to speak of, because it's certainly a loss leader. And debit belongs to checking, so checking will now need to have some level of cost recovery to provide the service that we all have been providing for years. So I think the paradigm will change quickly and it will be this year. And I don't think there will be many behind or ahead because it's just something won't be that long of a window.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David George with Baird.", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "A follow-up on the margin commentary and your comments toward the first quarter margin. How much of the eight basis point decline is kind of the remixing of the balance sheet towards resi mortgage and a little bit more securities? And how much is just strict kind of loan-price competition? Because if you look at both commercial and retail yield or on a loan side are under a little bit of pressure sequentially. So just trying to get a sense as to price competition, what's happening in the market and how are loan spreads today versus, say, three, six and nine months ago?", "Andrew Cecere", "David, this is Andy. I would say the great majority of that decline is due to the securities component of what we talked about. While loan spreads are not as strong as they were perhaps six months ago, they are still significantly stronger than they were two years ago. And we're seeing some moderation in those loan spreads and new originations, but not a significant level. So I would say the great majority is due to securities portfolio addition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "One quick follow-up on the margin to David's question. So Andy, understanding that the securities purchases will not have an effect on NII. Just on the margin uptick, if you're buying $3 billion to $5 billion or so per quarter, will that continue to have each quarter, that effect on the margin sequentially in the second and third quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, John, it will, in the neighborhood of five to eight basis points a quarter.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "Richard, question on the capital management. Just on the dividend amount, can you just remind us would you like to move right up to a 30% type payout ratio on the dividend? And what's your sense of the higher bar that the Fed might require for payouts higher than 30%? And then just between buybacks and dividends, is the old 80% payout still a reasonable target for you guys on kind of total capital management?", "Richard Davis", "First of all, I just want out the gate. This is me sitting in the pit, being held waiting and waiting, and I want to get back on the track. So we're going to stay below the 30%, not very far, but we leave ourselves room because there's also the cost of the preferred dividends and some other things. So our goal is to be somewhere in that 25% to 30% range and expecting that, that will meet with the favor of the Fed, because we don't want to push any limits or envelopes. There's just no reason to, just let us move forward. And so I think that's more likely what most other companies should do. And we've got no guidance on what would be required to go over 30%. And this management team isn't going to test those limits. Secondly, as 80% was an old phraseology we used that 75% to 80% of our returns would be given back to shareholders in the form of dividends and in buybacks, and that is still accurate. As you know, we won't get there right away because of the limitation that we just spoke of as part and in the buybacks, of course, we'll have some equally limited expectation, I think, as people slowly recover and get back to something normal. But whatever normal is, you can expect us to be back to the same normal of returning 75% to 80% of what we make to the shareholders, leaving the rest to us to reinvest and to grow the company.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "And maybe you or Bill could share some thoughts even at a high level on the credit improvement cycle and what you think you might see in terms of the pace of improvement, at least relative between various loan categories.", "P. Parker", "Yes, on the commercial. So excluding commercial real estate, but the general commercial corporate doing very strong, seeing continued improvement across the board there. Commercial real estate, I just have to characterize, is still extremely stressed. I think it will remain extremely stressed for another 12 to 18 months. There has been a little sign of life in multifamily product, medical office product. So there is some demand out there. But obviously, residential construction is not coming back anytime soon. On the Consumer side, other than residential mortgages, the consumer performance continues to get better. And so as long as unemployment improves slightly or at least stays stable, that's good news for the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Just a couple of quick questions. In terms of the very solid loan growth that you show, not only on a year-over-year basis but what appears to be maybe a slight acceleration of loan growth in fourth quarter, is there a specific geography where that's occurring? Or is that occurring largely on roughly an equal basis across the franchise?", "Richard Davis", "So Matt, that's your first question. I'll stop there. It's across the board, and it's partly because we've added our number of people doing loans, making loans across the board. All parts of our business we've been investing for the last couple of years, and I know that's kind of a hollow promise to all of you when there was nothing to show for it, but it's starting to show up now. From the very top and large corporate, we're invited now to participate in a number of new syndicated deals and/or lead a certain number of deals which we didn't lead before, all the way down to small business and having literally added 50% more Small Business originators in the last year and a half, at a time that's just perfectly positioned for us to go after the strengthening Small Business. I'll also say that the loan growth is coming across more area than it did a few quarters ago. Two quarters ago, I would have told you that corporate customers, large corporate were the strongest. They had already done their good work of restructuring their balance sheet and their earnings based on the recovery of the recessions linked. They had capital markets alternatives, and we saw them first. Last quarter I would have brought in, and I did bring in, middle-market is starting to show some signs of strength. And the fact is that they don't have the Capital Market as often, so banks reaping the benefit of that. Now I'll explain it and say that middle-market, across from large cities to community, as well as Small Business from the SBA to the small-ticket leasing to just traditional C&I small business are all showing equally strengthening capability and making themselves more worthwhile for a bank to make loans too. So it's not just across the types of loans or geography, it's also because we have more people in all of those places receiving stronger customers.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And then a quick follow-up on the mortgage banking trends. I'm presuming, given the relatively strong growth in the mortgage banking revenues -- or quarter-over-quarter, they were relatively weak despite solid growth in the origination volume. Should we expect continued declines into the first quarter in mortgage banking?", "Richard Davis", "Right. So Matt, this is Andy. As you know, what drives the mortgage revenue is net application volume, and net application volume is actually down on a linked-quarter basis in the neighborhood of 30%. We would expect that to continue to trend down moderately to the first and second quarter of 2011.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "But you still stand by your earlier statement that you think you're taking market share in that specific business?", "Andrew Cecere", "We are. Absolutely. What drove application volume down for us, as all of our competitors, was a high rate scenario or a high rate environment in that month of December. So that still is the case.", "Richard Davis", "And seasonality too. This is the time of the year where the originations are slow. But I think you'll see on a relative basis, we'll continue to keep it nice and are growing market position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess my first question is on the underlying expense growth. You've done a good job at stripping out some of the revenue items. But I think on the expenses, the growth was being distorted from both acquisitions, some of the tax credits. I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe what a more normal run rate is or what the run rate has been versus the, I recall, 11%, 12% year-over-year on a reported basis?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right, Matt, you're absolutely right. The fourth quarter seasonally is higher and also has the impact of the tax credit amortization being significantly higher than any other quarter of the year. I would say on a normal run rate basis, our expense growth is more in the neighborhood of 5% to 6%.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And as you look into next year, I can appreciate there is some regulatory headwinds. But do you think you'll be able to start exceeding some of the expense growth? And I guess what I'm getting at is there's been lot of investment in the business. I think it's very clear from some of the metrics that you are getting share in a number of areas. But at some point, when you see it filter down on the revenue and obviously the operating leverage, I'm just trying to get a sense of when we might start seeing that a little more transparent?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. And Matt, I think that's a 2012 moment in time, even 2011. We peaked in 2010. Just looking at this year, we peaked in our capital investments. We peaked in what will be the cumulative depreciation effect of all of these investments we've made in the last few years. I think you know we have a lot of catch-up to do from everything from just basic technology to customer research and data, to things like mobile banking and things. We've invested in all of those things, they're all coming to fruition this year. And the cost of them will start to be cumulative in 2011, because we're not having those large investments ahead of us that will start to trend back down. So that's actually a fairly big part of our expense delta. And certainly, what's taking us from where we used to be years ago to where we are today. But I also expect, at the same time, this remuneration that we'll figure out on how to offset some of the headwinds of legislative. We're at the worse moment right now as we could be. Everything's been levied against us. We haven't had time or the ability to solve all of that in some other forms of fees and charges. So I think that will also help. And then finally, this year, just so you know, the bank in 2010 performed much better than we thought it would, not just on loan losses, and by loan provision, but overall, we exceeded virtually every performance metric that we had expected in an awfully difficult year. As part of that, the incentive plans for the nearly 20,000 of employees who get paid on an annual basis of the company and their own line of business, those incentives are higher than they've been in the last two years. So there's a meaningful difference in 2010 for incentive compensation for the people who work on the front line for having done a very good job, and much significantly higher than it was in 2009 and even higher than it was in 2008. So if we continue to do well, that will in there, but we'll also have the offsets, like we had this year. If not, then the incentive compensation will come back down, and that will be a muting effect. So we don't mean to be anything less transparent about our expenses than we are on revenue, so I'm glad for the question. But I think Andy said it best, 5% and 6% over the long-term. And you can count us to be in the low-50% efficiency. I promise you it was never a target, but it kind of is now. Because you need to know, we're not headed to 52.5% on our way to 55%. But I also must tell you, we're not headed to 52% back down to 48%. We're probably going to be right around that 50% to low 50s. It seems to be the right place for us to have enough to invest and keep investing in new revenue so we can start being received by you guys as a revenue company with expense controls as opposed to expense company with flat revenue.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "We've seen a couple of acquisitions out there priced probably a little bit higher than what many people would have expected. And I guess just how you think about acquisition opportunities within the traditional bank space going forward, opportunities for your company and what pricing might look like and some of markets you're interested in.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, so opportunity is a good word. Because I've said it before, we won't let an opportunity be missed. If there is a good deal out there at the right price, we will be part of that. And if we get it, we'll be satisfied, and you won't be writing about how we overpaid. That's a fact. On the other hand, if we don't get a deal because we needed to overpay to get it, then I hope you'll appreciate that discipline, because we don't anything as an acquisition to make this company stronger and better because we're on our way to that just doing what we're doing. So having said that, we'll look for opportunities and all spaces, including traditional bank spaces. I think there will be some. We will be in those. We'll be looking at them. We'll price them to be exactly right for ourselves, but we will not get greedy and try to price them if we think we're in a pricing war just to win one, because that would be a mistake that this management team is not going to make. And I'd rather you were disappointed we didn't win something than to be disappointed than we won it at the wrong price. But we won't hesitate to look. It's just not a core strategy. M&A doesn't change our future. It just has to be a deal that makes it stronger than it was without it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Your cash went up almost $10 billion followed mainly driven I guess because your deposits were up so strong. Is there a point that you're growing your deposits too fast to put it to work effectively?", "Andrew Cecere", "You've highlighted a good point, Paul. What happened there was, towards the last few days of December, we closed on our Corporate Trust acquisition and in conjunction with that, we had about $8 billion of deposits come in the house immediately. And what that will do for us is allow us to continue to build out the left-hand side of the balance sheet in terms of both our securities portfolio and our loans, but it's purely timing. So it was a phenomenon of the year end and will be rectified in the first quarter.", "Richard Davis", "It's a broader question, Paul. We're not at a point yet where we think that we are so deposit-rich that we cannot afford to go after and grow our loan book. I mean it's quite the opposite. I welcome all of the loan growth we can. I'm expecting it not only because we're doing well, but as to my first question to Betsy, I think when the economy turns and those lines of credit start to get used, we'll be really glad we're core deposit-funded. And we just don't see a scenario where we have a circumstance where we're worried about the balance sheet getting out of balance because deposits are too fast or too strong. That will be, I think, -- the bank with the strongest core deposits going into the recovery will be the strongest bank, period.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "I guess I put everything you said together for both you and the industry. I mean, is it fair to say pre-provision earnings growth is going to be difficult, maybe impossible in 2011 just given all of the confluence of regulatory reform and higher expenses and asset yields resetting down, and to the extent there's earnings growth that's going to be credit-driven and then 2012 is the year where hopefully we get the handoff back from credit driven to pre-provision driven?", "Richard Davis", "Brian, no. That's an absolutely no. That's not what I meant at all. It might be more of an industry byline. But for us, PPI, pre-provision is going to grow, it has been growing. We're going to expect probably significantly less credit reserve recapture than you guys do. If it happens, it will happen because amass there, not because we're going to try to curry favor with higher numbers. It will just happen because our credit quality just keeps getting better. But PPI, God, we expect that to grow quite a bit this year. Our balance sheet will grow. Our margins may shrink but as Andy said, it's not a function of losing money. So we'll still have the loan growth, the good spreads growing deposit growth of core levels is a great core funding. Our fees are going to be quite strong because we're a lot more than just a retail bank. We've got a lot of payments and a lot of corporate trust, and wholesale new businesses and wholesale bank that are generating fees. So I'm quite involved in it. We are going to -- I want you to think about this as one of the most close to normal operating companies separate to finality of the last of credit quality getting better, of any bank you follow and I think PPI for us will be the way that will determine whether or not we're the real deal. And it has to be this year. It can't be 2012.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "And just to be clear, pre-pre grows even when you factor in Durbin in the back half of the year?", "Richard Davis", "It does.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "And then a follow-up. You've talked a little bit about the Brazil and India payments JVs in the past. I guess, for those of us who don't know those markets well, should we think about it as something that supports the overall growth rate of the payments business? Or are those big enough opportunities that this could be a level of change in the total revenues and earnings for the payments business over the next couple of years?", "Richard Davis", "It's the former, because they'll both be slow to start. So the JV in Brazil, as I think we told you, when we did it, won't really start to point money for -- until the second year and beyond. And so that, and it's going to get to a level even in a few years that will be significant to the payments group, but not huge to the bank. It will just be another contributor to our global payments. India, as we have said before, we've got this lock-down commitment to be the partner with the bank, State Bank of India, eventually to be the bank that works with them on the processing side of all merchant acquiring. But India will move slowly, but this will be very, very long and coming. That's probably a 2012 start, with a few years [indiscernible] benefit. So both of those are indications that we intend to continue to expand globally, but neither of those will grow near as much as just the core European, Central America, Mexico and domestic payments that we have today. It would just be nice to have them, but they're not going to affect or move numbers for a couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I wanted to follow up on the loan growth and loan commitments. So first, what was the wholesale line utilization in the third quarter? You said it was 26% this quarter.", "Andrew Cecere", "It's 26.5% in the third quarter, 26.1% this quarter, Mike.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And that would be calculated off the base of the $82 billion of wholesale loans?", "Andrew Cecere", "Closer to $66 billion.", "Richard Davis", "Both revolving loans. A number of guys was in quarter four of last year. Well, 28.8%. So Mike, that's 2.5% on almost $70 billion.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then, what's the dollar amount of the loan commitments in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?", "P. Parker", "For the revolving, it went up about $2 billion. It went up from about $65 billion to $67.5 billion.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And that would be the loan commitments?", "Richard Davis", "Those are revolving commitments. Commitments that are used for revolving purposes.", "Richard Davis", "So just under 4%, Mike, linked quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So what I'm trying to reconcile as you had the 1.5% linked-quarter wholesale loan growth and then...", "Richard Davis", "Total loan growth. They're funded loans. They're term loans.", "Andrew Cecere", "And it includes retail.", "Richard Davis", "So it's just a slice of it. The wholesale-only lines of credit only. Not credit card, not consumer, none of that.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So that's up? And the loan utilization is down?", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So why is that? Are you giving commitments to new borrowers? Or what's going on there?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, both. So the best way to think about it is we've got on the corporate side on all of these investments we're making, we are now in a lot of deals we weren't in before. So you're a Fortune 100 company, you want to renew your line, you want three or four banks in the credit. We weren't in it at all two years ago. We're now one of those banks. And those particularly strong companies just have a line of credit for the availability, they typically don't draw on it. They you get the middle market, and we've increased the number of middle-market lenders substantially. We've gone now national more than we did before, where we have availability to customers who have need outside of our footprint. And we're getting those lines of credit, but not necessarily usage. And then finally, if you look at our Community Bank, which is also present in here, we continue to be very strong in those thousand branches where we have community customers who are actually more likely to use their lines than most. But also invited some because the small community banks they've been relying on have been now as some form of a stress, and in fact, have not been lending or they have been reducing their line capabilities. So we're inviting those deals too. So we're kind of a barbell, where we've been invited into the large deals and into the very small deals that we were neither part of in the past. So if it works, then the line of credit is a proxy for eventually an outstanding use of the credit. But we agree that having it outstanding has held use of small value, but it's better than the other direction.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I don't want to put words in your mouth. I just wanted if can validate what I think I hear you saying. So loan demand is not improving based on the utilization of existing loans, but you're expanding your footprint to some Fortune 100 companies and outside of your traditional footprint? Is that fair?", "Richard Davis", "So loan demand is probably at the national level not growing. But by the fact that we've got more commitments and growth for the lines and our loans at our present year, means we are growing in this shrinking environment. So I think we must be thinking market share, that's kind of my hypothesis theory. But I don't think it would be right to say that loan demand has gone up. But the willingness for customers to want to engage in an open line of credit, and because they're more qualified than they were and because they want to be abundantly cautious, that's a fact.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then, to what degree are you seeing a substitution to the Capital Markets? You're seeing bond issuance going gangbusters when you don't have this loan demand going up at the bank level.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I mean, clearly, that's part of it. We open our Capital Markets. We get to participate in those underwritings now, but that's for the investment grade companies, obviously, a great substitute for bank loans. And I'll comment one thing on the demand. I mean with the pickup in M&A activity that we've seen a little bit more in the latter half of the year, that generates loan demand that's generally funded. So not under a revolver. So there is a little bit of a loan demand that's coming through on the wholesale side on the funded side for M&A activity. Might be part bank, but bank debt, part bonds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Gamaitoni with Compass Point.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "Do you guys have any interest in expanding into other types of fee businesses or adding on to current fee businesses? Just looking at M&A in that area, and if there's any concentrations maybe moving forward.", "Richard Davis", "So nothing new. But I'd like to be deeper in everything we're in. So what you see is what we like. Our last effort by partnering with Nuveen was probably a reflection of the fact we want to keep the bank fairly simple. We don't have an investment bank and we don't now have the asset management at that level. We're not an insurance distributor or an insurance creator. And we don't get into businesses that we don't understand well. But we get better in the ones we're in. So, Chris, I would say that you'll see more and more acquisition opportunity that's non-traditional in corporate trust and in the payments business. And when I say payments, I don't mean just card business. I mean mobile banking and some of the more innovative things that you're starting to read about because I think that will indicate an innovative company and one that can bring things to its customers earlier to market. So you'll see that kind of stuff in traditional banks, but nothing new. There's no space right now that we think we have uncovered. There's nothing we're doing now that we don't want to be doing. I don't think we've ever been more exacting to having the composition of earnings in revenue from the different places than we are right now. So if you like what we see, we're in a good position. We just like to be better at all of it.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "And as far as on the credit side, are there any specific regions or MSAs or some MSAs where you're seeing particular weakness on the residential mortgage side or commercial real estate side?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, I mean, it is more regionally or really MSA-based now. And for us, the markets we're in, clearly, the most stressed remain the Southwest. So in and out of Las Vegas, both on the investor and residential side. Some of the markets in California, generally the further you are from the coast, living in the high desert or some of the central Valley markets are still very weak.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "And then on the trust side, we saw a suit from Wells Fargo on EMC mortgage requesting files. That was yesterday. I know you're not, you don't usually trust deals. I was wondering if you received those types of requests. How many are proceeding? And just who bears the legal expense for that type of issue? Is that you or the trust?", "Andrew Cecere", "We do not bear the legal expense. Some of the rulings that you're seeing from the courts, again, we are in those as named only because we are the trustee. As we talked about in the script of the call, we do not hire the lawyers. We do not bear the legal expense. We do not bear the financial risk. We're not responsible for the foreclosure activity. We have a very specific role that we think we fulfill very well. And unfortunately, right now, that is not completely understood. It's complicated, I will give you that. But our role is very limited. And we do not bear the financial risk.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "I wasn't talking about the foreclosure side. I meant more as trustee for private label where an investor instructs the trustee to issue a request for loan files.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. Our role on the private label is very similar to what I just described. So again, we have a very limited specific role that we fulfill. And to the extent there is expense related to that role, it is either borne by the servicer of the trust itself.", "Richard Davis", "It will be built in the contracts in the beginning as our duties and remuneration for handling the requirements of the trust.", "Operator", "I will now turn the conference back over to the presenters for closing remarks.", "Richard Davis", "Well, thank you, everybody. Thanks for staying past the hour. We're always at your beckoned call if you have any further questions. ", "I'd like to just say that, in following up on the last questions, I think we're getting to a pretty normalized predictable pattern here, where you can appreciate the revenue contributors, the expense discipline, the economy that will recover will help all of that. And our improvement in credit quality is now getting closer and closer, and we hope it will be over the long term. So we're not through this cycle yet, but I don't see any reason to think we'll falter at this stage, but to continue a slow methodical report -- peak back to something more normal. And our number one goal really is to get the dividends started again and begin to show the investors that we intend to give them back what they've earned over these years. We're looking forward to having that to talk about the next call. So Judy?", "Judith Murphy", "Thank you, all, for listening to our review of the fourth quarter.

Following the review of the results by Richard Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Finance Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded and available for replay, beginning today at approximately 4:00 PM Eastern, through Tuesday July 24th, at 12 midnight Eastern Time. ", "I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Senior Vice President. Go ahead please. ", "Judith T. Murphy - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you Andrea. Thank you for joining us today. This is Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations at U.S. Bancorp. Richard Davis and Andy Cecere are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2007 results. If you have not received a copy of our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, they are available on our website at www.usbank.com. ", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10-K report on file with the SEC. ", "I will now turn the call over to Richard. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Judy and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I'd like begin the call today by taking a few minutes to review the highlights of our second quarter results. I will then turn call over to Andy Cecere, who will provide you with additional detail about our earnings. After completing our formal remarks, we'll open the line to questions from the audience. ", "This morning, our company reported net income of $1.156 billion for the second quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted common share for the second quarter of $0.65 or $0.01 or 1.5% lower than the earnings per share in the same period of 2006, and $0.02 or 3.2% higher than the first quarter of 2007. ", "As many of you know, growth in the second quarter for our company is seasonally higher. This year was no exception. Our strong loan growth and fee income led to a 2.3% increase in net income on a linked quarter basis. As Andy and I discuss the current quarter's results with you today, we would like you to keep in mind that consistent with last quarter, there were no unusual items, positive or negative, affecting our reported earnings. That being said, let me review some of the highlights for our second quarter. ", "First we achieved the return on average assets of 2.09% and a return on average common equity of 23% in the second quarter. These profitability measurements continue to be among the best in our industry. Our second quarter net interest margin of 3.44% was 24 basis points lower than the net interest margin we reported in the second quarter of last year, and 7 basis points lower than the previous quarter. ", "You may recall that we had assumed the net interest margin would continue to decline another 5 to 10 basis points from the first quarter margin of 3.51%. We continue to believe for a number of reasons that given the current rate environment, yield curve and our balance sheet mix, our real estimate of 5 to 10 basis points drop in the margin from the first quarter level, still holds. Andy will give you a little more insight into the reasons why we are comfortable with this position, in just a few moments. ", "On a year-over-year basis, the net interest margin declined by 24 basis points. I mentioned this variance as well, because tighter credits spreads still had an impact on our margins. During the past month, credit spreads once again appear to have stabilized for both commercial and retail loans, and as you know our company's strategy has been to focus on high quality credits, which by the very nature carries a lower margins and continue to be the most aggressive competition for these types of loans. ", "Once again our fee-based businesses exhibited excellent momentum. Payments and trust-related revenue were particularly strong this quarter. Year-over-year, our payments related fees grew by over 11%, while trust and investment management fees increased by 8.9% over the same period of last year. Our tangible efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2007 was 44.1%, making us one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry. ", "That being said, our non-interest expense in the current quarter was 7.2% higher than the second quarter of last year, and 6.1% higher than the previous quarter. A portion of these increases and expenses is related to planned investments in our fee-based businesses and banking franchise, such as personnel and marketing, business development and associated costs with our PowerBank initiative, the financial institution services initiative, and the expansion of our FAF Advisors' third party distribution, just to name a few of those initiatives. ", "In addition, the other portion of the increase in spending is related to the state business events, such as expense associated with signing of a new merchant contract, and accelerated OREO [Other Real Estate Owned] disposition activities. Andy will give you more detail on the expense variances in a moment. However, note that our disciplined approach to expense control has not changed, and will continue to be a focus and a hallmark for this company. It is, in fact our efficiency that allows us to invest, while still maintaining our industry-leading profitability metrics. ", "At this point, we are comfortable in saying that we expect positive operating leverage as we move forward to the remaining quarters of 2007. One of the balance sheet highlights for the quarter was solid year-over-year growth in average total retail loans at 7.8%, while growth in total commercial loans was 4.7%. Going forward we expect that our company's growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans will be slightly lower than the industry average, as we continue to concentrate on originating principally high quality credit. In fact, commercial real estate loans, which we haven't grown as fast as the industry, are down versus prior quarters, as refinancing have exceeded the growth in new business. ", "Further, the growth itself has been affected by the slowdown in residential home building and the company's decision to reduce condominium construction financing in selected markets. Going forward, we will, however, continue to selectively originate high quality commercial real estate credit with our long-term highly valued customers. ", "Moving on to credit, once again our credit quality metrics were strong. Net charge-offs were 53 basis points of average loans for second quarter 2007, slightly higher than the 50 basis points in the first quarter of this year, and higher than the 36 basis points in the second quarter of last year. These ratios equated to an increase of $66 million in net charge-offs year-over-year and $14 million on a linked quarter basis. The increase over the prior quarter and the second quarter of 2006, was expected and primarily the result of an increase in the retail net charge-offs. The most significant increase was in the credit card loans net charge-offs as growth in outstandings, which grew by almost 24% year-over-year and over 5% from the first and second quarter, and a return to more normalized credit card charge-offs both led to this increase. ", "Specifically, the credit card net charge-off ratio was 3.56% this quarter, double over the historical ratios for this loan category. Going forward, we would expect that both commercial and retail net charge-offs will increase modestly, as we move to this credit cycle. However, given our risk/reward profile, we expect our credit quality to remain favorable when compared to our peers. ", "Non-performing assets decreased to $565 million at June 30, from $582 million at March 31, 2007. And we are now just slightly above the $550 million balance, at June 30th of last year. Looking forward into remaining quarters of 2007, we would expect any increases in non-performing assets to be modest. ", "As many of you know, we've been very prudent in our approach to sub-prime lending. Our exposure to sub-prime residential loans in addition to the related wholesale businesses, is minimal and very manageable, and little has changed from the end of the first quarter of 2007. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.2 billion of residential real estates loans outstanding to customers that could be considered sub-prime, compared to $3.0 billion at March 31. In addition, we had $900 million of home equity and second mortgages to sub-prime borrowers at June 30th, and that balance is unchanged from last quarter. ", "These two portfolios represent 2.8% of our total loans outstanding as of mid-year. In terms of buybacks, we repurchased approximately 80 million shares of stock in the second quarter of 2007. This, combined with our quarterly dividend, is also going to be 113% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter. ", "At this point, I'd like to share a few highlights from our business line. Our Payment Services group reported an impressive 16.8% increase in average loan outstandings year-over-year; the result of growth in both our Corporate and Retail Card portfolios. U.S. Bank was one of the four issuers selected to participate in the Federal Government GSA SmartPay 2 card program. ", "We have been a payment provider to the Federal Government since inception of the Purchasing Card Program in 1986. This win allows us to continue to offer the full array of corporate payment products to current government agency customers, and provides a tremendous opportunity to expand our share of government's business beginning in 2008. The group completed the conversion of the CIBC Canadian purchasing and corporate card portfolio and the first phase of the First Horizon Merchant process and conversions. Other major milestones for this group included the issuance of the 18 millionth consumer gift card, since the program began in 2003 and the launch of the first hospital-on-payment finance solution, whereby we issue cards on behalf of the hospital, self-manage the billing and receivables processing. ", "Our Wealth Management group successfully completed to list our Corporate Trust conversion during the quarter, and the group gathered an additional $282 million in client assets through our recently launched SMA [Separately Managed Account] product. This represents an increase of more than 60% over the balance at the end of the first quarter, and our pipeline remains strong. ", "The U.S. Bancorp investments and insurance initiated a new requirement... retirement planning concept in the first quarter. This post retirement planning center, just opened in one of our Minneapolis branches. The center together with USBII's financial planning process is designed to attract baby boomers that need financial help in managing and planning for retirement. ", "And finally, in Wealth Management, our FAF Advisors continue to grow their third party retail and institutional distribution of our First American Funds. At the end of the second quarter, the third party fund balances were over $5 billion, approximately 20% more than at the end of June last year. ", "Our Consumer Banking business line successfully completed the integration of the Heritage Bank in Montana, and excluding our new branch acquisitions, the group opened five new in-store branches and added 59,000 net new checking accounts. These new accounts along with those opened in the quarter one of this year, represent an annualized growth rate of 4.6% from the January 1st start point of 6 million checking accounts. ", "During the quarter, we launched the PowerBank business model in our Portland market, on April 30th. With extended hours in most branches, the program now makes us the most convenient bank in that market. We have seen positive improvement in net new small business, DDA growth, client satisfaction of course, deposit and consumer loan growth versus last year, along with much lower staff turnover. As many of you know, the St. Louis PowerBank initiative was launched on April 1st of last year, and since that time, we've seen improvement in employee morale, turnover and client satisfaction, all leading indicators of success. We expect to rollout Denver market later this year with PowerBank as well as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati and Seattle in 2008. ", "And finally, U.S. Bank's mortgage benefited from the flight to quality in the mortgage lending business this quarter, with increases of over 17% in both production volume and the servicing portfolio. ", "Finally, within the Wholesale Banking group, we are transitioning our corporate bank from a large regional corporate banking model, to a national corporate banking model. The steps we've taken are many and include to-date, the hiring of a number of talented individuals with major money center experience. We have new leaders for our national corporate banking group, derivatives, business credits to leverage finance. We've established a 24-hour trading desk in Chicago, and have extended our calling program outside of our traditional banking footprint. Our emphasis within this segment is on non-credit products, those fee-based products that will effectively leverage our balance sheet and support our recent investment in payments and processing. ", "At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy to give you more details about our quarter. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Richard. The company's second quarter net income of $1.156 billion was 3.7% lower than the second quarter of 2006, but 2.3% higher than the first quarter of 2007. As Richard mentioned, historically the second quarter of the year has always been the strongest in terms of linked quarter growth for our company, and this year is no exception, as we experienced strong seasonal growth in payments, trust and investment management, deposit service charges and treasury management fee income. ", "I'd like to start the review with the year-over-year results. The $45 million or 3.7% reduction in net income from the second quarter of 2006 was primarily due to lower net interest income and increase in provision for credit losses and higher non-interest expense. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by solid growth in non-interest income, and a reduction in the tax rate. ", "Net interest income was $47 million or 2.8% lower year-over-year. Although average earnings assets increased by $7 billion or 4.0%, net interest income declined, as the 24-basis point drop in the margin more than offset the positive change in earning assets. The margin contraction can be attributed to tighter credit spreads primarily due to the positive loan pricing. And in addition to the tighter spreads on credit, the cost of funding the company has risen over the past year, as rates on interest bearing deposits have gone up, and the mix of liabilities continues to shift towards higher cost deposits and other funding sources. An increase in loan fees partially offset these negative factors. ", "Total non-interest income was higher in the current quarter than in the same quarter of 2006 by $100 million or 5.7%.Year-over-year organic business growth was 7.8%, but this growth rate was muted by a $35 million gain from the initial public offering of the card association in the second quarter of 2006. Overall, the growth in non-interest income was driven by the very favorable trends in payments, trust and investment management and treasury management fee income. In addition, the other income benefited from incremental bank-owned life insurance. ", "Non-interest expense in the second quarter of 2007 was $110 million higher than the same quarter in 2006. We'd classify much of the growth in two categories: First, about half of the increase in expense can be best categorized as investments in our business lines and franchise, including increases associated with fees and acquisitions and the related business integration activities, increase in compensation expense, and a portion of the $18 million increase in legal and professional fees which was related to recent revenue initiatives. ", "Second, the remaining increase in other expense can be best categorized as business event-driven. Specifically included in the change year-over-year in the other expense, was an increase in operating expense-related tax credit investments, additional merchant airline expense due to a new relationship and transaction growth, and other expense include the higher OREO related expense as the company accelerated efforts to dispose the acquired properties. ", "Finally, income taxes in the current quarter were lower than the second quarter of 2006, partially due to the decline of the company's tax rate. The result of an increase in tax credit investments, higher balances of tax-exempt municipal securities and additional bank-owned life insurance. ", "Moving on to the discussion on linked quarter variances: Net income in the second quarter of 2007 was $26 million or 2.3% higher than the first quarter of 2007. A seasonally strong 9.4% increase in fee income and a slightly lower tax rate, were partially offset by 1 % decline in net interest income, as well as increases in non-interest expense and the provision for credit losses. ", "Net interest income declined by $60 million on a linked quarter basis. Although average earning assets rose by $1.2 billion quarter-over-quarter, the favorable impact on this group... growth on net interest income was more than offset by a 7-basis point decrease in net interest margin. The decline in the margin can be attributed to tighter credit spreads, the continued migration of lower cost deposits into higher price deposits, and funding charges accompanied with the reduction in net refunds, including the impact from the mid first quarter incremental investment in bank-owned life insurance. ", "During our last earnings call, we estimated that the net interest margin would fall between 5 to 10 basis points from the 351 level we reported in the first quarter. As Richard indicated, we are still comfortable with that assumption for several reasons: First, in the later part of the second quarter, credit spreads stabilized. Second the impact of bank-owned life insurance is now fully incorporated in the run rate. And finally, the change in deposit mix from the lower cost accounts to higher price release has moderated in the last few months. ", "As I previously mentioned, non-interest income was seasonally strong on a linked quarter basis, due to 11% increase in payments revenue, a 6%increase in trust and investment management fees, a 12% increase in the deposit service charges and a 13.5% increase in treasury management fees. These are all non-annualized increases. While trust in investment management and treasury management fees benefited from second quarter tax season activity, while payments and deposits service charges were higher due to seasonally strong transaction volumes. The other income category was higher than the previous quarter having benefited from the purchase of incremental bank-owned life insurance in that quarter. ", "In addition commercial product revenue and investment product fees and commissions also posted good linked quarter growth. Offsetting a portion of the solid growth in non-interest income on a linked quarter basis, was $95 million or 6.1% increase in non-interest expense. Again, a portion of the increase could be defined as investment spending while the other increases are best described as business event-driven. Contributing to the unfavorable variance, were personnel-related expenses which increased by $40 million, principally due to an increase in compensation associated with the annual merit increase season, commissions and the impact of first quarter stock option grants. Slightly offsetting these increases, was the seasonally favorable variance and benefits, unfavorable variances in legal and professional, marketing and business development, and a number of other expense line items, reflecting the timing of business initiatives and the advertising programs. ", "Finally, the other expense category was higher by $43 million. The unfavorable variance primarily reflected the merchant airline expense associated with the new relationship, other loan expense related to accelerate... accelerated efforts to dispose of OREO property, and additional operating expense related to tax credit investments and integration expense associated with our recent acquisitions including Heritage Banks, the corporate trust business of LaSalle and several merchant processing acquisitions. ", "At this point, I would note that operating leverage was negative on a linked quarter basis as well. And as Richard previously mentioned, we would expect to see operating leverage turn positive over the next quarters. As the expense grows modestly from the current levels, net interest income stabilizes and fee income continues to grow. Finally, the current quarter's results benefit from a slightly lower tax rate. Going forward, we expect a tax rate on a TEB [taxable-equivalent basis] basis will be comparable for the current quarter, at approximately 30.9%. ", "Turning to the balance sheet; average earning assets rose by $7.4 billion or 4% over the second quarter of 2006. It was primarily the result of a 4.5% increase in total loans. The increase in average loans was driven by a 7.8% increase in retail loans led by credit card, a 4.7% increase in commercial loans, and a 4.6% increase in residential mortgages. ", "Commercial real estate loans declined year-over-year reflecting customary financings, the current slowdown in residential home building including certain markets for condominium development and the company's overall risk appetite. On a linked quarter basis, average earning assets grew by $1.2 billion, driven by an increase in total loans of slightly less than 1% and an increase in loans held for sale of 12.8%. ", "Again average earnings credit cards loans grew faster than the other home categories on a linked quarter basis, as our own branch originated, co-branded and financial institution partner portfolios continued to expand. Total average deposits in the second quarter of 2007 were $2.3 billion or 1.9% more than the second quarter of 2006. The decrease in total average deposits was principally due to the company's wholesale funding decisions, where by tight deposits greater than $100,000 were replaced with other short-term borrowings. ", "Increases in average interest checking and time certificates year-over-year were essentially offset by decreases in the average non-interest bearing deposits. A direct result of reductions of business demand deposits as customers reduced excess liquidity, money market savings, and savings accounts. ", "Deposit balances in lower rate money market and regular savings accounts continue to migrate to higher rate time certificates or deposits in the consumer business lines. Total average deposits in the second quarter were $1.8 billion or 1.5% lower than the prior quarter. Similar to the year-over-year variance, the change was primarily driven by the $1.7 billion increase in time deposits greater than $100,000, as management chose to replace these deposits with other short-terms funding. Increases in average non-interest bearing deposits and interest checking account balances were offset by reductions in money markets savings deposits. ", "Finally, as Richard mentioned earlier, we returned a 113% of earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in the second quarter of 2007. We remained well capitalized in our target with tier 1 in total capital ratios of 8.5% and 13% respectively, at June 30th. ", "I'd like to now turn the call back to Richard for his closing remarks. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Andy. I'm sure many of you in the audience today have had the chance to read our other press release this morning, announcing that Mike Doyle has resigned from his position as Chief Credit Officer for our company. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Mike for his many years of service to U.S. Bank. As Chief Credit Officer, a position he has held since 2002, Mike was the driving force behind the establishment, in implementation of our current credit policies, procedures, and our credit culture. He's leaving the company in excellent condition from a credit perspective, and we wish him well. ", "I'd be happy to answer your questions about this change in personnel, but I want to be very clear: Mike's departure in no way indicates concerns about our credit quality, nor does it indicate a change in our credit philosophy. We will continue to manage credit prudently with the goal of balancing risks and rewards. ", "In conclusion, as a company, we are focused on the future and continue to look for growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisitions similar to those in our recent past, which includes small banks and payment and processing businesses. ", "Our long-term goals did not change. Our constituents are counting on us to meet the challenges presented by this environment, but not to take risks that might place us in harms way in the future. We've not been immune to the challenges but our year-to-date results, which can rightly be defined as pure core earnings, support my belief that this company is well positioned to produce a consistent, predictable and repeatable earning stream going forward, for the benefit of our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. ", "At this time, Andy and I would now be happy to answer any questions from our audience, leaving a plenty of time for Q&A. So operator, if you would join us again please. ", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operators Instructions]. We will go ahead and take our first question from the line of Mike Mayo of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. ", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "Good Afternoon. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Mike. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Mike. ", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "Richard, could you elaborate more on the change in the Wholesale Banking. You mentioned going from a regional to a national model, and that you have made hires and expanding in all these business lines. What was the catalyst for this change? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mike. I am glad to do that. As you know, being the sixth largest commercial bank by asset size, it should at least in many cases put us in the camp up, more deals while we're either leading national company syndications or being part of these syndicated credits. If you look at the goal sheets which come out once a week, you will notice that most the time we are absent in those transactions. That's partly because, we have a heritage to become a major regional bank in the wholesale side, but really not enjoy the national corporate view that we've expanded now in our payment businesses, and then our trust businesses. So this is kind of the wholesale lending side catching up with the rest of the company and taking advantage of our size and our scale and many of the customers we currently enjoy. ", "As you probably know, there is a quite of strong quid pro quo coming forward in these days, that in order to gain the non-lending business from corporations across the country, you need to have a meaningful attachment to their credit line or their credit needs, and we need to step that up. So in accordance with that, we have opened our first out-of-footprint office in New York City. We've hired no less than almost ten key people to lead our national corporate activities, our derivatives business, our business credit activities, healthcare, leverage finance, food and ag, assets [ph] expansion, anything else I can't remember on the top of my head. In other words, we're moving to a national footprint and we have many of the customers already; 5% of the Fortune 500 customers we have some relationship with. But in order to really leverage this payment and processing capability, we need to step-up and take more position with a very high AAA rated customers across the country and this is intended to do that. ", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "So better share wallet of your corporate customer. So I guess that means... would you ever consider spinning off the processing business, or is it the opposite? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's just the opposite, although it's a good transition Mike. Not at all like a Metavante or based on the activities since we last talked on this call with FTC. We all... feel all the more emboldened to keep these businesses aligned. It's the growth part of our company. It's the non-balance sheet aspect that makes it much more attractive in returning capital. Its all the things that you know it to be, and in accordance with that, I've said this last time, we are a core bank that's going to expand in the payment and processing businesses, which have I think a nice attribute to add to the bank. We are not a payment and processing company that is going to have a bank hinged on to it. So it's quite... as you said emboldened to us to keep the company together and move forward with this nicely diversified and attractive revenue mix. ", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "And one last follow-up. I mean, how about more capital markets than I mean... in a way may be I wish you had paperback, or -- ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good question. Not really, we... by the way we are fairly relative, we are in the same building. When we didn't have the capital market capability, those of us from first start, we also had a certain level of envy wishing that we did, and once we enjoyed finally having that, we realized it might have been overrated in terms of our customers. They either wanted to have access to what would be the perfect partner, and/or they would ask us to find that partner for them. But in no cases did we feel that we benefited while we had, or lost necessarily when we didn't, the direct relationship with an investment bank. So having been there and done that, we really feel quite good about our position, and while it might be attractive in quarters like the most recent ones, and probably this one where those money market revenues will look very attractive, we'd like the simpler, more direct company that you all have come to track, and that we are enjoying our leading. ", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.", "Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor of UBS. Go ahead, please. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Can you just clarify the expense guidance a bit? I think you have said a modest increase in 3Q and 4Q, off the 2Q base? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we did. Let me take a moment on that whole topic. I don't like negative operating leverage, but I am not apologizing for it to the extent that, for us to make some investments in our core organic businesses, we simply needed to do that. And in accordance to that this is the quarter where that cost reflects itself. We are trying to dissuade anyone from thinking that, I or Andy have lost control, or that we were going to go crazy on expenses, or give up what has become one of the hallmarks of this company. So, what we want you to know, is that the next two quarters we see positive operating leverage, and a very flattish expense base from the base that we have created here in second quarter. ", "So that is more a telegraphing and the point is that we will continue to make investments, but we have made probably a one-step launch forward in this quarter to create this negative environment for one quarter in order to create a new baseline to operate the company at. We still see our efficiency to be well, better than anyone anywhere near our peer group, and it will continue to be one of the areas you will cite us for being the most efficient and the most profitable. So, really trying to temper what'd otherwise be perhaps a runaway reaction from one quarter's activity, all of which was intended and delivered. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. And then somewhat related question; as you through the markets and implement power banking, can you give us a sense of how much upfront expenses there are either in dollars or percentages and then... obviously there is a lag before you get the revenue boost, and that's still to come and give us a sense of how meaningful that might be over the next couple of years? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Andy wants to that. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Matt, thank you. We've modeled each of our locations, geographies that we are going to implement power banking and the incremental investment on fund does vary by market, depending upon the number of branches, the sort of level of staffing in those branches today. But they range anywhere from $5 million to $15 million per market overall. So it's not usually material. The payback does occur within the first couple of years. The payback is a function of both, increased loan volume in small business activity and deposit growth. And as Richard mentioned, our St. Louis leading indicators giving customer retention, employee retention, customer satisfaction scores are all positive leading indicators that we are seeing, and that's why we are very comfortable and continuing to roll this out. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay, and then just lastly if I may? In April you've talked about targeting higher earnings in '07 versus '06, and if I think about what's coming and better or worse, that the margins were in line with expectations, credits holding in there well, the expenses were the outlier, is it fair to say that you front-ended somewhat of the expense initiatives that you initially kind of earlier this year? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Richard. I would say that we are delivering as we've thought we were this year, but because the margin compression continued and we admitted we didn't see that at the beginning of the year, we continued to pursue our expense initiatives even despite the fact that margin came down at this level, because we do see that flattening out now and just hoping the investments made now will be handsomely rewarded in the future year or two. So now, we're kind of stuck to the plans and did make an adjustment, where we might well have been able to believe that it was more prudent to continue to make these investments at the timing, and the real order that we expected them to be made in the first place. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. Alright thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Matt. ", "Operator", ": Thank you. Our next question comes from side of Gary Townsend of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Go ahead, please. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Gary. ", "Gary Townsend - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Good afternoon. How you're you both? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi. Good, Gary. ", "Gary Townsend - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "You've developed some great non-interest businesses. How do you unlock that value and find it reflected more in the multiple, given the whole company? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great question. I have long given up on expecting the analyst community to discreetly give us PE value for the payment business of processing vis-\u00e0-vis the bank. Because I think, what you're going to do is, give us the value when you see it burdened in the kind of results we'll provide, which should be better than some of our peers who don't have those options. I respond with two specific responses: one is, on the initiatives that you don't see... that we don't talk about too often, we are working toward 2008 to a new plan. It's actually a color to our deepening customer relationships, but it's a very, very complete and complex movement toward having all employees receive direct absolute credit for selling all products in the bank, regardless of which line of business they are in, or whose line of business they are selling their product for. That sounds fairly simple but those of you who know banking really well, appreciate it. That is usually one of the reasons that banks sub-optimize their ability to cross-sell and offer more to their customers, because there's some of the file that was created. ", "So this year we are changing culturally and it's not just a program, it's a cultural change to move forward on that basis. I might marry that up with the fact that we are changing our incentive plans for 2008, whereby thousands of our top employees for this year and year's before had been paid primarily at a discretionally pool, and the pool is funded at year's end, based on the corporate performance and then it is cascaded throughout the company in the early part of the new year for incentive allocation. In concert with this deepening customer relationship and tracking capability of all products, we are changing to a much more discreet specific incentive program for each person in the company, outside the management committee, who'll remain fully vested in their overall cooperate performance. And these folks will now be much more as a percentage relying on their own business line performance, plus the corporate performance and have a much more discreet way during the year to track to their behaviors, their performance and their rewards. ", "So number one, I believe we will unlock the value of these other non-lending capabilities by incentivising our employees, and get them excited about getting our customers in more of these businesses. The second piece to that answer would be that we have a capability of that which many companies don't have, which is a payment expertise. And particularly, we are going to begin to develop more of an R&D capability at U.S. Bank, where as a payment leader, we are going to develop the next new products that our customers need. And mainly we are building a small core I'll call lab technicians, partnered with a number of bank employees who will go to our key customers routinely and say, what's the next new thing you need in payments, not in bank language but in your language? You can take it back to your core people, figure out how to build it if you don't have to buy it and be able to deliver that. As we referred before, 4,600 financial institutes in America use U.S. Bank for some form of payments partnership. So when we build that for our customers, we'll build it for ourselves, and we'll build it as a pass-along to other bank partners, which may most of you will not build it themselves, will not have the capability or the space for the interest in doing so. And we can leverage some of those areas we've been talking about here before, which have been more germane to just U.S. Bank and talk more about how they become leveraged across the bank industry. So those two things, I said a lot. But to me they are huge levers and none of which are necessarily going to be discreetly priced, because its payments per se but because of what we do of it. ", "Gary Townsend - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "You have to grow the bank faster in order to get a better multiple for the company? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The bank meaning the core banks. ", "Gary Townsend - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Yes. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we do and I do because, I believe that if we are really going to be a core bank with these special capabilities to leverage, then the core banks got to be the core. And so I really want to see... one of the things I am looking forwards is a more particular good use of our balance sheet to take on these cooperate and wholesale customer activities, continue to be on the top quality space. But do more audit and become more important of the key customers who are both attractive, are profitable to us and have the interest and ability of taking on these other products that we are going to build. Because the more sophisticated customer are the ones, who will jump on it first. So I do think the core bank needs to grow faster than it has in the past, but that leverage will accrue to the payment businesses as well. ", "Gary Townsend - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Thanks Gary. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of John McDonald from Banc of America Securities. Go ahead please. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi John. ", "John McDonald - Banc of America Securities", "Hi Richard. I was wondering if you could just kind of remind us of your M&A interest and where you would like to grow up the franchise and under what parameters? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thanks for the opportunity to be clear. We are more of the same would be the answer. We would like to continue to fund small banks of size I'll say from $500 million to $2 billion. We would like to particularly find those in the growth markets of western part of our franchise, let's say that we continue to have conversations in those situations. Then we are looking for deals that are not auction, we would like to do private deals like the last two, where we have an exclusive relationship with somebody who wants to be part of our future and appreciates what we will do to protect their franchise. And so, on the small bank area that would continue. ", "In the payment businesses and in the processing businesses, we are continuing to find some continued momentum. A number of payment companies come to our... come into our view. We talk with them, we make some evaluations every once a while we find when that works. Last time we talked as a group, one of the questions was, with private equity is there way that we can continue to compete pre-payment businesses when so much private equity is out there paying different price points? And the fact is yes, particularly because, we are interesting to some of the owners who don't want to just hand over their company and their keys to private equity partner, but they really want to have the growing concern in many cases a job. And they want to work in a company that can add capital and do something with it. So we continue find some decent stable of small payment companies that come into our view, and in the processing and trust servicing side, we haven't seen much activity lately but there hasn't been much too to see. But we believe that short... in a short order that medium sized trust company aspect of these medium banks will come into the forefront, we will be one of the candidates that they can look out to take over the business and providing same kind of service we have for the... I mean that precedes them. So more of the same John, nothing transformational, nothing significant to change the order of magnitude that we are trying to build here, which is a slightly enhanced revenue stream that attracts all of you. ", "John McDonald - Banc of America Securities", "Okay thanks. And a quick one for Andy, was there any meaningful sales of MPS this quarter Andy? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Not meaningful, John. We pretty much the same levels that we've experienced the last few quarters and you know below in a few million dollar range, so nothing unusual from prior quarters. ", "John McDonald - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, thanks. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks John. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Immanuel, I am sorry, Manuel Ramirez of KBW. Go ahead please. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Manny. ", "M. Ramirez - Keefe, Bruyette & Wood", "Hi, good afternoon everyone. Two quick questions on your deposit charge growth, just it looks like it's been decelerating a little bit in the last two to three quarters on a year-over-year basis. But based on your comments on account growth, it seems like there haven't been any real change there. So may be a little bit of back run on what's going on deposit charges. And then the merchant processing business, even in accounting for seasonal factors came in better than I expected this quarter. Was there anything unusual in that number or should we expect that continue from obviously the third quarter? Thanks. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Manny, first on the deposit service charges, we did see accelerated growth here in the second quarter versus the first quarter nearly 12% up. As you recall in the first quarter, we mentioned that it started out in the first two months of the first quarter were a bit lower than we had been experiencing. So we did see some acceleration in that growth. Second, on a year-over-year basis, our deposit growth is up about 3%. Now one factor in that may be that we have a new product called the CAA, Checking Account Advance, which the fees from that accrued to loan fees and are reflected in margin as opposed to deposits service charge and that may reflect a little bit of a shift in the way we are recognizing those fees. But as we talked about last call, we would expect on a go forward basis that the deposits service charge level would growth very much in conjunction with our growth in accounts, which as we talked about is in that 5% to 6% range. ", "With regard to merchant activity, the second quarter is seasonally stronger. There is activity that occurs that is a little bit higher in the first quarter, but that double-digit growth that we've seen is consistent with what we have seen historically and what we would expect in the future. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me just add, this is Richard Manny. To the deposit growth, I would like to see more deposit growth; and while we are accurate in depicting the movement of customers' balances to higher interest rate, our products and their usage of those for earnings credit, I do think that relevant to my earlier comments about the quid pro quo that comes off large corporate customers giving you more in our lending business when you have more expression of interest in their lending needs. I believe that deposit improvements will follow in that regard as well. That is one of the reasons we are introducing this wholesale corporate banking initiative which again we'll have legs to it in short order to show you. ", "On the merchant servicing side, I do think that it... that it would be fair for you to amend your expectations. This is a very attractive business. It grows quite handsomely. We have tens of thousands of customers join every year into the merchant category and because of our service period... I know we all talk about service, but its very bonafide here. We wouldn't add this many net new customers as often as we have in merchant servicing if no, we didn't have the kind of brand and the equity in the marketplace that it does. So we're quite emboldened by that, and with FDC and some of the recent changes and some of those peers we see that as a near-term opportunity because that disruption for them is absolutely opportunity for us to the extent that customers like dealing with a known entity and there is no change on this side of the fence. ", "M. Ramirez - Keefe, Bruyette & Wood", "And just to clarify, the last meaningful acquisition would have closed in the first quarter of 2006, right, on the merchant processing side? That's a pretty good cut at organic growth that we saw this quarter. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "That is correct. That would have been First Horizon and you are correct. ", "M. Ramirez - Keefe, Bruyette & Wood", "Perfect.Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Manny. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Todd. ", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple of quick questions on the card portfolio, obviously growth continues very strong. I was wondering if you could just remind us in terms of the break down in the portfolio there, in terms of your expectations, in terms of a normalized loss rate for that portfolio and then just update us in terms of kind of mix in terms of the channels and where that's coming from? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure Todd, this is Andy. First, from a normalized loss rate, about a year ago our loss rate in the credit card area was about 2.7% charge-offs and as you know this quarter it was 3.56%. As you recall in the fourth quarter of '05 with the change in bankruptcy legislation there was an acceleration of charge-off activity and it slowed greatly in the first few quarters of 2006. We are now getting back to a more normalized rate and given the growth characteristics that we see in this portfolio we're approaching what we would see sort of a normalized level in the mid 3.5% to 4%. So we were lower in the first quarter and second quarter of last year and this quarter I think represents more like what would expect to see in future quarters. Our actual rates will be a little bit higher but because of the growth that we see in the portfolio, the reflected rates would be in the mid 3.5 like you saw in this quarter. ", "In regarding where it's coming from, it is really across three areas. It is through our partners, it is through our branch activity, and it is through the direct sales activity that we see that growth. So we're seeing growth in all categories and I would also highlight that the growth that we're seeing in credit card is principally if not all prime credit cards we don't have sub prime activity it is really solid credit in terms of the growth that we're seeing. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, in fact this is Richard, I'll add to that. There were some analysts that expected our charge-offs to actually come down if not be flat and I am only disappointed because I thought that was prima-facie that as we're only a credit card prime portfolio and we're growing in the 20% range and honest to God that has a lot to do with our agent bank relationships and our partnerships that's high quality re-growth in a very valuable line of business. And so we are hardly a reflection of bankruptcy, post bankruptcy charge-offs coming to something normal, which by the way 3.5% to 4% itself will reflect the prime quality. ", "And secondly just the absolute growth of the portfolio is expected. At least I expect some prime customers to have some delinquency and some charge-offs. And so, for us, I would say that 53 basis points was actually a point of pride, I was holding for this quarter's result and while some folks expected differently or may see it differently, I hope this call helps you all to kind to go back and look at both our sub-prime, minimal impacts. The fact that our commercial quality credit as represented by MTA does not charge-offs as well and our credit cards will continue to grow at a very prime level. I think you should feel, as I do feel quite good about the quality metrics associated with charge-offs and then in the future we have indicated that they will be modestly growing and really is code word for mostly because the market does balance sheet will grow in the areas that have most likely the charge out level. ", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "That's helpful. And just to clarify so, you would evolve they may modestly pick up, you wouldn't expect them to fall outside of this kind of normalize range as you say and then just internally, just in terms of the challenge you are seeing more the growth coming out of the... mostly the Asian end relationships. Did I understand you correctly? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we are seeing it on both sides; I mean that is more than agent is quite attractive. I will give an example; we have the year-to-date... I think enjoyed 23 portfolios for 23 banks that have sold us their credit card portfolio this year. Those never get right value, they never get put out at the press release, but it shows you the kind of run rate we have in doing business which is very traditional by the way, with banks to give us their card portfolios which are quite in many cases cured. And that's has benefited a lot of our peers don't have because they are just not in that space. ", "In terms of organic growth, we are not a direct mail shop Todd and so this is really the opportunity that occurred to a company like ours that has a very strong branch-related growth of credit cards and debit cards to 2500 branches. And the fact is there has been a fair amount of disruption in the prime credit cards space and we have been able to move through that taking advantage of opportunities, including co-brand and some affinity opportunities that come to us because some of the larger partners have either lost track with them or just busy doing their own conversions. So we are optimistic for sure, but you know, I don't know how long we can keep 20% growth in prime credit cards but as long as we can its good today and its good for the future. ", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Great, that's helpful. Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Todd. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Hilder of Bears Stearns. Go ahead please. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of real estate related questions. First, I thought I heard you say that you have either curtailed or discontinued condo lending in certain areas and I wonder where that might be? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dave, this is Richard. We have... we have and not across the board by any means. We have a lot of good customers who do condos with. But primarily the market that have been in scraps, that we have reduced our exposure unless we know the customers particularly well, would be in the Florida, the Nevada and the Southern California markets to name three. Our exposures in condos are top markets, actually our Washington State, Florida, Colorado, New York and Utah, and except for Florida those other four are actually quite strong and so we continue to do a condo of lending in those markets and enjoy good returns, but Florida, Nevada, Southern California are markets that we've either tapered or by good fortune weren't very deeply in any way and continue to stay away from it. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. And you referenced a couple of times a program as I heard it to accelerate your sale of OREO and I was just wondering, it looks like your OREO balance has certainly gone up over the past year. Why are you doing that? Are you in fact sort of concerned that there will be more coming or --? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes Dave. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, are you there, Dave? We lost you. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, David you are back on, thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We didn't want to answer if you weren't there, okay. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, David in fact our ORE levels haven't declined in the last quarter and part of the theory is that we think that the... it's prudent at this time in the cycle to continue to be aggressive on moving those OREO properties off our books. So that you tend is not have a build but to be a very aggressive in terms of selling those properties at prices that we think we are appropriate at this time. So that's what we are doing, we would expect to continue to do that in the third and fourth quarter, again achieving the level of the ORE that we are seeing right now, and as you saw in the second quarter here, that actually came down for the first quarter. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And David, you are right, it is up year-over-year for sure and that's I think reflects in the market. Its generally the philosophy of this company that if you are going to have a stress property better to sell it soon or the later in this environment and we are actually getting quite a decent returns while we do take a hair cut and god knows so many out there is making a market on this of all of us who want to take this off balance sheet, that's included. We feel it's prudent and we think that we can withstand those additional expenses to lighten the load of future ORREOS. But it's not because we are worried about a downstream situation, we really want to keep this steady state so that we don't have anything to speak about in the future. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And the increase in expenses is that simply the cost of the loss on the properties or is it actually adding more people deferred? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "It's a little bit of both, but most of it's the flamer of the cost the differential and the property versus the sales price. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You might explain this two parts to the last--? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, as you know as the loan goes from, when the loan goes into fore- closure in the initial charge is to net charge-offs and is put in the books as an ORE asset and then to the extend there is a further decline in value. We saw it for lower that book value that goes to operating margins and that was part of the increase we saw in other expense this quarter. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Betsy. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Betsy. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. How are you? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Pretty good. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Good. I just wanted to understand the profits of the investments spending. I know you talked about that in the beginning of the call, but it would be helpful to understand how you are determining what you are going to expensively spend on the kind of return timeframe that you have for getting paid back on those investments and how far through the influence of investment spending you are? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, got it. This is Richard. I think we shared last quarter that every Wednesday in order to minimize platforms, just to create a little more innovation at least in discussion around this company about investment opportunity and every Wednesday morning Andy and I have an M&A discussion with anybody who has either a deal to talk about, which traditionally comes from the outside and/or an organic initiative or as I think one of our peers calls it embedded opportunities. Take a look at where we can do more with what we already have for investment. Each time they knew with us Betsy, we have with us the Chief Technology Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer. The reason I say that is because if someone has an idea, we decided has legs but in order to get it evaluated quickly we need to treat it like an outside deal and through a lot of resources into a quick evaluation. That evaluation comes back within a week or two. We evaluate it against a return and an expectationable time and ROI if you will and if they meet those hurdle rates, each of them are bit different, while I will have Andy describe a little further our general benchmarks. Then in fact, it has legs then we make that investment, we burn it into the plan and we put it out there and treat it like an outside deal. ", "As you all you may know from your experience in banking, an outside deal gets everyone's attention, because it has got the headline and it's got everyone excited about it. We try to create the same level of enthusiasm for opportunities in the company like the PowerBank or the distribution of FAF or the opportunity for cross bank initiatives. So we find that to be a formalized process now which... look, it's cracked, it's done and we're getting a lot more of this. In fact, we're turning down a lot more too which helps me to see where that kind of level of willingness I have and we have to make investments for our near term and long-term. Andy, you might have a little bit of --. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "And in fact we are tracking these things. Very specifically, we look at the... both the next year or two in terms of the profitability, the net present value, the internally, the returns and we're looking at all these things and examples of the investments we made, we talked about PowerBank, we look at it market-by-market. We look at the investment required and the returns we expect, which we talked about the people and the offices on the corporate banking side, that's another example. And we have a number of embedded opportunities within our payment script that we continue to invest in again. The returns are typically... the payback is typically within two years, eighteen months across most of these activities, and we try to measure those and we try to track them. We are tracking them very succinctly and very specifically. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And you mentioned that the pace of the idea flow has been ticking up? ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It has. It has Betsy and what I mean by that is we'll have somebody come in from, say, equipment/finance and say we wanted to get into this line of equipment. Not only do I know how to do it, I have maybe a team of people that I know that can do it, it will cost us this much to get into the situation, it will take this long to build the balance sheet up to a recovery point of the investment and let's talk about it. And a year ago, those ideas were never been embedded. Now there's a formal opportunity for us to say yes, no, we like it, maybe not now, maybe later, and we do evaluate things on the cost of capital and the ROIs got to be as good or better than any deal we would bring from the outside, and it's got to be accretive to the company in this 18-month range Andy talked about or good ideas may well not happen just because we can afford them. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And the ROI say everything, or has that... or has the cost of capital been impacted at all by the general rise in rates recently? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, as we think about it Betsy, we are looking at our returns. You know the returns in the projects we are looking for are anywhere between 14% to 20%. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great, thanks. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank, Betsy. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of J. P. Morgan. Go ahead please. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Vivek. ", "Vivek Juneja - J. P. Morgan", "Hi Richard, hi Andy. Just to follow up on the OREO disposition. Was this prime, or sub-prime properties, and what kind of pricing did you get on to the cents on the dollar, and to your comment of what you intend to do more in the third and fourth quarter, is that most the new stuff that flows into OREO or more that's still sitting there and that you intend to? ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "It was a combination of both prime and sub-prime or non-prime, Vivek, and we would expect it to continue to flow from NPAs to OREO, and then out of REO through the disposition process that we see. I would not expect a significant increase in expense in the current levels, but more of the same as you saw in the second quarter. ", "Vivek Juneja - J. P. Morgan", "All right, great. Thanks. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Vivek. ", "Andrew Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Is that our last call, operator? ", "Operator", "Yes it is. I will turn it back over to you. ", "Richard K. Davis - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, this is Richard. As we close, first of all, I'll thank you for your continued interest and support in our company, and let me tell you how excited I am about the future of this company, and yet how much I appreciate the reaction that you need to have to the fact that we are making some investments, and potential investments to move the company forward. I think I would be safe in this audience to say that no company has proven over its legacy that it knows how to do more with the dollar expense than this company by virtue of not only our disciplines, our D&A but our investment capability. ", "What I am saying to you is, there are some well-thought through longer term opportunities that we need to bring back to the street, bring back to you, enable this company to be as capable on the revenue side as it has been for years on the expense side and with a very careful well-placed increase in investment that is not long life and not significant to harm any of the profitability measures we enjoyed today. I believe that's the right decision to make for this company and while I believe you as an investors and analyst will follow over the course of time to have been the right decision and I thank you for that continued follow up. So Judy, your closing one liner? ", "Judith T. Murphy - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you for listening to our review of second quarter 2007 results.

(Operator Instructions). Thiscall will be recorded and is available for replay, beginning today atapproximately 11:30 AM Eastern Time, through Tuesday October 23rd, at 12O'clock midnight Eastern Time.", "I will now turn the conferencecall over to Judy Murphy, Senior Vice President.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you for joining us thismorning. This is Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations at U.S. Bancorp.Today, Richard Davis and Andy Cecere are here with me to review U.S. Bancorp'sthird quarter 2007 results. If you have not received a copy of our earningsrelease and supplemental analyst schedules, they are available on our websiteat www.usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you thatany forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk anduncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-lookingassumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10K report onfile with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over toRichard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you Judy, and good morningto all of you for joining us today. As you know, during the third quarter of2007 issues, events in general terms are all surfaced in the financial markets andhave significant impact on our industry. These issues seemed to accelerate andexpand as the quarter progressed, and at the forefront our concerns surrounded sub-primelending, liquidity and credit quality. Despite having this environment as abackdrop to the third quarter, I\u2019m actually pleased to be here with you todayto review the results of our third quarter.", "As we discussed in earlySeptember at our Industrial Conference, this company is not immune to theseissues and uncertainty in the current market. But given our prudent riskmanagement and credit culture, the impacts on our results have been and we willexpect it to be limited and manageable.", "At this point, I\u2019d like to take afew minutes to give you an overview of our third quarter results. I will thenturn the call over to Andy, who will provide you with additional comments aboutthe earnings.", "As we've completed our briefformal remarks, we will open the line-up for questions from our audience.", "Our company reported a net incomeof $1,176 million for the third quarter of 2007. Earnings per diluted commonshare for the third quarter were $0.67 or $0.01 higher than the earnings pershare in the same period of 2006, and $0.02 higher than the second quarter of2007. We achieved a return on average assets of 2.09% and a return on averagecommon equity of 23.3% in the third quarter. Both of these profitabilitymetrics continue to be among the best in our industry.", "Our third quarter net interestmargin of 3.44% was 12 basis-points lower than the net interest margin wereported in the third quarter of 2006, but equal to the prior quarter of 2007.The result of this stabilization in the margin was a modest increase in netinterest income on both a year-over-year and a linked quarter basis.", "Earlier this year, we'd indicatedthat the net interest margin will continue to decline from the first quartermargin of 3.51% and then stabilize at 3.40%. We continue to believe that giventhe current rate environment yield curve and balance sheet mix, this assumptionstill holds true. Importantly, for our company, a stable margin is a keycomponent to our future and long-term revenue growth assumptions.", "Once again, our fee-basedbusinesses exhibited excellent momentum. Payments and trust related revenuewere particularly strong this quarter. Year-over-year, our Payments Related Feesgrew by over 11%, while Trust and Investment Management Fees increased by 8.5%.In addition, the Treasury Management Fees, Commercial Products Revenue and MortgageBanking revenue all increased over the prior year.", "You may recall that the Treasury Managementand commercial product revenue fees are targeted for improvement through anumber of our revenue growth initiatives, and we expect to see those categoriescontinue to expand.", "Mortgage banking revenue has beenone category that has actually benefited from recent market conditions, what Iwould call a flight to quality. Our mortgage products are first-rate and ourcustomers and business partners know that we will be there to fund the loan atclosing.", "Non-interest expense in thecurrent quarter was 5.9% higher than the third quarter of last year, butslightly lower than the previous quarter. A portion of the increase and expenseyear-over-year was related to investments in our fee-based businesses and ourbanking franchise. Personnel, marketing and business development were associatedwith a number of our growth initiatives, which includes PowerBank, financialinstitution services, and the expansion of our FAF Advisors' third-partydistribution.", "On a linked-quarter basis,non-interest expense was lower as the cost of these investments made their wayinto the run rate. This reduction in expense along with the increase in netrevenue resulted in an expected positive operating leverage for the company ona linked quarter basis.", "Our tangible efficiency ratio ofthird quarter of 2007 was 43.6%, making us one of the most efficient financialinstitutions in the industry. A disciplined approach to expense control willcontinue to be a focus for this company. It is our efficiency that allows us tocontinue to invest, while still maintaining our industry leading profitabilitymetrics.", "Turning to the balance sheet:Total average loans grew by 4.3% year-over-year led by solid growth in averagetotal retail loans of over 8%. Credit card loans, once again drove the retailnumbers with a 26.9% increase in average balances year-over-year. And our branch based co-branded,affinity and financial institution partnerships all contributed to the increaseof this prime-only based portfolio.", "Although not yet fully reflectedin the average balances, the company did see a pick-up in commercial loangrowth, during the latter part of the third quarter. In fact, total loans grew$3.3 billion or over 9% on an annualized basis between June 30th and September30th of this year.", "Going forward however, wecontinue to expect that our company's growth in both commercial and commercialreal estate loans will be slightly lower than the industry average, as wecontinue to concentrate on originating principally higher quality credits andcompete on price for the best customers.", "Once again, our credit qualitymetrics were strong. Net charge-offs were 54 basis points of average loans forthe third quarter 2007, slightly above the 53 basis-points in the second quarterof 2007, and higher than the 38 basis-points of average loans in the thirdquarter of 2006. These ratios represented an $8 million increase in netcharge-offs on a linked quarter basis and a $64 million increaseyear-over-year.", "The increases over both the priorperiods, prior quarter and third quarter of 2006 were expected and were a consequenceof the current stress in the homebuilding and mortgage industry, as well as thenormalization of consumer net charge-offs after the late 2005 bankruptcy reformmeasures.", "The most significant increase inyear-over-year was in credit card loan net charge-offs. The growth inoutstandings, and a slow return to a normalized net charge-off ratio, led tothis increase. The credit card net charge-off ratio of 3.09% this quarter wasseasonally lower and well below our expected long-term run rate for thiscategory. As we have previously communicated, this ratio will continue to climbover time to its pre-bankruptcy reform rate of slightly over 4%, still very lowby industry standards.", "Residential real estate related charge-offs, includingconsumer first and second liens also grew modestly year-over-year on a linkedquarter basis as stress in the housing markets filtered through the portfolios.Going forward, we expect that both commercial and retail net charge-offs willincrease moderately as well as they can through the cycle. Given our risk and rewardprofile,  we expect our credit quality toremain favorable when compared to our peers, and any increase in net charge-offsto be very manageable. As expected non performing assets increased to $641million at September 30, from $565 million at June 30, this 13% increase wasconsistent with the expectations that we discussed at our recent investorconference. Given the current economic environment, we anticipate that our nonperforming assets will edge higher, but that increase will be modest.", "Our capital position remains strong. We repurchasedapproximately 6 million shares of stock in the third quarter of 2007. This combinedwith our quarterly dividend resulted in a 74% return as earnings to ourshareholders in the third quarter, and 117% year-to-date, which were well aboveour goal of 80%. We remained well capitalized at quarter-end with a Tier 1capital ratio of 8.6% and a total capital ratio of 12.8%.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy, who will make a fewmore comments about our quarter.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks Richard. For the first time in eight quarters, netinterest income was higher on both the year-over-year and in linked quarterbasis. The $12 million increase in net interest income over the third quarterof 2006 was the result of a $7.7 billion increase in average earnings assets,which was enough to offset the 12 basis-point drop in the margin. The $35 millionincrease in net interest income on a linked quarter basis, was the net resultof a stable margin and $2.6 billion increase in average earning assets.", "The margin contraction year-over-year could be attributed totighter credit spreads primarily due to competitive loan pricing. Additionally,the cost of funding of the company has risen over the past year as rates oninterest-bearing deposits have gone up and the mix of liabilities continues toshift towards higher cost deposits and other funding sources. An increase inloan fees partially offset these negative factors. We are still comfortablewith the assumption that our net interest margin will be relatively stablethrough the end of the year for a number of reasons. During the past severalmonths credit spreads appear to have stabilized for both commercial and retailloans. As many of you know however, our company strategy has been to focus onhigh quality credits, which by their very nature carry lower margins.", "There continues to be aggressive competition for thesecredits and we are just beginning to see risk price back in the market.Consequently, although we don't see credit spread deteriorating further, wefeel it'll take some time before these spreads have meaningful upside potentialfor the margin.", "In addition, the growth in our own portfolio in recentquarters has come from higher spread products including credit card and otherretail loans. And finally, the Fed actions in September will have a positiveimpact on the margin due to our slightly liability-sensitive position.", "Total non-interest income was higher in the current quarterthan the same quarter of 2006, by $96 million. Year-over-year the growth wassomewhat muted by a $32 million gain from the sale of equity interests in acard association, recognized last year in the third quarter of 2006. Alsoincluded in other income category in the third quarter were two specificvaluation losses totaling $21 million. The first was related to amark-to-market of certain trading account assets, while the second resultedfrom a mark-to-market of loans held by a commercial real estate joint venture.", "Non-interest income in the current quarter was lower thanthe prior quarter. Seasonal variances in trust and investment management andtreasury management fees contributed to the decline on a linked-quarter basis,both of which were affected by strong tax related activity in the priorquarter. The reduction in deposit service charges on a linked-quarter basis wasthe result of one less processing day in the quarter as well as fewertransaction related fees.", "Non-interest expenses in the third quarter of 2007 were $90million higher than the same quarter of 2006. The year-over-year increasescontinue to reflect recent investment in our business lines and franchises. Theremaining increase in expenses was driven by general business growth includingoperating expenses related to tax credit investments and merchant processingexpenses related to new customer and transaction growth. Also we haveORE-related expense.", "Non-interest expenses declined on a linked quarter basis by$12 million. The positive change can be attributed to favorable variancesacross many categories. At our recent Investor Conference I noted that ourmoney market funds may be impacted by exposure to liquidity and credit issuesin the asset-backed commercial paper market. Our third quarter results were notimpacted by this issue. The situation for the money market funds, including ourFirst American Funds, remains fluid. We still believe that the future EPS, infact, had a range from zero to a couple of pennies over the next couple ofquarters.", "Although recent market events had a minimal impact on ourincome statement, the rapid loss of liquidity in the mortgage securitizationmarket led to an increase in our non-performing loans on a linked quarterbasis. We identified this potential increase in September, as two mortgagebanking customers declared bankruptcy earlier in the third quarter. Bothcommercial loans have been placed in non-accrual as of September 30. Althoughthe loans are not performing, they are well collateralized and we do not expectany material losses.", "In addition, the slow-down in the real estate constructionmarket resulted in an increase in non-performing commercial real estate loans,as one large project was placed on a non-accrual status.", "Finally, an update on our exposure to sub-prime lending. Ourexposure to sub-prime residential loans is minimum and very little has changedfrom the end of the second quarter of 2007. As of the end of this quarter wehave $3.2 billion of residential real estate loans and $900 million of homeequity and second mortgage loans outstanding to customers that could beconsidered sub-prime. Those two portfolios represent 2.8% of total loansoutstanding as of September 30th.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Richard for hisclosing remarks.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Andy. I am sure many of you in the audience todayhave had the chance to read our recent press release announcing that BillParker has been promoted to Chief Credit Officer of U.S. Bancorp. Bill has beenwith the company since 1984 and has been very involved in the establishment andimplementation of our current credit policies, procedures and culture. I amvery pleased that Bill has agreed to assume this very important role for ourcompany, a role that is even more important today than it was just a quarter ortwo ago. Bill is joining Andy and I today to answer any specific credit-relatedquestions you may have about our third quarter results or the current creditenvironment as a whole.", "In conclusion, as a company, we will continue to capitalizeon our core financial strengths including our profitability, efficiency,prudent credit culture, capital management and customer service; whileselectively investing in the growth of our businesses and our people, bothorganically and via small strategic acquisitions.", "Our long-term goals have not changed. We believe that we canmeet the challenges presented by this environment and do so without taking therisks that could jeopardize our future.", "We are not immune to thechallenges, and our third quarter and year-to-date results support my beliefthat this company is well-positioned to produce the consistent, predictable andrepeatable earnings stream going forward, for the benefit of our customers,communities, employees, and shareholders. Andy, Bill, and I will now be happyto answer any questions from our audience. Operator we are ready.", "Question-And-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Okay the firstquestion is from Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "Good morning.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Mike.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "Could you just say something simple, it sounds like thereare a couple items that might have either hurt earnings, and I'm not sure thismight have helped earnings. You mentioned in other income $21 million ofvaluation losses, I guess that's probably not likely to repeat and you mentionedsomething else in other incomes that seemed to depress this quarter's results?", "Andy Cecere", "Right Mike, this is Andy. Two items; first of all last yearin the third quarter, we recognized a $32 million gain from a card associationtransaction, and there was a 2006 event in the third quarter of $32 million inother income. This quarter in 2007 we have $21 million mark-to-market relatedto our trading activity, and I would not expect that to be a repeatable event,but it was an unusual event.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "Negative $21 million?", "Andy Cecere", "That is correct.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "You also said the credit card losses are well below typical?", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "And why is that? Is just credit quality expected to staygood for a while or\u2026?", "Richard Davis", "You know Mike, if you look at our long-term history, lastquarter and third quarter, we were 285 and are quarterly and seasonally low forthe year. Quarter three is based on the timing of people's receivables and theyare working themselves up to the fourth quarter spending for the holidayseason, and are always in our portfolio because it's only prime, and it behavesin that manner. So while we'd love the 3.09% we didn't want the market to thinkthis was our new run-rate.  As much as Iwould celebrate that, it's really much more in the [mid-3.50s] right now on acore basis without seasonality and we want to remind the folks that before thebankruptcy reform, we were right around 4% and that's where we expect thisthing to level out over the next future quarters.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "And I guess the question is a stay of the U.S. consumer then. Do you stillfeel good with that 4% range? Is the consumer good in your markets?", "Richard Davis", "We do. We have a high propensity of prime customerco-branded credit card clients. By virtue of saying that these are people whouse their card for not essentials as much as they do some of the morediscretionary purchases continue to perform quite well. I would be the firstperson in the third quarter earnings cycle to say, with a bit of surprise, thatthe consumer holds are very strong and in categories that are more than justrequired spending, they continue to do quite well and seem to be quite robust.We are holding to those forecasts and expecting that there will really be nomajor change in consumer behavior for spending patterns.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "And then last question, I think we have core deposits inlinked quarter down a little bit, I know that's been a focus. Any color?", "Richard Davis", "Say it again, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "Core deposits?", "Richard Davis", "Yeah.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBank", "I mean when we look at it we are down a little bit,excluding jumbos.", "Richard Davis", "That's right.", "Andy Cecere", "Right. A little bit of that is seasonal. Our second quarteris heavy in our government activity and that does cause our deposit categoriesto increase a bit. So part of the decline is seasonal and if you strip thatout, we do continue to see a bit of a shift to the higher earning deposits from a customer standpoint, but notdissimilar from prior quarters.", "Mike Mayo - DeutscheBanc Securities Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John McDonald of Bank of AmericaSecurities.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Hi, good morning, Guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Andy, wondering if you could give a little bit of color onwhat drove your mortgage revenues this quarter, and what kind of outlook youhave for the mortgage business?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure, first of all John, the hedging component, both of ouron-the-book overall, is fairly neutral on a linked quarter basis. What we haveseen is, as Richard mentioned in his comments, a bit of a flight to quality. Sothere has been increased production and activity in our mortgage group,relative to prior quarters. In fact, they are having a very solid year. So, itreally is core production increase seen across the board.", "Richard Davis", "And John, given our size, last I saw we were 23rd ranked inproduction and 14th in servicing. We just really like that space. I mean we arevery good at this. We have a great deal of client relationships that we benefitfrom, both in the broker community and directly to the branches.", "It\u2019s just for us a core operating stream that's been, ifanything, slightly benefited, but as you all know it's not big enough to movethe needle except for the fact that it could be harmful to us if we were tostart to fail in this quality.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "You said the vast majority is agency business If youquantify that, how big?", "Andy Cecere", "The very vast majority of agency we have.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay.", "Andy Cecere", "It's a bit on the jumbo side and some of that is REITportfolio, but the great majority is agency.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay, great. And then a credit question. I don't know if yousaid, Bill is on the line today, If you guys can handle this.", "Bill Parker", "Yeah. I am here.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. Hi. Congratulations, Bill.", "Bill Parker", "Thank you.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "What's your remaining exposure to mortgage companies, andthen also if you could just walk through exposure to homebuilders as well?", "Bill Parker", "Yeah. The mortgage lending unit that we have has $1.4billion of loans outstanding. They're all secured either by warehouse firstmortgages or by mortgage servicing rights. So, we've had the two that Andymentioned that did file. The good news on the other ones is that they seem tobe getting through this liquidity crisis.", "Most of them have returned to issuing only conformingmortgages. On the homebuilding side, we do have a $4 billion of residentialconstruction. $1 billion of that is condominium construction and that is aportfolio that I am sure you are all aware is under stress, but it's regionallybased. Some markets are better than others but\u2026", "Richard Davis", "I'll add to it. And John, you know we've have a lot ofsub-categorical limits for different kinds of lending. And condos would havebeen one of those and our diversity of geography would also prove that we'renot concentrated in any one market, good or bad necessarily.  But I think in the real estate market, you'regoing to see our diversification across all size, types, levels andgeographies. They are going to serve us well during this next phase,  as commercial real estate and the downstreameffects of homebuilders might start to affect other things.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. And then one quick follow-up for Andy. In terms of themargin, what would need to happen in the rate environment to see some benefitsfrom the rate cuts? If you could just comment on that.", "Andrew Cecere", "We did have a bit of a benefit, John. As we talked about itin our investor day, we are slightly liability sensitive. Late in the quarteras rates went down, that helped us a bit. But our outlook continues to be forus this year sort of at a stable margin. We talked about credit spreads. We arepursuing high quality credits and that would be a key factor in terms of themargin improving, but our expectation again is relatively stable.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. Thanks.", "Andrew Cecere", "You bet.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research,LLC.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "Good morning.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "Bill Parker", "Good morning.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "I guess this is a question mostly for Bill. Bill could youjust speak a little bit, about the one large CRE project that went onnon-performing.", "Bill Parker", "Right.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "If you could give us any color on that, I would appreciateit. And also, we are pretty well aware that, Florida is a troubled market, but could youjust speak to sort of the regional trends that you are seeing in terms of CRE,credit quality and whether they are any changes in the last few months?", "Bill Parker", "Sure. As I said, we have $4 billion overall residentialconstructions. $1 billion is for condominiums. The one project is a condominiumproject in a good suburb of Las Vegas.However, unlike many condo projects which have experienced fallenpre-sales,  it is fully guaranteed, andwe're working with the guarantors to re-margin the project. We do anticipateadditional stress in that market in the residential construction. We do haveprojects and these are homebuilding projects, they are not condo projects inthe San Diego, Sacramento area that's a soft market. Nowagain those are guaranteed projects which we work together with ourrelationship lender, and work with our borrowers to re-margin the loans.", "In Florida we have ourcondo exposure in Floridais now about $100 million and the three remaining projects we have there areall on schedule and performing fine.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "Bill, could you just speak to the rest of the South East. Imean are you seeing any\u2026.What's your exposure in sort to the Atlanta market and if you are seeing anyadditional [places]?", "Bill Parker", "Yeah, we don't have -- we have very little in South East.The only place we really have is in the South East is Florida.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "Great.", "Bill Parker", "That's a $100 million. Yep.", "Nancy Bush - NABResearch, LLC", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Nancy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gary Townsend with FBR CapitalMarket.", "Gary Townsend - FBRCapital Market", "Good morning. My questions have been asked and answered.Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Gary.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Matt O'Connor with UBS", "Matt O'Connor - UBS", "Good morning.", "Richard Davis", "Hi Matt.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hi Matt.", "Matt O'Connor - UBS", "The margin was stable despite higher deposit costs, a littlebit of mixed shift over non-interest-bearings and I am just trying toreconcile, it seems like the offset might have been higher yields in retailloans?", "Richard Davis", "Matt that is certainly a factor, as I talked about it anddiscussed in my comments. The growth that we're seeing is in principally thehigher yielding assets, loans, credit cards and installments. That certainlyhelped our liability sensitive position a little bit, and the stabilizationacross the board in credit spreads also helped. So, all those factorscontributed to the stable margin.", "Mat O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. And then separately loan growth picked up like we areseeing in a lot of places. In September your period-end growth was about doublethe average driven by commercial. Is that better spreads that you are gettingso you are more open for lending? Is business coming back to the bank?", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Matt O'Connor - UBS", "Driving down a [household family], what do you think thatwill be?", "Richard Davis", "", "Matt its Richard.  Thespreads are not getting better yet. The hope is that they will, and we arewatching for risk premiums to come back as the yield curve starts to move. Thatdoes help a bit. But by and large, let's just say the banks aren't giving backthe benefit shot to the banks; they are giving it to the customers. So we arestill thinking to be very intensively competitive for the best customers, andbecause we really don't dabble in the markets with structured credits orcustomers who may not be as strong, I am not sure whether or not there is moreflexibility in the pricing downstream, but we simply [aren't] playing in thatcategory.", "So for us the answer is that the spreads are just as tightas they were before. The volume is a good sign. I do think it indicates that particularly the middle market is startingto use their clout a bit and as I think we talked in last two quarterly calls,there is a cycle in banking, and it's a real long one. But in the best of ourworlds, our customers are doing well and they are using the bank's balancesheet to grow their companies. Then they get strong and they start to stopusing loans, they start to build up cash and they are good depositors for useven if they are not using their loans.", "Then they go back to the cycle, they use up their cash andthey start to use our loans again and we are in that inflection point, wherethe cash is coming down, the use of the bank's balance sheet for the benefit oftheir growth is starting to happen. I think that portends quite frankly to goodthings for the economy and that's why banks typically see these things first,and we are seeing it now.", "Matt O'Connor - UBS", "Okay, and I guess that the concern might be that the banksare picking up some of this loan growth, and at the end of a cycle.  What does that mean in terms of creditquality looking out a year or two?", "Richard Davis", "", "Good question. I can't answer that for us. We are simply notdoing anything structurally that we haven't done for the last five years, whichat the peril of some optics where we have been at a slower growth, it\u2019s paid ushandsomely.  At this point of the cycleand we are as a company not going to take any changes at this point. As yousay, we are at the end of the cycle, where the risk could be much greater than the reward, so, we are notdoing that.", "Matt O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Manuel Ramirez with KBW.", "Richard Davis", "We call him Manny.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Will get it at the fourth try.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Good morning guys. On the reserves, just in thinking aboutwhere you are versus the industry, your reserve to loan ratio continued todrift down a little bit, although I would readily admit that you are prettywell reserved at this point. But if I think about the mix shift in loanportfolio from commercial to retail, your retail charge-offs are normalizingand your NPAs are rising albeit at a more modest pace in the industry overall.When should reserves to loans start to fund out and perhaps even start to riseto, unless there are changes in the balance sheet,  what are we are seeing at this point?", "Richard Davis", "Manny, this is Richard and I'll have Bill be more specific.We don't see that point yet in our current view, in terms of looking out a yearand forward, trying to get an inflection point. For a couple of reasons. One iswe do -- our growth in our balance sheet is expected to be high quality. So, weare not looking to change the mix of our portfolio as we grow it in the future.It has performed quite well, and I think the combination of the mix won'tchange measurably. It's a pretty big portfolio, so, it won't change veryquickly. Having said that we have a fair amount of unallocated reserves, whichwe threw up especially once a year, but they are well in the range of no actionrequired and no action even contemplated, because we have, as you said, a verystrong kind of a fortress balance sheet at this point in the cycle.", "So, while I do expect it to continue to be used as it'ssupposed to, I don't see in the near-term [or call it out] in the next year, aconsequential event that would cause us the need to  take any actions on the provision that itwould be greater than the charge-offs at that same point in time. Now Bill, youmight add to that some more details.", "Bill Parker", "Yeah, well Manny, I think you have cited some of the keythings we look at of course, which is our NPA coverage and we compare veryfavorably there to the peers. As Richard said, we look at this every quarter.We have models that we evaluate and we adjust those to what we believe as themoderately increasing loss forecast we have in our retail portfolios, and wewere adequately reserved.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "And one kind of technical follow-up question on yourunfunded construction commitments as well as your unfunded home equitycommitments. Do you hold reserves against those at some particular ratio tounfunded amounts?", "Bill Parker", "Yeah effectively we do, because we look at any kind ofdrawings that would result in a loss during a certain forecast period.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Okay.", "Bill Parker", "So the answer is yes.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "All right. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Manny", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Todd.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Todd.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Good morning everybody. Most of my questions have beenanswered, but Bill just a follow-up in terms of the real-estate, could you justcomment.  You have mentioned before, theone project that came on non-performing this quarter, just the re-marginingprocess with that borrower.", "Bill Parker", "Yes.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Could you just give us a sense, as the industry goes throughthe cycle, of the kind of appetite thereon or the willingness  on the borrowers' part of what the dialogueis like with some of these borrowers as you look to strengthen your [lateral]position?", "Bill Parker", "Sure, I mean this is a pretty typical case, where because weare relationship lenders, this is a developer. This is our third project withhim. The first two went extremely well and the third one would be changingmarket conditions so obviously the sale stalled out. These folks have anincentive to work with us. If they have any liquidity they will put it in. Inthis particular case he has other properties of which we are seeking to take anequity position. Ourfirst lender in other projects backed it and was able to shore up this project.So, in all cases, these folks are willing to continue to work with us, becausethey are long-term developers, they've been through the cycles; they want tomaintain a good relationship with the bank. ", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "That's helpful. And then just secondly, how often or can youtalk a little bit just in terms of kind of the reappraisal process in some ofthese markets. What  are you doing there,in the process?", "Bill Parker", "Yep. And probably the area where that comes up most rightnow is Californiaand there are projects that we have to get reappraised, as often as every sixmonths and get re-margined every six months.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "And I am assuming you've re-graded as appropriate?", "Bill Parker", "Oh yeah. Yeah.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Great, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Todd.", "Operator", "The next question is from Lori Appelbaum with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "My question is\u2026.hi Richard.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "And Andy. My question relates to the loan loss reserve. Myrecollection was as of the last $10,000, the unallocated reserve was about $700million plus, and I was curious what the current unallocated position is?", "Andy Cecere", "It is\u2026", "Richard Davis", "We are calculating it for you.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Oh, thank you.", "Bill Parker", "It's about 600 to 625.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "600 to 625 and some of that has been eaten up by the realestate issues that you have mentioned?", "Andy Cecere", "I left that in the outlook on retail credit mortgages there.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Andy Cecere", "Yeah. And credit cards and the increasing return tonormalization on cards.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then the normalization on cards, I can see thedelinquency deterioration, but the loss rate actually improved?", "Bill Parker", "Right.", "Andy Cecere", "Correct.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "So, what actually is happening within the card portfoliothat seems to be a disconnect between loss trends and delinquencies?", "Andy Cecere", "", "Well, again, as Richard said, third quarter is usually aseasonally good quarter for collections for us. Now we will see the increase indelinquencies that will occur from now through basically second quarter of nextyear.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah. I know it's a bit of anomaly in a one year view, butif you do go back at least two more years you will see third quarter performslike clockwork for us, which is why as much as I want to celebrate the number.I actually didn't want you all, to mistakenly think that was our new run rate,because that would be unsustainable.", "On the other hand, when we talk about long-term we are likea lot of our peers. I actually don't know why the pre-bankruptcy levels haven'treturned yet. We don't see them coming even in the next couple of quarters. So,we are saying that we think we will be at the 4% level, because we know we haveto believe that, but we actually don't have all the evidence that it will bethere at this point in time. We just believe it's going to have to get back tothat point.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And if you can also update us on credit performance inyour sub-prime portfolio, delinquencies and losses?", "Bill Parker", "Sure. On the residential mortgage side, while thedelinquencies are up, obviously in both home equity and residential mortgagesand the sub-prime, the loss rate we had in the third quarter on our firstmortgages was 1.29% and the loss rate on the home equity was 4.09%.", "Richard Davis", "That's sub-prime.", "Bill Parker", "That's all sub-prime rate now.", "Richard Davis", "Which is 2.8% of the total portfolio?", "Bill Parker", "Right. Yeah.", "Richard Davis", "There is some point to note to that our prime home equitylends and loans are stable and that to us is good news. I know there is a newconcern in the marketplace that seconds or the next to have impairment and I dobelieve that sub-prime  will and are. Butbased on the percentages that we don't have in sub-prime we will have to reportthat loans and lines are both performing steady in the prime portfolio and insome cases, I think there is a worry that, lines will perform more poorly thanloans and we're not seeing that in our case right now. But you know we didn'tgrow this portfolio in the double-digits for the last couple of years either.So I would expect our performance to be handsomely better than our peers, giventhat we were both through the loan to value and through the cycle ofunderwriting to our prime portfolio.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "And in the pace of delinquency deterioration that  was more noticeable in the quarter,  I am assuming that the delinquencydeterioration of residential mortgage. Was all of this sub-prime portfolio?", "Richard Davis", "A good chunk of it was prime majority it was.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Okay. We didn't think expect that.  These loss rates that you just mentioned, arethey going to continue to move a bit higher in terms of share?", "Richard Davis", "[In loans also], yeah, but I think they will move a bithigher. That's correct, we agree.", "Lori Appelbaum -Goldman Sachs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And at this time I am showing nofurther questions.", "Richard Davis", "Great. Operator, thank you and everyone thank you forjoining us and thanks for your continued interest. Judi?", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you for listening to our third quarter review.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference call over to Ms. Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, madam.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you for joining us today.  This is Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations at U.S. Bancorp.  Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker, our Chief Credit Officer, are here with me to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2007 results and answer your questions.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10-K report on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy and good afternoon to all of you joining us today.  I\u2019d like to begin today\u2019s call with an overview of our fourth quarter results and a review of some of the highlights.  I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Andy, who will provide you with additional comments about the earnings.  After we\u2019ve completed our brief formal remarks, we\u2019ll open the line to questions from our audience.", "U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $942 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Earnings per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of $0.53 were $0.13 lower than the earnings per share in the same period of 2006, and $0.09 lower than the third quarter of 2007.  ", "As we announced in December, the fourth quarter results included two items that in total reduced the earnings per common diluted share by $0.13.  The first was a pre-tax charge of $215 million or $0.09 per diluted common share representing our proportionate share of certain litigation involving Visa and a number of Visa banks.", "The second item was a pre-tax market valuation loss of $107 million or $0.04 per common diluted share related to the purchase of certain asset-backed commercial paper holdings from certain money market funds managed by a subsidiary, FAF Advisors.  ", "Excluding these two one-time items, our earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 would have approximated $0.66 per diluted common share.  We achieved a return on average assets of 1.63% and a return on average common equity of 18.3% in the fourth quarter.  Excluding the Visa charge and the market valuation loss, our return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been 2.01% and 22.6% respectively.", "Our fourth quarter net interest margin improved from 3.44% in the third to 3.51% in the fourth quarter, a 7 basis point increase.  This improvement in our margin, in addition to good quality growth in average earning assets, resulted in an increase in net interest income on a linked-quarter basis as well as on a year-over-year basis.  ", "As we have said in the past, a stable margin is a key component of our long-term revenue growth assumptions.  Our assumption going forward is that given the current rate environment, yield curve and our balance sheet mix, the margin in 2008 should settle in the mid 340s range comparable to that of 2007.  Andy will discuss our rationale for these expectations in greater detail in a moment.", "Once again our fee-based businesses exhibited excellent momentum.  Payments-related fees were very strong this quarter, recording year-over-year core growth in the high teens.  Trust and investment management fees increased by almost 8%, while treasury management fees, commercial product revenue and mortgage banking revenue also improved over the prior year.  ", "As we discussed at our September investor conference, treasury management and commercial product sales have been specifically targeted for improvement via several revenue growth initiatives.  This quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that these initiatives have begun to gain attraction.", "Although revenue growth in the fourth quarter is seasonally not as robust as in the second or third quarters for our company, payments, trust, and investment management fees along with commercial revenue all posted solid core growth over the prior quarter.  ", "Mortgage banking revenue was lower on a linked basis by quarter by $28 million as an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedging activity was partially offset by higher servicing revenue and production gains.  ", "Our mortgage banking division continues to benefit from the recent market conditions with what we would call a flight to quality.  Our mortgage products and service are first rate and our customers and business partners know that we are committed to originating and servicing high quality credit.", "The growth in total revenue, net interest income and fees was 3.4% year over year.  However, revenue growth, excluding the $107 million money market related asset valuation loss in the current quarter and a previously reported $52 million gain from the sale of the 401(NYSE:K) business posted in the fourth quarter of last year,  would yield more than an 8% year-over-year increase in total revenue.  The growth in total revenue on a linked-quarter basis was approximately 1% annualized.  Excluding the money market-related asset valuation loss, total revenue grew by over 13% on an annualized basis demonstrating the powerful impact that a stable margin, coupled with our strong fee-based business, can have on our overall revenue growth.", "Non-interest expense in the current quarter was $322 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year and $191 million higher than the previous quarter.  Although certain expense categories tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter, the majority of the dollar variance from both time periods was due to the $215 million Visa litigation charge taken in fourth quarter.  A large part of the remaining increase in expense year-over-year and on a linked-quarter basis can be attributed to core growth and continued investment in both our fee-based businesses and our banking franchise.", "Our efficiency ratio as reported for the fourth quarter was 54.7%.  That declines to a more comparable 47.2% when adjusted for the fourth quarter Visa litigation charge and market valuation loss.  We are one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry.  ", "As a company, we will continue to have a disciplined approach to expense control.  It is our efficiency, after all, that allows us to continue to invest and maintain our industry-leading profitability metrics.", "Turning to the balance sheet, total average loans grew by 5.4% year over year, led by solid growth in average total retail loans of 7.5% and commercial loans of 6.4%.  As we indicated last quarter, commercial loan growth began to pick up during the latter half of the third quarter.  Our fourth quarter results reflect that activity as average commercial loans grew by almost $3 billion or 6.4% year over year and over 18% on an annualized linked-quarter basis.  ", "A significant portion of this growth came from the corporate banking and business equipment leasing groups and represented growth in both current and new relationships, again demonstrating that our growth initiatives are beginning to have an impact on our overall results.", "Going forward, we expect that our company\u2019s growth in both commercial and commercial real estate loans will be slightly lower than the industry average as we continue to concentrate on originating principally high quality credits and compete on price for the best customers.  ", "We saw a very favorable change in our deposit trends this quarter.  Average total deposits increased by 3.7% in the fourth quarter over the same quarter of last year and by more than 5% on an unannualized basis over the prior quarter.  This deposit growth is, in part, the result of our company\u2019s continued focus on and execution of our revenue initiatives.", "Our credit quality metrics remained very manageable.  As predicted, net charge-offs and non-performing assets rose moderately this quarter.  Net charge-offs were 59 basis points of average loans for the fourth quarter of 2007, above the 54 basis points in the third quarter of this last year and higher than 47 basis points of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2006.  These ratios represented a $26 million increase in net charge-offs on a linked-quarter basis and a $56 million increase year over year.  ", "The increases over both the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2006 were expected. On the commercial side, stress in the homebuilding and mortgage industry led to an increase in net charge-offs, albeit small, at just $8 million.  The most significant increase year over year on the consumer side was in the credit card loans net charge-offs, as growth in outstandings and a return to normalized net charge-off ratios led to this increase.", "The credit card net charge-off ratio of 3.29% this quarter remains below our expected rate for this loan category as we anticipate this ratio to climb over time to its pre-bankruptcy reform rate of slightly over 4%, which will be still very low by industry standards.", "Residential real estate related charge-offs, including consumer first and second liens, grew modestly over the same period of last year and over the prior quarter.  We anticipated the growth in total net charge-offs to accelerate as we move into 2008 as stress in the commercial mortgage and homebuilding industries continue and the upward trends in delinquencies and the consumer residential real estate-related categories migrate to charge-off status.  The increase in net charge-offs is expected to be manageable and within the expected through the cycle range.  ", "As expected, non-performing assets also increased during the quarter to $690 million at December 31 from $641 million at September 30, a 7.6% increase.  Given the current economic environment, we anticipate that our non-performing assets will continue to move higher but this increase will be very manageable.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy who will make a few more comments about the quarter.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks Richard.  I would like to begin by summarizing the significant items that have impacted the comparison of our fourth quarter results to prior periods.  As Richard discussed, the current quarter included two significant items: first, the $107 million asset valuation loss; and secondly, the $215 million Visa litigation charge.  Earnings per diluted common share without these items would have been $0.66.  ", "The third quarter of 2007 also included a charge of $115 million related to Visa litigation.  This charge represented the company\u2019s proportionate share of the litigation settlement between Visa and American Express.  Third quarter earnings per diluted common share without this charge would have been $0.67.  ", "Finally, the fourth quarter of 2006 benefited from three notable items, including a $52 million gain on the sale of the company\u2019s 401 recordkeeping business; a $22 million charge to prepay certain debt; and a reduction in tax liabilities related to the resolution of certain state and federal tax examination.  ", "After consideration of these items, the fourth quarter 2006 earnings per diluted common share would have been approximately $0.61.  Hopefully this gives a little clearer view of our earnings moving into 2008.", "Net interest income in the fourth quarter was higher on both the year over year and linked-quarter basis.  The $68 million increase in net interest income over the fourth quarter of 2006 was the result of a $10.6 billion increase in average earning assets which was enough to more than offset the 5 basis point drop in the margin.  ", "The $78 million increase in net interest income on a linked-quarter basis was the result of a 7 basis point increase in the margin and a $5.4 billion increase in average earning assets.", "The margin contraction year over year can be attributed to slightly tighter credit spreads, primarily due to competitive loan pricing and a decline in net refunds relative to a year ago.  An increase in loan fees and a relative improvement in wholesale funding rates partially offset these negative factors.", "As Richard mentioned, we are comfortable with the expectations that our net interest margin will settle in the mid 340s in 2008 which would be comparable to the full year margin in 2007.  ", "The fourth quarter margin was slightly higher due to a number of positive events, including a lag in the repricing of a portion of our consumer products in conjunction with the last rate decrease; higher yield-related fees; our ability to garner favorable short-term funding rates during the current market turmoil; and an increase in EFI funds due to the absence of share repurchases in the fourth quarter.", "Going forward, our expectation for a stable net interest margin is based on steady to slightly improving credit spreads, continued growth in higher spread products, including credit card and other retail loans, and normalization of funding and liquidity in the overnight markets and the resumption of our share repurchase program.", "Our capital position remains strong.  In anticipation of the need to purchase certain securities from the rated money market funds managed by FAF Advisors, the company did not buyback shares of stock in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the full year 2007 however, 58 million shares were repurchased.  These repurchases, combined with our quarterly dividend, resulted in 111% return of earnings to shareholders for the full year 2007, well above our 80% goal.  We remain well capitalized at quarter end with a tier one capital ratio of 8.3%, just slightly below our target ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 12.2%.  We anticipate that we will return our target tier one capital ratio by March 31st 2008.", "Richard will cover the highlights of our credit quality statistics for the quarter, but I wanted to update our exposure to sub-prime lending.  Our exposure to sub-prime residential loans is minimal and very little has changed from the end of the third quarter of 2007.  ", "As of the end of this quarter, we had $4.2 billion of residential real estate loans and home equity and second mortgage loans outstanding to customers that could be considered sub-prime.  Those two portfolios represent 2.7% of total loans outstanding as of December 31.  Although the percentage of sub-prime loans is very small, we have taken steps to address concerns related to the repricing of the adjustable rate mortgages and the impact that may have on our current customers.  This program was instituted in the spirit of the model introduced by the federal government, but we feel that it contains additional flexibility.  The result of this program will be an increase in the total of restructured loans reported by the company as we move into 2008.", "My final comment relates to an accounting change that will impact the results in 2008.  Effective January 1, 2008 the company will adopt Financial Accounting Standards 157, Fair Value Measurements and 159, Fair Value Options as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The impact to our financial statements from the adoption of these accounting standards will be an expected reduction in earnings per common diluted share of approximately $0.02 at the time of adoption in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $0.03 for the full year 2008.", "I would now like to turn the call back to Richard for his closing remarks.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Andy. Last September at our investor day meeting I announced the formation of a new division in our company focused on revenue growth.  We are calling this new division the Enterprise Revenue Office, the ERO, and appointed [Mac McCulla], a name familiar to many of you, to lead this effort.  ", "As you might also remember, I discussed the first group of activities the Enterprise Revenue Office will focus on.  A set of 15 initiatives focused on building deeper relationships with our customers.  These 15 initiatives are expected to generate between $500 million and $750 million of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2009.  I am very pleased to report that we will have six or seven of these initiatives up and running in pilot form in the first quarter, including three of the largest opportunities.  ", "In addition, we are finalizing a number of activities that will allow us to become more proactive and disciplined in the pursuit of new sources of revenue; in particular, as it relates to leveraging our broad payments capabilities.  I will continue to keep you updated on the progress we are making as these important activities begin to gain traction.", "December marks my one-year anniversary as CEO of this company.  Although the first year of my tenure proved to be anything but business as usual, for us and the others in the financial services industry, I am very pleased with the strides we have made in positioning of this company for the challenges that lie ahead  ", "As you can see from the quarter\u2019s results, we have managed through this environment well.  Our management team is focused on the future and working on initiatives that will capitalize on current products, services and our geographic reach while working with our new ERO to innovate and deliver new products and services for our current and our future customers.  ", "As a company, we will continue to utilize our core financial strength including our profitability, efficiency, prudent credit culture, capital management, and customer service while selectively investing in growth of our businesses and people, both organically or via small strategic acquisitions to lead our long-term goals without taking risks that could jeopardize our future.

Operator, we\u2019re ready.", " ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Your first question will come from  Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch.", "Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch ", "Good afternoon Richard. Just two quick questions.  It sounded like from Andy\u2019s remarks that you would not be repurchasing stock in the first quarter, but would expect to resume repurchasing stock in the second quarter and beyond, is that the right read?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "Hi Ed, we did not repurchase in the fourth quarter, this is Andy, we did not repurchase in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the FAF transaction.  We will start to repurchase late in the first quarter.  Our first objective is to retain, get back to the 8.5% tier one ratio, but we do expect some, albeit a low level of purchases in the first quarter and back to a normalized level in future quarters.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "It looked like operating costs, even after backing out the Visa litigation charges, were stepped up pretty noticeably.  I guess obviously related to a number of the revenue growth initiatives that you touched upon. Is that sort of core expense level sort of a base level now from which we can think about sustaining or growing from given the fact that you\u2019re moving forward with power banking and a number of other revenue initiatives that you discussed or would you expect a step down a little bit from the fourth quarter level?", "Richard Davis", "", "You know Ed, the answer is I believe that represents the direction I\u2019d like to go in having a higher expense base but offset when the revenues starts to show, so let\u2019s agree that we\u2019re starting to move that number up, we still speak and will have positive operating leverage for the year of 2008, but in the beginning stages of an investment curve that we\u2019re in, I suspect that will probably be a bit of the expenses ahead of some of the revenue and at this point I hesitate to cut back on that to the point that I\u2019ll either delay or lose the benefits that we\u2019re creating now and the momentum.  ", "So from the near term I think you\u2019re seeing us at a new run rate base, but as we deliver the revenue that I\u2019m expecting that will continue to keep the positive operating leverage and the industry leading efficiency ratio that you\u2019ve come to expect and you can have my word that should we not find the revenue coming about we have all kinds of opportunities to reduce the expense flow to make sure that we protect our ratios.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay thank you, that\u2019s very helpful and very good quarter, especially relative to what we\u2019re seeing from peers.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC.", "Also known as Nancy Bush.  Could you just speak to the deposit growth, is this coming in a particular geographic area or product because it\u2019s rather startling to see so much deposit growth in such a short period of time and is there something here that has kicked in and should we expect more going forward?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "Nancy, two things, I would say part of the deposit growth was unique to the fourth quarter, we have some acceleration of broker dealer growth and activity that I would call more temporary in nature, but even peeling that back we are starting to see growth in our core consumer deposit products.  We are adapting a number of new products and a couple of pricing strategies.  Still within our constraints and range but we are seeing some core growth in consumer deposits on the savings and checking side so I think we are starting to see a turn to the curve that we\u2019ve experienced the last couple of years.", "Richard Davis", "", "So Nancy, you\u2019re right, it is a meaningful change in the past and I think it\u2019s one that a lot of people hopefully would do someday.  It\u2019s not at the cost of the increment of our margins but we are taking advantage of some of the margin attributes that allow us to firm up and at the same time start being more competitive in some of these markets.  ", "Power base, to Ed\u2019s earlier question is one of those areas but you will see us take different approaches in our community markets or in the markets that we have low market share which we\u2019re calling a program called Self Banking where we will be more aggressive in markets where the disintermediation risk is so much lower, so if we do our job well you will see a slight increase in the cost of deposits managed against the overall margin remain flat and the growth of core relationships which is something we\u2019ve been long coveting for many years.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC.", "Great and secondly if you could just speak to the profitability of mortgage banking right now, I mean there\u2019s been a great deal of hope that the remaining players would see better quality loans, better profitability, increase market share, if you could just speak to whether that is yet being seen?", "Richard Davis", "", "You know Nancy it is for us, I\u2019m happy to report, didn\u2019t have to change any of our protocols, our products, our broker stream, we were doing exactly the business a year ago that we\u2019re doing today.  We\u2019re seeing a highlight now of the flight to quality that we call that in our notes, it\u2019s a funny way to say it but we do have customers and partners wanting to do business with us because we haven\u2019t changed our products that we haven\u2019t changed our return on the focus of customer service and under the leadership of Danny [Orgoniya], our first mortgage business, you know we\u2019re in the high teens as a national ranked mortgage provider and mortgage servicer, that\u2019s a great place for us to be because it\u2019s a great business.  ", "Our own customers get our own business, we do a lot of business for others, but it is for us a high quality business and actually the margins have improved because of the flight to quality.  That along with the hedging acumen that Andy has to bring to the table to make sure that the business is managed in this difficult time has given us a very robust view of the future of mortgage banking.  It\u2019s one of our growth initiatives based on the size that it has in the company.  Andy, did you want to add to that?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "The only thing I\u2019d add Nancy is in the fourth quarter, given the dramatic change in interest rates day to day and the turbulence that occurred our head results were a little less than the third quarter and that\u2019s some of the decline you\u2019re seeing on the [link] quarter basis but the core underlying servicing and production revenue is very strong.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC.", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor with UBS.", "", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Richard, can you talk a little bit about how you can take advantage of the current downturn?  Obviously you\u2019ve held up a lot better than others from an earnings point of view, your capital is intact, there\u2019s [Overlay: Thank you] set up better, you mentioned some opportunities in the commercial lending side but are you looking at other opportunities in this downturn?", "Richard Davis", "", "I understand where the question said is let me answer in two parts.  The first one, not exactly what you meant but, while a majority of our peers I believe are focused on internal action, not the least of which would be capital preservation, dividend reviews, line of business reductions and perhaps contraction of employees.  We\u2019re not working on any of those things and so issue number one is we have the ability to be focused on continuing to power through on the initiatives that this company has long been focused on which is to be as great an offensive stock as you\u2019ve known us to be for years as a defensive stock.  And we would be doing that anyway but given that our peers might be focusing on other things, that\u2019s the distinct advantage.", "Follow up to that is we have made that, I think, very clear to our 54,000 employees by emboldening them to be all the more advantageous in dealing with the very best customers and prospects we may heretofore not seen and take advantage of our window of opportunity and be very aggressive in the pride that they should feel about the company that they keep.  So we\u2019re getting a lot of the, I\u2019ll call it the 12th man on the team kind of benefit, we\u2019re not shrinking away from that advantage.", "In terms of the real technical and financial advantage, let\u2019s agree that to have a distinct PE advantage to your peers is something to understand and to manage.  In this case we just finished our board meeting here this morning, we\u2019re off-site today in Atlanta where you know Novus is headquartered and during the board meeting we discussed issues about being very prudent with our advantages, keeping our powder dry to make sure we understand what material items in the next quarter or two in this great environment and let me say for anybody who wants to not be confused, we have no desires or need to do any transactional event or transformational event to keep this company moving forward as well as it can.  ", "And yes, we have advantages you must understand them, evaluate them and make sure you don\u2019t leave them unfettered and we will continue to look at those advantages and make sure that we don\u2019t miss the chance where something may come along but we are not seeking it, we are not looking for it, we like who we are, where we\u2019re headed, I love the fact that we\u2019re not under any disruption, but I\u2019m not going to look a blind eye to opportunities if something comes along.  So, it\u2019s not a goal but we\u2019re not going to overlook an opportunity if something comes along but it would certainly have to present itself and it hasn\u2019t yet.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "And Richard just a follow up on that last point, I mean you might be in a position where you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat where there\u2019s a lot of potential sellers just a few potential buyers, are you looking at is, just prioritize just in terms of what\u2019s most important from a financial point of view, strategic new business lines, seems like you might have your pick to those new places or new geographies.", "Richard Davis", "", "Right, I would say to order things number one, number two and number three is financial.  This has just got to make sense for our company in the near term and the long term.  You\u2019re not going to hear us consider deals and wile away the issues of two years of dilution or marginally accretive, that\u2019s not smart.  This company is in a great position and in fact arguably at the sixth largest sized, maybe at the last point, large enough to be able to understand and manage without being too big to be complex.  So, I\u2019m going to be very prudent with the use of our capital and our position and not dilute what got us here.  ", "And then if that financially made sense then strategically it would have to fit, that would be the second gateway because we literally do things that make sense and as I know it today, Matt, we\u2019re still focused on small in-market acquisitions that make sense in the deepening of the markets that we\u2019re in.  Small but meaningful and perhaps strategic payment opportunities anywhere on the globe that makes sense and continue to look at that trust and wealth  management business where there are businesses that I think will come to us in the next quarter or two from some companies downstream that say I really think I don\u2019t want to get in this business anymore, I want someone else to do it for me and you guys have a track record.", "So financial first, strategic second and both are required before we go to any third of fourth considerations.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good afternoon all.  I think first question, Andy could you itemize the things that caused the benefit to the fourth quarter margin again, went kind of fast and I could write them down and then maybe provide how much each of those items benefited the margin?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "Sure, there are three principle reasons for the margin improvement.  Number one is that we did not purchase stock in the fourth quarter so our free funds were actually higher because of that lack of repurchase. ", "Number two is that we did benefit from the downward trend in rates, as you know we are liability sensitive and as we projected in the downturn in rates we benefit and that helped us out in margin.", "And then finally as you also probably know, the last month of the year and principally the last half of the last month there was a lot of turbulence in the financial markets which allowed us to actually benefit quite substantially in terms of our wholesale funding cost day to day.  There is a bit of a flight to quality and we had some days there where on an overnight basis we were borrowing at a low rate.  ", "My expectation is all three of those things will begin to normalize and as we talked about, our expectation for \u201908 is to get back to that mid 340 margin for the full year.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You say those three items provide you seven basis points, ten basis points of margin?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "You know, again, I don\u2019t have each one itemized specifically but a combination of all of those things are sort of the seven basis points.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, if the Fed keeps cutting interest rates as aggressively as some may suggest wouldn\u2019t you still benefit from at least the trend in rates going down further?", "Andrew Cecere", "", "You are correct we are still liability sensitive but I will also say that given that where rates are today on some deposit products, we are going to start to reach a floor on our downward pricing, so that the benefit, while still there, will begin to diminish as rates continue to go down.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay and I can ask one follow up question, on the actual qualities, clearly is going to look better than most are going to report over the next couple days but I guess the one that you could look at is the 90 day past due was up 30% sequentially, is there any concern there that it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come in terms of inflows and NPAs at some point?", "Richard Davis", "", "Chris this is Richard and I want Bill to answer that but yes, that is a concern and yes so is the fact that 30, [80 and] 90 continue to be finding themselves back down to a more normalized level, so if anyone in the next couple weeks tells any of you differently, we have a pretty good view of the next 90 days in banking, we have a very blurry view after that.  I mean you just can\u2019t really possibly predict much beyond your delinquencies and your charge off routines.  ", "Bankruptcies can come in faster from the sides than they used to be and the valuation losses, not dependent on how predictable you are on your loss by customer\u2019s ability to repay, the actual loss for instance this case autos or homes or other things are much more difficult to predict than they used to be because the market has so many moving dynamics, so we are concerned about that, we did plan as you know, we\u2019ve telegraphed that our net charge offs and our non-performers will grow over the course of the year.  We expect that, if it changes the trajectory we will telegraph that to all of you.  At this point it\u2019s definitely as we expected it to be and we\u2019re not immune but we don\u2019t see any reason to pull the trigger or call in for any kind of onetime event in order to account for any surprises that we didn\u2019t see at this point.  That would be the CEOs approach, but let the chief credit officer give you their real facts that might make more sense.", "Bill Parker", "", "Yeah we did see some stickiness in the 90 days over the holiday season that was probably a little more than we normally see, but as Richard said, the good news was on our residential mortgages portfolio, including home equity, we were actually flat to down on our 30 to 89 day delinquencies.  So that was a positive development for us.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks for the candor.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Good afternoon everybody.  A couple questions, just a follow up along those lines, just in terms of the comments that you made before just in terms of expectation for accelerating delinquencies and so forth and higher charge offs, Richard I think you mentioned that the expectation is that it will still remain within through cycle type of a range, could you just kind of frame that out for us in terms of how you\u2019re thinking right now and whether or not the Board and Senior management has kind of thought through the potential in terms of recession scenario and how that may impact those figures?", "Richard Davis", "", "I think I\u2019ll have Bill answer the first question, but Todd let me go with the last one.  You might expect that we\u2019re fairly good students of our own numbers and we have a recession scenario that we\u2019ve built in our profit plan which is particularly watching for these signals, the early indicators and then reacting if need be on the expense side of the equation to respond to that so we protect our original commitments.", "We\u2019re not seeing these events yet that would cause us to trigger our recession scenarios neither at the company level or at an individual line of business level, but you can rest assured we have done our homework, we know exactly what that looks like.  For US Bank we\u2019re a fairly large consumer based company, so should there be a recession or a technical slowdown either way, it effects us on the credit side, it also effects us in the customer demand side and it effects our payment businesses both on the acquired and issuing side.  So yes we and the Board have talked about that and we\u2019re good stewards of what\u2019s possible, but we\u2019re also operating in what we know today which itself fairly decent growth, albeit a bit slowing, it\u2019s manageable for us and based on the mix of businesses there are some counter-intuitive activity that goes on where some areas are actually strengthening at times and others are weakening.", "So on the recessionary preparations, we are prepared for that and have looked at our moving parts.  Regards the rest of it in terms of actual credit performance, let me have Bill add that.", "Bill Parker", "", "Yeah you referred to the through the cycle comments and we defined that before as between 60 and 80 basis points, if you look at our balance sheet we do have a fairly sizable credit card portfolio relative to the size of our balance sheet and as we\u2019ve stated we do expect those losses to move up into the low 4% range and as it does that we will move up in that range of that through the cycle.", "Richard Davis", "", "So Todd, I think we are making clear to you guys we tell you what we know.  We said 60 to 80 over the cycle and in our minds that would be the range in a more traditional time, post this bankruptcy reform and all the other things.  These numbers could move on the high end or slightly above that range that we just said depending on how the performance of credit cards and the real estate businesses perform.  ", "We\u2019re not seeing it go above that yet, we\u2019re definitely seeing in that range at the high end and we\u2019ll telegraph that to you as quickly as we see anything otherwise, but we would not as I said be immune and at this point we did not add to provision, we don\u2019t feel we need to, we\u2019re adequately provided for, we\u2019re going to watch the earnings of the other banks and see that they\u2019re addition to provisions might place us in a relative ranking, on an absolute basis we\u2019re very well provided and we want to make sure on a comparative basis we are as well so we\u2019ll continue to visit that but at this point in time I think you would agree if you looked at our numbers that we\u2019re in a good position and a strong healthy balance sheet right now.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "I appreciate those comments and if I could just add a follow up, just again along the lines on the mortgage side, the reference to the increase in the restructured loans this quarter, could you just provide a little bit more color around that, specifically, you made reference to the sub-prime piece and being a driver of that increase, could you just talk a little bit more about what exactly kind of proportionally the composition there and any other, whether it\u2019s accounting changes or I should say policy changes that may have been made within the residential mortgage portfolio that allows you to become a little bit more proactive in terms of managing these elevated delinquency levels?", "Bill Parker", "", "What we looked at in our sub-prime first residential mortgages and what we looked at was a pool of customers in our sub-prime portfolio that have always made their payments as agreed at a certain level for two to three years and they were facing interest rate resets which would cause a higher payment level and what we did was chose to provide relief to them in the form of allowing them to maintain their current level of payment.  So it\u2019s still a performing mortgage, but accounting treatment would say you have to report it as a restructured loan.", "Richard Davis", "", "Todd, this is Richard, I\u2019m actually quite proud of that action, we\u2019ve contemplated and built the rules before the President\u2019s recommendation and while it may not be five years as was recognized by the President\u2019s commission, it\u2019s an extensively larger set of customers based on a different measure of need and in our case let it be said that US Bank doesn\u2019t want to own a house.  We don\u2019t want to put people out of their houses and we want to do what\u2019s right.  Our profit plan predicted that we would not enjoy those increases for the next couple of years and it\u2019s to that extent of the protection people and protect our assets that makes a lot of sense to us and for our shareholders.", "Bill Parker", "", "Okay and again just any policy changes to speak to in terms of with the mortgage portfolio specifically in terms of how you\u2019re recognizing either the charge off or foreclosure process?", "Richard Davis", "", "No, none.", "Bill Parker", "", "Okay, terrific, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "I know we talked before about competitive pressures and I thought you said it\u2019s easing up some on mortgage. But more generally, are you seeing the competitive conditions getting better, worse or are they the same?", "Richard Davis", "", "I\u2019m seeing them to be the same, may be a little different variation on things but for us, pricing is not quite as aggressive as it\u2019s been, in part because I think it is just the inward focus a lot of companies are looking at. When you are inwardly focused you try to shave off the edges on everything, in this case it might be shaving down some of the pricing comparisons.  ", "So for us, we\u2019ve always been a low-cost provider and a challenger in the market for price for the very top customers. That is a little better than it\u2019s been in times past, in part because I think we are leading with a certain level of certainty that we may not have had on a relative basis before.  ", "On the positive pricing side, the actions -- not the least of which that were taken yesterday -- do assist us in some of the less rationale deposit pricers moving away from the competitive view; and that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t give our customers what they deserve, but it is nice to have less pressure on some of these unrealistic deposit gatherers with the FDI fee insurance that\u2019s been provided to them, it\u2019s very hard to compete.  ", "So I think there is current and will be a slightly beneficial deposit pricing going forward.  Absent that, everyone is out there clawing for the next customer and doing what they can to make sure that they offset some of these pressures with decent revenue growth; so on that side, it is as competitive as it has ever been and I think in our case we just have a slight few advantages that we\u2019re seeing.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "What about your willingness to extend credit?  Have you pulled back even just a tiny bit based on what you are seeing with your credit losses for the industry?", "Richard Davis", "", "I\u2019ll let Bill answer that technically, but the answer is in certain things, yes; but for the most part no, because this is my moment to say to you all we weren\u2019t doing most of this for the last few years and many folks criticized us for not growing our assets more robustly and now that we haven\u2019t changed our formats we are still growing at about the same levels we were, but it appears to be a little more core than maybe it was known to be before.

It has always been a homegrown product that has been led by a guy named Randy Griffith who has led us through all of these difficult times with no remorse and no regret as to the kind of businesses we offered our customers.  ", "Sub-prime for us has always has been first and foremost customers who qualified at a different price point and in this case, they are stressed for sure, but there\u2019s never been a single point of failure for our company nor has it been a major earnings stream.  It\u2019s just been part of the composition of building customer relationships. By the way, as they graduate to prime they have been welcomed into the bank at the prime level and have been part of our long-term growth; you just couldn\u2019t see it over the years.", "Andrew Cecere", " ", "I will just add on the prime portfolio that this branch portfolio which is 90% of the business, the net loss rate on that in the fourth quarter was 21 basis points.", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "", "Finally on the 90-day past due, is that mostly a seasonal impact that you would expect to settle back down here in Q1?", "Andrew Cecere", "It should come back down and there is a seasonality to it, but as I said earlier, there was some stickiness that we did not see in previous holiday season.", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "", "Thanks for taking all the questions.", "Richard Davis", "Brock, to follow-up on that for everyone\u2019s sake, as I said earlier, we do operate under the traditional old fashioned banking knowledge that 90-day delinquencies are a predictor of future charge-offs; 30 day delinquencies are predictors of potential problems.  Bankruptcy is a kind of out of the sight, comes out as a surprise sometimes but you get that information and all of a sudden it is your new bankruptcy. ", "The valuation of both homes and automobiles is probably the one thing that\u2019s most volatile now because our predictability has been proven to be absolutely on point.  We have a really good idea of who is going to go delinquent or who is going to have a charge-off. What we don\u2019t know as well as we used to, by no fault of our own, is the amount of that loss, until which time the valuations are clear and either deals are settled in the marketplace or we get the results after the fact.  ", "So, I think it\u2019s important.  We are one of the first banks to report that as you look at this course of the credit, most banks are quite good at understanding risk of charge-off or risk of default and loss for commercial and consumers; but the ability to size the absolute loss is probably more difficult than it\u2019s been.  ", "So, we are not hedging, we are not trying to act like we don\u2019t know, and we are also not sitting on something we know that\u2019s bad either because we simply can\u2019t see much beyond 90 days probably most certainly within 45 and after that we just watch the signals and we will adjust to it as we learn.  ", "For me, as the head of a company that\u2019s got its basis on risk management and understanding customer relationships, it is not only what happens but it\u2019s how we treat our customers for the period, it\u2019s how we manage with them to try to help them get through this time that will forever build relationship that will go generations forward. If  we\u2019re there to help them when the times are tough and that is our number one objective -- not at the cost of the shareholder, but at the benefit of the shareholder -- and that\u2019s the art of the science here.", "Operator", " ", "We have no further questions at this time.  Are there any closing remarks?", "Richard Davis", "There are, thank you operator.  Thank you, Tina.  I just want to thank you all once again for following this company and showing an interest if you\u2019re an investor, thank you for that.  ", "I\u2019ve always closed my presentations -- and I won\u2019t hesitate today -- to close with a commitment that this company focuses on being among the very best banks in the country in every measure; to be consistent, predictable, and repeatable.  I can\u2019t think of a time that that will mean more than it does in this very volatile time.  ", "We are not the savants, we are not mind readers, we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we know our company very well.  We know everything going on inside of it and we are quite pleased to present to you these results for Q4 and for 2007,  despite my chagrin that the shareholder did not gain a return last year from U.S. Bancorp, over the long course of time they have and it\u2019s our hope that over the long course of the future they will again as well.  ", "So, we look forward to continuing to communicate with you, especially during the quarter as we progress through this challenging time. If there is  any news to tell you we\u2019ll be the first to tell you.  Thanks operator.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time through Tuesday, April 22 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Time.", "I will now turn the conference over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "", "Thank you, [Christie], and good morning to everyone on the call today. ", "Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2008 results and answer your questions.", "If you have not received a copy of our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, they are available on our website at USBank.com. ", "", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10K report on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "", "Thank you, Judy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning.", "I'd like to begin today's call with an overview of our first quarter results and then turn the call to Andy, who will provide you with additional comments about our earnings. After we've completed our formal remarks, we will open up the line to questions from our audience.", "The company's first quarter results reflected the disciplined approach we've taken over the past number of years toward managing credit and operating risk while prudently investing for growth. Our company recorded net income of $1.09 billion for the first quarter of 2008. Reported earnings per diluted common share are $0.62, or $0.01 lower than the earnings per share in the same period of 2007 but $0.09 higher than the prior quarter.", "The first quarter results included several significant items that combined reduce earnings per common diluted share by $0.02. Briefly, they included a $492 million gain related to the Visa IPO, a $253\u00a0million impairment of certain structured investment securities, a $62 million reduction in trading account income related to the adoption of the new accounting standard, a $192 million incremental provision for credit losses, a $25 million contribution to the U.S. Bancorp Foundation, and a $22 million accrual for litigation matters. Andy will provide more detail on these items in a few minutes.", "We achieved a return on average assets of 1.85% and a return on average common equity of 21.3% for the first quarter. Excluding the net unfavorable impact of the significant items I briefly mentioned, our return on average assets and our return on average common equity would have been 1.92% and 22.1% respectively. ", "Our first quarter net interest margin of 3.55% was higher than the 3.51% net interest margin we recorded in both the first and fourth quarters of 2007. This 4 basis point improvement in our margin, in addition to the strong growth in average earning assets, resulted in an increase in net interest income of 9.8% year-over-year and 3.8% unannualized on a linked-quarter basis. ", "As we have said in the past, a stable margin is one of the key components to our long-term revenue growth assumptions. At 3.55%, the margin is slightly higher than we'd anticipated at the start of the year, primarily due to the decline in the fed funds rate, growing and higher spread earning assets, and our ability to capitalize on lower short-term funding costs.", "Our fee-based businesses continue to show excellent growth year-over-year, with payments-related categories, Treasury management fees, commercial products revenue and mortgage banking all increasing by more than 11%. Trust and investment management fees grew but at a lower rate of 4% as positive growth in transactions and new customers were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the equity market valuations. ", "Linked-quarter revenue growth for the first quarter of the year is historically the slowest for our company. This year was no exception, as the majority of our fee categories were lower this quarter than last. The Treasury management and mortgage banking revenue lines were exceptions, as both posted strong linked-quarter increases. ", "Mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter benefited from strong growth in origination and servicing income in addition to favorable changes in accounting, the MSR valuation and economic hedging activity. Bottom line, our mortgage banking division continues to benefit from the current market conditions, enjoying a flight to quality in both the production and servicing aspects of that business.", "The growth in total revenue - net interest income plus fees - was 14.3% year-over-year. More importantly, revenue growth, excluding the net impact of the Visa gain, asset valuation loss and accounting changes was more than 8% year-over-year. This is significantly higher than our company has experienced in the past few years, demonstrating the powerful impact that a stable margin, coupled with our strong fee-based businesses, can have on overall revenue growth. ", "Non-interest expense in the current quarter was $224 million higher than the first quarter of last year but $172\u00a0million lower than the previous quarter. ", "A large portion of the increase in expense year-over-year can be attributed to core growth and our continued investment in both fee-based businesses and our banking franchise. In addition, this quarter's contribution to the Foundation, litigation expense, investments in tax-advantaged projects and credit-related costs for other real estate owned and collection activities accounted for most of the remaining variance. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, total non-interest expense was lower. Although certain expense categories tend to be seasonally lower in the first quarter of each year, the majority of the positive dollar variance from the previous quarter was due to the $215 million Visa litigation charge taken in the fourth quarter, partially offset by the current quarter's two special items - the Foundation contribution and the litigation expense. In addition, compensation and benefits were higher this quarter, reflecting annual merit increases and incentive accruals.", "Our efficiency ratio as reported for the first quarter of 2008 was 43.5%. Excluding the significant items I detailed earlier, the ratio was more comparable to past quarters, at 47.1%. Importantly, excluding the significant items, we achieved positive operating leverage on a linked-quarter basis. ", "We are one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry, and as a company, we will continue with our disciplined approach to expense control while making prudent investments in our products, services, employees and franchise.", "Turning to the balance sheet, total average loans grew by 7.3% year-over-year, led by solid growth in average total commercial loans of 10%, retail loans of 7.4%, and residential mortgages of 6.5%. On a linked-quarter basis, total average loans increased by $3.8 billion, or 10% on an annualized basis. This increase was led by a $2.1 billion increase in total average commercial loans, representing the extension of credit to both current and to new customers. ", "We are finding that our company is benefiting from the uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets as customers seek stability in their financial services provider. We have the capital to lend, and we're in the position to provide the high quality banking products and services our customers seek. ", "That said, be assured that we will continue to concentrate on originating principally high quality credits. We can and will compete on price for the best customers. ", "We saw very favorable deposit trends this quarter. Average total deposits increased by 8.4% in the first quarter over the same quarter of last year and more than 4% unannualized over the prior quarter. This deposit growth is in part seasonal, driven by higher broker-dealer, government and institutional trust balances and the company's ability to attract low-cost wholesale funding in a somewhat volatile market. In addition, the growth in deposits reflected our continued focus on our revenue initiatives, particularly in the corporate banking business line. ", "Finally moving on to credit, our first quarter credit results remained manageable. As predicted, net charge-offs and non-performing assets were higher this quarter and somewhat higher than we expected 90 days ago. Net charge-offs were 76 basis points of average loans for the first quarter of 2008, above the 59 basis points and 50 basis points of average loans in the fourth and first quarters of 2007 respectively. The increase over both the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2007 was the result of continued stress in the residential home and mortgage-related industries as well as the growth of our consumer loan portfolio. ", "Within the consumer loan portfolio, credit card loan net charge-offs accounted for the majority of the linked-quarter and year-over-year increase. The credit card net charge-off ratio of 3.93% this quarter, however, still remains below our expected rate for this loan category. We now anticipate this ratio will climb above its pre-bankruptcy reform rate of 4% plus. Given the high quality of this prime portfolio, we still expect that our net charge-off ratio will be lower than industry standards but higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. ", "Residential real estate-related charge-offs, including consumer first and second liens, also increased at a faster rate last quarter following the recent trend in the industry. We expect the growth in total net charge-offs to continue through the balance of the year due to general economic conditions, continued stress in the homebuilding and related industries, and the upward trends in delinquencies in the consumer and residential real estate-related categories. ", "The increase in net charge-offs is expected to be manageable and within our through the cycle range of 60 to 80\u00a0basis points on average and may approach 100 basis points at the high end during this economic slowdown. This represents a slight revision upward from our prior forecast of 90 days ago.", "Also as expected, non-performing assets increased during the quarter to $845 million at March 31 from $690\u00a0million at December 31, a 22.5% increase. We anticipate that our non-performing assets will continue to increase as a result of the current economic conditions and portfolio trends. The first quarter results included an incremental provision for credit losses of $192 million. With this addition to the reserve for loan losses, the company's coverage ratios remain adequate. ", "The allowance to period-end loans at March 31 was 1.54% while the allowance to non-performing loans was 358%. ", "Before I turn the call over to Andy, I'd like to say a few words about our recently announced agreement to purchase Mellon 1st Business Bank in Los Angeles, California. This acquisition will more than double U.S. Banc's deposit market share as well as significantly expand our middle market customer base in the Los Angeles area. Mellon 1st Business Bank is an excellent example of the type of acquisitions we are searching for, acquisitions that fill in and expand our presence in faster-growing markets within our 24state footprint, particularly when the price is right and the risks are manageable.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy, who will make a few more comments about this quarter. ", "Andy Cecere", "", "Thanks, Richard.", "I'd like to begin by summarizing the significant items that have impacted the comparison of our first quarter results to prior periods.", "Other fee income in the first quarter included a $492 million gain related to the Visa initial public offering. The other fee income line was also impacted by the adoption of FAS 157 fair value measurements, which decreased trading revenue by $62 million. Recall that we discussed the impact of the adoption of this standard in our January earnings call. ", "For comparison purposes, the other fee income line in the first quarter of 2007 included $107\u00a0million mark to market on approximately $3 billion of assets purchased from certain FAF Advisor money market funds. During the current quarter, an additional impairment charge of $253 million was recognized on these structured investment securities as they are now part of the company's investment portfolio. The impairment charge was booked as a securities loss. As most of you are aware, spreads widened during the first quarter. As a result, about two-thirds of the write-down on these structured investments was related to changes in market-related credit spreads, while the remaining third was due to potential credit loss and fee payment changes. ", "Non-interest expense also included two significant items:  first, marketing and business development expense included a $25\u00a0million contribution to the company's charitable foundation, while other expense was higher due to the $22\u00a0million litigation accrual. For comparison purposes, recall that the fourth quarter of 2007 also included a significant expense item, a $215\u00a0million Visa litigation charge.", "Finally, the adoption of FAS 157 resulted in an increase of $19 million in the compensation expense line. This was offset, however, by a similar increase in the mortgage banking revenue line as the standard eliminates the deferral of compensation expense related to the closing of mortgage loans held for sale.", "As Richard discussed, the provision for credit losses recorded this quarter was $192\u00a0million in excess of net charge-offs. The incremental provision was made in recognition of the current economic conditions, stress in the residential real estate industry, and the growth of our consumer loan portfolio. ", "Earnings per diluted common share for the current quarter without these significant items would have been approximately $0.64. For comparison purposes, fourth quarter 2007 earnings per diluted share without the impairment charge in the structured investment securities and the Visa litigation charge would have been approximately $0.66.", "As Richard discussed, net interest income in the first quarter was higher on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis due to strong earning asset growth and an expanding margin. The margin expansion year-over-year and on a linked-quarter basis can be attributed to growth in higher spread assets and the benefit from being liability sensitive in a declining rate environment. Our company has also benefited from the ability to secure favorable short-term funding rates given the volatility in market conditions.", "Going forward, given the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect a stable interest margin based on steady to slightly improving credit spreads, continued growth in higher-spread products, including credit cards and other retail loans, and a normalization of funding and liquidity in the overnight markets. ", "Our capital position remains strong. As you may recall, we indicated in January that we would not buy back stock in the first quarter of 2008 in order to ensure that our tier one capital ratio returned to our target level of 8.5% from the 8.3% we posted at December 31. Our tier one and total capital ratios were 8.6% and 12.6% respectively at March\u00a031, both slightly exceeding our own target levels.", "As Richard mentioned, we announced an agreement to purchase Mellon 1st Business Bank in March with an anticipated close by the end of the second quarter. Because of this acquisition, we expect to delay the buyback program during the second quarter in order to maintain our tier one capital ratio near target at June\u00a030.", "Richard covered the highlights of our credit quality statistics for the quarter, but I want to update you on our exposure to subprime lending. Our exposure to subprime residential loans remains minimal, and very little has changed from the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "As of the end of the quarter, we had $4\u00a0billion of residential real estate loans and home equity and second mortgage loans outstanding to customers that could be considered subprime. These two portfolios represented 2.6% of total loans outstanding as of March 31. Given the current credit environment, we have published additional schedules this quarter as part of our earnings release package with more details on the credit performance of this portfolio.", "In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results. The company posted a solid loan growth on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis, a 9.8% increase in net interest income year-over-year, and a higher net interest margin, excluding significant items, total revenue growth of over 8% year-over-year and positive operating leverage on a linked-quarter basis. We had manageable increases in net charge-offs and non-performing assets, and finally, we ended the quarter as we began - with a strong capital base and liquidity position.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy.", "Our Board of Directors and management team are here today with me in Portland, Oregon to host our 2008 annual meeting, where I'll be very proud to share our full year 2007 and first quarter 2008 results.", "As our shareholders leave the meeting today, I want them to recognize that this management team and our 54,000 employees are focused on the future, not on repairing problems from the past. We're focused on business growth initiatives and on our customers, not on downsizing businesses or eliminating positions. In other words, U.S.\u00a0Bank is open for business. ", "As we successfully close the books on the first quarter of 2008, I'm confident that our company will continue to perform and prosper despite the challenges we face in the current economic environment. This company will continue to invest in new and existing products and services, in our communities and in our employees, while focusing on our responsibility to produce consistent, predictable and repeatable results for our shareholders. ", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Jon.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Jon.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Richard used the term \"incremental provision\" in terms of the large increase sequentially, and you guided to some modestly higher losses in the future. And I guess the question is:  How much of that is truly incremental, and do you think that the provision will fall back to that $200 million-type quarterly run rate?", "Bill Parker ", "", "This is Bill Parker. The incremental provision Richard referred to was, you know, to increase the allowance, so that was the $192\u00a0million. The core run rates [inaudible] for the quarter were 293, but we do anticipate those levels of losses to continue to increase during the balance of the year.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. ", "Richard Davis", "So, Jon, we - you know, this company is going to be adequately protected over the long course, so you can count on the fact that - I said this last time, and I'll say it again - we can see pretty clearly 30\u00a0days out, we can see marginally 90\u00a0days out, and after that we really can't see what's going to happen in credit any further than that because there's just too much volatility and there's a lot of seasonality as well.", "So we felt very good about being able to add that $192\u00a0million to bulk up our provision to be as strong, in fact, even stronger than before, and we will watch each quarter to see that we are adequately reserved. And should we need to add to reserves, we will. But at this point in time, we don't see that.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Just two other quick questions.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "In light of the Mellon 1st Business Bank acquisition - it's obviously a hot topic - but can you talk about what does and what does not make sense in terms of M&A for your company?", "Richard Davis", "Sure. In M&A, I'll start by saying we will always take a look at anything that comes in front of us to be opportunistic and to make sure we don't pass on opportunities that might otherwise not at first glance look attractive. But we will do due diligence at a very thorough level, and in many cases find that it doesn't pass our test, which in our minds, it needs to be accretive, it needs to be focused on revenue growth not on expense benefits, and it needs to be relevant to our long-term future growth, where we're trying to build a wonderfully balanced diversification of revenue based on a core in-footprint banking business, a national wholesale business, and an international payments business. ", "So you'll find us looking at payment companies, trust companies and traditional banks. But I'm not looking for that transformation deal unless it were so advantaged that it would be crazy to pass and we haven't seen anything like that in this period of time, so it's kind of the old-fashioned, small, sensible, accretive and revenue focused. ", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just early thoughts on the Northwest-Delta merger and what kind of impact that might have on your payments business.", "Richard Davis", "Sure. It's too early to know exactly except to say that we're the merchant acquirer for both of those companies, which is positive. I think that the merger makes sense and is good for the new company, the largest airline, I guess, in the world. ", "We are the merchant issuer - or, I'm sorry, the card issuer for Northwest through our WorldPerks, and we have a very good relationship with them. We also have a great relationship with the current head of Delta Airlines, who used to be the head of Northwest, and we've been the bank for Northwest, I think, for as many years as people can remember. ", "So I'm expecting that our relationship and the great partnership we've had with that organization will carry us forward into the next stage, and we're looking forward, frankly, to having more business from the largest bank in the world - or largest airline in the world.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Farr of Deutsche Bank.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Chris.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, Chris.", "Chris Farr - Deutsche Bank", "", "Good morning. I'm just wondering if you can give me a sense of the economic outlook for the potential 100\u00a0basis points increase in charge-offs - like unemployment, GDP growth - and what geographies are you seeing the greatest stress?", "Bill Parker ", "This is Bill Parker again. Clearly, the geographies with the greatest stress are the Southwest, specifically California markets, Arizona, Nevada, and then also Florida. And then for really different reasons, the upper Midwest of Michigan and Ohio, with the [inaudible] industry. ", "So those areas, I mean, you've seen the softening in employment over the last few months, and if that, you know, if that continues, I mean, that's the kind of thing that will drive our losses towards that peak loss rate that Richard mentioned.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, Chris, this is Richard. I'll add to that. I want to make it clear - we're not at a 100\u00a0basis point increase nor at that level. But I think last time when we spoke to this group we said that at the high end of the cycle we'd be in the mid-90s and, if nothing else, I want you all to be very comfortable that the three of us will tell you what we think and what we know, and we're thinking that that's probably a little low now. At the high end of the cycle, we could approach 100 basis points.", "It will be - as we got there, right now, if you'll look at our current situation - it will be just as the 76\u00a0basis points today is spread pretty much across all categories - commercial, commercial real estate, residential, credit cards and other retail. We don't see any particular area suffering any more of a consequence to go from 76\u00a0to something higher; we simply more of the same.", "And I think you know that in every one of those categories, we are primarily prime, and to the extent that that has been the outcome that's occurred with this current economic downturn, I think it would be prudent for us to expect that it will get worse across the entire categories. ", "But we don't see anything necessarily beyond 30 or 90 days to say that it's Armageddon. It just says that it's continuing to get worse, and the stresses appear in all categories.", "Chris Farr - Deutsche Bank", "", "Sure. And then beyond homebuilding and commercial, I mean, what other areas or pockets are you focusing on right now in terms of weakness?", "Bill Parker ", "As Richard said, I mean, it's really across the board. I mean, we're a significant auto lender. We've seen higher delinquencies in our auto portfolio. It's still manageable, but the loss per vehicle when we do have to repossess a car is higher than it was 90\u00a0days ago.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, Chris, anything related to the homebuilding starts to show stress at this point in time. So, you know, I don't know, let's say it's a small business that manufactures faucets, they're stressed now, or companies that manufacture door bells; they're stressed. ", "And so most of the domestic providers of mortgage-related business are going to find stress in this cycle, and some of them show up as commercial loans, some of them show up as small business loans. It's actually quite predictable when you think about it. It's just a matter of how long this downturn might take people and how long they can hold on through these difficult times. We are seeing that stress, and we're managing it. ", "Chris Farr - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research, LLC.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "", "Good morning, guys. Richard, we're hearing from others who have capital and are steady in this market that they're seeing, you know, tremendous potential for earning asset growth and taking share, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just comment to this whole phenomenon? I mean, are you seeing clients coming to you? Are you seeing new clients? Are you moving market share? You know, what's going on?", "Richard Davis", "We are, Nancy, and in fact this might be the time, I think, when there's permanent shifts in market share. ", "It's, I think, quite logical. It's surprising to me how pervasive it is, but we are seeing customers coming to the company - we call it a flight to quality - customers that are coming with a bigger position, customers who we perhaps had before and now want to come back.", "It works both ways, too. People want to get their lending relationship with you because they're confident that you're not going to change your level of interest in supporting them. They want to give you their deposit because they want to be comfortable that the company's going to be able to support those deposits, especially above FDIC levels.", "So it is across the board, it is complete, and it is from every single category. And so what I need to make sure is that this company remains prudent and that we neither get greedy at a time just because we can have more business. If it doesn't fit our model of prime-related and high-end customer, I assure you we're going to pass on it. Just because we could do more doesn't mean we should, and in fact the more good prime stuff that comes to us, frankly, we can price for it now because risk has been added back into the equation and because it's a buyer's market for us as regards to customers.", "So it's quite positive for us, and I believe it will give us a long-lasting benefit over the course of the next couple quarters.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Is this being seen - I mean, this phenomenon - being seen throughout the franchise or are there regions where you would say that you're claiming greater share than others?", "Richard Davis", "I'd say it's everywhere, but I would say in terms of line of business it's probably showing up in corporate and middle market banking the most. Consumer not as much; I don't think those customers are as keened in on what's happening. But I will say on the corporate and middle market side, those are customers - CFOs, treasurers, controllers\u00a0 they understand the difference, and they are coming to us at higher levels.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor of UBS.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "", "Good morning.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "I thought it was an interesting comment about the small business that makes the doorbells and the faucets and things like that, the spillover impact, and I'm just wondering, of your $46 billion of C&I, you know, how much would be kind of quasi-tied to housing, if you had to estimate?", "Bill Parker ", "Yeah, we actually track it. We have about $5 billion in commitments. So that $40 billion of C&I really grosses up to, you know, $100\u00a0or so billion of commitment. So about $5\u00a0billion in commitments is in one way, shape or form suppliers to the homebuilding industry.", "Richard Davis", "So 5% to 10%, Matt, would be really kind of what we're looking at. And I'd say that it's [inaudible] because you don't - it can keep going and going, and if you work really hard, everything has something to do with a house, if you try too hard.", "But Bill's right, we've been tracking housing-related now for over a year. As we can see - you know, loans and downturns are pretty much like annuities; you can see them coming. They're like a slow flood. But you can predict. You just can't exactly see where it's going to end.", "And so in our case, we don't have a material concentration across any of our portfolios, either on geography or product or customer type, but we do have our fair share of related businesses in this area which we're watching closely. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. And any sense on how that 5% to 10% compares for the overall industry?", "Andy Cecere", "That would be consistent with - if you looked at, you know, industry distributions of the economy, that would be consistent.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. And then just, Richard, a question here. You know, we're seeing a lot of banks - some could argue are the weaker players - getting capital without needing to restructure in a meaningful way, and I guess some could argue that it's healthy that they're getting capital or some could argue it's not healthy because they're not taking out capacity. I'm just wondering kind of big picture what your thoughts are on that. And, you know, is it a little frustrating that you're sitting here with capital and a multiple and maybe not having, you know, the unbelievable distress opportunities that we might have thought we would have at this point in the cycle?", "Richard Davis", "Right. Thanks, Matt. It's a good question.", "I'm not frustrated by it because I actually understand it, and so the frustration would be if it didn't make sense to me. I'm not surprised how this process is rolling out in that I think nobody wants the industry to be stressed. Capital is a good solution to keep the entire greater good theory alive, and I don't think any bailouts are positive for anyone.", "And so I think that based on Nancy's question and what we are seeing across the board, we're getting benefited in the long term by this flight to quality and the benefits that accrue to a company's reputation for not having been through this stress. Capital can often be diluted, as you know, as well, so I'm looking forward to a shareholder meeting today where I at least, of other things, don't have to face shareholders who have felt a precipitous drop in their value or wonder if we're going to harm them by diluting their investment or by cutting their dividends.", "So I think we're getting our share of benefits. It's our job to leverage that benefit and take advantage of it while not making mistakes, and you have my word we will do that.", "But we can live with that discord, and the fact is that not being distracted is probably the biggest value I can offer you. And I won't be able to prove that to you for probably a year from now, but a year from now when things are maybe settled down, I hopefully will be talking about a very well-oiled revenue company here that made its change in course during this period of time when we weren't focused on retrofitting or downsizing or reconstructing the company. So I'm actually quite positive about it.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Yep. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian of Merrill Lynch.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Ed.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Good morning, Richard. How are you?", "Richard Davis", "Good.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Good. Could you just go into a little more detail about your capital management outlook? You mentioned, you know, no buybacks related to Mellon 1st Business Bank, I guess, in the second quarter. Could you just remind us of a couple of things, number one, what amount of cash you're paying for that and, number, two, does that mean we should expect some resumption of buybacks in the second half of the year?", "Andy Cecere", "Ed, this is Andy. Thanks for the question. We did not disclose the financial details of that transaction, but suffice it to say that we will not be in the buyback market in the second quarter due to that. We expect that to close June or so of the second quarter, and that essentially takes the capacity for buybacks in Q2. Given everything we see thus far, we would expect to be back in the buyback market in the second half of the year.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "So I'm guessing, then, from those comments that you're expecting that that - and maybe you haven't disclosed this\u00a0- that that's a 100% cash deal in terms of structure?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, it is 100% cash.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "", "Hi. A couple questions. One, just finishing up on the capital question, how do you think about the capital levels in an economy that is deteriorating, as you point out? I guess I'm wondering if, you know, as credit deteriorates does that lead you to a need to increase capital to deal with that?", "Andy Cecere", "Betsy, this is Andy. You know, we've targeted our capital levels at the 8.5% tier one, and we will continue to maintain that target level. Capital is very important in this environment, you're right, but we're 250 basis points above what would be defined as well-capitalized, and we're very comfortable with that position.", "And that, together with our strong liquidity and our earnings power and our relatively speaking strong credit position all makes us comfortable with our targets at 8.5.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "", "Right. So you would say that today you're in an overcapitalized position expecting a deterioration in the credit outlook?", "Andy Cecere", "I would say we're at the target levels that we've set for ourselves, and we'll continue to maintain that target.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. And then on the margin side, just looking, you know, forward, as you were looking at the forward yield curve and some improvement expected there, at least at the long end of the curve, how can you take advantage of that? And how do you plan to take advantage of the steepness in sort of the 210 portion of the curve?", "Andy Cecere", "Right. Thank you. You know, we did come up in margin a bit more than we expected. If you recall back in our January earnings call, we thought we would be flattish to what we experienced in the first quarter of '07 in the low 350s and we were at 355. ", "I think there are three things that are causing that increase. Number one is some of the loan volume that we're getting, as Richard and Bill both mentioned, the flight to quality offers this opportunity with the spread coming back into the equation, and we'll be able to compete very effectively. And we have the capital and we have the funds to lend, so that's helping us.", "Secondly, there has been a flight to quality on the deposit side of the balance sheet which is offering us opportunities to grow deposits, and our national market funding is also very favorable in this environment. ", "And then finally, as you know, we're a bit liability sensitive so the fact that rates came down 125 basis points in the first quarter helped us out a bit. We continue to be liability sensitive, albeit at a little lower level, because we're hitting some deposit floors. So to the extent we see a further drop in rates and a steepening of the yield curve, that'll benefit us a bit. But as we talked about in the call, given today's yield curve and today's rate scenario, we expect a relatively stable margin.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, there's nothing that you would plan to do on, you know, with swaps and trying to capture some incremental and II from the 210 portion of the curve?", "Andy Cecere", "You know, what we try to do is manage our interest rate risk within the constraints of our policies, and we'll continue to do that. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Betsy, it's Richard. One more thing.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "", "Yeah?", "Richard Davis", "Capital is king right now. We get that, and we're going to protect it as maybe our most precious asset. ", "I will also remind you that our ability to generate capital is far and away ahead of our peers based on both the business mix, the quality of our assets and our efficiency. So our ability to generate return on tangible common of 42% a year is also probably the gift that keeps giving. So in our case, we are focused on protecting those capital levels. We also know we can generate it pretty quickly. ", "And at least at this point in time, I still don't feel so bad\u00a0 and I said this 90\u00a0days ago - that the buyback is the first thing to give up right now, because I'm not sure with the volatility of the stock market that a correlation of a buyback is as high as it would be in more normal cases, and the dividend must be protected and is very important to us, having increased it 6.25% back in December, and protecting it going forward. That's my first and foremost concern for the shareholders. So that all kind of comes together in the focus we put on capital protection and generation. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Groesbeck of Groesbeck Investments.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Ted. Good morning.", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "", "Yes, good morning. Thank you. A question for you. In the mortgage business, what percentage of originations were refinances?", "Bill Parker ", "", "Our non-purchase money, you mean?", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "No, in the regular mortgage originations, how much was refinancings of mortgages?", "Bill Parker ", "Oh. That's probably about 50%.", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "Fifty percent, okay. And in the charge-offs, were there any commercial loan charge-offs in the quarter?", "Bill Parker ", "", "Yes, there were. ", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "Okay. About how much?", "Bill Parker ", "I think it was - let's see.", "Andy Cecere", "It was 55.", "Bill Parker ", "Fifty-five?", "Andy Cecere", "Yeah.", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "Fifty-five, okay. And also, a question - if there were no buybacks during the quarter, it looked like the weighted average share count was down?", "Andy Cecere", "It was about flat.", "Theodore M. Groesbeck - Groesbeck Investments", "It was about flat. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson of LGIMA.", "David Knutson - LGIMA", "", "Hi. I had a couple of quick questions, one in regards to the, I guess, the latter part of the first quarter. Did you see a change in the payment profile of your clients? Did you see any credit deterioration? Was the weakness backend loaded, I guess?", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, this is Richard. In fact, I think we've said that March should be the month we'll learn a lot.", "We did. We saw some additional stress in the ability to repay, both on the credit card side and some of the auto categories, primarily. We hold off on our concerns until we see the stimulus refund and what happens in April and May when the refund checks come in in normal situations. ", "So before we get too concerned, we'll let March be a slight decrease to prior periods, but we'll wait and maybe call the decision in May or next month when we get a sense for how the stimulus and the money back into the markets come to bear.", "We've also been very careful to watch our forward-looking delinquencies, and they are fairly predictable. They're not stressing a great deal. Bankruptcy is a little higher, but everything is just incremental. It's a very slow incremental continuation of downturn in the prime businesses, where I think it's reflective of this economic downturn and the duration now. Whether we're in a recession or not, call it what you will, we've been in a slowdown for awhile. ", "So I think, David, that's really the cost that we're seeing on the consumer side.", "David Knutson - LGIMA", "One follow-up question to that. The last time that we had a stimulus package similar to the one we're expecting, what area did it benefit? Did it beneficial the consumer credit card business the best, the auto business, or the small owners? Or what was the meaningful - or can you try and quantify it for us? ", "Richard Davis", "It went two places - actually, we saw it three places. It went into deposits, more like the money markets and checking accounts. It went into credit card paydowns, because it's the most fluid item for people. And it affected, the two together affected a lower NSF-OD fee business because people were bringing themselves current on their checking account side.", "So we kind of see the effects on both sides. Deposits balloon up, fees go down a bit, and credit card payments are higher and charge-offs are lower. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to go, to more of the daytoday kind of stuff.", "David Knutson - LGIMA", "There hasn't been any increased speed in the roll rate of delinquencies over the quarter, people moving from 30\u00a0days to just simply going no more payments, or has there been?", "Bill Parker ", "Yeah, this is Bill Parker. No, the thing that has occurred in the last, you know, 90, 120\u00a0days is really those that do go delinquent go seriously delinquent - 90 plus - have a much more difficult time getting out of that situation. That's the pattern that's changed during this slowdown.", "David Knutson - LGIMA", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, David.", "Bill Parker ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet of Galleon. ", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Brock.", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking the call. I just wanted to get some color on the book of Mellon Business Bank. I remember that bank from years ago, but just kind of - just wanted to freshen up on size and what's under the covers there a little bit.", "Richard Davis", "Sure.", "Andy Cecere", "Okay. Brock, this is Andy Cecere speaking. It is principally a deposit-gathering bank, and from a size perspective it is much more deposit versus the loan. We have a book of about $1\u00a0billion on the loan front, and about $2.8\u00a0billion on the deposit front; very little in securities, and so that'll be incremental to our balance sheet. ", "We also see a lot of opportunity here to continue to extend the deposit side of the balance sheet and the loan side with the products and services that we're able to offer, particularly on the payments and Treasury management side.", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "And what kind of reserves were they running?", "Andy Cecere", "Their reserve level is about 10%. ", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "Okay. And what had been their historical credit experience?", "Andy Cecere", "Pardon me?", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "What had been their historical credit experience?", "Bill Parker ", "It was very strong. We did a thorough due diligence of their loan portfolio, and they're primarily a middle market lender. They're not in the investor real estate business, so it's a pretty solid credit. ", "Brock Vandervliet - Galleon Group", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Brock.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Guenther of Garden State.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "", "Good morning, Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Greg.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "I know you mentioned that due to declining home prices in many of your exposed markets that net charge-offs and nonperforming assets increased in the first quarter?", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "And going forward, you forecast that these charge-offs will continue to be increasing, but at a manageable clip.", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "So my question is:  What's the watermark we'd really need to see that would concern management as far as net charge-offs going forward?", "Richard Davis", "Well, you know, when we said 60 to 80 in the range, you know, we're at 76 today, so we're in the range. If this range gets longer or more steep, then I would say once we get to that 100 basis points or the 1% that we operate up here, that would be a point of worry for me.", "You know, I'll mention that - I said that our charge-offs were higher than we thought they'd be 90\u00a0days ago. In order of magnitude, this company made, you know, over $0.60 earnings per share this quarter, and the difference between what would have been an amazingly great quarter and one that disappointed me because it was worse was less than one penny. So this isn't going to take us from, you know, profit to loss, but it's going to just be a lag on the ability to let the pre-provision earnings of this company not be erased by some of the after-provision.", "And so it's not going to be Armageddon under any scenarios I can see, Greg, under any circumstances. But I do think that once we approach that 100 basis points, then we're at a point of stress that is both probably going to continue for somewhat longer than we would have thought, and it starts to erase some of the great things we're seeing above the line that I was hoping that would shine through earlier.", "So I think in the next 90\u00a0days we will learn a great deal on the trajectory of the rest of the year.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "", "Will there be a bit more clarity in the next quarter?", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Gregory G. Guenther - Garden State", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford Bernstein.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Kevin.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "", "Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning. Just to follow up on that, I just want to get a little more into your\u00a0- how you're thinking about reserving here. And Richard, you've remained at the high end of the industry in terms of reserve adequacy and that's still the case, but how should we be thinking about reserves now? And when you think about remaining adequately reserved, are you thinking about reserves to annualized charge-offs, reserves to NPAs, or is it that if things worsen, we bump up reserve to loans? How are you thinking about that?", "Richard Davis", "Kevin, thank you. There's a lot of allowance, you know, coverage ratios, but I look at two, and primarily two of the most important. One is total allowance to total loans, and that's a bit of a misnomer if you don't understand the business mix you have in the portfolio, but in our case that's very important to us and our allowance to total loans is 1.54%, which at least last quarter would have put us in the very top of our peer group, near the top, and I think it will stay there.", "The next thing I look at and equally important is allowance to total nonperforming loans because, as logic would prevail, those are the loans that are having some form of stress. This particularly quarter we will be at 288%, which is almost three times coverage. I feel very comfortable with that, especially compared to our peer group. ", "And while will keep our eye on nonperforms, perhaps one of the most instructive things I can offer you all is both based on regulator concerns and needs to be aggressive in downgrading at this point in the cycle, I don't think that necessarily nonperforming loans mean the risk of total loss as they may have meant in some of the more traditional days. They're simply a recognition of a higher stress and potential loss. ", "", "So I like to look at both because NPAs might be an overkill, but allowance, either way, in my mind has got to be at the high end of our peer group and well within what we'll call adequate to satisfy the regulators. And in both cases, I think our actions this quarter to add that $192\u00a0million as part of the benefit was to bulk that up [strictly] and give us plenty of time to watch the next couple of quarters and see if we have a need to do that again.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Right. Thank you, that's helpful. And you mentioned in there to satisfy the regulators. Is it your sense that the regulators, the safety and soundness regulators, are a bit more - are paying closer attention to the levels of reserves at your bank and at your competitors?", "Richard Davis", "Well, I know they're satisfied with our bank. I suppose they're watching closely because that's certainly an area of concern for them.", "I will say that particularly the regulators have been very aggressive in making sure that stressed credits are recognized quickly, downgrades are recognized quickly, and benefit of the doubt goes to the downside. And that doesn't surprise me. That's probably prudent at a time like this, and the regulators have a lot of concern that banks don't take too long to recognize problems or don't look for a Pollyanna outcome when in fact they'd be better served to be prepared for the worst.", "So we see it as a little bit of that, but we've seen it every cycle and it's not unusual. ", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Thanks very much.", "Richard Davis", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Jeff Viscone] of Viking Investors.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Jeff.", "Tom Purcell - Viking Investors", "", "Hi. This is [Tom Purcell]. Thanks for taking the call. Just a follow-up on Kevin's question earlier. When you guys look at the NPAs, do you exclude the 90plus accruing in restructured? If you do, what's the thought process? Thanks.", "Bill Parker ", "They are excluded from the NPA totals, however there's also a table that includes the 90plus, so you can look at it both ways. So it's however you choose to look at it.", "Tom Purcell - Viking Investors", "I guess I was wondering from the reserve adequacy standpoint, Richard said you look at reserve to loans and reserve to NPAs. For yourselves, when you're looking at it, do you include those or do you exclude them?", "Bill Parker ", "Well, effectively you include it. But the ratios Richard was citing exclude it. It's just the NPAs without the 90\u00a0days. But when you actually do the reserve methodology, since it's mostly the consumer assets that are more than 90\u00a0days, it does factor into the allowance methodology and analysis.", "The nomenclature people use [inaudible] externally reported numbers is often just an allowance that NPLs or NPAs\u00a0 without the 90\u00a0days. ", "Tom Purcell - Viking Investors", "Okay. When Richard said just staying, you know, at the top of the peer group on the 150 to total loans and watching that, do you want to keep the reserve above the combination of NPLs plus restructured plus 90day plus or is that not actually - should I not think about it that way?", "Bill Parker ", "I wouldn't think about it that way. I mean, there's two things. One, we obviously look at how we believe we should be well-capitalized and adequately served relative to our peers. And we are a highly rated bank, and those are important measures. ", "But then we also have the internal methodology to calculate the allowance, and that's where you get into the delinquencies and the underlying ratings of commercial credits, et cetera, which Richard was also talking about.", "Tom Purcell - Viking Investors", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Bill Parker ", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Doheny of Decade Capital.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Tom.", "Tom Doheny - Decade Capital", "", "Good morning. Just a quick question. I apologize if you hit on this, but the decline in credit and debit card revenue from the fourth quarter, I realize there's a lot of seasonality in that line but anything else you can, you know, hit on in terms of the decline on a linked-quarter basis or is that just purely seasonality?", "Richard Davis", "It's purely seasonality. In fact, it's even got the increase in fuel prices offsetting that, so it's absolutely and only seasonality. There's nothing remarkable in there at all.", "Tom Doheny - Decade Capital", "Okay, great.

After we have completed our formal remarks, we will open the line to questions from the audience.  ", "Our company reported net income of $950 million for the second quarter of 2008.  Reported earnings per diluted common share are $0.53 or $0.12 lower than the diluted common share in he same period of 2007 and $0.09 lower than the same period in prior quarter. ", "While the company had very positive operating growth in operating income reported decline in earnings from a year ago and the prior quarter was, simply put, the result of an increase in credit costs and the impact of a few significant items recognized in the first quarter of 2008.  ", "In our view, this quarter\u2019s results reflected our company\u2019s core strengths and building momentum.  The results demonstrated to us, and we hope to all of you, that a diversified business mix, our approach to risk management, our strong balance sheet and our strong capital positions have prepared this company for the challenges of the current economic environment.  Further, we are very satisfied that our current investments and the revenue goals for the company are on track and now beginning to show results.  ", "Let me review a few highlights.   The second quarter results included two significant items which combined reduced earnings per diluted common share by $0.11.  They included a $66 million impairment of certain structured investment security and a $200 million incremental provision for credit losses.  ", "We achieved a return on average assets of 1.58% and a return on average common equity of 17.9% in the second quarter.  Both returns, although lower than prior quarters, remain well above the median returns for our peer groups.  ", "Our second quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.61% was higher than the first quarter of 2008 by 6 basis points and 17 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year.  The improvement in our margin, in addition to the quarter\u2019s strong growth and average earning assets, resulted in an increase in net interest income of 15.6% year-over-year and 4.3% un-annualized on a linked quarter basis.  ", "The growth in net interest income was a significant driver in the positive variance in second quarter core revenue growth and operating earnings. This growth takes on more significance, however, when you look at the past.  The last full year our company enjoyed an increase in net income was 2003.  This directional change provides significant momentum for revenue growth going forward.", "Our fee-based businesses also continue to show excellent growth year-over-year with payment related categories, mortgage making revenue, commercial products revenue, and treasure management fees posting the strongest results.  Trust and investment management fees grew, but at a lower rate, as positive growth in transactions and new customers were partially offset by the impact of adverse equity market conditions.  ", "Consistent with past years, linked quarter non-interest income growth was easily very strong for the majority of our fee categories.  Significant items in both the current and prior quarters, however, somewhat masked the linked quarter trends that totaled non-interest income.", "On an un-annualized basis, payment related fees increased by 9.8%, treasure management increased by 10.5%, deposit service charges by 8.2% and both trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue grew at 4.5%.  All of these categories represent ongoing revenue streams that will continue to benefit us in the future as we are challenged by a stressed economy and the credit issues that have ensued.  ", "The growth in total revenue net interest income plus fees was 7.5% year-over-year.  Maybe more importantly, revenue growth, excluding the net impact of asset valuation losses was more than 9% year-over-year.  This is significantly higher than our company has experienced in the past number of years, again providing a solid and growing revenue base to off set some of the increasing costs associated with the current economic cycle.  ", "Non-interest expense in the current quarter was $165 million higher than the second quarter of last year and $39 million higher than the previous quarter.  A large portion of the increase in expense year-over-year can be attributed to continued investments in both our fee based businesses and the Banking franchise.  In addition, the other expense category has grown as a result of the higher credit related costs for other real estate owned and loan collection activity in addition to fraud losses in investment and tax advantage projects.  ", "On a linked quarter basis certain categories such as legal and professional were seasonally higher and business expansion and the timing of merit increases were responsible for a higher compensation cost.  Credit related costs for other real estate and loan workout also contributed to the link quarter increase.", "Our efficiency ratio, as reported for the second quarter of 2008 was 47.5%, comparable to the 47.3% efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 2007.   A more favorable 43.5% efficiency ratio recorded in the first quarter of 2008 affected several significant items, the largest impact of which came from the Visa Inc gain.  ", "We continue to be one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry.  We have always operated with a disciplined approach to expense control and our ability to maintain our efficiency is particularly important in this environment.  As a low cost provider we can and we will remain a very competitive player in the markets that we serve.  ", "Turning to the balance sheet, total average loans grew by 12% year-over-year, followed by solid growth in all the major categories.  On a linked quarter basis, total average loans increased by $7.8 billion or 5% on an un-annualized basis.  A portion of the increase both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was due to the reclassification of a number of federally insured student loans from loans held for sale to the portfolio as well as the purchase of a student loan portfolio.  In addition, growth, specifically in commercial real estate, was impacted by the acquisition of Mellon 1st Business Banc.", "On average, these items added $3.3 billion to average loan outstanding for the second quarter.  Extracting these items, our core average loan growth was 9.7% year-over-year and 2.9% un-annualized on a linked quarter basis.  ", "We continue to find that our company is benefiting from uncertainty and the volatility in the financial market.  As customers seek stability in their financial service provider as well as they find the other providers are pulling back from the market.  Our Banc is a benefactor of the flight to quality aspect of this challenging economic environment.  We have a strong capital structure and we are in the position to lend and to provide our customers with a high quality Banking product and services.  ", "That said, be assured that we will continue to concentrate on originating only high quality credit.  We can and we will compete for the best customers nationwide.  ", "We also saw a very favorable deposit trend this quarter.  Average total deposits increased by 14.1% over the same quarter of last year and 3.8% un-annualized over the prior quarter.  This deposit growth was in part driven by higher broker dealer, government, and institutional trust balances, the acquisition of Mellon 1st Business Banc as well as the company\u2019s ability to attract low-cost, full sale lending in this volatile market.  ", "In addition, the growth in deposits reflected our continued focus on our revenue initiatives, particularly in the corporate Banking business line.  Extracting Mellon 1st Business Banc, average deposit growth was 13.5% year-over-year and 3.2% on a linked quarter basis.  ", "Finally and moving on to credit, as expected, credit costs were higher again this quarter.   Net charge offs were 98 basis points of average loans for the second quarter of 2008 above the 76 basis points of average loans in the first quarter of 2008.  The increase in net charge offs was the result of continued stress in the residential home and mortgage related industries, declining home prices in most geographic regions and the impact of the worsening economy on our commercial and consumer customers.  ", "Within the consumer loan portfolio, credit card loan net charge offs accounted for the majority of the linked quarter and year-over-year increase.  The credit card charge off ratio of 4.84% this quarter, although still below the industry average, was higher than our company had seen in the past five years and is indicative of the economic stress facing many consumers.  ", "Note that there is some seasonality in credit card net charge offs; consequently, we expect a rate of increases in credit card net charge offs to moderate somewhat in the third quarter.  Given the high quality of this prime portfolio, we still expect that our credit card net charge off ratio will continue to be lower than the industry average.  ", "As we indicated at a recent investor conference, the net charge off ratio on residential real estate related loans, including consumer first and second liens, was expected to increase this quarter to approximately 1% of average loans outstanding.  First, residential mortgages were slightly lower than predicted with a net charge off ratio of 91 basis points while the net charge off ratio on home equity and second mortgages reached 1.13% for this quarter.  Combined the net charge off ratio on the first and second mortgages this quarter was 1.01%.  A majority of the increase in both first and second mortgages can be attributed to loans originated through our consumer finance division as our branch-originated portfolio continues to perform very well. ", " A worsening economy, falling home prices, and rising gas prices, have more recently, heightened concerns in the industry about auto loans and leases.  We offer auto loans through our branch network, in addition to originating loans and leases through dealers across the country in our indirect auto business.", "Our auto loan portfolio, which totaled $9.5 billion at June 30, is a very high quality portfolio and we have been in this business, uninterrupted, since 1953.  The net charge off ratio in the second quarter on that portfolio was 72 basis points, just slightly lower than the 79 basis points we recorded in the first quarter of this year.  The portfolio is current and performing well and at June 30, our retail auto lease portfolio totaled $5.4 billion.  Again, this is a high quality portfolio; the net charge off ratio was 58 basis points in the second quarter, compared with a net charge off ratio of 49 basis points in the first quarter of this year.", "As many of you have heard me say in the past, we can generally see credit trends 90 days out, but not much beyond and as we look 90 days ahead, taking into account the higher level of delinquencies in residential real estate and other consumer portfolios, taking into account the decline in home values and other collateral, accounting for the continued stress in the home building and related industry, adding the impact of higher gas and commodity prices on consumers and businesses and finally the general stress in the economy.  ", "As a result we do expect net charge offs to increase in the third quarter at a rate somewhat comparable or lower to the amount that we experienced between the first and second quarters of this year.   Given that expectation the net charge off ratio will rise above 1% in the third quarter.  ", "Also, as expected, non-performing assets climbed higher this quarter.  At June 30, total non-performing assets were 1 billion, $135 million, or 34.3% higher than at March 31.   Although the majority of the increase was driven by residential real estate, home building and related industries, the economic slow down and rising commodity prices has had an impact on some of our commercial customers.  ", "Given these conditions we anticipate that our non-performing assets will continue to rise.  As a result of the upward trend in both net charge off and non-performing assets, in addition to the economic concerns already mentioned, our second quarter results included an incremental provision for credit losses of $200 million.  With this addition to the allowance for credit losses management believes that the company\u2019s allowance was adequate at June 30, with the ratio of allowances to period in loans at 1.60%l. compared to 1.54% at March 31 and the ratio of allowance to non-performing loans of 273%.", "Going forward we will of course continue to assess the adequacy of our reserves for loan losses and provide for credit losses to reflect portfolio and economic conditions. ", "I will now turn the call over to Andy who will make a few more comments about the quarter.  ", "", "Andrew Cecere", "I would like to begin with a quick summary of the significant items that have impacted the comparison of our second quarter results to prior periods.  First, during the second quarter and impairment charge of $66 million was recognized on the structured investment securities purchased in the fourth quarter of 2007 from an affiliate and as these assets are now part of our company\u2019s investment portfolio, the impairment charge was recorded as a securities loss.", "The impairment charge was driven this quarter by wider market spreads for these types of securities caused by the continuing decline in housing prices and an increase in foreclosure activity.  ", "During the first quarter of 2008 the company booked $253 million in impairment charge on the same portfolio structured investment securities.  ", "The provision for credit losses reported this quarter was $200 million in excess of net charge offs.  The first quarter of 2008 also included an incremental provision for credit losses of a similar amount $192 million.  As you probably recall, the first quarter of 2008 also included several additional significant items that impacted the comparison of linked quarter results.  ", "The other income line in the first quarter included a $492 million gain related to the Visa initial public offering and a $62 million reduction in revenue related the adoption of a new accounting standard.  ", "", "Total expense in the first quarter included a $25 million contribution to the U.S. Bancorp foundation and a $22 million accrual for certain litigation.  These significant items reduced our first quarter diluted earnings per common share by $0.02, while the impairment charge and an incremental provision taken in the current quarter reduced diluted earnings per common share by $0.11.  ", "Net interest income in the second quarter was higher on a year-over-year and on a quarter basis due to both strong earning acid growth and an expanding margin. The improvement in margin on both the year-over-year and link quarter basis was the result of growth in higher spread assets and the benefit of being liability sensitive in a declining rate environment.  We continue to benefit as well from our company\u2019s ability to secure favorable, short-term funding rates in this volatile market.  Our margin of 3.61% was slightly higher than we anticipated a few months ago, primarily because of our success in funding the balance sheet at favorable rates.  ", "Going forward, assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect to maintain a fairly stable net interest margin, with a slight bias to the downside, for the third quarter.  This assumption is based on steady to slightly improving credit spreads, continuing growth in higher spread products, including credit card and other retail loans and a normalization of funding and liquidity in the over night markets.  ", "With the follow launch of our earlier discussion on the credit quality of our retail auto lease portfolio I wanted to spend a moment on the lease residual values and the impact they have on non-interest income; particularly now that there is a growing concern surrounding the current value of used cars.", "Although the incidence of loss has been fairly on track and predictable over the past number of quarters, the severity of loss has grown.  As you may know, these residual losses result in charges to other non-interest income; in fact, non-interest income decreased year-over-year by $42 million, as net gains in the second quarter of 2007 transitioned to net losses in the second quarter of this year.   ", "We continually and carefully manage the residual risk on this portfolio by maintaining conservative, upfront, residual valuations, originating leases with longer lease terms, and managing concentrations within the portfolio by type, make and model of car, recognizing impairment when necessary and finally, carrying catastrophic residual loss insurance to limit our overall loss exposure.  Given the current market for used cars we continue to expect adverse market pressure on all of these residual values, but feel that they will be very manageable for our company.  ", "Our capital position remains strong, our 201, and total capital ratios were 8.5% and 12.5% respectively at June 30, both right on target levels.   Although we have capacity and return authorization to buy back additional shares we do not anticipate to repurchase shares between now and the end of the year.  ", "In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter operating results.  The company posted solid loan and deposit growth on both a year-over-year and link quarter basis, strong growth in net interest income of 15.6% year-over-year and 4.3% un-annualized over the prior quarter.  Excluding significant items discussed total revenue growth of over 9% year-over-year, a manageable increase in credit costs and finally, we ended the quarter as we began with a strong capital base and liquidity position. ", "Before turning the call back to Richard I want to take a moment to update you on the company\u2019s investment and perpetual preferred stock issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "The investment is held in the available for sale securities portfolio with a book value of $97 million.  At June 30 the value of this investment was $79 million.  As we do for all of our investments the company will continue to monitor the performance of the entities to determine if any impairment is necessary at a future date.", "Richard Davis", "", "Before we take questions, I\u2019d like to spend a moment talking about a few business line high lights for the quarter.  ", "First the second quarter marks the end of the bidding process for the governments GSA SmartPay 2 program.  U.S. Banc through its corporate payments business line is one of four card issuers qualified to contract with the government agencies to provide travel, purchasing, fleet and integrated products as well as other payment management technologies.  ", "The results are in and U.S. Banc increased its share of the GSA transaction volume from 37% under SmartPay 1 to 48% under SmartPay 2.   This is great news for our company and adds to the momentum already present while increasing the overall market share for this unique corporate payment business line.", "Another high light comes from our institutional trust in custody and corporate trust groups.  Over the past two months both have been enjoying the benefit of a flight to quality as new customers specifically sign U.S. Bancs superior credit quality and service levels as they leave their current provider and bring their business to us.", "Finally for the third year in a row U.S. Banc was rated number one in the nation in the 2008 Privacy Trust study for retail Banking conducted by the Ponemon Institute.  Customer privacy is a very important priority for our company and we are proud to be recognized with this level of recognition once again.", "In conclusion, during this call we have described the economic environment in which we are all operating as challenging and stressful.  I would add that it is also easy to describe it as unprecedented and even historic.  ", "We are a Banc.  Accordingly we are and will be affected by the challenges confronting the financial service industry today.  As such, we will continue to carefully manage the risks for the more important message we want to deliver to our investors, our customers, and our employees is that we remain focused on the opportunity to grow our business, to deepen our customer relationship and to acquire new customers.  ", "As you have heard me say before, we are open for business and very mindful of the fact that this environment, although stressful, has presented our company with a window of opportunity to solidify and grow our position in the markets we serve.   We are prepared to manage this company through the cycle.  Our prudent approach to risk management has not changed, our business model is intact and we are in the position to utilize this company\u2019s strong capital generation to invest in growth opportunities as well as in our community and in our employees.  ", "We will rely on our earnings capacity to sustain our dividends and maintain our well-capitalized position, all the while focusing on our responsibility to produce consistent, predictable, and repeatable results for our shareholders.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse. ", "", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "", "Richard, just following those comments and talking about your outlook, particularly describing it as such in terms as challenging and stressful.  In terms of the business you talked earlier in the year about the new revenue opportunities and the build out as opposed to rationalizing the business.  Given the outlook and the updated credit outlook, how were you thinking about the business now going forward, given the change, particularly as it relates to credit?", "Richard Davis", "I think one of the parts of that question is if we\u2019re going to change any of our current plans for the investments in the company, I\u2019m not.  The current credit environment, while, as I said challenging and stressful and all those other things is certainly diminishing our bottom line impact, if you look above the line, before losses and before loan loss provision adds, the core company is operating at levels as good as it has in the past two years, in fact that better in some cases.", "Part of that is because we\u2019ve continued to stay on the offense and stick to the basic business of Banking and not been worried about any of the issues that have been focusing some of our peers, but we\u2019ve also been investing in these initiatives, many of which we\u2019ve mentioned over the prior quarters and those are really coming through.  ", "In a normal environment I would spend this whole conference call telling you about power Banc and talking about wealth management and talking about corporate trust and payments and I would get into those details and I\u2019m happy to do that at any time, but given that the byline right now is credit quality, liquidity, capital and protection of the dividend, I don\u2019t want to lose the sight that this company is still working in the old fashioned scenario where losses are higher, but  we\u2019re operating just like we did a couple years ago on trying to grow the future of the company through these revenue initiatives and 54,000 employees in the company, 52,000 spend every day working on moving forward while maybe 2,000 of us worry about making sure that we\u2019re protecting where we got up to this point in the cycle.", "I\u2019m actually quite optimistic about the benefits and you\u2019ll see them come through when the loan loss provision adds stops and when loan losses start to moderate, I think you\u2019ll see some really quality revenue benefits coming from this company that you haven\u2019t seen in a generation past.  ", "", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "", "I appreciate that.  Secondarily, just in terms of the payments business, again were resilient in the quarter and again given your outlook can you give us a little bit better feel in terms of the pricing versus volume in the quarter and again what the outlook would be there?  Again, as you talked about rising energy prices and the like it seems like the payments business continues to deliver.  How were you thinking about that business in the second half and again how should we think about it in terms of volume business versus the pricing changes that may have come through?", "Richard Davis", "I\u2019m going to tell you that it has a slight negative bias to it, the bottom line because volume is probably going to come down a little bit more in the payment businesses than the margin will go up simply because of the consumer recession that I think we\u2019re in and I do believe we\u2019re in one.  Having said that, you\u2019re going to find average ticket prices are higher.  ", "Our volume will still moderate in some cases where people still need to buy their more necessity based items on their debit cards or their credit cards.   The corporate space is primarily government and business related and those businesses are still spending it pretty much unfettered from the current environment.  ", "I think you you\u2019ll see that we don\u2019t have much different second half than we had first half. The thing that I might add though, that I\u2019m not sure that understand the impacts is the financial stimulus.  I happen to be a believer that the stimulus actually did show itself in this economy, but it didn\u2019t show itself at the Bancs as much as it showed itself at the gas pump or at the cash register.   ", "Having said all that, I think that perhaps a more negative view of the stimulus checks is that they were perfectly timed.  They came in the last 90 days when people needed them the most to get through their daily living activities and now in a short month they\u2019ll be gone.  Whether that translates to people need to spend more on their debit or credit card, whether that creates additional stress in consumers ability to repay their debt, I think that\u2019s a question mark we\u2019re going to watch for the next 60 to 90 days because I think there\u2019s a slight negative bias toward that outcome as well, because quarter three and quarter four don\u2019t have any of those benefits in them that will undoubtedly affect us somehow.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor - UBS. ", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 UBS", "", "You guys have a decent amount of exposure to the consumer auto loans as well as the auto leases that you addressed earlier.  Could you just give us some more color on what are the loss rates right now? Where do you think they go in the second half of the year which, if I recall correctly, tend to be a little seasonal higher and I think you might have some insurance in residuals, if you could remind us of that as well. ", "Richard Davis", "We do and we\u2019re prepared for that, because we know that\u2019s an area of concern for the market, so Bill why don\u2019t you start with the performance and Andy why don\u2019t you run with the insurance.  ", "P.W. (Bill) Parker", "", "Again, we have about $5.5 billion of leasing portfolio.  We\u2019ve been in the business for a long time; it\u2019s an all time portfolio that ended the quarter at about a 58 basis point loss rate.  The balance of it is about $9.5 billion of loans that originated both indirect and through our branches; the loss rate on that\u2019s about 74 basis points.  On the first half of the year if you add those two together at about $15 billion the first half of the year, they had combined $25 million of loss first quarter at $25 million of loss at the second quarter.  ", "As you mentioned, the latter half of the year there will be a seasonal up tick.  There also is the issue of severity on some of the SUVs and trucks that are obviously going to be going to auction and those that are a higher loss rate, but right now we\u2019re in the 70s on this portfolio, all prime portfolio, we don\u2019t expect a material deterioration in it. ", "Andrew Cecere", "On the leasing side of the equation we have about a $5.4 billion lease portfolio and about a $3.4 billion lease residual ports booked.  What we are experiencing is a normal rate of incidence, but a higher loss per incidence and that loss is principally focused in the SUV category which represents about 41% of our total book.  Not unlike the total US SUV population.  We do expect this to continue, but it is certainly manageable within the overall income statement.  ", "We do have catastrophic insurance.  The catastrophic insurance has not come into play yet because some of the positives are off setting some of the negatives and it\u2019s a net insurance number, but if things get very, very bad we will have insurance for that, but to date that has not taken place. ", "Richard Davis", "When we talk about seeing 90 days out and we see that in term of incidence of loss, what\u2019s harder to predict is the amount per loss.  As cars come off we have some go to auction or we fin other ways to dispose of them.  So, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a bit of an uncertainty even within the 90 day window, but if you had 25 and $25 million per quarter that combined portfolio, it\u2019s undoubtedly going to move up, but not material enough to even really, I wouldn\u2019t even probably rank it in the worry spot of things that we\u2019re concerned about, because it\u2019s a prime portfolio and it\u2019s performing quite well.  The incidence of loss is very predictable.  The announced first car coming off lease is already substantially higher than it was in the past and I don\u2019t think it has a lot more to go.  ", "", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 UBS", "", "The loss rate that we saw this quarter, my guess is it will be among the lower of a lot of your peers as they come out with results.  Do you think the big difference is simply that you are all prime while some had some other stuff in there, or is there another thing that we should be focusing on here in terms of why the qualities will look better?", "P.W. (Bill) Parker", "I think we\u2019ve been very prudent in our underwriting.  I do think it\u2019s a higher quality portfolio.  In terms of lease side, we\u2019ve never enhanced residuals\u2019, that\u2019s not something we do.  We have extended lease terms, so I think overall the book is very conservative from an underwriting standpoint.  ", "Richard Davis", "I think that\u2019s it.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 UBS", "", "Your net interest margin ticked up a few bits this quarter and you\u2019re expecting it to be stable to down for the rest of the year.  Can you just give us a little more color on what\u2019s driving that?", "Andrew Cecere", "You bet.  We are liability sensitive.  Rates have come down, that\u2019s helped us a bit.  We expect it to be relatively stable, down just a little bit if anything, but relatively stable.  We are benefiting from the flight to quality that Richard talked about.  We\u2019re able to grow our loans at every good spreads, we\u2019re able to gather deposits because of the flight to quality and we\u2019re able to gather wholesale funding at a favorable rate right now, so all t hose things are contributing to our net interest margin at the 360 or so and I think we\u2019ll see that going forward. ", "Richard Davis", "I agree with that.  We are not, rest assured everybody, we are not growing our loans at twice the amount we did a year ago, because we\u2019re reaching down on the quality spectrum.  This is absolutely what flight to quality looks like and we are getting prime customers at higher levels, at better spreads and better margins and we\u2019re being very selective.  ", "As I said on the last call, our precious capital, the first goes to our very best customers, the next goes to everybody else\u2019s very best customers, and there\u2019s none left over.  So, we\u2019re really quite advantaged right now and if the flight to quality got stronger continued then that margin continues to be closer to where it is now with much less slight negative bias.  We just want to be realistic in case that were to stop.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush - MAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy Bush - MAB Research, LLC", "", "About the trajectory of credit quality deterioration, is it continuing to accelerate, was it accelerating at the end of the quarter and any intrepid prediction or guess about when things start to level out?", "Richard Davis", "The best way to position it is back in the middle of May, we saw that we would be in the mid-90s in our charge offs and here we came in at 98 basis points which I struggle with, because I really wanted to be exactly at the mid-90s.  But, the fact is, is that it didn\u2019t change a lot since the last 60 days. We\u2019re getting better at learning how to predict these outcomes and read the slopes or the curves, but it\u2019s definitely continuing to get worse.  The world doesn\u2019t get better.  ", "The best way for me to portray it to you is non-performing assets and net charge offs, if you look at the slope of the curves that we just experienced between data points quarter two and quarter one the slope going forward from quarter three as in comparison to quarter two will be up, but at a lesser slope.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cecere, US Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions)", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 AM eastern time through Tuesday, April 28 at 12 midnight eastern time. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for US Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you, Rachel, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me to review US Bancorp\u2019s first quarter 2009 results, and to answer your questions. If you have not received a copy of our earnings release and supplemental analyst\u2019s schedule, they are available on our Web site at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Andy and I would like to start the call today with a short review of our first quarter results. As we\u2019ve completed our brief formal remarks, we\u2019ll open the line to questions from our audience.", "US Bancorp reported net income of $529 million for the first quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.24. I\u2019m very proud of our first quarter results, as they reflect the company\u2019s ability to produce strong core operating earnings in a very stressed economic environment. Equally significant is that we achieved record total net revenue this quarter, and it was driven by core growth in both net interest income and fee revenue.", "Although core operating earnings were strong, significantly higher credit costs, including the cost to building the reserve for expected credit losses and reflect existing economic conditions, resulted in earnings that were lower than the first quarter of 2008. The current quarter\u2019s earnings compared favorably however, to the prior quarter\u2019s earnings due to a combination of higher fee income and lower expense.", "Significant items impacting the company\u2019s first quarter earnings included $198 million of net security losses, a $92 million gain on a corporate real estate transaction, and $530 million of provision expense in excess of net charge-offs. In total, significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter by approximately $0.28.", "Our performance metrics were impacted by these significant items with return on average offset in the current quarter of 0.81% and return on average common equity of 9.0%. Excluding the significant revenue items and incremental provision expense, return on average out-debt and return on average common equity would have been approximately 1.56% and 19.7%, respectively. As I\u2019ve stated, our company continue to do well this quarter on an operating basis. And I\u2019d like to review a few of those highlights with you now.", "We recorded strong growth in total average loans year-over-year. Total average loans outstanding increased by $30.5 billion or 19.6%, with solid growth in all major categories. Excluding the impact of recent acquisition, total average loans on a core basis grew by over 11% year-over-year.", "On a linked quarter basis, total average loans increased by $8.5 billion or 4.8% and excluding acquisitions, by almost $2 billion or 4.4% on an annualized basis. This linked quarter annualized growth was somewhat muted by a decline in overdraft balances outstanding and seasonally lowered non-interest bearing corporate card balances. Excluding these two non-interest bearing loan categories, total average loans on a core basis increased by 6.4% annualized late quarter.", "This growth in average loans outstanding illustrates that our company is continuing to provide credit to our customers. But average loan outstandings are just part of the story. As not all new loan originations and commitments to lend are fully reflected in these numbers. In fact, during the first quarter of 2009, US Bancorp originated almost $14 billion of residential mortgages. We originated over $4 billion of consumer loans including installment loans, student loans, lines of credit and home equity lines and loans. We originated new prime based credit card accounts with lines totaling $2.4 billion and we issued over $8 billion of new commitment and renewed over $14 billion of commitments to small businesses, commercial, and commercial real estate customers.", "The statistics clearly demonstrate that US Bancorp continuous to be responsive to, and supportive of the borrowing needs of both our new and current worthy customers and the government\u2019s efforts to maintain the flow of credit in these stressful economic times.", "Another highlight of the first quarter results was our outstanding growth in average deposits. Total average deposits increased by $29.7 billion or 22.7% over the same quarter of last year. And over $16 million or 11.1% unannualized on a linked quarter basis. Without acquisitions, this year-over-year growth rate was 12.3% while linked quarter growth was 6.8% an annualized.", "This tremendous growth on average deposits as well as loans outstanding is clear evidence that our company is benefiting from the uncertainty in the financial market and the flight to quality by consumers and businesses that are looking for a safe, stable, and sound financial institution. In fact, we are currently the highest rated financial institution in the country with a AA rating from S&P and an AA3 ratings from Moody\u2019s. These ratings have given us a significant advantage as our customers make the decision as to where they will place their business, and where they will place their trusts.", "As I\u2019ve previously mentioned, the company reported record total revenue in the first quarter. A major contributor to this success was mortgage banking which also produced record setting revenue with increases year-over-year and linked quarter of a $128 million and $210 million respectively.", "The growth in mortgage banking revenue reflected the high origination fees, servicing revenue, and a favorable change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedging activity which was essentially neutral for the quarter. Total mortgage production of $13.4 billion was another quarterly record and was significantly higher than both the same quarter of 2008 and the prior quarter. The majority of this production is packaged and sold into the secondary market and we expect to continue to accommodate the increased demand from mortgage products from both new and existing customers.", "Finally, I would like to draw your attention to non-interest expense which benefited this quarter from the implementation of the company\u2019s cost containment plan in late January. Year-over-year excluding the impact of acquisitions, total on interest expense was a simply flat. While the $67 million decline in expenses on a linked quarter basis was a result of seasonally lower spending, and the company\u2019s cost saving efforts. Both of which were more than offset by the other expenses related to the two acquisitions made in November of last year.", "Our efficiency ratio as reported for the first quarter of 2009 was 45.8%. We continue to be one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve achieved this positive core operating leverage this quarter on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.", "In total, the first quarter results underscore the inherent value of our company\u2019s strong balance sheet, and it\u2019s diversified earning stream. As customer actively seek a bank partner that can provide the product and services they need and the safety instability they require, our balance sheet businesses continue to grow and prosper. As consumers in businesses pull back on their spending and the equity market faltered, our fee based businesses remained solid but their growth is tempered. It is however this diversified earning stream that have allowed us to perform despite a stressful economic environment. And it is this diversified mix of businesses that has us very well positioned for the recovery days of the current economic cycle.", "Moving on to credit, as I pointed out earlier, an increase in credit cost including the cost of building the reserves for expected credit losses and to reflect the existing economic environment drove the year-over-year reduction in the company\u2019s net income. Net charge-offs of $788 million were 24.7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008. As expected slightly lower percentage increase than we experienced in previous quarters. The increase in net charge-offs once again reflected the continued stress in residential homes and mortgage related industry and the impact of the worsening economy on both our retail and commercial customers.", "The most significant increases in net charge-offs were recorded for lease financing, primarily small business leasing, construction and development loans, and credit cards. Total net charge-offs to average loan outstanding were 1.72% in the first quarter compared with 1.42% in the fourth quarter.", "Also and as expected, non-performing assets increased this quarter. The change reflected an increase in non-performing loans in the bank\u2019s core loan portfolio, and the impact of the recent acquisition for Downey Savings and TFF Bank & Trust.", "As of March 31st, total non-performing assets were $3,410 million compared with $2,624 million at December 31st. Included in total non-performing assets were $702 million of loans and other real estate covered by a loss share agreement with the FDIC in conjunction with our two California acquisitions. In other words, there is minimal amount of potential loss in these loans given the terms of the agreement of our agreement with the FDIC.", "The majority of the increase in non-performing loans within the core bank portfolio was related to residential mortgage and residential construction related industries, as well as other commercial real estate lending. In fact, of the $361 million increase in commercial non-performing loans approximately 43% was real estate related. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned, excluding covered assets was 156 basis points at March 31st.", "Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest rose by 26% this quarter, as the company continues to work with customers to re-negotiate loan terms, enabling them to keep their homes. These separates are in sync with the government's goal to restore the housing markets, and our desire to retain the value of these relationships for our shareholders.", "As expected, given the upward trends in both net charge-offs and non-performing assets, in addition to the continued weakness in the economy, we increased the allowance for our loan loss this quarter by recording an incremental provision for loan losses in excess of five \u2013 excess of charge-offs of $530 million .This represents an amount equal to 67% of the current quarter's total net charge-offs.", "With this addition, the company's allowance for credit losses to period in loans excluding covered assets was 2.37% compared with 2.09% at December 31st. And a ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding covered assets was 169%.", "Going forward, we will continue to assess the adequacy of our reserve for loan losses and provide for credit losses at a level that reflects changes in the credit risk of the loan portfolio and the current economic condition. Our company enters this credit cycle with a strong balance sheet and we fully intend to protect that position through this cycle and beyond.", "Finally and importantly, our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 10.9% and 14.4% respectively at March 31st. Both well above our target levels. Additionally, our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio were 3.7% at March 31st while tangible common equity as a percent of risk-graded assets were 4.0%. Both ratios were higher than on December 31st, having benefited from earnings and the recent dividend reduction.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Richard.", "You\u2019ve now heard the key highlights of this quarter's results from Richard. Overall, the results reflected the strength and quality of our core earnings. And I like to spend a few minutes to provide you with more detail. I\u2019ll begin with a quick summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our first quarter results to prior periods.", "First, non-interest income included a $198 million of security losses. Included in this total were $254 million of impairment charges on several securities including a perpetual preferred issue of a major US financial institution, our SID exposure, and a few agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities. These impairment charges were partially offset by gains of securities sold of $56 million. Second, the other income in the first quarter included a $92 million gain on a corporate real estate transaction. And third, we recorded an incremental provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $530 million in the first quarter.", "Significant items in the first quarter were in total $636 million and reduced diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.28 cents. For comparison purposes during the first quarter of 2008, the company recorded $251 million of security losses, the results of impairment charges on structure investment vehicles, other preferred securities, and non-agency mortgage backed securities.", "In addition, non-interest income in the first quarter of 2008 included a $492 million Visa Gain and a $62 million charge related to the adoption of FAS 157, while non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2008 included two special items totaling $47 million. Additionally, results in the first quarter of 2008 included an incremental provision for credit losses of $192 million. The net impact of the first quarter 2008 significant items reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 cents. Finally, net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2008 included $253 million of security losses and incremental provision expense of $635 million. Together, these items reduced fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.34 cents.", "Now, a few comments about operating earnings this quarter. Net interest income in the first quarter was 14.5% higher than the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to a strong 13.7% increase in average earning assets. As projected, the net interest margin for the first quarter was 3.95%, 4 basis points higher than the previous year.", "Net interest income was slightly lower in our link quarter basis as a 4.1% increase in average earning assets was offset by an expected decline in the net interest margin. The slight improvement in the margin on a year-over-year basis was principally the result of growth and higher spread assets. On a linked quarter basis, the expected reduction in net interest margin was primarily due to the full quarter intact of the two California acquisitions, the re-pricing of a number of consumer-lending products that lacked the decline in money cost during the fourth quarter, as well as, the normalization of funding and liquidity in the wholesale funding markets.", "Going forward, assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expected the net interest margin to remain relatively stable. Total non-interest income in the current quarter was lower year-over-year primarily due to the $492 million Visa Gain reported in 2008.", "Offsetting the negative impact of that one-time item were favorable variance in mortgage banking revenue, as Richard discuss earlier, as well as Treasury management fees and commercial product revenue, which were higher than the first quarter of 2008 by 10.5% and 15.2% respectively. The growth in both of these two categories reflected the wholesale banking groups ongoing revenue initiatives and the bank's bank-wide BDR or building deeper relationships project. Seasonality, a slowing economy and unfavorable equity market conditions led to a decline in several fee-based categories this quarter. Merchant profit in services revenues lower an a both year-over-year basis ending quarter, while corporate payment products revenue declined from the same period of last year, although remained flat to the prior quarter.", "Both of these payments related categories reflect the slow down in consumer and business spending but remained positioned for our recovery. Trust and investment management fees were also lower year-over-year and linked quarter, as adverse equity market conditions reduced the value of assets under management and consequently related management fees. Deposit service charges decreased from both the comparable time periods as changes in consumer spending patterns led to lower fee related activity.", "Finally within non-interest income and other income, excluding the impact of significant items was lower year-over-year due to higher end-of-term residual losses in consumer auto leases and lower equity investment income. On a linked quarter basis, the corporate real estate transaction, as expected and as expected lower in the term losses on retail auto leases, accounted for the majority of the variance.", "As we indicated in our last call, the end of term losses on auto leases peaked in the third and fourth quarter of 2008 as a number of cars coming off lease began to decline.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy.", "In summary, I am very proud of the results for this quarter. I am more than confident that \u2013 more confident than ever that this company with this diversified mix of businesses, coupled with its long-standing prudent approach to risk, and the remarkable dedication and loyalty and hard work of its employees, will continue to outperform despite the stress of the current environment. We are, in fact, building momentum in our balance sheet businesses while remaining poised to capture the extraordinary opportunities that we\u2019d present for our fee businesses as the market, the economy, and the world recover.", "In conclusion, our fundamental businesses remain strong. We are not immune to the challenges facing our industry but we are open for business and continue to prudently lend to credit-worthy customers. We continue to wisely invest and grow our franchise. We continue to support the communities in which we operate. We continue to serve our customers current needs while building deeper relationships for our future. and most importantly, we continue to create value for our shareholders. Value that is derived from our high quality balance sheet, capital strength, and earnings power; factors that have enabled the US Bancorp to successfully navigate the challenges of the present while remaining well positioned to view the opportunities of the future.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience. Rachel?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning, Richard and Andy and Judy. How are you?", "Judy Murphy", "Good morning.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good. Richard or even Andy, can you give a little more color on the mortgage banking side? I\u2019ve had some other banks report some pretty good increases or write ups of the MSR. Didn\u2019t look like that occurred with you guys this quarter. And mortgage production volume was up nicely, but the increase in the production volume was lower than the type of gain we saw if you will, from the origination of sales volume. Sales volume and origination of sales was up about five fold quarter-to-quarter, and mortgage production was up less than half. So, is the driver gain on sale? Has that spread widened to such a degree? And if so, can you comment on the sustainability of those kind of margins you can get on the sale of the loans?", "Andy Cecere", "Chris, this is Andy. First, regarding your hedge question. Our hedge was essentially neutral for the quarter against the servicing valuation, but that was an improvement versus the fourth quarter. As you know, the fourth quarter rates were highly volatile and we actually recorded a negative in the fourth quarter of about $70 million. So on a quarter linked basis, that did improve the numbers. Year-over-year it was slightly positive. In the first quarter 2008 we were negative about 13. So the neutrality in the first quarter was helpful.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Andy Cecere", "Regarding the production versus servicing numbers, the production number was the principal driver in the first quarter, both on a linked basis and a year-over-year basis, producing $174 million linked in about $130 million quarter-over-quarter. So it is the principal drive. We had a record quarter in terms of, but not only production but also applications. So we would expect that strength that we saw in the first quarter to continue at least until the second quarter.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Are you also seeing widening spreads on the gain on sale on those loans?", "Andy Cecere", "Not yet, but the key driver in the revenue increase is the production levels.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And I may have missed this. If could just follow up on the tax question. I know that your tax rate was a bit low this quarter on taxable equivalent basis. What\u2019s the outlook going forward so I know how to model that?", "Andy Cecere", "Right, Chris. So we, on a TEB basis, we are at about 21.5% this quarter. Higher than last quarter but lower than the first three quarters of 2008. And it\u2019s really a function of where our income levels fall. We would expect the rest of the year to fall somewhere between 20% and 25% on a TEB basis.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with isi Group.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, Ed.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "Andy Cecere", "Go ahead, Ed.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Richard, in past calls you\u2019ve been at least willing to give a three-month type of credit outlook. You didn\u2019t do that on this call. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re still willing to do that in terms of the pace of increase in charge-offs and NTAs. And then if you could also comment maybe a little more broadly on how you\u2019re thinking about additional reserve build throughout the balances of \u201909, that would be helpful. Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "I would be happy to. Thanks, Ed. I\u2019m happy to report that our last few quarters, including this quarter are very consistent with what we\u2019ve expected along this cycle. And we\u2019re looking the same for the next couple of quarters as we move forward.", "In other words, the kind of trajectory you\u2018ve seen in both the increase in charge-offs and non-performing loans in the future couple of quarters are not expected to be very different in the last few quarters. So we\u2019ve got a nice, steady, unfortunately negative, but steady stream northward of both non-performs and charge-offs moving on the 20% to 30%, 35% range linked quarter as you\u2019ve seen for last four or five quarters.", "We are happy to report that, if nothing else it\u2019s very predictable. We\u2019re able to really see well ahead into the 90-days on the consumer side where the modeling has become much more precise. It\u2019s much more measurable as regards to delinquencies becoming \u2013 what percentage of those become charge-offs; which of those go to bankruptcy. We have a much better view on that. So consumer is much more mature in this cycle in terms of credit quality and understanding the future implications.", "I would say commercial and commercial real estate are a little more lumpy in that, as I\u2019ve said in prior quarters, it\u2019s not quite the modeling. It\u2019s more of the deal by deal or the systemic nature of the kind of loans that are going in distress. In our case, because of a significant amount of stress we\u2019ve had in our California housing portfolios last year, we are able to replace some of that. Now that\u2019s matured into something more traditional and old-fashioned C&I and CRE stress that we\u2019re seeing. And both of those will continue to show non-perform first, and then some of those will translate into charge-offs later.", "So I\u2019ll remind the audience that the charge-off nature of the non- perform, particularly commercial real estate where they\u2019re primarily collateralized, it\u2019s not necessarily equal to that of an unsecured credit. And so they\u2019re not equal to that of the stressed consumer credit. So our non-performs are up slightly more than our charge-offs. So I wouldn\u2019t actually read that to believe we\u2019re going to have a higher incidence down the line of charge-offs, more consistent with the prior quarters. And you can pretty much just draw a line as we have done.", "We don\u2019t see anything tempering yet. We don\u2019t see it coming to an end. But we also don\u2019t see any unexpected outcomes that would cause our trajectories to change in the next two quarters.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. So for the next two quarters, we\u2019re going to expect that trajectory line that we\u2019ve been seeing to continue upward at the same pace?", "Richard Davis", "That\u2019s how we\u2019re finding it. And then that bring us to the second part of your question, which we\u2019ll continue to provide reserves to be adequate for those expectations. And I don\u2019t expect us to stop reserve building until which time we see straight in [ph] the reduction not with the continued trajectory northward. And I think we\u2019re going to find loans to start to moderate in that regard late in the year. But for the next couple of quarters, I would expect us to see some reserve build and that we\u2019ll determine the (inaudible) of that as each quarter comes to a conclusion as we have a better view into the next 90 days and the next 180.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Just one last question. Do you think this quarter\u2019s reserve build was abnormally high or next couple of quarters could be similar?", "Richard Davis", "This quarter was a good example of average for the last years. We\u2019ve been between 55% and 100%. Bill, this is 67%. It probably reflects that we think we\u2019re probably in the middle of this whole cycle. And I think that we\u2019ll find something in that same range between 33% and 100% in the next few quarters. But it could be that wide of a range. And we really don\u2019t make that decision until the very end of the quarter Ed, when we have a real good view of the next 90 days.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, John.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Good morning. A couple more credit questions. Commercial real estate and net charge-offs in the non-construction book were better than I expected, and wonder if Bill could get some color on that. And then on construction, you\u2018ve talked in the past about how you\u2019ve gotten ahead of some of the construction credits. Can you enlighten us on where you stand there?", "Bill Parker", "Sure. First I\u2019ll do the construction loans. What we\u2019ve been talking about last year was our California residential mortgage portfolio. This quarter we saw additional stress, not just in California but also in the Pacific Northwest. Obviously, Las Vegas, Phoenix-type areas. In sum \u2013 total of those areas outside of California are not as big as our California exposure but needless to say, the residential construction portfolio remains under stress.", "On the commercial mortgage side, again about half of that \u2013 more than half of that is actually owner-occupied, so really cutting in to our middle market and small business in community lending area. So that\u2019s a fairly stable bulk even in downturn. And then the other mortgage plans, there\u2019s obviously we do have retail, office, et cetera. But those are fairly broadly diversified portfolios; projects throughout our footprint. They\u2019re all recourse [ph].", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "So you expect the trajectory of your overall charge-offs and NTAs to continue on a similar pace? Do you expect some shifting there with the construction slope moderate and then other commercial real estate in C&I pick up a little bit?", "Bill Parker", "Yes. There\u2019ll probably be some of that. But clearly the stress \u2013 the high level of stress will remain in the construction category. And depending upon the length of the downturn, there could be more stress in the mortgage lending area. But so far, that\u2019s been more case by case or the regional basis looking at particular markets, as opposed to broad based.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, Question on the fee based businesses, some of the trends and sensitivities. Richard, you had given some sensitivities both from the payments and wealth management revenues to the economy, consumer spending, and market levels. Based on what you\u2019ve seen so far in the first quarter, do you still feel good about those relationships?", "Richard Davis", "We do. In fact, I\u2019ll give you a little bit more highlight. In the first quarter, the same store sales for the costumers that our payment businesses are aligned with was down 9.6%. To be more specific, North America, which is about three-quarters of our volume was down 9.7%. And Europe was down 9%. That\u2019s 25% of our volume. That is very aligned with what we would expect at our performance in the payment businesses related to consumer small business behavior is down 2.2%. So that reflects that we're gaining some market share and we're still growing the businesses underneath all of that stress.", "And for the second quarter, we forecast that 9% to be very similar for quarter two in our book of business. And if that's the case, we'll probably continue to see a very moderate flatness in the benefits coming from the payment side. But as Andy mentioned in his comments, the pipeline's built. Everything is ready for a higher flow when the economy recovers both here and overseas. We'll see that information translate directly into bottom line and we're really looking forward to that.", "On the trust side, a number of our businesses are aligned directly with the valuations in the market. And as the markets are impaired, that continues to take some of the information directly into the bottom line of our business success. But the like [ph] payment is open and ready to roll when the trust business picks up as a relation to the markets improving. We'll get the benefit on that, too.", "So for the quarter, I was actually played \u2013 a couple of years ago on this call, we we're talking about how our payments and trust businesses, the non-balance sheet businesses were really coming through like gang busters while we dealt with an inverted yield curve and a decreasing margin and spreads on the balance sheet. Now we've got a reverse where the balance sheet businesses are enjoying a yield curve again and amazing growth while the payment businesses and trusts are hanging in there but ready in position for when things turn on. So right now, with two or three cylinders of the four running, I look forward to the day when we have all of them on up and running at the same level.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks. One quick follow up on credit cards. Can you give some color on your outlook for charge-offs in credit card? Maybe relative to employment? Maybe relative to the industry? Are you seeing a performance differential in your book between your partner cards and your generic bank cards?", "Richard Davis", "Bill, why don't you do that?", "Bill Parker", "Yes. First part, the relationship to unemployment, I think it's pretty clear to all of us that card losses do correlate with unemployment. Because of our prime nature of our book we do expect our losses to go up with unemployment but not to the level that I have seen in some of the other bank portfolios. So, it will, it will go up as unemployment rises through the balance of the year.", "With regard to bank brand versus partner brand clearly the bank brand shows higher losses than the co-brand type activities but both portfolios are prime based, and basically have been operating in similar fashion.", "Richard Davis", "Also John, you would notice yet, you'll see it in the 8-K but our total 30 plus delinquencies are up compared to the fourth quarter but there is an improvement in the early stage delinquencies, which caused update certain level of tempered enthusiasm for the fact that the consumer might be starting to get more solid around their ability to manage their debt. And the long term due of that leads to credit card.", "But as you see in our portfolio's performed with the best of all the large portfolios. I expect this to not only continue there but slightly separate itself from further because our consumers are performing quite well during this period. And our ability to restructure and work with them on cases where they need help has been quite successful.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks Richard. Some other banks have talked about that early stage bucket improvement on the 30-day delinquencies and maybe cited seasonality on that. Have you seen any evidence of seasonality there? Or, maybe a little more how to \u2013", "Bill Parker", " \u2013yes, there is. I mean, it is, there is a seasonal influence there. But last year I think the important distinction is last year we really didn't see any lift from the normal factory fund type payments of the seasonality of this year does appear to be actual lift from the seasonality.", "Richard Davis", "Like the old fashioned \u2013", "Bill Parker", " \u2013yes.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Bill Parker", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Good morning, guys. Richard, a question for you. There is a great deal of debate, becoming more heated in Washington, about whether the banks are actually lending or not. Can you just give us your take on this and there seems to be a belief that the banks are not lending, and should be. And this said, what more you can do to increase lending in line with your receipt of TARP funds?", "Richard Davis", "Miss Nancy, I think it's fair to say that it is individual bank related. And I think a lot of banks are lending and some of the, perhaps eight to 20 rules on the larger banks not being as aggressive in the entire period, is what you're seeing.", "In our case, of course, we are lending and we've said that from the beginning. I reflect on yesterday's Wall Street Journal story that showed the February results compared to January where we're shown slightly below the median, and in fact we were down February over January, down by 4.4%.", "To be very specific, our new originations and commitments were up 4.4%. Our commercial real estate was up but our commercial and industrial renewals were down for the month. If you look at the whole quarter, which we'll see eventually, that negative 4.4% was actually 3.6% for quarter one improvement over quarter four. So my first issue is, any one period of time picked at the wrong moment for the wrong optic, does not really, what is a suitable way of determining bank lending.", "In our case, I went through my \u2013 in my early comments, all the net or the gross new loans we've made, but on the net position, this also gives you (inaudible) we're lending more than we did 90 days ago. And if you want to tie that to TARP, I suggest that we're good stories of the investment by the taxpayers. I think we can prove that any give \u2013 any time, under any period, to show that we're robustly making loans.", "But, I will say that probably the most dangerous aspect of that is the number of credit worthy and interested borrowers that exist in this current downturn. And I think it's fair to say that banks, and even the government would make, take a risk by trying to align success of the economic recovery with the amount of lending that's accomplished. Because there's a number of customers who are neither as qualified as they were a year ago nor are they interested in exceeding additional levels of debt.", "So, I think that the banks that are growing in this environment absolutely must be taking market share because I don't think overall there is more lending out of the market place at this stage of the recession. And I think it's fair to say that banks in general, in total, they reflect that and therefore be flat to negative. But individual banks they're actually making where they should be are dismissed as either making it up or not being able to justify their position because there is plenty of lending out there being accomplished.", "I said it 90 days ago, and I'll say it again. And I think any of the customers calling you for, maybe one wells, that we have not denied a single credit worthy customer since the beginning of this downturn for any reasons of either capital or (inaudible), we simply have continued to be prudent with our underwriting as we were many years ago and we're making loans to whoever qualified to meet our terms. And in this case you'll see we're surely we continue to increase quarter over quarter. And you'll see that we've been good stewards of that TARP money.", "I'll also say, too few of my peers mention it, but I will reflect it as well. There is a slowing down of interest in consumer appetite and commercial appetite in the last couple of weeks, maybe the last half of the quarter one. In February-March, we saw a little bit less appetite. So, I think there is a reason to believe that as the cycle matures, people are becoming a little more careful in what they do to extend their balance sheet. I think they're also being a little more careful to become more productive in the time when they need to cut back on costs and rationalize their businesses.", "But for those who are asking for loans, there\u2019s still plenty of money out there and I think the banks are willing to make those loans for all intents and purposes.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Well, I\u2019ve got you. Would you care to update your view of TARP?", "Richard Davis", "Sure. I'm looking forward to learning more about it. As you've all read, and as I know as well, we're expecting a white paper from the government on the, this Friday on the 24th. I'm also led to understand that we'll be getting an individual update sometime and around that time to find out how our performance during the stress test occurred, at which point I'm of the mind I'll learn that I have the chance to rebut any of these findings or confirm those findings. And in early in May, I guess we'll all find out some levels of detail how we performed. I start on the stress test because I do believe that that is the proxy or the gateway to the question on TARP.", "I have indicated before and I\u2019ll remind you all that we would like to pay back our TARP obligation only and after we have permission from our regulator and in the good alignment with what the government wants at the right time. But it's my hope that if the stress test results in positive I think that should first right to then say I'd like to repay the TARP if I may, find out what the terms of that include, what the timing would be. That\u2019s for both our shareholders and for the government, for all the optics to go along with it. And then move forward on that basis to move this company back to independent status. That's my goal.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Nancy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Rochester with FBR Capital Markets.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry if you mentioned this earlier, could you roughly give us the amounts of the larger real estate company loan that went bad, that boosted C&I, NTAs?", "Andy Cecere", "We cited $110 million but that, we can't \u2013", "Richard Davis", "Yes, it was $110 million, David. It was \u2013", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", " \u2013Okay, I apologize. And instead, what \u2013 looking at the rest of the increase there, what specific industries aside from those related to residential construction home building industries would you say made a preponderance of that increase?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, a couple of the areas that we've seen strapped outside that is gaming. We do do gaming credits. We've seen strength in that area. Also, newspapers have been an area of high stress. Those are just couple of the two main industries.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And finally, can you update us on where you see the unemployment rate peaking in terms of timing and level? I know you have mentioned in the next couple of quarters you are looking at a reserve build, and maybe that will be temporary, but after that can you kind of update us on how bad you think the economy will get? And when we'll start to see, you think, we'll start to see a turn?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. We're looking at the unemployment rate near the end of this year hitting between 9% and 10% on the high end of that range but not hitting 10%. And if you look at the performance guidelines that you'll see later on the stress test, they'll be somewhere in between all those same scenarios.", "So I think we've been consistent with what the market is telling us. We haven't built for the Armageddon scenario. We can, but we haven't. And under any circumstances we find ourselves able to be profitable through the cycle and I think what we're looking for, David, is late in the year that starts to peak and then starts to trim back down slowly but surely into 2010. So, we're of the mind that the economy starts to show the possibility of recovery late in the year or early first part year. But we're not building any financial metrics around that to happen until 2010.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from Richard Ramsden with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Richard.", "Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on the restructured loan market. Could you just give us an update on the re-default rates in the restructured loan portfolio? As well us give us a breakdown of how the composition of that portfolio has changed?", "Bill Parker", "Sure. Obviously, most of it is mortgages, the single biggest category that will continue to grow as we continue to work with our client base in trying to prevent foreclosures. What we've looked at is we measure who that we restructured and we've been doing this back beginning in, actually prior to '07, where we restructured the loan and then they eventually go into foreclosure or we have to take a loss or an event like that.", "On that basis we've restructured over 8,000 loans and 12% of those re-entered foreclosure are actually entered foreclosure. And the other \u2013", "Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But then \u2013", "Bill Parker", " \u2013 yes, go ahead.", "Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, sir. On the re-default rates that you've seen, how are those evolving? Because you've been \u2013you've been conducting the program long enough now that you, I assume you've got some good data on how the re-default rates are evolving.", "Bill Parker", "Right. In the cumulative re-default rates, 12%. But you maybe speaking about the vintage impact of that, because obviously we went through the restructured most recently and not yet have the potential to go into foreclosure. So, if you look at some of the older vintages, it differs by portfolios. We have some restructured types that have maxed out at around that 12% range. Some of the older vintages get up to 20% or 30% range, depending upon the program.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, Richard, this is Richard. We've \u2013 you've all read about and heard from the OCP about their recent findings that re-default rates are higher for loans where the payment went up even if the payment was precluded from going up higher. We've seen that same early incident that those with payments going up perform less positively than those with flat payments or reduced payments. And in the course of that, that's early warning. And we're working now to evaluate our go forward approach to make sure that we take that thing, guide it, and keep payments flat or reduce payments, for those restructured credits so that we don't have a long term re-default problem that may not have shown itself yet.", "Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that's great. And then the second question I wanted to ask is on deposit pricing trends. It looks as if that's now become a little bit more rational but it would be just helpful to get your perspective on how that's changed, I guess, in the last couple of months?", "Andy Cecere", "Richard, this is Andy. And your statement is correct. What we've seen is some of the more irrational price \u2013 deposit pricers are not in the marketplace any longer. I would say the large banks are pricing in the similar band that is rational and reasonable. There are still a few outliers, principally smaller banks. But I would say that it has rationalized quite a bit in the last quarter.", "Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.", "Andy Cecere", "You bet.", "Richard Davis", "Rachel, anybody else?", "Operator", "That concludes the Q&A session.", "Richard Davis", "Well, let me just thank you guys for joining our call. And I guess on one hand I'm completely more proud of the fact that I hope you appreciate the simple, transparent nature of our earnings. It's a little old fashioned except for the fact that loan losses and provision continue to be a question mark that, throughout \u2013 we have our board meetings then our annual shareholder meeting and we're going to declare once again that, without a lot of noise and fanfare, we're just kind of a basic old fashioned bank going through a cycle, able to earn through it under any circumstances, and pleased to see that underneath all that we're building some very strong momentum for a future that will be quite robust for our shareholders, as the credit world finds itself more settled in the coming quarters and coming years.", "So, thank you for that support. If you have any questions we'll be \u2013 certainly have the answer later today.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. If anyone has any questions please feel free to call me at 6123030783. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, this does conclude today\u2019s US Bancorp first quarter 2009 earnings conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cecere, US Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions)", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon eastern time through Wednesday, July 29 at 12 midnight eastern time. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for US Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you, Michael and good morning to everyone listening to the call today. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me to review US Bancorp\u2019s second quarter 2009 results, and to answer your questions. If you have not received a copy of our earnings release and supplemental analyst\u2019s schedule, they are available on our Web site at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Andy and I would begin the call today with a short review of US Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results. After we have completed our brief formal remarks, we will open the line for questions from the audience.", "Since our last earnings call, a number of significant events have occurred that have impacted our investors and our customers, as well as our company as a whole. I would like to take a moment to summarize those events before Andy and I review the details of our second quarter financial results.", "On May 8, the results of the SCAP supervisory capital program or stress test were released. As we announced US Bancorp passed the stress test. I am also very proud to say that we ranked the best among our peers in the category of Resources to Absorb Losses to Risk-Weighted Assets and Total Loan Loss Rates. On May 11, w announced a $2.5 billion common stock offering and $1 billion non-guaranteed debt issuance.", "The capital raised was not prompted by the results of the stress test, but rather by our company\u2019s desire to redeem the $6.6 billion of preferred stock issued to the US treasury under the capital purchase programs and a move forward from a position of strategic flexibility and dependence.", "The issuance of the non-guaranteed debt was also required to qualify to repay the TARP fund. We were very pleased with the outcome of this issuance, as it was completed at the best pricing of any other peer bank debt issuance up to that date, and was a testament to the credit quality of our institution. Both the common stock offering, which raised $2.7 billion of capital and the debt issuance were successfully completed in one day.", "On June 17 we announced that we had redeemed the $6.6 billion of TARP funds and finally, on July 15th, announced that we completed our participation in the program by repurchasing the warrant issued in conjunction with the TARP funds for $139 million. A successful exit from the TARP program validates the strength of US Bancorp.", "We are grateful for the support of the taxpayers and the regulators during our participation in the program and we are now looking forward to capitalizing on our position as one of the largest independent banks in the country.", "While we were managing through these corporate events, the rest of the company continued to run business as usual, and produce strong core operating earnings in what can only be described as a very stressed economic environment. US Bancorp recorded net income of $471 million for the second quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.12 cents.", "Once again we achieved record total net revenue this quarter and it was driven by growth in both net interest income and fee revenue, the latter of which was led by mortgage banking activity. Although core operating earnings were strong, significantly higher credit costs, including the costs of building the allowance for credit losses to reflect existing economic conditions and higher FDIC insurance costs resulted in earnings that were lower than the second quarter of 2008 and the previous quarter.", "Significant items impacting the company\u2019s second quarter earnings per share included an FDIC special assessment of $123 million, accelerated amortization of the discount or deemed dividend of $154 million associated with the TARP preferred stock redemption, net securities losses of $19 million, and $466 million of provision expense in excess of net charge-offs. In total, significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share in the second quarter by approximately $0.34 cents.", "Our performance metrics were impacted by these significant items with a return on average offset in the quarter of 0.71% and the return on average common equity of 4.2%. Excluding the significant items I just noted, return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been 1.41% and 15.9% respectively.", "As I stated, our company continued to perform well this quarter on an operating basis, and I would like to review a few of the financial highlights that impacted these results. First, we recorded strong overall growth in total average loans year-every-year. Total average loans outstanding increased by $20.8 billion or 12.8% with growth in all major categories. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, total average loans on a core basis grew by over 5% year-over-year.", "On a linked quarter basis, total average loans decreased by 1%. This linked decrease in average loans outstanding was principally due to the reduction in commitment utilization. Specifically, the average rate of commitment utilization by our corporate and commercial borrowers declined from an average of slightly over 37% in the first quarter of 2009 to slightly under 35% in the second quarter.", "The decline also reflected an overall softening of demand for new loans by our customers, both commercial and consumer as they maintained a cautious outlook on the economy and their own growth opportunities. We are, however, continuing to originate and renew new lines and loans for our current and new customers.", "In fact, during the second quarter of 2009, US banks originated over $16 million of residential mortgages, another record quarter for US bank home mortgage. We originated over $4 billion of consumer loans, including installment loans, student loans, lines of credit and home equity lines and loans. We originated new prime based credit card accounts with lines totaling $2.5 billion.", "We issued almost $9 billion of new commitments and renewed over $16 billion of commitments to small businesses, commercial and commercial real estate customers. Overall, new originations plus new and renewed commitments were over 12% higher than in the previous quarter.", "As I stated at the time we announced the redemption of our TARP preferred stock, we continued to look forward supporting the government\u2019s efforts to maintain the flow of credit in these stressful economic times. We will continue to be responsive to the borrowing needs of our current and new creditworthy customers, and more importantly, we had the capacity to do so.", "Another highlight of the second quarter results was our outstanding growth in total average deposits. Total average deposit increased by $27.4 billion or 20.2% over the same quarter last year and $2.7 billion 1.7% un-annualized on a linked quarter basis. Without acquisitions the year-over-year growth was a very strong 11.2%.", "We continue to be one of the highest rated financial institutions in the country with our lead bank U.S. Bank National Association rated AA1 by Moody\u2019s, AA minus by S&P, AA minus by Fitch and AA high by [BVR]. These ratings have given us a significant advantage as our customers make the decision as to where they should bank and where they should place their trust.", "The excellent growth in the average deposits further illustrates that our company is benefiting from the uncertainty in the financial market and the flight to quality that consumers and businesses that are looking for a safe, stable and sound financial institution.", "As I previously mentioned, the company reported record total revenue in the second quarter. A major contributor to this success was mortgage banking, which also produced record selling revenue with increases year-over-year and linked quarter of $227 million and $75 million respectively.", "The growth in mortgage banking revenue reflected higher origination fees, servicing revenue and a favorable change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and that of economic hedging activity, the latter which had a positive impact on revenue this quarter. Record mortgage production of $16.3 billion was significantly higher than both the same quarter of 2008 and of the prior quarter.", "Finally, I would like to draw your attention to non-interest expense, which was impacted by the special FDIC assessment and overall increasing the rate of insurance coverage, partially offset by benefits from the implementation of the company\u2019s cost containment plan in late January.", "Year-over-year excluding impact of acquisitions and incremental cost of FDIC insurance, total non-interest expense increased by less than 1%. The $258 million increase in expense on a linked quarter basis was the result of the increase in FDIC expense, as well as seasonally adjusted higher operating expense, and a national marketing campaign, partially offset by the company\u2019s cost saving efforts.", "Our efficiency ratio as reported for the second quarter of 2009 was 51.0%. Excluding the FDIC special assessment the efficiency ratio was 48.0%. We continue to be one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry. And I am pleased to report that we achieved positive core operating leverage this quarter on a year-over-year basis.", "Now moving on to credit; as I pointed out earlier, an increase in credit costs including the cost of building the allowance for credit losses drove the year-over-year reduction in the company\u2019s net income. Net charge-offs of $929 million were 17.9% higher than the first quarter of 2009. A lower percentage increase than we experienced in the previous quarters.", "The increase in net charge-offs once again reflected the continued stress in residential home and mortgage-related industries, and the impact of the worsening economy on both our retail and commercial customers. Also, and as expected, nonperforming assets increased this quarter. The rate of increase at 17.8% was however; lower than the past number of quarters.", "At June 30th, the total nonperforming assets were $4.016 billion compared with $3.410 billion at March 31. Included in total nonperforming assets were $682 million of loans and other real estate covered by a loss-share agreement with the FDIC in conjunction with our two California acquisitions. There is a minimal amount of potential loss in these loans, given the terms of the agreement with the FDIC. ", "Excluding these covered assets, the majority of increase in nonperforming loans within the core bank portfolio was related to residential mortgage and residential construction-related industries, as well as other commercial real estate lending.", "Restructured loans that continued to accrue interest rose by 10.8% as the company continues to work with customers to renegotiate loan terms, enabling them to keep their homes. Since 2008, including loans serviced for others, we have modified over 15,800 residential mortgage loans totaling approximately $3.5 billion. These efforts are consistent with the government\u2019s objective to restore the housing markets and are aimed to retain the value of these relationships for our shareholders.", "As expected, given the upward trends of both net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, in addition to the continued weakness in the economy, we increased the allowance for our loan loss this quarter by recording an incremental provisions for loan losses in excess of net charge-offs of $466 million. This represents approximately 50% of the current quarter\u2019s total net charge-offs of $929 million.", "With this addition, the company\u2019s allowance for credit losses to periods-end loans, excluding covered assets was 2.66% compared with 2.37% at March 31 and the ratio of allowance to nonperforming loans excluding covered assets was 152%.", "As we look ahead 90 days, we anticipate continued growth in both net charge-off and nonperforming assets. However, we expect the rate of growth to trend lower. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase the allowance for loan losses until our credit quality has stabilized and we have consistent evidence that net charge-offs levels are leveling off or declining.", "We will continue to assess the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and provide for credit losses at a level that reflects changes in the credit risk of the portfolio and the current economic conditions.", "Finally, and importantly, our capital positions remain strong. Our Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 9.4% and 13.0% respectively at June 30, both comfortably above the well capitalized bubble as defined by the regulators.", "Additionally our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 6.7% from 5.4% at March 31, and our tangible common equity to tangible assets rose from 3.8% at March 31 to 5. 1% on June 30. All these ratios benefited from the recent $2.7 million capital issuance and positive earnings. Let me now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Richard. Overall the company\u2019s second quarter results reflected the quality of our core franchise and its earnings power. And I would like to provide you with a few more details. I\u2019ll begin with a quick summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our second quarter results to prior periods.", "First non-interest income included $19 million in securities losses. Included in this total were $88 million of impairment charges on securities including perpetual preferred securities, our SIV exposure and a few agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. These impairment charges were partially offset by gains and securities sold during the quarter of $69 million.", "Second, other non-interest expense in the second quarter included a pre-tax $123 million charge for an FDIC special assessment that will be paid in the third quarter.", "Third diluted earnings per share was reduced by the impact of $154 million deemed dividend, associated with the repayment of the TARP funds and finally, we recorded an incremental provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $466 million in the second quarter.", "These significant items in the second quarter reduced diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.34 cents. For comparison purposes during the second quarter of 2008, the company recorded $63 million in securities losses.", "Additionally, results in the second quarter of 2008 included an incremental provision for credit losses of $200 million. The net impact of the second quarter 2008 significant items reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.11 cents.", "Finally non-interest income in the first quarter of 2009 included $198 million in security losses, a $92 million gain on a corporate real estate transaction. The prior quarter also included an incremental provision expense of $530 million. Together, these significant items reduced first quarter 2009 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.28.", "As Richard mentioned at the beginning of the call, we repurchased the warrant issued as part of the TARP program for $139 million on July 15th. This payment will not have an impact in earnings the third quarter as the payment represents a direct reduction in equity. The payment will result in a nominal reduction in our Tier 1 and total capital ratios of approximately 6 basis points.", "Now, a few comments about operating earnings. Net interest income in the second quarter was 10.3% higher than the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to a strong 10.5% increase in average earning assets. As projected, net interest margin for the quarter was 3.60%, one basis point higher than the previous quarter or in other words relatively stable.", "Our outlook for the net interest margin hasn\u2019t changed. Going forward, assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we continue to expect net interest margin to remain relatively stable.", "Total non-interest income in the current quarter was higher year-over-year, primarily due to strong mortgage banking revenue as well as favorable variances in net securities losses, commercial product revenue, ATM processing revenue and treasury management fees. The growth in both, commercial product revenue and treasury management fees reflected the company\u2019s ongoing revenue initiatives.", "Payment related revenue, trust and investment management fees, as well as deposit service charges and investment products fees and commissions declined year-over-year, adversely impacted by the slowing economy and unfavorable equity market conditions. These revenue categories, particularly payments in trust and investment management, however are positioned to rebound as the economy strengthens and the equity market stabilized.", "Within non-interest income, other income was lower year-over-year, primarily due to an unfavorable variance in equity investment income, which was partially offset by lower end-of-term lease residual losses. Strong mortgage banking revenue and seasonally higher payments related revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit services charges, treasury management fees, all contributed to the growth in non-interest income, excluding significant items of $180 million on a linked-quarter basis.", "Additionally, the other income category benefited from the lower end-of-term losses on auto leases. As we indicated in our last call in January, the end-of-term losses on retail auto leases peaked in the third quarter of 2008 at $84 million, as a number of cars coming off-lease began to decline. End-of-term losses in the second quarter of 2009 were down to $14 million.", "Finally, excluding the increase in FDIC insurance costs and acquisitions, non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year, again demonstrating the company\u2019s ability to control expense at a level appropriate for the current operating environment.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. The past few months have been anything but ordinary for our company. We have been operating in one of the most challenging economic environments in our country\u2019s history. We completed and passed the regulatory stress test. We raised $2.7 billion of new common equity, redeemed $6.6 billion of preferred stock and subsequently completed the repurchase of the related warrant.", "Working against this extraordinary event as a backdrop, our company posted record net revenue, maintained a control expense environment, continued to lend and gather deposits and preserved the strength of our credit ratings and capital base.", "As we move forward, we will continue to build our franchise, enhance our products and services and engage and develop our employees. In other words, we will capitalize on our now unique position of strength and independence to further differentiate U.S. Banc from its competitors.", "In fact, in early July we launched a nationwide ad campaign to reinforce those methods to our current and future customers as well as all of our financial partners. We felt this is the opportune time to further build brand awareness for our company in a distinctive position as one of the nation\u2019s largest independent financial institution.", "Our focus on revenue generation continues with an emphasis on building deeper relationship with our customers. For example, 39 weeks into our relationship review initiative, we\u2019ve held over 6,700 meetings with clients and have identified almost 9000 opportunities to increase share of wallet, which translates into potential incremental annual revenue of almost $400 million.", "On the revenue side, approximately 10% of our households have now signed up for a relationship deepening package or product that provide our customers the superior value and create more value for our shareholders. While focusing on these another new revenue-producing initiative, we remain poised to capture the many opportunities that will present themselves as the financial markets and the worldwide economy recovers.", "We expect to continue to be among the best performers in the industry, as our diversified mix of businesses, longstanding prudent approach to risk, dedicated employees and the strength of our balance sheet enable us to manage and even prosper in this period of unsurpassed economic stress.", "In conclusion, our second quarter results reaffirmed that our fundamental businesses remain strong, although credit cards remain and will remain elevated in the near-term; we are open for business and managing this company for the long-term.", "As we continue to prudently lend to creditworthy borrowers, judiciously invest in and grow our franchise, support our communities, serve our customers, and importantly create value for our shareholders by sustaining our earnings power, high quality balance sheet and capital strength.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill Parker and I will now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "The past few quarters, I think you have been a little bit more explicit your charge-off guidance and this time you\u2019re just saying will remain elevated. Any comments you want to give in terms of what elevated might mean? I mean up another 15%, 20% flattish?", "Richard Davis", "As I told you in the quarters before this we were always projecting that we would see pretty much flat results from the prior quarters and then last time we met 90 days ago, we said that we start to see that coming down. In other words the trajectory of the increase would come down. I\u2019d expect that the trajectory you saw coming down in this quarter from prior quarters will continue in that same direction in the future quarter.", "In other words we are starting to see this continued reduction in increase becoming now a more consistent outcome. So, if you like what you saw between quarters one and two, I think you\u2019ll start to see the same trajectory follow in quarters two to three.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "So, charge-off closed to slow, and that would apply to NPAs as well or [it will be tough there]?", "Richard Davis", "We\u2019d do both. So, that both moving in, not exact lock step, but both moving in the direction the same way. It\u2019s a fairly positive outcome.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Just in general like if we think they picture here you\u2019ve managed the risk well on the market disruption in the first part of the cycle, consumer credit, the second part. I have some folks out there, very much out there, pretty concerned on the C&I and the commercial real estate.", "Two questions one, what\u2019s your outlook for those loan buckets in general? Two, has there been a meaningful difference in underwriting at USB versus others the last several years?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I want Bill to answer the specifics, but I\u2019ll tell you I think we are continuing to enjoy the benefits of the many years of not stretching to make loans to C&I and commercial real estate customers. I think you\u2019d agree as what we told; we were the last large bank into the recession in terms of credit distress. ", "I predict that we\u2019ll be the first out because that longevity of longstanding prudence is going to pay us dividends. You\u2019ll see that we are stressing like everyone else. I think you\u2019ll continue to see our peaks and valleys will be muted compared to others. Bill wants to bring some color on that.", "Bill Parker", "Sure. On the C&I portfolios the mid markets and corporate portfolios, the only areas that have been problematic there are the newspapers, media and gaming type industries, where you see higher leverage points. ", "We do not have a large leveraged portfolio. So, our core middle market and corporate is actually holding up pretty well. They have taken the correct actions to weather the storm. Small business, of course sees some stress in its environment, but overall C&I is holding up pretty well.", "On commercial real estate, we talked about residential construction for a long time now, almost two years into this. What began in California and our outstanding there now $2.7 billion is down from over $4 billion before. So, that is an area that\u2019s going to continue to be stressed and we are continuing to work through it.", " I think I mentioned last time, it\u2019s moved into the Pacific Northwest, where we also have bolder exposure, but the loss varied there, not as bad as we have seen in California.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay and then just lastly, Richard if we look at commercial loan demand, it seems like it falling off the cliff both for you guys, which is the industry in general. I guess from a broader point of view it is the positive because customers are paying down debt or is it a negative because it implies for the cuts now put in staff.", "Richard Davis", "I think let\u2019s see could it be both, because it feels like both. I think it\u2019s a positive in terms of bank\u2019s balance sheet not taking on customers that will fall into further stress with this kind of duration of this downturn. In our case the reason I highlighted the majority of our decrease in linked quarter outstandings was the derivative of our hoping to buy commitment was to show that the demand is still there for the right customers and as you know 12.8% in linked quarter origination.", "Those who have the money have the availability to use their money, have really restructured the way they run their business and they\u2019re simply not hoping to buy loans in line. So, I believe that the demand overall for the stronger customers is reflected what you\u2019d expected a year, year-and-a-half into recession, where they permanently reset their capital expenditures some of their growth objectives and not using as much of the bank\u2019s balance sheet or their own frankly to grow.", "So, I think that it\u2019s a normal outcome at this point in the cycle. I think it\u2019s good for banks if we continue to be prudent as an industry and not reach to get loan growth by reducing our underwriting. Certainly won\u2019t do that at this company. As I have told you before because of our strong operating earnings, we will compete on price for the AAA customers, in order to either keep our own or to go get someone else\u2019s.", "In fact our margin stability it probably reflects, that we probably could have a little margin increase, but we want to give it back in the form of high quality customer attraction. So, I think it\u2019s probably both demand in terms of the economy is not very good news for the banks.", "I think those who stay pure at their underwriting, you\u2019ll see the demand is the biggest reflection of why a loan growth isn\u2019t prominent across the industry. I think that\u2019s probably a good sign, we are not reaching trying to do something we shouldn\u2019t do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Najarian - Isi Group.", "Ed Najarian - Isi Group", "Just couple of questions, first quickly, can you quantify the net gain in the evaluation of mortgage servicing rights net of any hedges?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, let me give you the hedge number. The hedge gain, year-over-year, so in the second quarter of 2009, it was a positive $45 million, Ed. In the first quarter of 2009, it was a positive $2 million and in the second quarter of 2008 it was a negative $25 million. So, on a year-over-year basis the improvement in the hedge was $70 million.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group", "Okay, but this quarter, the number that impacted revenue positively was $45 million?", "Andy Cecere", "That is correct. Then with regard to the remainder of the mortgage improvements, I would say two-thirds of it was rate-related and one-third of it was volume-related.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group", "Okay. Thanks. And then secondarily, any comments on early-stage delinquencies? Looks like we are seeing a little bit less stability on early-stage consumer delinquencies from you guys and maybe we have seen it some other banks.", "Bill Parker", "Yeah, we did see some improvement. Our card portfolio was down 30 plus, I would say 30 plus, it was down 43 basis points in the last 90 days. So that is good for our outlook on the third quarter. On autos, our auto portfolios both are leasing and loan portfolios showed a little bit of decline one to five basis points decline on the 30 to 30 plus. At least that was stable. ", "Last year it was still trending up. And then finally, on our small ticket leasing portfolio, their delinquencies came down about 50 basis points. So that was positive as well. So we have seen a little bit of more normal, seasonal uptick, or improvement in delinquency patterns.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group", "But in terms of mortgage and home equity, I guess that is a bigger portfolio?", "Bill Parker", "That is a little more mix on the late stage on both mortgage and home equity. We did see improvement but we did see an uptick some in some of early stage.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group", "You are still looking at those numbers and feeling confident that at both NPAs and charge-offs can increase at a slower pace, it sounds like?", "Bill Parker", "Correct.", "Richard Davis", "And this is Richard. If there anything we\u2019ve gotten good at is, it is modeling forecasting and stress testing again our own forecast. And if there is anything that I am comfortable with, it is our ability to predict 30 days for sure and now 90 days with a certain high level of certainty. ", "There is always a lumpiness where you can have a deal of large customer come out of nowhere with a surprise. We\u2019re going to at least down the table there is a possibility, but in terms of the mechanics of the consumer, the home equity, the mortgage, those are very much annuities, you can get a pretty good line of sight of now 90 days.", "Commercial and commercial real estate a little lumpier, but when you know your portfolio like we know ours, we have a high level of confidence in our ability to predict that and I said this to you guys two years ago. ", "We\u2019ll always tell you the bad news clearly and honestly and transparently and when the news starts to get good, our hope with the responses if you\u2019ll believe us then too. And we are not seeing [all green shoots] and we are not seeing the end of the road here but we are starting to see in our portfolio a new, repetitive improvement in overall performance of our credit.", "We are starting to see that as first a decrease in the increase of negativity, and over the course of time, I think we will be one of the first to be at the top of the hill and get on the other side.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group", "Okay thanks and then Richard, you have paid back the TARP and strengthened your capital ratios. Can you give us a sense of your M&A appetite at this point in the cycle?", "Richard Davis ", "Sure. It is no difference firsts of all because of those other activities. Those are just nice variables to have behind us. The M&A activity interest remains the same, Ed. We are first and foremost interested in payment businesses and his corporate trust businesses that would add quickly to the scale and value of those businesses that right now are being impaired by the recession, but will come back with [gangbusters] when things get better. ", "In terms of acquisitions, we will always be available to the FDIC list of opportunities that come along weekly. But we also are going to keep our powder dry for an opportunity that may be above of more significant nature like the Downey PFF or something like that. ", "So I am not going to do a lot of the Bank of Idaho\u2019s a lot of the small five and ten branch deals unless they are amazingly opportune. But otherwise we will stay on the sidelines. We will watch for a larger FDIC opportunity and in the old fashioned sense of acquisitions that continues to be a very slow, quiet process, given the new results of the SCAP and everything else.", "So we are probably in the near-term going to remain on the sidelines, and watch and see the good things come along and be able to be opportunistic when and if it happens. But nothing transformational and nothing outside of the bounds that we have been talking about for the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, good morning. Couple of other questions on the early-stage delinquency. You indicated those have been improving in a couple of asset classes. And I guess I\u2019m wondering where you fall out with regard to the debate on why they are coming down. Some folks are kind of suggesting it is still seasonality.", "Others saying its just slow down and unemployment rate, growth rate or the jobless claims and then another angle is, is mismanagement, doing a better job managing or having an impact on managing these early-stage delinquencies. When you look at your portfolio, what are the drivers there?", "Bill Parker", "I would have to say after seeing fourth quarter and first quarter, going through very rapid deterioration in the number of portfolios, part of it is that we have completely upped our protocol on the collection areas and that does make a difference. ", "Also, I think it is more a return of just to some normal, seasonal patterns, which were not here before while the economy was deteriorating rapidly. So we expect, as the unemployment continues to rise, card losses will over time go up again but third quarter is normally a decent quarter for card losses.", "Richard Davis", "Betsy for your benefit, we have an unemployment expectation of slightly over 10% by year end with a continued increase in 2010. So w are not sitting here thinking, I don\u2019t think outside of the bounds of what others are expecting. As you all know a few basis points increase in unemployment, it\u2019s like the [retro scale]. It\u2019s not linear.", "So, it\u2019s a big deal and we appreciate how to stretch out our portfolios, but for the most part, our unsecured portfolios are planned only and our collateral portfolios are well written to low loan to value. So whether it\u2019s impairment in the beginning or an absolute loss, I think we are going to fare quite well.", "On the housing side, we are also expecting an additional 5% to 10% drop in housing values, which at the end of that process will be peak to a drop of around 40% fall. Our expectations are so far aligned with that the mix of business we have across our primarily 24 states would reflect that that\u2019s not going to be above the average for the national, but probably near or at about that same level. So, I think we are in the range of expectations that some of the economists would predict as well.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then on deposits and deposit growth did a great job with core deposits this quarter. I\u2019m sure that this is in part the reflection of the efforts that you\u2019ve had with your branch strategies, but could you speak to where you think the jumbo CDs are, relative to last quarter? I mean obviously they are down a lot, but is that kind of an exiting of low risk strategy or did you price to get those folks out?", "Andy Cecere", "Our pricing strategy on the retail side is to focus on core checking and savings accounts. That\u2019s where we are certainly a bit more aggressive. Not at the top of the peer group but in the middle of the peer group. So that\u2019s been our focus in growing core accounts and we\u2019ve been successful with regard to that.", "On the wholesale side, we\u2019ve had volatility up and down. That\u2019s more of a function of liquidity on the wholesale customers, but I would say overall, both in terms of wholesale and retail, we\u2019ve had strong deposit growth. I think it is a function of the flight-to-quality and the reputation of our company.", "Richard Davis", "I know you followed us for a long time. It is one of the advantages that this downturn created for y US Banks with a chance to get back into the competitive game for pricing on core deposits. As you know, we were probably at the bottom two years ago. ", "We are now very competitive, but just because we are competitive for core I want you to know we still don\u2019t attract hot money. We don\u2019t like it. We don\u2019t know what to do with it. It is not consistent and repeatable and so you just won\u2019t see us using our margin to attract on rates on any basis, where customers don\u2019t bring the rest of the relationship.", "So we stay true to that, but we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be able to keep this strong margin at the same time how we redefine ourselves as a competitive deposits, comprised of core deposits will not help as well as the flight to quality.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Rochester with FBR Capital Markets.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "It sounds like your economic expectations may be a little bit weaker than they were in the last call, at least in terms of what you are looking for from the unemployment rate perspective, but you are still looking for a deceleration in the growth in NPAs and charge-offs.", "Would you say that that\u2019s largely predicated on what you are seeing in the early stage delinquency side because you are seeing the dip there you are thinking that the rate of growth should slow?", "Richard Davis", "I\u2019ll let Bill answer technically. We don\u2019t spend, it is not all modeling. We know our customers. We know them very well. NPAs are usually a proxy for future charge-offs. ", "There are lots of regulatory reviews and has a lot to do with capital allocation and those are all what we all know them to be, but we really want to know at the end of the day which of those NPAs would be a proxy for charge-off and which unsecured loans, primarily consumer lots should go to charge-off and that has a lot to do with delinquencies in first and late stage has a lot to do just knowing the quality of your portfolio. ", "We have a got a very high sensitivity to whom we lend our money to and how we\u2019ve done it. I would say it is a blend between the statistics, David and what we know about our company. It would be very easy for me to take a very safe road and tell you that is going to be another many, many quarters of the same, 25% to 30% increase in both NPAs and charge-offs. We just don\u2019t see that. ", "We could be surprised like anyone else, but our backset which has served us very well. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been wrong on any of our 90 day projections in this whole cycle are based on a lot of data, a lot more than just unemployment, housing and delinquencies.", "Bill Parker", "I think the other thing I would mention is that we are potentially prime-based lenders. And the early part of this economic downturn was really more market disruption, capital market disruption and unique events. Now, we are entering a phase that looks more like a normal recession that is not severe, but that has less of a dramatic impact than some of the things that occurred earlier on in this downturn.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "Have you noticed any change at all, potentially improvement in the re-default rates that you are seeing in your restructured portfolio? Have you seen any meaningful contributions, or more notable I should say contributions growth in this bucket in the C&I or CRE products?", "Andy Cecere", "I\u2019ll do the residential mortgages first because I\u2019m guessing that is what you are asking about. Our re-default rates there we do modifications, of course, for all of our mortgage portfolios, first mortgage portfolios. We have a measure of 60-day default rate and right now, that is at about 22%. We also measure it based on who reenter or enters foreclosures and that is at about 12%.", "We take steps to improve that all the time. We increased significantly the number of malls that we do, where the payment actually decreases. We have doubled the percentage there up to about two out of three of them now, where the payment increases. So, that should make the future performance even better. Additionally, we are entering into the [SCAP] program this quarter that\u2019s the administration new program. That should help too.", "On the commercial or commercial real estate side, we don\u2019t have a lot of TDRs there. Generally, we\u2019ll try to work with the borrowers. The credits will go into A, if it\u2019s a real estate deal. We\u2019ll get charges down to great value.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "I was wondering if you have an outlook on the net interest income growth it seems that the margin flat and loan demand being rose a bit, it going to be hard to grow net interest income at least in the near-term. Do you have some views there?", "Richard Davis", "John, we do expect relatively stable margin. On the earning asset front, I want to separate wholesale from retail a little bit. On the retail side, we\u2019d expect flattish to some moderate growth, which is what you say in this quarter.", "On the wholesale side a lot depends upon the utilization that we talked about. We are booking new loans with gaining new customers. The offset is what the utilization would do. I would expect that to be flat to down. So, those two things may offset, that the bottom line from all that is maybe flattish net interest income.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "How about on the securities portfolio, Andy I guess you assumed that will be pretty flattish?", "Andy Cecere", "I\u2019d not expect major changes there. What you see in the last few quarters, what you should expect in the next few quarters.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "You guys are pretty specific about the credit outlook. How about our reserve build for the last couple of quarters you building at 50% to 100% of charge-offs and it\u2019s a little below that this quarter. What kind of outlook would you have there?", "Richard Davis", "Well, 50, is in our history. So, we\u2019ve got 50, 67, 75 and 100. I just like round numbers very divisible by something. 50, is on the low end of that six quarter range, but its still in it. I think those suppose to be right at 50 today. So, we are trying to telegraph that we are the low end of the sixth quarter trailing circumstances.", "I guess what I think, John, is if we start to see a continuation of the kind of trends we saw this quarter, and that continues to bear out, as I said in my comments, they need to be sustained and convincing. We\u2019ll start to move that 50% down to 40% or 30% or 25%. Eventually we\u2019ll get down to very close to where we only I think reserve build for the growth that we expect in the portfolio, which would be very nominal.", "I\u2019m going to be careful. I want us to have all the reserves built possible so when recovery is among us, we don\u2019t have to take any of the earnings away from that recovery in order to continue to backfill on reserves and we started this cycle as one of the strongest balance sheets I promised you every quarter we ended. ", "You\u2019ll see us be generous on provision that we will also telegraph our views of the future by the way we start to move that down, when it finally starts to happen.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "So, the credit outlook plays out as you expect with the growth rate moderating in both NPAs and charge- offs. We should see that reserve build magnitude starts to at least stay at the 50 and maybe go down from 50?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, it has a positive vibe to getting smaller. We didn\u2019t talk about it. That has a lot to do with if you like where you are at the moment in time. We do like our coverage ratios. I must say, we are adequately reserved. That\u2019s the appropriate way to find it.", "I like the way we are satisfactorily adequate and so I think we are at a place we like if it so, if that\u2019s the only variable and that starts to become loan forecasting, loan loss forecasting, NPAs and those become favorably bias and I think so too will the reserve be.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Particularly if the loan book is not growing, all that much?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, although we want to grow. I mean I\u2019m hoping those commitments just the recovery. The best thing to about open commitments and you noticed were 35%, that we will get better in our high quality customers decide to start drawing on our loans right away. That\u2019s the easiest. That\u2019s loan growth you\u2019re going to get because I know the quality of our portfolio, we\u2019ll take that all day long. I think you\u2019ll see a growing balance sheet as well, but I think you\u2019ll see at the prime level that we have had in the past.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Then the last thing is with TARP repaid, there is still some uncertainty I guess about maybe new regulatory regimes. What capital ratios will you guys manage to and which metric system will look for you to manage to?", "Andy Cecere", "We have two principal targets that we have talked about. John one is the Tier 1 cap one level. As you know historically we have been targeting 8.5%. We\u2019ve raised capital actually to get above 9% given the current environment. I\u2019d expect this to be continue to be above 9% and then about two-thirds at a just over two-thirds being Tier 1 common. So, the ratios that you see now would be consistent with what we manage to in the future.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "You like that two-thirds of total Tier 1 being common? Is that a good perhaps, okay?", "Andy Cecere", "I do, at least two-thirds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush - NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "A question for the future, assuming there is going to be one. Could you clarify what the regulatory input is that you\u2019re getting on reserves, when we come to the end of this credit cycle? In other words, are you going to be able to draw down reserves as we did in past cycles or are the regulators going to expect reserve levels to stay high?", "Richard Davis", "We have had no guidance on that. I have to report because we have had no reason to have conversation in any of the last two years on any quarter with our selection of both reserve bills and our adequate coverage. So, we don\u2019t have the dialog even to reflect back on and what kind of guidance they are giving.", "I will tell you from my perspective and what I know and what I\u2019m affected by. I think that we all agree that the capital ratios will be higher in a pro-cyclical world than they were going into it and I think we are going to be required to keep both capital -- I\u2019m sorry and loan loss reserves at a higher level.", "I also think that in the future when I talk to you about loan growth being 10% forecasted growth that we are going to have to apply a 110% loan loss reserve built, all things being equal, so we are starting to build for our future book.", "I have no conversations though to record with anybody here on any guidance whatsoever. I just think the prevailing wind is on a pro-cyclical basis. All of us at banks will have higher capital requirements, higher loan loss requirements and we will be paying insurance premiums for many years forward, all of which were at lower levels or nonexistent going into this cycle. So that is all I know.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "So your view is that the emphasis on the regulatory basis will swing from this anti-cyclical to a pro-cyclical emphasis going forward?", "Richard Davis", "Yes pro-cyclical is a funny definition, but I think what you meant is that there will be, if I can, vis-\u00e0-vis the old SunTrust argument they had too much. I think there will still be a tight balance where we can have the appropriate level, but I don\u2019t think anyone is going to argue that more is worse than less, but it is going to be important that we don\u2019t build reserves to use for future earnings because that is just bad business and it doesn\u2019t give you our shareholders a clear line of sight on real earnings. ", "So I think there will be a lot more guidance coming out as it becomes clear that the recovery is ending and the banks will no longer look on linked quarter that will say, are you at the right place and we\u2019ll probably get that definition, I am going to guess, in a couple of quarters but we have not seen them yet.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay. And just on the capital front Richard, could you just give your philosophy about rebuilding the dividend?", "Richard Davis", "Sure. Wow it took six people to get to the dividend. The philosophy hasn\u2019t changed here, first of all. And so I\u2019m going to give you everything but the math. But we said for a long time that we will give a high percentage of our earnings back to the shareholders in the form of dividend and in stock buybacks. As much as we all forgot the stock buyback, it is still a reasonable approach to use. I think it will come back one day as one of the options. ", "So if US Banks gave a majority of its earnings to the shareholders in those two methods and I believe both odds will be used in the future by our company. And the dividend will be something; a percentage of a large amount of our earnings will go to the dividend. But it will be a line of sight that I have to have and the Board has to have as we look into the next year, as we begin to evaluate our first dividend increase. ", "And once we get into the latter part of this year we will have a good idea for 2010. It is my commitment for all the reasons you would expect to give the dividend an increase at a level that is both sustainable, one that we can grow from, one that is predicted on the basis of future earnings and that is meaningful.", "But I will hold back some for potential stock buybacks to benefit the shareholders in that way and we will keep a little for ourselves to continue to invest in the future. But Nancy, you have known us for a long time. Our percentage of high value to shareholders through those two forms has not changed and it is just a matter now of getting my head around what those numbers will be and giving a high percentage of it back to the shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo - CLSA.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning. And say, you are pursuing some national advertising. And I just, my first thought is that, you must be doing a big deal on a market. So maybe I\u2019m too skeptical there. I mean you are gaining some share within your market, so why national advertising and how much might that cost?", "Bill Parker", "Sure the national advertising is intended to be certainly all end market too, but we are 24 state franchise and the other 26 we don\u2019t usually get a lot of visibility for. This follows perfectly on our newfound growth of the corporate bank, moving it from a regional corporate bank to a high quality national corporate bank. As you know we have offices now in both New York and Charlotte and we have enhanced our team by more than 100 senior lenders and capital markets, people in these markets.", "So number one Mike, you know the story from a couple of years ago, but our newest result on Fortune 500 companies is 467 of them do business with us, but only a mere 132 do corporate banking with us. The others do corporate trust and/or corporate payments. All very good. But we are a national bank and we should have the national corporate capability.", "So, we are talking to the [litany] of high quality customers, both private and public that are starting to know us by our quality, knowing our brand a bit. They don\u2019t know it is at least a neutral equity and now we want to build positive equity. The campaign is slightly more than $10 million. It will run the majority of quarter three and a little into quarter four.", "It will be TV and it will be print and it will be equally end market and out of market, identifying primarily the attraction of key leaders outside of market and small businesses and consumer\u2019s end market. So it\u2019s got a nice bifurcated view. It is all about strength, stability and being honest partner with people who need a good partner at times like this.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "You touched on this before in terms of larger, out of market acquisitions. You are a little more open to that. Is that correct?", "Richard Davis", "No. I didn\u2019t mean to say that. I\u2019m glad you clarified. Out of market acquisitions are going to be first and foremost costing this company two basis. One is, we\u2019ve got so much momentum going in our organic initiatives as many which you all just haven\u2019t seen yet, that the cost of us doing a deal in or out of market is substantial.", "Well again, stress against that momentum. I\u2019m willing to take it if it is right, but I am not looking for it. Out of market additionally has a cultural risk, at least when you do an end market deal, you have the ability to introduce your culture and confirm that it remains.", "We have a culture now that I really like. I don\u2019t want it to get diluted. To do it out of market, which cause us to put a lot of people out of the current market to get into those new markets and create a culture. I wouldn\u2019t be unwilling to do it, but it has to be remarkably a great deal to pursue and at this point in time, we don\u2019t see anything like that.", "I didn\u2019t mean to indicate out of market is of higher interest than end market. There aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities. I just want to let you all know if a great deal comes along, we\u2019ll look at anything, but we won\u2019t do anything outside of our very prudent approach we\u2019ve used in the past, but if in a couple years nothing big would come along, and we haven\u2019t done a big deal, I hope you are not disappointed because I like who we are.", "We are very relevant and we\u2019re very good at what we\u2019re doing. Acquisition is not a course this company has to take unless the opportunity presents itself at which point we\u2019ll evaluate it.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "In terms of delinquencies, as a good predictor for loan problems, maybe I\u2019m haunted. I think it was 2001 Labor Day or the day after that when you had your investor conference. That is before your CEO, you had a different Chief Credit Officer, but it was six weeks or so after that conference when you had the big credit quality surprise.", "So just through your experience, a couple of decades of doing this, how good of a predictor are delinquencies on future NPA? Are there times when it hasn\u2019t worked so well?", "Richard Davis", "You mixed a couple of things there. First of all, in dog years, 2001 you are right. Its five generation ago. So, I\u2019m going to tell you that this company and this team is much more able to forecast and we simply would not make that mistake. I guarantee you that.", "In terms of predictability, I think delinquencies have always been the best predictor of most likely loss effects from consumers and from the small business portfolio because it is the annuity aspect of it, you just doesn\u2019t change that fast. It is not at all a good predictor of course in non-NPAs, as a predictor of loss in the commercial and commercial real estate.", "I would say it hasn\u2019t changed seven years later. It is still the best predictor, but this company has changed. We know how to do that better, we do have a different team here.", "Our focus as Bill mentioned it earlier has been to bring on as much competence on the defense of knowing what\u2019s going on in our credit and quality as it was in offense before. I think it\u2019s a good time for you to have trust in our ability to predict. That last by gone of 2001 is just that. Bill, you want to add to that?", "Bill Parker", "No, the second that I think the delinquencies plus bankruptcy trends are very good indicator at least for the next 90, 120 days on mostly consumer and small business. Again on the wholesale side, it\u2019s not necessarily good predictor at all. You have to look at other factors.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "If there is one factor that makes you feel better on the wholesale side or maybe just the offset to the two because aren\u2019t we kind of getting going on the commercial real estate side?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, there is still plenty of stress on our residential construction portfolio. Like I said, our stress there has moved into our portfolio in the Pacific Northwest that\u2019s about a $700 million portfolio. So, yes, we still see stress.", "Richard Davis", "So, I think Mike, two things. One would be the mix of our business that unsecured versus secured. That which is secured was underwritten at fairly conservative level that we can even tell the stand for the majority of the downturn and predicted downtrend. ", "So, risk to loss continues to be less than perhaps likelihood of NPA in both mix of our portfolio and the quality of those that are underwritten. But we will definitely see the continued stress we were not immune to it at all, which is why we are not saying losses or NPAS will go down in linked quarter. They just continue to think will go up by now.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Richard Davis", "Michael, thank you very much. Judy?", "Judy Murphy", "The official close. Thank you for listening to our review of second quarter results. If you do have any questions, please feel free to give me a call at 612-303-0783.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) This call will be recorded and available for a replay beginning today at approximately noon through Wednesday, October 28th at midnight. I would now like to turn the call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you Christie and good morning to everyone who has joined our call today. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter 2009 results and to answer your questions. If you have not received a copy of our earnings release and supplemental analysts schedules, they are available on our Website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties, factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are detailed in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you Judy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Andy and I will begin the call today with a short review of U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter earnings results. After we\u2019ve completed our formal remarks, we will open the line to questions from the audience. U.S. Bancorp recorded net income of $603 million for the third quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.30 compared with $0.32 per diluted common share in the same quarter of last year, a $0.02 or 6.3% decrease year-over-year and compared with $0.12 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2009. Solid third quarter operating earnings defined as income before provision and taxes were higher than both the third quarter of 2008 and in the prior quarter, and importantly kept pace with the increased costs of credit, including the cost of building the allowance for future credit losses to reflect the current economic conditions. In total, a number of significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter by approximately $0.19, and Andy will provide more detail on those items in a moment.", "Our performance metrics were impacted by the significant items with return on average assets in the current quarter of 0.9% and return on average common equity of 10%. Excluding significant items, return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been approximately 1.46% and 16.3% respectively. As I stated, our company continue to perform very well this quarter on an operating basis. Once again, we achieved record total net revenue this quarter, driven by growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. ", "A few of this quarter\u2019s financial highlights included an increase in total average loans outstanding of $15.4 billion or 9.3% year-over-year, with growth in all major categories except commercial. Growth in total average loans was impacted by recent acquisitions. Without acquisitions, total average loans grew by 2.6% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, total average loans decreased by 1%, driven mainly by a 5.2% decrease in average total commercial loans outstanding. Similar to last quarter, the decrease in average loans outstanding was largely due to lower usage of outstanding commitment by our commercial customers. Specifically, the average rate of commitment utilization by our corporate and commercial borrowers declined from an average of about 35% in the second quarter of 2009 to approximately 32% in the third quarter. The decline in average balance is also reflected in overall softening of demand for our new loans by our customers both commercial and consumer as they remain cautious and are waiting to see concrete signs of an improving economy before investing and extending our businesses and their debt obligations.", "That being said, we are continuing to originate and renew lines and loans for our customers who want and need credit. In fact, during the third quarter of 2009, U.S. Bank originated almost $15 billion of new residential mortgages, and over $32 billion of other loans, plus new and renewed commitment for our consumer small business commercial and commercial real estate customers, essentially equal to the previous quarter\u2019s total. We remain responsive to the credit needs of our current and new creditworthy borrowers and continue to strongly support the government\u2019s efforts to maintain the flow of credit necessary to stimulate and strengthen the economy.", "Growth in average deposits was another highlight of our third quarter results. Total average deposits increased by $32.8 billion or 24.6% over the same quarter of last year, and $3.1 billion or 1.9% on annualized \u2013 on a linked quarter basis. Without acquisitions, the year-over-year growth rate was an exceptionally strong 16.1%. This growth clearly indicates that our company is continuing to benefit from a \u201cflight to quality.\u201d As one of the highest rated financial institutions in the country, our lease bank, U.S. Bank National Association has a significant advantage over the competition. Consumers and businesses are looking for a safe, stable and sound financial institution, and U.S. Bank ranks at the top of that list when measured against those fundamental criteria.", "As I previously mentioned, the company reported record total net revenue in the third quarter. A major contributor to the success was mortgage banking related revenue, which grew year-over-year by $215 million. Total mortgage banking revenue however was lower on a linked quarter basis as it fell back about 10% from the record-setting revenue posted in the second quarter of this year. Mortgage production of $14.8 billion were significantly higher than the $7.6 billion recorded in the same quarter of 2008 and modestly below the record-setting $16.3 billion in production completed in the prior quarter. The growth in mortgage banking revenue and production is another example of the flight to quality and our company\u2019s ability to capitalize on its unique position in this market. We have moved from being one of the top 25 mortgage banking providers in the country to being one of the top 7, as many of our competitors are either no longer in the business or they are pulling back while we continue to support our customers\u2019 mortgage needs, with high quality mortgage products and underwriting processes.", "In addition to mortgage banking, commercial products revenue and treasury management fees also showed solid double-digit growth year-over-year. I call out these two categories in particular as they most clearly illustrate how the investments we have made over the past two years, specifically in our corporate banking expansion and in building deeper relationship initiatives had now translated into positive and tangible results. With an efficiency ratio of 47.5% in the third quarter, our company has a distinction of being one of the most efficient financial institutions in the country, and I am pleased to say that we achieved positive core operating leverage this quarter on both year-over-year and linked quarter basis. We are managing our operating expenses at a level appropriate for the current environment, while prudently investing in our businesses and our employees to ensure future growth.", "And now moving on to credit. Credit costs in the third quarter, including the costs of building the allowance for credit losses were higher than the same quarter of 2008 and the prior quarter. But as expected, the rate of increase moderated on a linked quarter basis. Third quarter net charge-offs of $1.041 billion [ph] were 12.1% higher than the second quarter of 2009. This percentage increase was lower than the 17.9% increase reported between the first and second quarters of this year. Also and as expected, non-performing assets increased again this quarter. The $376 million or 9.4% increase was lower than last quarter\u2019s linked quarter growth rate of 17.8%, another indication of the credit quality although not yet improving, it\u2019s deteriorating at a slower pace.", "Accruing loans 90 days or more past due excluding covered assets increased by 8% over the prior period. The increase was largely related to the higher residential mortgages and a seasonal increase in credit card delinquencies, plus the impact of recent prior portfolio purchases. With regard to early stage delinquencies, total 30 to 89 days past due loans at September 30th, which is slightly higher than June 30th. Our C&I commercial real estate and small business portfolios all experienced declines in early stage delinquencies relative to the second quarter. Offsetting the positive variance in commercial related categories, the increases in early-staged delinquencies and retail lending, led by higher credit cards, first mortgages and home equity loans. The increase in early-staged delinquencies and credit cards reflected a normal seasonal pattern in the recent portfolio of purchases. Early-stage delinquencies in residential mortgages and home equity loans have been steadily increasing over the past number of quarters, but the growth rate is slowing.", "Our auto loans and lease portfolios were the exception in the retail category this quarter, with early-stage delinquencies improving linked quarter as the value of used cars continues to recover. Overall, these trends in our early-stage delinquencies further support our view that the pace of deterioration in credit quality is decelerating. Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest rose by 7% this quarter. Our company began actively working with customers to renegotiate loan terms late in 2007, enabling many of them to keep their homes. Since 2008, including loan service for others, we have modified over 21,000 residential mortgage loans, totaling approximately $3.6 billion. Additionally, we began participating in the \u2013 that government\u2019s mortgage modification program in August of this year and have since begun trial modification on over 3,500 loans or 12% of eligible loans.", "Going forward, we will continue to actively assist our customers and support the government\u2019s objectives to restore the housing markets. As expected, given the upward trends in both net charge-offs and non-performing assets, in addition to the uncertain and soft economy, we increased the allowance for credit losses this quarter by recording a $415 million incremental provision for loan losses. This represented approximately 40% of the current quarter\u2019s total net charge-offs of slightly over $1 billion. This compares with an incremental provision equal to 50% of net charge-offs in both the second quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2008. This incremental provision raise the company\u2019s allowance for credit losses to period in-loans excluding covered assets to 2.88% from 2.66% at June 30th. The ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding covered assets in this quarter to 158% [ph], while the allowance to non-performing loans plus 90 days past due loans excluding covered assets remained unchanged from the prior quarter at 107%.", "As we look ahead 90 days, we anticipate continued growth in both net charge-offs and non-performing assets. However, we expect the rate of growth to once again trend lower. Consequently, we expect further increases to the allowance for credit losses, as credit quality stabilize and have consistent evidence of the net charge-offs are leveling off or declining. We will continue to assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and provide for credit losses at a level that reflects changes in the credit risk of the portfolio and current economic conditions.", "Finally, and importantly, our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 9.5% and 13% respectively at September 30th, both very comfortably above the well capitalized level as defined by the regulators, and following our repayment of the preferred stock issued under U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. Additionally, our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 6.8% and our tangible common equity tangible assets ratio rose to 5.4% at the end of the third quarter. All of our capital ratios benefited from the $2.7 billion capital issuance last night and continued positive earnings.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Richard. Once again our third quarter results demonstrated our company\u2019s ability to produce quality core earnings, while managing through a difficult economic cycle. And we would like to provide you a few details about the results. I will begin with a quick summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our third quarter\u2019s results to prior periods. First, third quarter non interest income included $76 million of securities losses, representing impairment charges on perpetual preferred securities, our SID exposure and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. ", "Second, other non-interest income included a $39 million gain related to our investment in Visa, and third, we recorded a $450 million provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs. These three significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter by approximately $0.19. For comparison purposes, during the third quarter of 2008, the company recorded $411 million of securities losses as well as $39 million of market disruption related losses.", "Additionally, results in the third quarter of 2008 included an incremental provision for credit losses of $250 million. These three significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2008 by approximately $0.28. Significant items in the second quarter of 2009 included $19 million of security losses, $123 million related to a special FDIC assessment, and $466 million provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs. In addition, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were reduced by the impact of the $154 million deemed dividend associated with the repayment of the TARP funds. ", "Together, these significant items reduced second quarter 2009 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.34. Finally, as a reminder, we purchased the warrant issued as part of the TARP program for $139 million on July 15th. This payment did not have an impact on earnings in the third quarter, as the payment represented a direct reduction to equity.", "Now, a few comments about operating earnings. Net interest income in the third quarter was 9.7% higher in the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to the $19 billion or 8.9% increase in average earning assets. Net interest income was 2.5% higher than the previous quarter, largely due to favorable funding rates, as average earning assets were essentially flat on a linked quarter basis. The favorable change in the company\u2019s funding costs driven by both an increase in low cost deposit balances and lower rates paid on those balances led to an increase in net interest margin, which was 3.67% in the third quarter versus 3.60% in the second quarter of 2009. Assuming the current rate environment in yield curve, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable, with a slightly bias towards improvement in the fourth quarter.", "Total noninterest income in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by $681 million, partially due to the favorable impact of the significant items, most notably lower security clauses. However, core noninterest income including significant items and acquisitions grew by over 13% year-over-year, driven by mortgage banking revenue, commercial product revenue, treasury and management fees, ATM servicing fees and lower residual losses. Partially offsetting these positive variances were trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and investment product fees and commissions, which declined year-over-year, adversely impacted by the slow economy and equity market conditions.", "Payment related fees, which were flat year-over-year, despite a meaningful job in same-store sales, as well as trust and investment management fees continue to be well positioned to rebound once the economy strengthens and the equity market stabilize. This position is in part the result of a number of recent attractive strategic acquisitions, including the bond trustee business of First Citizens Bank, the mutual funds administration and accounting service division of Fiduciary Management, the Diners Club Merchant Portfolio from Citibank, the credit card issuing programs for KeyBanc and associated bank, and a new merchant processing alliance relationship with Santander in the UK. ", "In late July, we also announced the creation of Syncada, a B2B joint venture with Visa. As Richard mentioned, mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter was higher than the same quarter of last year, but lower on a linked quarter basis, largely due to production volume. Included in the mortgage banking revenue this quarter was a benefit from a net impact of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and the associated hedge. The net amount of the gain was $67 million in the third quarter compared with a net loss of $32 million in the third quarter of 2008 and a gain of $45 million in the second quarter of 2009.", "Within non interest income, the other income category was higher year-over-year, primarily due to lower end of term lease residual losses as well as the Visa gain. As we have noted during previous quarterly calls, end of term lease residual losses peaked in the latter half of 2008. The end of term losses in the current quarter were $3 million compared with losses of $84 million in the third quarter of 2008, and $14 million in the second quarter of this year. On a linked quarter basis, seasonally higher payments related revenue as well as higher commercial products revenue, deposits service charges, equity investment income and the Visa gain more than offset the declines in trust and investment management fees in mortgage banking and securities losses.", "Total noninterest expense in the current quarter was $240 million or 13.2% higher than the same quarter of last year. The variance was largely due to acquisitions, higher FDIC insurance premiums, marketing and business development expense related to our new FlexPerks credit card program, increased costs related to investments in tax advantage projects, which create an offsetting benefit in income tax expense and costs associated with mortgage servicing and other real estate. Noninterest expense was lower on a linked quarter basis by $76 million, as the favorable variance resulting from the second quarter special FDIC assessment was partially offset by an increase in marketing expense for the FlexPerks and higher costs related to our investment in tax advantage projects.", "Finally, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2009 on a taxable equivalent basis was 18.4%. This rate was lower than the previous comparable periods and reflected the marginal impact of tax exempt income, investments in affordable housing and other tax advantage projects combined with a lower pre-tax earnings year-over-year.", "The tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to the current quarter. I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Andy. During our second quarter earnings call, I said that the first half of 2009 had been anything but ordinary for our company as we concluded and passed the regulatory stress test, placed $2.7 billion of new common equity, paid back TARP and finally completed the repurchase of the related warrant. Although we continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economy, our vision into the future is clearer today than it was three months ago. These past three months brought us the beginning signs of stabilization and even some improvement in the markets we serve. While unemployment remains high, an indication that does not peak, the rate of sales have moderated. ", "The housing sector remains weak, but the pressure on housing prices have lessened and we have seen sales activity pick up in some of our most effective markets. Our commercial customers are still decreased in the usage of their outstanding lines of credit, and overall demand for new credit is not robust, but our customers are efficiently managing their businesses and prudently saving for their future. In the third quarter, our company posted record net revenues, achieved positive core operating leverage, continue to lend and gather deposits and preserve the strength of our credit rating and capital. I would consider this quarter to be much closer to business as usual than we have seen in quite some time.", "Our senior management team just finished participating in an extended Board of Directors meeting. During our time together, we reviewed the company\u2019s business line initiatives and overall strategic direction with the Board. After this review, the Board and the management team reaffirmed the strategic direction of our company, and we now continue to move forward building our high quality franchise, enhancing our products and service delivery, engaging and developing our employees and capitalizing on our unique position of strength and independence to differentiate just from our competition.", "Our third quarter results once again validated the strengths of our diverse business lines and effectively demonstrated that the momentum we have created has and will continue to effectively carry through the current cycle, while positioning us to capitalize coming [ph] to recover. U.S. Bank remains open for business and we are managing this company for the long term. As we continue to prudently lend to creditworthy borrowers, we judiciously invest in and grow our franchise. We support our community. We provide best-in-class customer service and importantly we create for our shareholders by sustaining our earnings power, high quality balance sheet and capital strength. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience. Christie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi Richard, Andy.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning Matt.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "You point to a lot of small acquisitions that you have done this quarter. And just in general since the crisis began, you have done a number of deals, I was wondering if you had the total revenue pickup that you have gotten from those deals and what the earnings opportunity might be overtime, because I feel like it\u2019s hard to keep track of each one, but it\u2019s starting to add up?", "Andy Cecere", "Matt, this is Andy. What we tried to do because each individual acquisition is relatively small, but when you add them up, they do become a little bit bigger number, we tried to do as we did in this call, demonstrate the earnings growth, the revenue growth or the balance growth related to acquisitions. So as Richard mentioned, the 9% loan growth plus was about 2.8% without acquisitions and net earnings from \u2013 net interest income flows around the same level. The fee income growth was less so, because that was driven by core mortgage growth and the expense growth as we said, about $88 million of our increase year-over-year was related to acquisition. We will continue to describe the growth both with and without acquisition in future periods, because again no one individual acquisition is big, but when you add them all up, they become a number that was mentioned.", "Richard Davis", "And Matt, it\u2019s Richard, we haven\u2019t changed our philosophy that we won\u2019t do diluted transactions. So, you will find that everyone of them does that up, but what they might think is a little longer to be highly accretive, but they will start out being non dilutive and anything we have done in the last 12 months is just starting to hit some point of benefit and I think we will just see is over the course of time, they will start to add up and given your question, we will do a better job of, maybe isolating those for future calls and giving you a guidance of what we said 12-month acquisitions is really done for earnings.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And then just separately, you know, Wells Fargo came out today and provided a number of outlook comment regarding credit. They talked about consumer losses, potentially peaking first half in next year and commercial losses in the back half of next year, just wondering if you have any time frame on when you think your loss rates might peak in here, portfolio or overall?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I read those, too. I will tell you. Stick to my voice that we can see 90 days really clearly, and I think we have been able to prove that at the beginning of each new quarter, we have been pretty close to right at the end of that quarter. So, I am going to stick first of all to saying we can see it at the end of the year pretty clearly and I will remind that we do see the increase of both charge-offs and non performs continuing to go upwards but at a decelerating rate, which means we are getting close to the point where we are going to hit that version, because we don\u2019t have much left to keep reducing on an increasing rate. I won\u2019t say we do see the consumers are more predictable, because it\u2019s more of an annuity business, we can track their behavior and assuming seasonality, it ticks up back into historical patterns. We have a pretty good idea that the consumer won\u2019t track with unemployment, I think we see that sometime in next year, but I don\u2019t know what part of next year. On the commercial side, based on the quality of our book, I think we will emerge faster from any problems from most of our peers, but it\u2019s a little less even because it\u2019s more customer related than it is group or category related. So, I would also say that next year, we expect those to peak, but I wouldn\u2019t be so precise to when or which part of 2010, because we just can\u2019t see that farther.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Richard Davis", "Hi Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi good morning, thanks. Couple of questions, one is on the footprint in how you are thinking about capital usage for extending your footprint. You indicated that the Board confirmed the strategic plan for U.S. Bancorp, could you just help me understand what that means for capital usage and extending or enhancing the current footprint?", "Richard Davis", "I can, thank you. First of all, the headline was organic load at an aggressive level, and M&As will be opportunistic if and when they come along. So, what we wanted to make sure the Board is aware of this, we are going to continue to pursue what we have done in the last two years, in investing more heavily in our franchise and technology to employ engagement to some of the products and services that you will start to see more of as we build deeper relationships. That\u2019s quite important because if we weren\u2019t just start forward an M&A strategy as our future, that will be a different approach to things.", "Andy Cecere", "Further I would say that we talked about deepening our investment in our 24 state franchise where you would see the consumer and small business bank as opposed to trying to expand it and perhaps dilute ourselves over more locations. At the same time, we are going to spend those same energies organically on taking the commercial real estate, commercial and corporate bank more at the national level along with the trust business to expand where we have already been playing effectively. So, I think it\u2019s a little (inaudible), but we basically are confirming doing more what we have done over the last couple of years allowing M&A to be an infill and depth building as opposed to expansion areas and allowing M&A to be additional to our success, but spending a fair amount of our capital in the organic measures of old fashioned banking to get long term gains.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And at some point, you will be hitting the density of presence in your current footprint, at levels that perhaps you are targeting already, my point is, at point do you start seeing the ROIC in expansion at a better return and potentially increasing density of presence in your current program?", "Richard Davis", "That\u2019s a great point. We have further to go probably than you think, and I am not disappointed to say that. We have come to conclude like a good retailer that when we have a market position either in deposits or branch and they can be combined, of one, two or three position and 168 MSAs that we consider ourselves involve in. When we are one, two or three, it\u2019s incremental and it\u2019s accretive, your investments are more than one for one, where your four or five or six something below that, you will find that your investments are not as well returned and your goal would be to get up into the top three if you can in order to leverage your investments. Of those 168 markets, slightly more than half of those, we are in that one, two, three position, but inside that, which is whole lot of markets, we are not. So, there\u2019s plenty of time and energy to be placed, and there\u2019s some really good growth markets where our positions are very strong.", "Andy Cecere", "(inaudible) helps, well let that be a jumpstart, strategically decided to go after it directly and just start building our infrastructure in places where we are not going to get it otherwise.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then lastly on capital usage, the dividend, what are the key things you are looking for to yield the conclusion that you were on to increase the dividend?", "Richard Davis", "I will move to question two without the dividend question. We are \u2013 and exactly we have done in all the years, very predictable, and by that I mean that it\u2019s been historically, this company is routine to look at the dividend December of every year, and we will do that again in December of this year. We will make a recommendation to the Board to evaluate in December based fully on our ability to have confidence in the next one and two-year earnings results for this company. Once we get our line of sight and we have a pretty good idea where that would be, we will trust asset for regulatory policy and economic circumstances. If we like where that number comes even in the worst part of the stress test and we feel that there\u2019s ample room to begin with dividend, then that will be the moment, we will do it. At December, well, you will see it in December, if not, then that indicates that we are going to wait a little longer to see our line of sight that gives us that confidence.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "The regulators aren\u2019t going to be coming out with their capital requirements until the beginning of the year probably so, is there an opportunity for you to read, think the dividend, not just in December, but another quarterly \u2013?", "Andy Cecere", "Absolutely. Always we think that and if we don\u2019t take action in December, we will continue to evaluate it until we do. I would also indicate that when I say stress test, I include what could be possible outcomes that they could place on us under those scenarios, too.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it, thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "Good morning guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "I think said, Richard, that the ROE adjusted for special items was about 16% this quarter, is that correct?", "Richard Davis", "Correct.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "How do you see that going forward? And that\u2019s a very healthy ROE given the sort of zero interest rate environment, is that a sustainable number, is that a number that you can build upon and quote normal times, if you could just give your thoughts there?", "Richard Davis", "I will. I will have Andy give you some color around it. First of all, I think that banking in general because of the higher new bars that will be placed on all of us going forward, namely higher loan loss provisions or likely, and they were before the downturn. Higher capital requirement so likely. And now we are all seeing insurance and (inaudible) actually getting credits for. I think all three of those are natural negative vices for the ROA and ROE of the long term banks than the after versus the before scenario. But I also attempted in your question that the increasing old-fashioned banking on benefits, yield curve and the flight to quality that banks won\u2019t have in being able to be the place where our capital well recognized and we get paid for risk, I think that\u2019s a positive vibe. ", "So, I think that net-net, you can expect things to go close to, maybe frankly under where they were before. This bank was typically in the 21% to 22% ROE, today we are talking about a normalized 16, and I think you will see it somewhere between those two numbers as things start to settle. Having said that, we also do though enjoy a strong balance sheet management and this company does on interest rate, but we have guidance based on the way we are constructing on having it, you talked about that just briefly.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, we are slightly asset sensitive, as you know, Nancy. So, to the extent rates go up, and or the yield curve steep will help us. As Richard mentioned, the key variable to get back to normalized will be the charge-off level on reserve bill. And you know, two years ago, three years ago when we were earning under 20%, we had a charge-off level below 1%, we are now well about 2%, to the extent we get back to those levels is when we will get back to our normal ROE levels.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "Yes, and I would ask a similar question about sort of normalized mortgage banking, as you look at the mortgage market going forward, I think there\u2019s fair amount of confusion about what a real mortgage market is going to look like in the future. Could you just speak to your outlook there?", "Richard Davis", "We will, actually, I will have Andy give you \u2013 we studied in that in our strategy session, but as I will also say, I don\u2019t think you could plan to expect \u2013 we sort of pass to increase our mortgage business by over a third from where it was a year ago. So, we have now added hundreds of new mortgage originators, we have created new operating centers in more states and you will see it to be a more robust player in the market even with the market shrinking. We have gotten bigger and trying to grab more market share as well. As you know by our size, and our composition of other earnings, we are not going to be a one trip pony of anyone\u2019s category, but I thought that mortgage to be a substantially higher, given what we do think is a long-term good and effectively, one day we will be a very predictable earnings, we want to be a bigger part of that. So, our investments will reflect that, and Andy might talk about how we see into.", "", "Andy Cecere", "I think that\u2019s exactly why you told \u2013 about this quarter, Nancy, we had production of about $14.8 billion and that compares to a year ago about half that level of $7.6 billion. The $14.8 billion is probably higher than what would be normal run rate because of refinancing activity and the level of interest rates, but I would expect and we are also done into fourth quarter of next year, will still be 25% to 40% higher than we were a year ago, but probably on a 100% margin.", "Richard Davis", "We think it\u2019s going to be volatile, but it\u2019s still especially in old-fashioned quarter what banking does and so people will eventually need, it would be a good place for them to get their mortgages and we want to be a bigger player in that.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.", "Richard Davis", "Hi John, how are you?", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning. I was wondering, if Andy, you could give us a little color on the puts and takes in your margin and NII outlook?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, what\u2019s happened this quarter is similar to what\u2019s happened in the prior quarters, John. The loan rates, the loan yields have improved a bit principally on the wholesale commercial side. Earnings assets are relatively flat, but the big help, the big positive is our growth in core deposits, both demand deposits and interest-bearing deposits and the mix in that shift has helped our margin a bit as we talked about 367 for the quarter, I would expect to continue to slight modest positive because of that fact and we see some of the same trends that relate here in the fourth quarter.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And in terms of your positioning with the securities portfolio, I guess two questions, do you see any remaining risks in the securities product and what\u2019s your possibility about kind of growing the securities portfolio given your rate outlook?", "Richard Davis", "Right, we are worried about $43 billion, John. You know, our risks in the future quarters are similar to what we experienced this quarter, but albeit at a diminishing level, they are in the SIV exposure, which is down to just about $1 billion now. They are in the non-agency mortgage backed and slightly in some smaller perpetual preferring, those would be our key areas. In terms of the future, you know, the $43 billion I would expect to be relatively stable, perhaps slightly higher in future quarters.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, and last question on credit, do you also expect, you mentioned slowing space of NPA growth and charge-offs growth, do you also expect a magnitude of reserve though to continue to moderate?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, this is Bill, John. Yes, if you look back at over the past couple of quarters, I mean fourth quarter last year, we were at 100% of charge-offs on reserve billed, 167 [ph], 50 [ph] in this quarter, 40% though. Again, we evaluated at the end of each quarter and it\u2019s highly dependent on our economic outlook at that time, yes we do anticipate that, that assuming of losses continue to moderate, which we believe they will go in the fourth quarter, that will come down to.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, and Billy, I knew you just started to have modification program, but just a general comment about how modifications even beyond have and restructurings might be impacting your NPAs and delinquencies?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, as you know, we just did start \u2013 and I will point out that we actually \u2013 when they published a 3% effective rate or 3% of those that were eligible at (inaudible) actual number was 12% and we anticipate that will improve over the next quarter or two as we stabilize the program. If we look at our total restructured loan book, we have about $1.3 billion in restructured mortgages, we look at the AA as one, which is the way regulators often report that the two payment default, the re-default rate for our overall book, that\u2019s about 25%, and we also look at it for those that go into the program but then eventually close, and that\u2019s about 25%. Those are the two key metrics that we launched.", "Richard Davis", "John, this is Richard. We don\u2019t get too many chances to offer to carry on things. But the participation has a lot to do with quality. So, we may never get to the high end of that number, and I am not going to apologize for it, we don\u2019t have a portfolio that warns that, but we will be as everybody else\u2019s best practice in terms of doing the right job of restructuring mortgages and helping people, stay in their homes. So, I would caution all of you that it\u2019s not the only modifications we do, and it probably has a lot more to do with the quality that we start within the facility.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning Mike.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Good morning. My questions are really on kind of what\u2019s normal, so starting with the loan utilization, down from 35% in the second quarter to 32% in the third quarter. Is this is an all-time low, what\u2019s the long-term average, what do you think about that?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, this is Richard. It\u2019s a record low for as long as we have been tracking in this management team, but I know they are going to spend in the 30% range as well. I think what I would tell you over the normal course is when you take the mix of our business is we are probably in the 35% to 40% range of utilization, and you know, pretty well diversified across commercial and consumer and that\u2019s probably the better place to market. So, it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but when you take it on a 100-plus billion dollars and you lose a couple of percentage points, it\u2019s meaningful and I think moving from 32 back up into that mid-30s, and maybe high 30s will be as impressive as just making loans the old fashioned life. I will also offer to you all as evidenced that that it will appear that banks are not participating in the recovery of the economy because our loan books are shrinking and in some cases, that may be accurate, but for this bank, it\u2019s certainly isn\u2019t accurate to say that. I think the reflection of customers\u2019 usage, these are people that already have loans approved, clients approved, probably it\u2019s pretty preferred rate, and they are choosing not only to not use in more of it, they are actually choosing to pay it down, which is about (inaudible) for new demand being people given the circumstances and people\u2019s tolerance right now to extend their balance sheet.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "So, pay downs are influencing the bottom line number there?", "Richard Davis", "Most of it, in fact, for our 1% linked quarter of decrease, the majority of it is coming from the decrease in the utilization.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "And are you also seeing a switch back to the capital markets from bank financing?", "Andy Cecere", "That is also a factor, Mike, that\u2019s a good point, and you know, that has opened up and loosened quite a bit in the last couple of quarters, and that has helped some of the higher graded companies alternative sources of capital.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "So, you should be helping things recover on the negative side though, the overdraft charges with the big banks indicated that this was going to impact them starting with fourth quarter, how much should a reduction in overdraft fees impact you and when do you think it might impact you?", "Richard Davis", "First of all, the newest item is coming out of the (inaudible) with a very aggressive position. I am not going to justify that I am going to count on the fact that we will have plenty of time to get that into committee and come up with a solution in the expense, but in the meantime, we along with others made comments 30 or 40 days ago that ours would begin in the first quarter of 2010, nothing in 2009 \u2013 fourth quarter of this year, and in accordance with that, you can size it for yourself, but I think the best estimates have been the fact that it would be a couple of hundred million dollars in reduced fees, and depending on how the customer behavior moves forward, how they decide to opt out, whether or not their behaviors are as we predict them to be, that\u2019s a pretty wide swing, Mike. For us, it\u2019s going to move the needle, it\u2019s not going to change the way we run the company, but it\u2019s something to watch for, and I would say, as I said it has nothing but negative bias for long-term fee businesses the banks are in, but I am not ready to size it, as I just don\u2019t know what the final rules would be.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Okay, I am sorry. When you said a couple of hundred million in less fees, that\u2019s what some people have estimated and that might not be a crazy estimate?", "Richard Davis", "That\u2019s right.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Okay, and then last question, just a follow-up to the mortgage banking question, is there any way to kind of give a rough estimate, how much your mortgage banking fees this quarter, for example would do to refi versus people buying new homes?", "Richard Davis", "About 80% refinancing, Mike.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "And I heard recently, someone said starting in a year or so for the next several years, the only mortgage banking business you will see is due to the purchase of new homes, is that just a stupid statement or is there some truth to that?", "Richard Davis", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a stupid statement, I do think there\u2019s some pent-up demand for new home activity in addition to the refinancing seeing in this period. So, I think we would change in the future, as we have talked about, I don\u2019t expect the current levels to continue, you know, our $14.6 billion production is higher than what would be normal, but we will be well above where we were a year ago.", "Andy Cecere", "The quality of the GAAP period \u2013 I don\u2019t know how long or when, but when rates start to go back up, they will be that last flash of people who think, My God, I will have to refinance go forward, and then as rates start to come up, and I think that will be faster than new volume will get to the old days, so probably it will be net negative to overall mortgage banking income in that window, it could be 90 days, It could be six months, I don\u2019t know, but whenever that happens, it will probably a small fold in the earnings continuity, but on the other side of this \u2013 houses are fairly priced, people are getting new homes, and they will start to refinancing because they have to and not because it\u2019s rate driven, and I think it will be an old-fashioned business in a couple of years.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "All right, that\u2019s helpful, thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian of ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Good morning guys. Hello?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, hi Ed.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, most of my questions have been answered, but just one more on the tax rate, you have been running with these below normal tax rates for the last several quarters, you indicated that\u2019s going to stay low in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the pace that, that might normalize in 2010 into 2011?", "Andy Cecere", "So, the tax rate at 18.3% [ph] this quarter is down because of two reasons, principally the increase in tax credit related business which causes an increase in expense. So, you see our expense going up about $41 million both on a linked quarter and on a year-over-year basis. That has a direct relation to a lower tax rate, that combined with the fact that our income levels are just lower than it would be normal. So, as I talked about in the last call, we think our full year number is about 20%, we still think that. The first half of the year is just above 20%, the second half is just below 20%. We would expect the activities related to CDC to continue to be strong as we go into the rest of this year and next year. And you know, overtime when we get back to our normalized level, our tax rate will begin to increase from the 20s approaching the 30s, but it will take a while to get to normalized revenue levels.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, so really that move from 20 to 30 is mostly a function of getting, of the earnings normalizing?", "Andy Cecere", "That is correct.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heather Wolf of UBS.", "", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning Heather.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Hi good morning. Just a quick follow-up on your outlook, the one to two year view of earnings and the stress test for capital levels and reserve levels, would you be willing to share with us what some of those stress tests are?", "Andy Cecere", "Categorically, the stress test will be first and foremost to the economy, starting with unemployment rates and how they affect our portfolios and which parts, expected usage of lines, remember we talked about earlier about our commercial customers. Then I would move to regulatory and political and they are different, they are both very different, these stress tests would cause us to be pretty wide on our variance just in terms of what we think can happen in both law policy, the new consumer protection agencies from those activities are certainly new variables that weren\u2019t there before. And then finally, I add back all of the momentum that this company is having today on its organic, well invested organic initiatives over the last couple of years, supply to quality and then getting things to that point is normal. I believe flight to quality is even bigger than it was a few months for this company, and frankly, the longer the down turn, its presence the more benefit on a relative basis, it traps to you. As Frank said, it\u2019s not good for all of us to be in this circumstance. So, we are building a circumstance where eventually the flight of quality is neutralized and we are not getting gains from that, we are getting it from just being a provider of more services to more people with more relationships in more places and carrying that momentum with the kind of normalcy that you come to expect years before. So, the flight to quality is a great opportunity for us to use this to reinvest in the bank while we are gaining those benefits, but really to not rely on it for too long. So, put all of that in the mix, Heather, and I think this area \u2013 they are provocative and the statistics that we have signed to them and the Board was interested in seeing how we would align the risks and the rewards, but net-net, we feel very positive that the old-fashioned way of banking for a company like ours which is big but pretty simple has been pretty positive, that\u2019s a very nice positive vibes through over the next couple of years.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "And more specifically on the regulatory stress test, what kind of capital levels and reserve levels will you be stressing for?", "Andy Cecere", "Now, that\u2019s the art of it, not the time. So, that I am not going to disclose to you, because that\u2019s proprietary, the lesser degree that what you see in the last couple of quarters, namely raise $2.7 million in May to get to a point that we thought was more than sufficient to accept a supportive balance sheet with a good capital position, able to withstand any of the \u2013 continuing decreasing economy and hopefully enough to be a place for the regulators under any circumstances would say, you are well capitalized and we are satisfied with where you are, but that\u2019s the art of it, and so, our efficiency were made our own best estimates, and we continue to be that and the fact that this company \u2013 (inaudible) decent run of money every quarter, we believe gives us an ability to feel all the more confident at where we are, isn\u2019t good enough, we are going to be there very shortly no matter what the rules are. So, we put that out there is not a high risk for this company, but one just a pretext.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and then just the $1.3 billion in mortgage PRs, can you just give us dollar value that\u2019s in non-accrual versus the dollar value on performing?", "Andy Cecere", "Well, the ones that are reported, the $1.3 million is all performing.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Okay, wonderful, thank you very much.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Heather.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carole Berger of Soleil Securities.", "Andy Cecere", "Hello Carole.", "Richard Davis", "Carole, you there?", "Carole Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Yes, good morning guys.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning.", "Carole Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "All right, I had my mute on. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I was just wondering, you have a figure for tangible book value per share?", "Richard Davis", "11.04 [ph].", "Carole Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "11.04?", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Carole Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "You bet.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Carole. Nice to hear from you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Hi, if I compare you to most regional banks, I guess I would say your mix of business is very much a regional bank kind of mix of business, one of the things that\u2019s really different about you is that you have held your margin very well where it\u2019s been under severe pressure for most of the rest of the industry, and most of the other companies are now kind of guiding to the incremental reprising of loans and deposits adding a couple of basis points a quarter maybe, but then you know, should rates ever go up, then we will get a benefit and see margins going back to where they were or a while back. And I am just kind of curious, you are kind of guiding to flat to slightly up margins. I mean, if the industry, if the regional banking industry generalized recaptures, you know, 30, 40, 50 basis points that they lost over the last two years, how much of a benefit would you anticipate getting from that?", "Andy Cecere", "So, Chris, when I talked about a relatively flat with a positive bias, I prefaced it with given the current rate environment in yield curve, and we continue to expect and we have been pretty close to our expectations with regard to margin and perhaps at beating in each of the quarters. So, we expect it to migrate up a little bit, but not a lot. To the extent rates increase and more importantly the yield curve steepens, that will be a positive bias to us and I would imagine to many banks, partly because we are asset sensitive and partly because that was (inaudible).", "Richard Davis", "Hi Chris, it\u2019s Richard. If you look back a couple of years, in the 420s or 430s [ph], I wouldn\u2019t guide you to that number again. One of the reasons you were there is because we were fairly uncompetitive in deposit pricing, in fact, many of you who have followed us for a long time know that we are in the bottom depth in most of the marketplace \u2013 look at that earlier, we are not there anymore. We are competitive, we are in the middle of the pack, in places we want to win, we will go out even higher \u2013 discussion on being a market leader, it can afford you more leverage when you do change rates. So, on the deposit side, I think loans will give stronger overtime to the industry, because we will continue to have more opportunity. We will get more of the (inaudible) and we will be able to have a risk premium that we did have going into that downturn. On the deposit side for U.S. Bank, it\u2019s probably closer to where it\u2019s going to be now than it will be either a risk or reward going forward. So, we are pleased with where we are and we have given some of that margin \u2013 I don\u2019t write it even in higher back in the form of deposits.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad of KBW.", "Richard Davis", "Hi David.", "David Konrad \u2013 KBW", "Hi good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the processing company, overall processing revenues were flat year-over-year, but linked quarter up quite a bit, and really the run rate from this year, it\u2019s up quite a bit. So, I don\u2019t know, it seems a little bit more than seasonal based on looking at last year, but and perhaps it had something to do with the recent acquisitions, but just \u2013 and it looks like pretty good growth rate. Just wondering if you could comment that on your outlook for revenues there?", "Richard Davis", "David, thank you. One of the things I would have hung up and just point and talk about. The fact that it\u2019s left and the portfolios that we do processing for our 8% \u2013 (inaudible) down over the same period. Probably that number taught anything else on the \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get a lot of visibility and thank you for calling it out. Yes, a little bit to do with acquisitions, but it has a lot more to do with our European and our international processing coming in this quarter now. Remember a year ago, right now, we are talking about a big investment in an international payment platform that would be scaleable and useable in all over the world. That was installed about a year ago, to start about this year, it\u2019s changed greatly the ability for us to be scalable and some of these acquired properties outside of the base.", "And in this face, we just continue to have a better benefit on renegotiating some of our terms with our merchants, having a much better retention than we have had in years past, the attritions laydown and frankly a lot of our competitors in the merchant acquiring space are very disrupted or been disrupted action to their customers and we have been completely steady state \u2013 but overall making a lot more money on it. So, when that sooner comes back, I always talk about this bank \u2013 the corporate trust affected by primarily the markets and the payment business affected by the economy. When those two hit back, force some their companies with kind of a aid [ph] underneath themselves or we are satisfied that is a grip beginning to show that we see some improvement in the economy and we are going to call that out as one of the positive finds.", "David Konrad \u2013 KBW", "Great, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks. Was hoping you could expand a little bit, within the expenses, it seems like the increase was heavily concentrated in marketing and this is development you alluded in the text of the press release, too, card products and things, could you just expand a little more on what your plans might be going forward in that area?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, so we talked a lot on FlexPerks and just to be specific there, FlexPerks as you recall was our solution to the decision when the WorldPerks card portfolio was taken by AmEx when Delta [ph] was merged. The portfolio that was ours, we never gave up the portfolio to keep, and so we decided to invest heavily in the portfolio to recreate different rewards program for those customers. I wouldn\u2019t tell exactly the numbers, but I will say that our early results have been significantly better than we hoped in terms of retention of customers to keep their WorldPerks card now called FlexPerks, the challenge we have now, Moshe, is to make sure that, that turns into spending behaviors not just card retention, and while we are \u2013 it comes in that order, by the way, we have plenty more cards than we thought we would have in our original expectations. So, the advertising seems to have worked. ", "Now, we need to create a rewards program routine and their behavior that helps people say I really want to use this card. So, ask me again in 90 days, we will see how that\u2019s going, but the investment of advertising which is also marketing and collateral and all the things that go along with creating the rewards and rewards themselves been part of that cost. The other thing in that category expense as you will see will be just overall brand development advertising and some collateral that we have been doing with our clients, and also underneath that as part of our corporate bank and wealth management restructurings that we have been talking about for a couple of quarters. ", "We are getting more national view on the corporate side and doing a better job at the higher end wealth management clients that we have done in the past, creating a new brand called private client reserve and setting a lot of energy, bringing a lot of new employees with those kinds of talent to amend what we have not had here in years past which is a very high wealth management capability. So, those expenses are both noninterest expense and personnel expense and they are all aligned with that organic investment I have been talking about during the call, all of which will probably yield benefits in the future quarters more than they have now. That\u2019s all, it\u2019s pretty much the real delta between the variance of the prior period and current period, it\u2019s been marketing in people.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks very much.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have reached the allotted time for the question-and-answer session. Are there any closing remarks?", "Richard Davis", "Thank you Christie. First of all, I thank you enough for your interest in our company and I mean that. I will tell you, with a very good strategic meeting that we just came back from actually yesterday. We have been gone over the weekend, and I must say when you put it on paper to explain to your Board of Directors where your opportunities lie, where your weaknesses are, and where your future is going, it gives us great celebration to pause and say simple and basic is good, and you are going to see more of that from us. We will continue to protect our prudent, our risk and credit underwriting philosophies, you will see us to be a watchful on the expenses, but we are also making a lot more revenues, so we will reinvest that. ", "And while whereas the dividend is an important step in our shareholders\u2019 focus, and finally I can\u2019t put words around at the momentum we are feeling in the company by the employee engagement and their pride of being part of this company is probable, you can\u2019t taste it. And I am excited to show it off to you over the coming quarters. So, thanks for your interest in our company and if you have any others questions, Judy, Andy, Bill and I are happy all day long to answer those questions. Judy?", "Judy Murphy", "Absolutely. Thank you for listening to our call and absolutely feel free to call me if you do have questions later today.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cecere US Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer there will be a formal question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon eastern time through Wednesday, January 27th at 12 midnight eastern time. ", "I will now turn the conference over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy ", "Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 results and to answer your questions.  Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.  A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at www.USBank.com.  ", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release and our Form 10K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.  I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis ", "I\u2019d like to begin on page three of the presentation and note some of the highlights of our fourth quarter 2009 results.  U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $602 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 or $0.30 per diluted common share.  Earnings were $0.15 higher than the same quarter last year and equal to the $0.30 per diluted common share the company earned for the third quarter of 2009.  We achieved record net revenue of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter and year-over-year positive operating leverage with an industry leading efficiency ratio of 49.1%.", "The flight to quality continued this quarter as we experienced strong year-over-year average deposit growth of 25.2%, 15.3% excluding acquisitions.  Average loan growth was 8.2% primarily due to the acquisitions as our commercial customers continue to pay down their balances leaving year-over-year average total loan growth excluding acquisitions at .4%, a point of pride given the current low demand for credit.", "As expected, net charge offs and non-performing assets excluding covered assets increased again this quarter and at a more modest pace than the prior quarter.  Importantly, total credit costs declined on a linked quarter basis due to a decrease in the provision expense necessary to build the allowance for credit losses.  We maintained our strong capital position with the Tier-1 capital ratio increasing from 9.5% at September 30th to 9.6% at December 31.  ", "Finally, during the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the operations of the banking subsidiaries of FBOP Corporation in an FDIC assisted deal.  An acquisition that added 150 branches to our franchise, over $13 billion of loans and more than $14 billion of deposits.  We announced last November that we would be selling the three Texas branches acquired in this transaction and the buyer Prosperity Bank announced the purchase of the branches late yesterday.  That sale is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter.", "On Slide Four, we show our performance metrics over the past five quarters.  Return on average assets in the current quarter was .8% and return on average common equity was 9.6% just slightly below the ratios posted in the third quarter of 2009.  The fourth quarter results included two significant items which were net security losses of $158 million and provision expense in excess of net charge offs of $278 million.  Excluding these significant items which Andy will discuss in a few minutes, return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been approximately 1.36% and 15.3% respectively. ", "On the right hand of the Slide is a graph showing the five quarter trends of our net interest margin and efficiency ratio.  Our net interest margin of 3.83% improved over the prior quarter by 16 basis points primarily due to the higher loan spread and lower funding costs while our efficiency ratio ended the quarter at 49.1%.  Our efficiency ratio reflects in absolute terms our prudent approach to managing operating expenses at a level appropriate for the current environment as well as our continued investment in our businesses and employees to ensure our future growth. ", "Turning to Slide Five, our capital positions remain strong.  Our Tier-1 capital and Tier-1 common equity ratios were 9.6% and 6.8% respectively at December 31st.  Additionally, our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio rose from 3.3% at December 31, 2008 to 5.3% at yearend 2009.  Our capital position continues to benefit from our ongoing profitability.  With this positive earnings stream, business line momentum, moderating credit costs we continue to expect to generate significant capital going forward.", "As I have indicated in the past, this was the first factor we considered when deciding whether this was the right time to recommend an increase to our current quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share.  We are confident that our earnings can support a higher dividend.  Unfortunately, there remains a great deal of uncertainty for all of us in the banking industry regarding potential legislative and regulatory changes in addition to the timing and the scope of the economic recovery and what that all means for the level of capital that will be required going forward.", "I assure you we are acutely aware of how important the dividend is to our shareholders.  At this point however, the most prudent approach for our company is to continue to work closely with our regulators and defer action on our dividend until a sustainable economic recovery is evident and clear capital guidelines are established.  ", "Moving on to Slide Six, average total loans outstanding increased by $14.4 billion year-over-year primarily due to the recent acquisitions.  As noted on the slide, excluding acquisitions, total average loans grew by .4% year-over-year.  On a linked quarter basis total average loans increased by 5.3% driven again by acquisitions.  As I mentioned earlier and some [inaudible] last quarter, the lack of growth in average total loans outstanding excluding acquisitions was largely due to the lower usage of revolving lines of credit by our commercial customers.  ", "Specifically, the rate of commitment utilization by our corporate and commercial borrowers declined from an average of about 32% in the third quarter of 2009 to approximately 30% in the fourth quarter.  The decline in average balances also reflected an overall softening of demand for new loans by our customers both commercial and consumer as they remain cautious rightsizing their own balance sheets to reflect the current economic conditions.  That being said, we continue to originate and renew lines and loans for our customers who want and need credit.  ", "In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2009 U.S. Bank originated over $11 billion of residential mortgages, originated over $4 billion of consumer loans including installment loans, student loans, lines of credit and home equity lines and loans.  We originated new prime based credit card accounts with lines totaling over $2 billion and we issued more than $9 billion of new commitments and renewed over $17 billion of commitments to small businesses, commercial and commercial real estate customers.", "Overall, excluding mortgage production, new originations plus new and renewed commitments were over $33 billion, slightly higher than the previous quarter\u2019s total bringing the full year 2009 total to over $129 billion.  We remain responsive to the credit needs of our current and new creditworthy borrowers.  In fact, we have begun to take a second look at small business loans that may have been turned down in the initial credit review process to see if there are additional opportunities to provide them with solutions to their financing needs.   We continue to strongly support the government\u2019s efforts to maintain the flow of credit necessary to stimulate and strengthen our economy.  ", "Growth in average total deposits was a key highlight of our fourth quarter.  Total average deposits increased by $36.4 billion over the same quarter of last year and $14.5 billion on a linked quarter basis.  Excluding acquisitions, the growth rate remains strong at 15.3% on a year-over-year basis and 10.8% annualized on a linked quarter basis.  Our company continues to benefit from a flight to quality and remains one of the highest rated financial institutions in the company as rated by S&P, Moodys, [inaudible] and DBRS.", "Turning to Slide Seven, the company reported record total net revenue for the fourth quarter of $4.4 billion.  In fact, we also achieved record net revenue for the full year of 2009 of $16.7 billion.  The growth in revenue was driven by earnings asset growth and expanding net interest margin, business line growth initiatives and acquisitions.  Reported total net revenue was impacted in each of the last five quarters by securities valuation losses which are detailed at the bottom of the slide.", "Moving on to credit as we turn to Slide Eight.  Credit costs in the fourth quarter of 2009 including the cost of building the allowance for credit losses were higher than the same quarter of 2008 but lower than the previous quarter.  As expected, the rate of increase in net charge offs moderated on a linked quarter basis.  Fourth quarter net charge offs of $1,110,000,000 were approximately 7% higher than the third quarter of 2009.  This percentage increase was lower than the 12% increase recorded between the second and third quarters of this year.", "The growth in net charge offs once again reflected the stress in the residential home and mortgage related industries and the impact of the economy on both our retail and commercial customers. Also, and as expected, non-performing assets excluding covered assets increased again this quarter.  The $184 million or approximately 5% increase was lower than last quarter\u2019s linked quarter growth rate of approximately 12%, another indication that credit quality is deteriorating at a slower pace.", "At December 31st total non-performing assets were $5,907,000,000.  Included in total non-performing assets were $2 billion and $3 million of loans and other real estate covered by a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC.  Given the terms of these agreements with the FDIC, the amount of potential loss on these loans is substantially reduced.  ", "Turning to Slide Nine, you can see that as expected given the upward trend in both net charge offs and non-performing assets in addition to the uncertain and still somewhat weak economy, we increased the allowance for credit losses this quarter by recording a $278 million incremental provision for loan losses.  This represented approximately 25% of the current quarter\u2019s total net charge offs of approximately $1.1 billion.  This compares with an incremental provision equal to 40% of the net charge offs in the third quarter of 2009 and 100% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  This incremental provision raised the company\u2019s allowance for credit losses to period end loans at December 31st excluding covered assets to 3.04% from 2.88% at September 30th.  The ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding covered assets ended the quarter at 153%.", "As we look ahead 90 days, we anticipate continued growth in both net charge offs and non-performing assets, however we expect the rate of growth to once again trend lower.  Given the current focus by the investment community on credit quality, we have included the following nine slides which provide credit related information about each of our major loan portfolios.  I will highlight just a few items on each slide.", "Beginning on Slide 10, provides more detail on the commercial loan portfolio which has declined from an average of over $50 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 to approximately $43 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to the lower line utilization and lower demand.  The trend in utilization of outstanding revolving lines of credit is shown on the right hand side of the slide.  The net charge off ratio on the portfolio increased to 2.28% in the fourth quarter with losses coming primarily from the more leveraged sections such as correspondent banking and gaming.  Non-performing commercial loans as a percentage of average loans were 2.05% for the fourth quarter, very comparable to the previous quarter.  ", "Slide 11 provides additional information on the commercial leasing portfolio.  Early stage delinquencies and net charge offs have declined over the last two quarters in this portfolio primarily due to the improvement in small ticket leasing.  ", "Moving on to Slide 12 and the company\u2019s commercial mortgage portfolio.  Average commercial real estate mortgages have increased over the past year due to the lack of permanent financing previously available in the CMBS market.  Approximately 45% of the portfolio is owner occupied.  Overall, net charge offs remain low at just 48 basis points of average loans outstanding.  ", "The commercial real estate construction portfolio is detailed on Slide 13 and is the most stressed portfolio.  The net charge off ratio of 6.24% remains elevated and reflects declines in the market value of both commercial and residential construction properties.  Residential construction loans outstanding have declined from an average of $4.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007 to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009.  13.6% of the loans in this CRE construction portfolio are currently classified as non-performing.", "Turning to the residential mortgage portfolio detailed on Slide 14, the net charge off ratio continues to edge higher currently standing at 2.37% for the fourth quarter of 2009.  On a positive note and similar to the company\u2019s other retail loan portfolios, early stage delinquencies for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased slightly from 2.39% in the third quarter to 2.36% in the fourth quarter.  Restructured residential real estate loans that continue to accrue interest rose by 1.2% this quarter.  ", "As you may recall, our company began actively working with customers to renegotiate loan terms late in 2007 enabling many to keep their homes.  Since late 2007, including loans serviced for others we have modified over 27,000 residential mortgage loans totaling approximately $4.6 billion.  Additionally, we began participating in the HAMP, the government\u2019s mortgage modification program in September of 2009 and have since begun trial modifications on over 7,400 loans or 26% of eligible loans.", "We expect that the number of loan modifications that we complete over time will be lower than the industry average as our initial underwriting was generally more stringent on debt to income.  We are finding that a large percentage of the modification requests we receive are already below the 31% debt to income and therefore do not qualify for HAMP.  Additionally, these loan modifications exclude acquired covered loans which are modified following the terms of the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC.  Going forward we will continue to actively assist our customers whether through HAMP or other programs and support the government\u2019s objective to restore the housing markets.  ", "Slide 15 summarizes our home equity portfolio.  Currently overall demand for the home equity products is down although we grew our average home equity loans by 4% year-over-year.  Our high quality traditional portfolio has performed very well during this cycle with current net charge off cycle of only 1.29%.  The consumer finance originated loans carry lower FICO scores and represent approximately 13% of the total portfolio.  The net charge off ratio on the consumer finance portfolio was 6.56% for the fourth quarter.  ", "Credit card loans are detailed on Slide 16. The net charge off ratio has declined each of the last two quarters due to a portfolio purchase in early September.  On the right hand side of the slide we have adjusted the ratios for this portfolio purchase to show the upward trend in the credit card net charge offs continues.  Given the high quality of our portfolio however, we continue to perform significantly better than the industry average.  Similar to the mortgage and home equity products early stage delinquencies improved on a linked quarter basis.  ", "Slide 17 provides additional detail on the retail leasing portfolio.  Net charge offs have declined as better used car prices have significantly reduced end of term valuation and credit losses.  Finally, Slide 18 summarizes the credit information on other retail loan portfolios.  Early stage delinquencies and net charge offs declined during the fourth quarter and as was the case with retail leasing, the auto loan portfolio loss rate improved as used car prices have rebounded from their lows late last year.", "In summary and going forward, we expect net charge offs and non-performing assets to continue to increase but at a decreasing rate.  Additionally, we will continue to assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and provide for credit losses at a level that reflects changes in the credit risk of the loan portfolio and the current economic conditions.  ", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere ", "The overall quality of our fourth quarter results reflect both the strength and quality of our organization and I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to provide you with a  few more details about the results.  I turn your attention to Slide 19 which gives a full view of our fourth quarter and 2009 results.  Earnings per diluted common share were $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2009 equal to the prior quarter and $0.15 higher than the fourth quarter of 2008.  ", "For the full year 2009 the company earned $0.97 per diluted common share.  Approximately 40% below the full year 2008 as higher credit costs more than offset a 14% increase in operating income.  The key drivers to the company\u2019s fourth quarter results are detailed on Slide 20.  The $0.15 per share increase in year-over-year was the result of a 20.8% increase in net revenue driven by a 9.2% increase in net interest income and a 37.8% increase in non-interest income.  This favorable change in revenue was partially offset by a 15% increase in non-interest expense and higher credit costs.", "Credit costs were impacted by a $478 million increase in net charge offs partially offset by a decrease of $357 million in incremental provision year-over-year as the need for additional reserves lessened.  Earnings per diluted common share were comparable on a linked quarter basis.  Positive variances in net revenue and the provision for credit losses were offset by growth in non-interest expense.  ", "A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our fourth quarter results to prior periods are detailed on Slide 21.  The two significant items in the fourth quarter 2009 were net securities losses of $158 million primarily representing impairment on our SIV exposure and provision in excess of net charge offs of $278 million.  These two items reduced earnings per diluted common share by approximately $0.18.  Significant items in prior comparable periods are listed on Slide 21 and reduced earnings per diluted common share by $0.19 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Turning to Slide 22, net interest income increased year-over-year by $199 million or 9.2% primarily as a result of a $19.4 billion increase in average earning assets, $14.2 billion of which was acquisition related.  Net interest margin was two basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 due to our ability to replace wholesale funding with low costs deposits as well as overall lower funding costs.  On a linked quarter basis net interest income was higher by $203 million due to an $11.3 billion increase in earnings assets, $9.2 billion of which was acquisition related and a 16 basis point increase in net interest margin.", "The net interest margin improved due to the change in mix between wholesale funding and low cost deposits, overall funding costs and a favorable change in loan spreads.  The acquisition of FBOP did not have a material impact on net interest margin.  Assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the low to mid 380s for the first quarter of 2010.  ", "Slide 23 provides additional detail on our growth in average earning assets this quarter.  Year-over-year average total loans grew by 8.2% primarily due to acquisitions while average investment securities increased by $2.2 billion or 5.2%.  Linked quarter average total loans grew by $9.7 billion again, primarily due to acquisitions while average investment securities rose by $1.6 billion or 3.7%.", "Slide 24 breaks down the growth in average total loans by category.  Looking at the chart on the left you can see that the relatively small increase in total average loans, excluding acquisitions was due to a 12.2% drop in average commercial loans as retail residential mortgages and commercial real estate were all higher on a year-over-year basis.  The majority of the loans related to FBOP and Downey, PFF acquisitions were reported as covered assets.", "Covered assets increased by $13.3 billion year-over-year with FBOP and Downey, PFF contributing $8.9 billion and $4.4 billion of the increase respectively.  On a linked quarter basis the growth in average loans was primarily due to acquisitions which accounted for $8.2 billion of the $9.7 billion increase.  Average commercial loans declined by $1.2 billion and were partially offset by increases in residential mortgages and other retail lending.", "Moving to Slide 25, you can see the very favorable growth in low cost core deposits over the past five quarters.  Average total deposits grew by $36.4 billion or 25.2% year-over-year partially due to acquisitions.  Importantly, low cost core deposits, non-interest bearing interest checking, money market and savings excluding acquisitions grew by 35.1%.  This growth reduced the need for wholesale CD and foreign branch funding and contributed to the net interest margin expansion.  On a linked quarter basis average low costs deposits excluding acquisitions grew by $9.2 billion or 7.5% unannualized which again, had a positive impact on the net interest margin.", "Slide 26 presents in more detail the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.  Non-interest income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $553 million or 37.8%.  Excluding the favorable change in net securities losses, non-interest income was higher by 26.7%.  The positive variance was driven by a 10.3% growth in payments related revenue, mortgage banking related growth of $195 million due to the favorable change in the MSR valuation and related hedge of $103 million and a higher gain on sale margins related to a 36.4% increase in production volumes.", "41.2% in commercial product revenue due to concentrated sales efforts related to recent investments in growth initiatives and other higher revenues due to lower end of term lease residual valuation losses and payments contract termination gains.  On a linked quarter basis non-interest income was lower by $77 million primarily due to net significant items which were unfavorable by $121 million, a $58 million reduction in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to a 25.2% reduction in production volume and an unfavorable change in the MSR hedge of $34  million and lower trust and investment management fees, deposit service charge and treasury management fees.", "These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in other revenues related to lower end of term valuation losses and the payments contract termination fee.  Acquisitions had a minimal impact on the variance in fee revenue on a year-over-year or linked quarter basis.  ", "Finally, on Slide 27 we have provided highlights on non-interest expense which was higher year-over-year by $290 million or 15%.  The majority of the increase can be attributed to acquisitions which accounted for $86 million of the increase, higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects which accounted for $79 million of the increase and FDIC insurance expense and other loan expense primarily related to costs associated with other real estate owned.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense was higher by $175 million or 8.5% primarily the result of acquisitions which increased expenses by $66 million, costs related to investments and tax advantage projects which accounted for $60 million of the increase, the elimination on October 1st of the 5% salary reductions related to our early 2009 cost containment initiative, seasonally higher legal and professional expenses and other loan expense associated with other real estate owned.", "Finally, the tax rate on the taxable equivalent basis was approximately 21% in the fourth quarter and full year 2009.  The rate is expected to gradually increase in 2010 with net income over time.  As you turn to Slide 28 I will turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis ", "In the fourth quarter of 2009 our company posted record net revenue, achieved positive year-over-year core operating leverage, continued to lend and grew our core deposit base, preserved the strength of our credit rating and capital base and completed a fourth FDIC assisted transaction adding 150 branches to our franchise.  Just yesterday we announced the completion of the purchase and conversion of 14 additional branches in Nevada from P. W. Parker &T.", "We have positioned this company for growth and we are managing this company for the long term.  Our core businesses continue to perform. We are operating from a solid capital and liquidity position and we are well positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery as we enjoy the benefits of the flight to quality, as we continue to invest in organic initiatives, M&A and joint ventures, as we opportunistically acquire and as we benefit from core businesses that are scalable and can be leveraged as this economy recovers. ", "The coming year will not be without its challenges including a soft economy and its impact on credit quality in addition to the new regulatory and legislative oversight and actions.  I am confident that the momentum we have created during the past very challenging year has positioned U.S. Bancorp to grow and prosper as we continue to prudently lend to creditworthy borrowers, judicially invest in and grow our franchise, support our communities, provide best in class customer service and importantly, create value for our shareholders by sustaining our earnings power, high quality balance sheet and capital strength.", "That concludes our formal remarks.  Andy, Bill and I will now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Some other banks have pointed to signs that loan demand is increasing especially in small business and the lower end of middle market.  I am just wondering if you can comment on what you think your opportunities are there and I guess first if you would agree that there is some signs that it is picking up?", "Richard K. Davis ", "We are seeing short term increases.  We had a nice December in virtually every small business category which includes the cards, traditional lines, SBA, small ticket leasing, across the board.  January is starting out with kind of a moderate continuation but we are not seeing a robust strength so we are not going to call it a trend yet but we would agree that in the last part of the year we saw an uptick that would give us some hope.  ", "In the rest of the markets though we are seeing the rest of the categories, we would see loans as being fairly predictable.  There are some companies in each of the categories that are getting stronger and are starting to move out in front.  They are starting to use lending again as part of their growth initiative but by far the majority of the companies are holding back at this point still using their profitability coming from efficiency and balance sheet management not so much from growth.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Then just separately on credit, your guidance for NPAs and charge offs to increase but at a slower rate and the rate is already pretty low so it feels like 1Q is probably about the peak.  One, is that a fair characterization ?  And two, shouldn\u2019t the reserve build be about done if that is the case?", "Richard K. Davis ", "Your conclusion is right, that is exactly one we wanted you to make.  We are getting down to the point where we have been completely consistent on that trajectory and it has been accurate and we are going to say it again because we are getting close to splitting hairs here.  We are going to get down to very nominal increases of both NPAs and charge offs in linked quarter.  We would agree, we are getting close to inflection as long as there are no big surprises that we don\u2019t predict in the economy.", "Having said that, you can continue to expect the provision as you are seeing we\u2019ll build it at a lesser rate until we think we have a solid consistent pattern of improvement.  Once we see that, we believe our ratios are sufficiently acceptable and then you won\u2019t see us add to the provision.  We are not quite there, that will be a lacking effect to our consistent expectations of the inflections near term for charge offs and NPAs.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "So just to be clear, even if charge offs and NPAs are flat or down a little bit say in 2Q there will still be some loan loss reserve build?", "Richard K. Davis ", "I think so because we just want to be abundantly careful to make sure that we see a repeated consistency.  So one quarter in this environment isn\u2019t enough to convince all of us that we\u2019re done.  A couple of quarters, yes and because it is just a matter of time and not a matter of facts we\u2019ll probably continue to add to the provision a little longer until we\u2019re sure.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions, one on the dividend you had indicated in the past that two consider any action on the dividend you needed line of sight on earnings and clarification from regulators on capital.  Could you maybe just give us an update especially given that Basel III has been announced?  I know it is not from the US regulators but how does that factor in to your thinking to what you need to hear from the regulators [inaudible] line of sight on that.", "Richard K. Davis ", "I think they are related actually.  I do not know if we are actually calling it Basel III yet but it is getting that nomenclature.  Let\u2019s agree, our line of sight is still very good for the company and you might guess we are stress testers par excellence, we know how to stress test the company and we feel that a nominal dividend increase is quite reasonable for this company.  But, we also realize and respect the need to work with the regulators who are working on Basel, they are working what eventually will become G20 constructs for our global capitalization and most recently they came out with new guidance for both dividend and stock repurchase paperwork that needs to be completed to confirm our preparation and that is connected to Basel.", "All that being said, we continue to work with our regulators to comply with all that necessary information.  We know that they are seeking and we agree that the economy needs to be on firm footing longer than it has been so far.  So, my characterization would be that despite our own confidence in our own numbers, and I would suspect even our regulator\u2019s confidence in our predictions under the backdrop of an uncertain economy it is prudent for all of us to wait a little longer until we see some stability.  Then, we will fulfill the final requirements of the very tedious but appropriate paperwork that needs to be complied with in terms of providing capital guidance and the necessary stress testing that goes along with it.  Andy, you might add to that?", "Andrew Cecere ", "We are working with the regulators on a number of different aspects of Basel II and fulfilling our requirements there and we are on track with our own schedules and with the regulators.", "Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "The new guidance regarding the dividend, the stock buyback that came out is related to making sure that the stress tests have been done sufficiently to warrant a change in those policies.  Is that right?", "Richard K. Davis ", "It really is a stress test overlaid and intersected with capital and being able to say stress test isn\u2019t just a matter of loan quality or earnings but they intersect it with your current capital positions, your ability to earn and generate capital and the quality of your forward view.  Put all that together and then they still need to intersect that with what will be the eventual capital guidelines which they have not come out with which we are all waiting for.  So until those intersect plus the economy needs a little longer to go.  We think we will be among the first to assess that decision.  We are in the queue for that but we also appreciate the fact that waiting makes sense for all reasons.", "Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "The stress test is kind of fluid, right?  It is not the exact same one as was done last April?", "Andrew Cecere ", "No.  That\u2019s a stress test that we do on our own numbers and forecast and projections and we do that ever quarter.  So it is something that we do on our won and use our own projections and our own definitions of what a stressed economy would look like.  ", "Richard K. Davis ", "But those stress test definitions to be accepted by the regulators as a real appropriate stress test they would agree with so they can make the assessment against our own evaluation.", "Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then a separate question on this tax that is being suggested, I know it has to go through Congress, etc. but can you just give us a sense as to what the potential impact could be on your organization and how you anticipate managing for that?", "Richard K. Davis ", "You mean the financial crisis responsibility fee?", "Betsey Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Correct.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Which of course is something we all agree hasn\u2019t been approved yet.  We understand why it is coming about and we can account for that in our forward view.  If it is a July 1st kind of event and we are looking at the 2010 impact for us it is $125 to $150 million on a full year basis.  So for us that would be about half that number.  We also appreciate that there may be some different definitions which will change, what is included or not included.  But, based on our really good core funding and our strong earnings, I think the impact to our EPS as forecasted actually by many of you is not insignificant but it is in the 2% to 4% kind of a range on full year 2011 and that is something that obviously we can manage and we intend to make up for it in discontinued excess performance and make sure our shareholders don\u2019t feel it.", "Andrew Cecere ", "The impact to us has really been diminished over the last four or five quarters as we have experienced tremendous deposit growth with the flight to quality that we talked about.  Given that loan demand has been a little weak out there, we have become much more deposit funded as an organization overall.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Having said that though I must say that I am disappointed at the idea of there being kind of one side to this all.  We will forever be in that kind of middle ground of being large enough to hit all kinds of systemic important companies being a $280 billion but we\u2019re also going to fight the good fight that we are a fairly simply company and we are in the very basic business of banking and payments and some of these things are perhaps levied at us just based on our size and in some cases based on the actions of a lot of companies in the last few years and a lot of those actions that we did not take.  ", "On calls like this we were withstanding some of the alternatives that some of the others were taking to make a lot of money and we didn\u2019t.  I am going to continue to be outspoken on trying to keep U.S. Bank in the family of what is right in the industry but I am going to continue to distinguish us from not being cast with the masses when it comes to things like fees, reputation, impacts and taxation.  I am against it because I don\u2019t think it is right.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John MacDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "John MacDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Andy, the net interest margin was significantly better than your guidance.  I was just wondering what surprised you on the up side and do you still have an upward bias in your outlook for first quarter or do you really expect it to be kind of flattish this time?", "Andrew Cecere ", "I really do expect it to be flattish John.  It wasn\u2019t any one single item I would say it is a combination of three or four things.  First, loan spreads both in the wholesale and the retail categories all were a slight bit better than our projections.  Secondly, our core deposit growth continues as you see from the numbers.  That overall core deposit funding is at a lower costs.  Finally, our overall wholesale funding levels are a little bit lower than our expectations.  So it is a combination of all those things and given that level of trend we do expect it to be relatively stable in the low to mid 380s for the first quarter.", "Richard K. Davis ", "John, as you compare it to last year\u2019s fourth quarter where we had that blip to 383 based on Downey primarily.  This is a more sustainable across the board repeatable kind of margin improvement that we feel confident in settling around there.", "John MacDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Andy, a follow up on your guidance about the tax rate, starting the year at 21% or so, does it ramp up slowly or does it depend on your profitability ramp?  What is driving that?", "Andrew Cecere ", "It will ramp up consistent with our profitability so I would expect a moderate ramp up not a significant increase.", "John MacDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Towards what ultimately might be a normal tax rate for you guys?", "Andrew Cecere ", "As we look at the full year of 2010 I would expect somewhere in the low 20s, between 22% and 25% tax adjusted.", "John MacDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co.", "Then the final thing, Richard was asked kind of in the past trying to understand the cumulative impact of a number of acquisitions that you have done trying to assess how much of these deals are in your current earnings and how much is still to come.  Any sense of the cumulative impact the deals might have on 2010 and beyond on your earnings power?", "Andrew Cecere ", "What I would tell you is we try to isolate the specific expense items as you noted and the loan growth and deposit growth items in the slides and you can see the numbers there.  I would say as you look at the revenue growth that occurred here in the fourth quarter, about 20% of that revenue growth was related to the acquisition impact, FBOP, PFF and Downey and the remaining 80% was really core so you can work through the numbers.  Most of that increase was in the margins section.  The income component was relatively modest it was principally in margin.", "Richard K. Davis ", "To add to that, the company a few years ago might well have had acquisitions like this and it would have been more a play to save the expenses, run off the high cost deposits and move along.  In the last couple of years this companies now takes in an acquisition and brings it on for more customers.  We protect the depositors.  We intend to develop relationships and not lose them just based on price and we are not looking for the cost savings as much, we are looking for the revenue growth.", "So what I would say to you is these acquisitions are joining the core franchise now in being more of a revenue focused company and so there is an additional attribute there, a synergy that comes along with it that you should just include in the company being bigger doing better which is in our numbers as we think going forward.  But, if I perform for you guys like we said we would this company entirely will perform better with higher levels of revenue and higher levels of operating leverage going forward because we have positioned ourselves to grow as opposed to just being stable with expenses coming down.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "I was hoping we could get a bit more information on the modifications specifically if you could repeat the dollar amounts again and also redefault rates, what is sitting in non-performing versus performing, level of debt forgiveness, etc., any information you could give us would be great.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Let\u2019s have Bill do that.  I am going to remind you one of my comments was though the HAMP program gets all the headlines, it is not the only program that a lot of us participate in particularly banks like ours that have participated in FDIC deals.  In November of 2008 one of our agreements with the FDIC was to be the first bank besides Indy Mac that they at the time owned that would adopt the FDIC modification program.  So, we have done that and in fact it is a bigger number for us than HAMP having started HAMP in September.  ", "Also, long before either of those events we were doing what was right for customers by keeping them in their houses and saving ourselves from owning a home.  I just want the cover story that it isn\u2019t just HAMP.  I said it in my comments and I will say it again, you won\u2019t see us in those monthly HAMP reports probably above the median.  We simply don\u2019t have that kind of base of customers or that kind of loan-to-value portfolio that will give us the ability to have big numbers and that is actually a good thing.  But headlines will always rank banks and [inaudible] those that have the highest number are the ones doing the best and in some cases it is quite the opposite.  ", "P. W. Parker ", "We have about a little over $1.3 billion of restructured mortgage loans and those are the accruing restructured loans.  We look at both the 60 day redefault rate which is what the regulators use and then we also look at a rate where things enter foreclosure.  Our 60 day rate is 27.5% and ones that ultimately wind up in foreclosure is 17.6%.  The 27.5% compares to what the OCC put out in their third quarter modification report where it shows industry averages are close to 50% on that.  So ours are running significantly better than that. ", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Any information on debt forgiveness.", "P. W. Parker ", "We do have programs for debt forgiveness.  If you run through the HAMP process obviously you don\u2019t get there but we do have our own modification programs so we do sometimes look at that because the cost of putting off the 114 reserve can be significant so sometimes it is in the bank\u2019s and the borrowers best interest to do debt forgiveness.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Heather what we are learning to is there is a new psyche around borrowers and we are learning that sometimes lower payments, sometimes lower principle, sometimes combinations causes permanent behavior changes and sometimes it doesn\u2019t.  So despite best efforts if you don\u2019t hit the right psyche with the right borrower you\u2019ll do all these actions and they will continue to default or they\u2019ll walk away.  I think the whole industry is learning new reactions to new actions that are coming along and probably in another couple of quarters we\u2019ll probably figure out the best, highest, most efficient way to protect a customer and get them to stay with the home and give us the benefit of not having a property and them staying in it.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "I just had one other quick question on deposit growth.  It sounds like it has been sort of surprising you guys to the upside, I know it has been surprising me to the upside.  Do you have any color going forward about what to expect and maybe what to expect in different rate backdrops as well?", "Andrew Cecere ", "Heather our deposit growth has been across categories both retail and wholesale, across geographies throughout our states and it has been incremental positive each and every quarter.  As we look forward I would expect to continue to see growth in our deposits.  We have become a little bit more aggressive in retail deposit pricing.  I would not expect to see the same level of robust growth that we have seen in the last few quarters but still continued growth.  Given our expectation around the continuation of moderate loan demand I think you will see us continue to be more deposit funded.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Let me add to that, there are a couple of other things.  We have over 1,000  of our 3,000 branches are in small communities and we have a community banking strategy that forever has been unique and different and it is our secret weapon.  As you might guess the propensity of banks that are under stress are small community banks these days and in those markets it is latent, it comes a little later than the beginning of the recession but customers start looking around thinking, \u201cWow I really need to put my money in a bigger, safer name,\u201d in many cases.  So we are seeing robust growth and it just doesn\u2019t come out in the details.  ", "Secondly, we have a corporate trust business that starts to gen up again as the market starts to warm up.  There is a lot of good core deposits that come in that category.  Then lastly, our corporate banking strategy which we have been talking about for two years, typically we get visibility because of the actions we are taking now on the balance sheet or in our capital markets but one of the undertows to that status is more deposits that come along with those relations.  All of those are adding together well above just what would be more deposits from each customer.  We have a lot more customers each with deposits.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Konrad \u2013 Keffe, Bruyette & Woods.", "David Konrad \u2013 Keffe, Bruyette & Woods", "I had a question regarding FDIC deals.  I mean your capital ratio has held in very well this quarter despite the FBOP deal which I think speaks to your capital generation capabilities.  But maybe from an operational standpoint, what\u2019s your appetite over the near term to look at more FDIC deals?  Then kind of bigger picture how do you view the tradeoffs or the rankings between building your footprint through FDIC deals and increasing the dividend?", "Richard K. Davis ", "We said last time and we are sticking to it, FDIC deals  need to be big enough and meaningful enough for us to put our company through the distraction.  So, we are still looking at deals that have, I don\u2019t know what I said last time, but probably 50 to 100 branches to make it worth the effort.  That means we\u2019re taking out of our near term scope the small bank of Idaho deals that we did last spring and those sort of deals.  They are just distraction costs more than they are financial costs.", "If we look at those deals of the size that I spoke to, FBOP is a great example, if we don\u2019t feel we can protect those capital levels and continue to grow with our own operating performance then we won\u2019t make that trade off.  In other words, if we can\u2019t grow through it we won\u2019t put our burden either on the risk of the dividend being deferred longer or the risk of our capital levels falling.  So, it has got to hit that sweet spot and that has a lot to do with our own confidence in our earnings which is why we stress test everything to make sure before we do a deal we can afford to make those tradeoffs.", "But, dividend is very important which relates to capital, we will protect it as a precious asset as it is.  But, if a great deal comes along and we can afford it and it is meaningful enough to cause a distraction to the company we will grab it and move forward.  So a lot of what you have seen in the past is what we will do.", "David Konrad \u2013 Keffe, Bruyette & Woods", "What is your views of the Chicago market with the recent deal you certainly increased your position in Chicago but the market share is still light relative to too many people in that market so what is your plans with Chicago?", "Richard K. Davis ", "In Chicago we are number nine now, I think up from 13 in total deposit market share.  What I like about Chicago and it is what I know about California having been a native is it is not the entire market, it is not Chicago land it is the markets we are in.  We are a very heavy western franchise neighborhood bank now moving in to the south with FBOP, not so much actually in the city but enough to be connected to the commuters.  So while I would love to be more than nine and we will make an effort to be more relevant in that market, we have got enough market position in the communities that I think it is a unique strategy, it is kind of a combo between large metro and community and for us it is working quite well.", "So if I could go from nine to say five or six and strengthen the total performance in each of those markets, we would be satisfied with that.  Getting to the top three will probably take longer but it is a goal to grow Chicago and to become relevant in its entirety but certainly we\u2019ll start at each market level.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Richard, last quarter you talked a little bit about deposit service charges and you thought that maybe the things sat last quarter it might be 20% or so out of revenues.  Just based on what you know now do you think that is still valid?", "Richard K. Davis ", "Yeah I do.  First we have a two step process coming up in our life on that topic and this is all pre what may come out of the Consumer Protection Agency that I am sure will come about.  In the end of the first quarter we have our own identified opportunities to improve the transaction routines and improve the reaction from our customers by changing the maximum number of overdrafts and the dollar amounts and all of that.  That occurs at the end of this quarter and then at the beginning of the third quarter we will follow the rules of the Federal Reserve that has come up with yet a different overlay on rules and regulations on NSF and OD. ", "All those without any sense for what kind of new offsets we might create and I don\u2019t mean just service charges but new ways of relating to customers and their total relationship.  That for us is a $200 to $300 million kind of impact for U.S. Bank this year and we will still as I said, await what will be the potential further negative of what I think the Consumer Protection Agency will probably overlay on some of those fees which they will consider either a nuisance or accepted.", "On the other hand, I do think we and not related to what others do so much as what we want to do with our customers is find a better value proposition where we can create different paradigms that include how you can be covered, to provide insurance to customer when the in fact don\u2019t want to be surprised.  I think we\u2019re all expecting this opt in opt out to be a moment of time where we will learn a lot about customer behavior.  We are expecting extremely low levels of opt in after people begin opting out because we simply aren\u2019t going to build those financial expectations and if they come along we\u2019ll be surprised pleasantly.", "In other words, we\u2019re expecting a very, very low percentage of people after they begin in the opt out in July 1st or August 15th to want to jump back in until they experience a moment of embarrassment at which point they may say, \u201cTell me again now what are my choices?\u201d  And we want to have a much better menu of options to say, \u201c Look if you don\u2019t want to be caught without money at a certain point of time there are a number of different programs or alternatives we can give you to make sure you have an insurance to get through your life because perhaps your behaviors up until now you were paying a lot but you were also getting a lot.\u201d  ", "So we\u2019re expecting $200 to $300 million loss this year.  By next year at this time I think we will have a much better understanding of behaviors, customers\u2019 willingness to pay for certain services and by then John I think we\u2019ll have a much better clarity around it.  But, for now we\u2019re expecting the worse.", "John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Will you be very aggressive in trying to urge customers to opt in?", "Richard K. Davis ", "No, we\u2019re not going to do that because I want them to do it when they have decided, I want them to initiate it.  So if I were to tell you ahead of time to opt in because something that hasn\u2019t happened to you, it won\u2019t be a very sustainable opt in. The rules are going to require us to have you opt in every time you have an issue.  So, I\u2019d really rather have you have the moment that you know to call us the minute something happens.  I mean think of the alternatives, with mobile banking and stuff like that we could easily create a product where if you have an overdraft circumstance, step out of line, dial this following number or input something in your mobile phone and all of a sudden we\u2019ll transfer money over, then go back in line and get your transaction.", "There are lots of ways, or prefunded debt cards we\u2019ll give you to put in your pocket in case you have to flip another card out at a moment of uncertainty.  So, I think there will be plenty of ways to give customers alternatives and opt in will be probably the last reaction to a choice of in or out.  I think there will be a lot of better alternatives, I don\u2019t want to force people in.", "John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", " ", "Just one quick follow up, just on the small business lending I think you have talked a little bit about your focus on that and maybe that was a promise to the Administration to go back and relook at the category, but any surprises or is it about what you expected?", "Richard K. Davis ", "You mean the second look?", "John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Richard K. Davis ", "So second look is really working.  It is a fairly nominal opportunity to override basically the computer programming that goes along.  Small business is not manually underwritten but when you have now a loan that is close call and it was going to be turned down by the computer, we do outsource it to a human.  A human who takes a look at the circumstances and sees maybe what the computer couldn\u2019t.  I would say probably in low 10% to 15% levels we might find a way to make that deal.", "It is not huge but it is better than zero.

Are you seeing some of your competition doing the same thing right now?", "Andrew Cecere ", "About a year and a half ago I would say we were in the lower quartile in terms of deposit pricing in the marketplaces that we were in and in addition there were a number of competitors who were very aggressive outside of what I would call normal balance in terms of deposit pricing.  So two things have occurred number one, we made a decision to be at least at the median in most of our markets.  We felt that was where we needed to be in addition to the convenience and quality of our company we needed deposit pricing in the median.  Secondly, many of the competitors have moderated their level of pricing.  So those two things combined I think are certainly key factors in our ability to grow retail deposits.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Lastly, just given the interest rate scenario analysis you guys conducted, do you anticipate the margin comfortably rising above the 4% range maybe to the 4.25% range in the longer term as NPAs decline?", "Andrew Cecere ", "As I said in our prepared comments, we expect relatively stable low 380s given the current rate environment and yield curve.  As you can see from our Q and you\u2019ll see from our K, we continue to be slightly asset sensitive so to the extent rates increase that will help us modestly.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "So stable next quarter but in the longer term say two to three years out is there any reason structurally why you can\u2019t get back to a 4% to 4.25% range that you see?", "Andrew Cecere ", "No, there is no structural reason we can\u2019t but we\u2019re not projecting out that far.", "Richard K. Davis ", "We report [24] a couple of years ago and one of those issues was not defending deposit pricing and we\u2019re not that bank before.  So that is one probably difference between before and after.  Also, we\u2019re going to stay on the high quality asset generation so we may not enjoy some of the higher margins that come with higher risk.  We\u2019re simply going to stay in the conservative category and kind of earn it the old fashion way.   I don\u2019t know that it couldn\u2019t get back up there David but we don\u2019t see that, at least in the next couple of years as an outcome without having to stretch for it and we\u2019re not going to stretch for it.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "You guys gave some of the impact from FBOP on expenses, fees and loans, what was the impact on net interest income for the fourth quarter and what was the impact on the margin?", "Andrew Cecere ", "There was no material impact to margin Mike and net interest income was just about $100 million.  ", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "The HAMP program on the credit losses, the charge offs were what 2.54%.  If not for the HAMP program what would have charge offs been?", "P. W. Parker ", "Are you talking about our total residential mortgage charge off rate and what it would have been without the HAMP?", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "Yes.  Yesterday Citigroup gave a number.", "P. W. Parker ", "We don\u2019t have that calculated.  It would not be a material difference.  Most of our HAMP program is in the FDIC covered but on the securitization portfolio.  So a lot of it is not on the balance sheet.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "You mentioned loan utilization went from 32% in the third quarter down to 30%.  I thought last quarter you said it was an all time low so is this a new all time low for loan utilization?", "Richard K. Davis Yes it is and it was 385 a year ago so it is a big drop.  We saw a little uptick in November and then it came back down in December so it was short lived.  That might be yearend issues of companies.  Remember this is primarily our wholesale customer who have the open to buy, they have got the line available and they are paying it down.  That is the best indicator, and I have used this when we have talked to the Administration as well, the best indicator of loan demand is the people who have it can use it, it is there if they want it, it is a preferred rate and they don\u2019t.  Until that starts to turn that is your best proxy for what the real loan demand is out in the real world and we\u2019re not seeing it.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "When you say wholesale customer, can you define that?", "Richard K. Davis ", "That is going to be anybody above small business even in community banking.  So small business is not included but anything from lower middle market to middle market to corporate including commercial real estate in communities and in the large market.  So, everything but small business.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "So there is just not demand, you are willing to loan but there is no demand?", "Richard K. Davis ", "You got it.  That is a good sound bite.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.", "Then last thing, you went through a lot of onetime or noise in the quarter and I guess I can always follow up afterwards, you had over provisioning, you had securities losses, you had a low tax rate and it seemed like you had some other noise in expenses and also fees, the other line.  Is there anything else you\u2019d want to really highlight in expenses and fees as being kind of non-permanent?", "Andrew Cecere ", "You know in expenses Mike the fourth quarter is traditionally a high level market for tax amortization expense related to our tax advantage programs and that is typically a seasonal activity that obviously occurs in the fourth quarter.  That would be the principle item there.  Many of the other things are acquisition related and they are going to be in the run rate on a go forward basis.", "Richard K. Davis ", "I don\u2019t want you to think it was a noisy quarter because I thought it was pretty straight forward but, I will add one more thing.  We did mention the impact of our cost containment activity in February of last year.  When the market was obviously getting worse, we thought it was prudent to take a 5% expense reduction across the company and we did.  Then in October we thought that things were steadying back a bit and the company\u2019s revenue was strong enough and we added it back to the pleasure of the employees and that run rate shows up in the linked quarter aspect but that is now the appropriate run rate that we are back at. ", "But, were it not for those actions last year we wouldn\u2019t have been able to offset some of the other loan loss charges and things as well.  So, we are pleased we did it but that would be a non-sustainable linked quarter effect too Mike.  But, other than that I think we should see it as a pretty standard operating.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Greenberg \u2013 Brave Warrior Advisors.", "Glenn Greenberg \u2013 Brave Warrior Advisors", "Your non-interest income you haven\u2019t really commented on in the Q&A but it seems to be coming on very strong and I know you said you have a goal of having that be about equal to your net interest income.  I wanted to get your thoughts on whether you see perhaps a potential for it to exceed net interest income given the slow growth in the economy?", "Richard K. Davis ", "I do.  A couple of years ago it was ahead of net interest income because margins were tight, they yield curve wasn\u2019t very yielded well and our payments and trust businesses were gang busters.  It is the complete opposite right now and our payments and trust businesses are just wide opened for business.  As I said before, the freeway has got lots of lanes there are just not that many cars on it but when they are ready we\u2019re ready.  So I think with a higher margin and a higher asset balance sheet growth coupled with what will soon be the emerging growth again of payments and trusts, I\u2019d love them to compete with each other for 50/50 at intensely higher levels than a couple of years ago and I think we\u2019re on that path.  It will lag but it will eventually start giving net interest a run for their money.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Analyst for Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Analyst for Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "You guys were one of the first to really go to the FDIC assisted deals with Downey and PFF.  I was wondering if any of the economics changed year-over-year from when you did FBOP compared to the first two?", "Andrew Cecere I would say that the economics were very similar.  The expectations in terms of deposit run off are consistent, the actual are consistent with our expectations.  Thus far with FBOP it is starting out the same.  The incremental revenue impacts from just having more outlets so to speak in the California marketplace are very positive as Richard mentioned so no, they haven\u2019t changed substantially.", "Richard K. Davis ", "Ken, this is interesting but Downey and PFF really were thrift kind of deals and they were consumer deals and they were mortgage deals.  FBOP was a core bank deal with commercial real estate and wholesale customers.  So, as much as they looked a lot alike, they were entirely different and I would say that we learned a lot from Downey and our better ability to value something like an FBOP by knowing the difference and each has it different attributes.  But, between those two there\u2019s not a deal that I can think of that the FDIC could put before us that we wouldn\u2019t have high confidence in knowing exactly how to model and be able to optimize our bid in order to get the best deal if any of those comes along.", "So, we have kind of seen both ranges of it and I have got to say I have to give props to the FDIC.  They are good to work with, they give us good feedback along the way from the closing night all the way through the accounting issues we have had very good success and have enjoyed that relationship.", "Analyst for Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "One quick follow up on the margin, I know you said there was no impact, I am assuming that refers to the purchase accounting but was there any restructuring done to FBOP\u2019s balance sheet that could have strengthened their core margin?", "Andrew Cecere ", "No.  We brought down the loans to fair market value and that\u2019s reflected in the run rate but the impact to the margin was immaterial.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time.

(Operator Instructions).", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Tuesday, April 27 at 12 midnight Eastern Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judy Murphy", "Thank you, Ashley, and good morning to everyone who have joined our call today. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter 2010 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedule are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin on page three of the presentation and note some of the highlights of our first quarter 2010 results. U.S. Bank reported a net income of $669 million for the first quarter of 2010 or $0.34 per diluted common share. Earnings were $0.10 or 42% higher than the same quarter of last year and $0.04 higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. Total net revenue of $4.3 billion in the first quarter was 11.3% higher than the same quarter of 2009. With an industry leading efficiency ratio of 49% in the first quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage on a linked quarter basis. We experienced strong year-over-year average deposit growth of 13.7%, while average loans grew by 3.9%. Growth in both categories benefited from recent acquisitions.", "As expected, net charge-offs and non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, increased this quarter, but at a more moderate rate, with both categories rising by approximately 2%. Importantly, the provision for loan losses declined on both a year-over-year and a linked quarter basis, as the increase in net charge-offs was more than offset by a decline in reserve build. We maintained our strong capital position, with the Tier-1 capital ratio and Tier-1 common ratio increasing to 9.9% and 7.1% respectively at March 31.", "On Slide Four, we show our performance metrics over the past five quarters. Return on average assets in the current quarter was 0.96% and return on average common equity was 10.5%, above the returns posted in each of the past four quarters. The first quarter results included two significant items, which were net security losses of $34 million and provision expense in excess of net charge-offs of $175 million. Excluding these significant items, which Andy will discuss in a few minutes, return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been approximately 1.19% and 13.1% respectively.", "The five quarter trends of our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph at the right hand of Slide Four. Our net interest margin of 3.90% improved over the prior quarter by 7 basis points, primarily due to the lower funding cost. Our first quarter efficiency ratio of 49% was essentially flat to the prior quarter.", "Turning to Slide Five, our capital positions remain strong. As previously noted, our Tier-1 capital and Tier-1 common equity ratios rose to 9.9% and 7.1% respectively at March 31. Additionally, our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio rose 3.8% from March 31, 2009 to 5.6% at March 31, 2010. Our company continues to generate significant capital each quarter, due to our diverse mix of businesses, a number of which are less capital intensive than our traditional balance sheet businesses, in addition to our superior efficiency ratio and ongoing profitability.", "Given our ability to generate significant capital, even under adverse economic circumstances, we believe we have the capacity to return more of our capital to shareholders through an increase in our dividend rates. However, as I have indicated in the past, we must continue to defer a dividend action until we see clear evidence that the economy has recovered and is sustainable, and we receive clear regulatory capital guidelines and approval. I am aware of how important the dividend is to our shareholders and I can assure you that we will continue to work closely with our regulators to help facilitate their decision-making process.", "Moving on to Slide Six, average total loans outstanding increased by $7.2 billion year-over-year. As noted on the slide, excluding acquisitions, total average loans declined 2.9% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, total average loans increased by 0.6%, driven again by acquisitions. The lack of growth in average total loans outstanding, excluding acquisitions, was largely due to the lower usage of revolving lines of credit by our commercial and corporate customers. Utilization of outstanding commitments by these borrowers declined from an average of about 30% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to approximately 28% in the first quarter of 2010. Despite this reduction in the balance of average loans outstanding, we are continuing to see the benefits of flight to quality as we gain new customers, and believe that our balances are declining less than those of our peers.", "We continue to originate and renew lines and loans for our customers who want and need credit. In fact, during the first quarter of 2010, U.S. Bank originated nearly $9 billion of residential mortgages. We originated over $4 billion of consumer loans, including installment loans, student loans, lines of credit, and home equity lines and loans. We originated new prime based credit card accounts with lines totaling $2 billion, and we issued $6.6 billion of new commitments and renewed $14.6 billion of commitments to small businesses, commercial, and commercial real estate customers.", "Overall, excluding mortgage production, new origination plus new and renewed commitments were over $27 billion, somewhat lower than the previous quarter\u2019s total, again indicating that the demand for new loans remain subdued. We continue to be open for business, and eager to meet the credit needs of our current and new creditworthy customers.", "Total average deposits increased by $22 billion over the same quarter of last year and $1.6 billion on a linked quarter basis. Excluding acquisitions, the growth rate was 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. On a linked quarter basis, excluding acquisitions, average deposits declined by 1.7%, primarily due to lower average DDA balances in wholesale banking and in corporate trust. Importantly however, savings deposits, which include interest checking, regular savings, and money market savings, were higher than the fourth quarter by 3.4%, reflecting a number of our recent growth initiatives, including our new S.T.A.R.T. program, Savings Today And Rewards Tomorrow, and our consumer and small business product packages.", "Turning to Slide Seven, the company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.3 billion. The growth in core revenue was driven by earning asset growth and expanding net interest margins, our fee-based businesses, growth initiatives, and acquisitions.", "Moving on to credit as we turn to Slide Eight, as we predicted for you last quarter, the rate of increase in net charge-offs moderated on a linked quarter basis. First quarter net charge-offs of $1,135,000,000 were 2% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. This percentage increase was lower than the 7% increase recorded between the third and fourth quarters of last year. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, increased by $91 million or 2%. This percentage increase was also lower than the fourth quarter's linked quarter growth of 5%. Notably, excluding covered loans, early and late stage delinquencies in all major loan categories improved during the first quarter. This first quarter's nominal increases in net charge-offs and non-performing assets, in addition to the favorable change in early and late stage delinquencies, indicates the linearity in inflection points in credit quality. Accordingly, we expect the level of both net charge-offs and non-performing assets to be relatively stable in the second quarter.", "Turning to Slide Nine, you can see that as expected, given the moderating but still upward trend in both net charge-offs and non-performing assets, we increased the allowance for credit losses this quarter by recording a $175 million incremental provision for loan losses. This represented approximately 15% of the current quarter\u2019s total net charge-offs of approximately $1.1 billion. This compares with an incremental provision equal to 25% of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2009 and to 67% of net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2009. This incremental provision raised the company\u2019s allowance for credit losses to period end loans at March 31, excluding covered assets, to 3.2%, up from 3.04% at December 31. The ratio of allowance to non-performing loans, excluding covered assets, ended the quarter at 136%. With the expectation that the level of net charge-offs and non-performing assets will remain relatively stable during the second quarter, the amount of reserve build as a percentage of net charge-offs is also expected to decline.", "The following eight slides provide credit-related information about each of our major loan portfolios, and I will highlight just a few items on each.", "Slide 10 provides more detail on the commercial loan portfolio, which has declined from an average of over $49 billion in the first quarter of 2009 to approximately $41 billion in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the lower line utilization and soft demand for new loans. The net charge-off ratio on the portfolio increased to 2.41% in the first quarter, but the early and late stage delinquencies as well as the non-performing loans to total loan ratio improved on a linked quarter basis. Overall, asset quality measures are improving for the commercial loan portfolio.", "Slide 11 provides additional information on the commercial leasing portfolio. Delinquencies and the level of non-performing loans have stabilized in this portfolio, primarily due to the improvement in BEFG, our Business Equipment Finance Group, where losses peaked in the first half of 2009.", "Moving on to Slide 12 and the company\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio. Average total commercial real estate loans have increased over the past year, primarily due to the growth in CRE mortgages, or a lack of permanent financing previously available in the CMBS market, has allowed us to extend financing. Net charge-offs on the CRE mortgage portfolio remain low at 73 basis points of average loans outstanding and key credit metrics reflect stable trends.", "The net charge-off ratio on the commercial real estate construction portfolio, however, remains elevated. Delinquencies of that portfolio have however improved significantly year-over year, and property values are stabilizing.", "Turning to the residential mortgage portfolio detailed on Slide 13, the net charge-off ratio edged lower than the first quarter to 2.23% of average loans outstanding. Importantly, early and late stage delinquencies for the residential mortgage portfolio improved significantly. This improvement was seen in both the traditional branch originated portfolio and in our consumer finance group portfolio, where loans with higher LPVs and lower FICO scores reside. Our company has been actively working with mortgage customers to renegotiate loan terms since late 2007, beginning with our own modification programs and now including both the FDIC's modification program and HAMP. Since 2007, including loans serviced for others, we have modified over 33,500 residential mortgage loans, totaling approximately $5.8 billion.", "Slide 14 summarizes the performance of our home equity portfolio. The majority of this portfolio, 87%, was originated through our retail branch network. This traditional portfolio has performed well during this cycle, as demonstrated by the current quarter's net charge-off rate of just 1.25%. The remaining 13% of the portfolio is primarily broker-originated and is managed by the consumer finance group. Both segments contributed to the improvements in delinquencies and net charge-offs this quarter.", "Credit card loans are detailed on Slide 15. Average loans outstanding grew by over 20% year-over-year, but declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2009. The net charge-off ratio during the past three quarters has been impacted by portfolio purchases made in September of last year and we have adjusted for the transactions in the chart on the right side of the slide. Similar to the other major loan categories, early and late stage delinquencies improved, while net charge-offs increased over the prior quarter, reflecting loan growth trends over the past number of quarters. Going forward, losses on the credit card portfolio are expected to stabilize, but remain elevated as long as unemployment remains high. Given the high quality of our portfolio, however, we expect to continue to perform significantly better than the industry average.", "Slide 16 provides additional detail on the retail leasing portfolio. Net charge-offs and delinquencies have significantly improved since the first quarter of 2009, as better used car prices have significantly reduced end-of-term valuation and credit losses.", "Finally, Slide 17 summarizes the credit information on the other retail loan portfolios, a breakdown by product of which is provided in the pie chart on the right. Early and late stage delinquencies improved in the first quarter, while net charge-offs remained stable. Similar to retail leasing, the auto loan portfolio loss rate improved as used car prices rebounded from their lows.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I will take just a few minutes to provide you with more details about the results. I turn your attention to Slide 18, which gives a full view of our first quarter 2010 results compared to those reported for the fourth and first quarters of 2009.", "Earnings per diluted common share were $0.34 for the first quarter of 2010, $0.04 higher than the prior quarter and $0.10 higher than the first quarter of 2009. The key drivers for the company's first quarter results are detailed on Slide 19. The $140 million or 26.5% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of an 11.3% increase in net revenue, driven by a 14.7% increase in net interest income, and a 7.3% increase in non-interest income. This favorable change in total revenue was partially offset by a 14.2% increase in non-interest expense. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter were slightly lower than prior year's quarter, as the $347 million increase in net charge-offs was more than offset by a decrease of $355 million in incremental provision, as the need for additional reserves declined.", "Net income was $67 million or 11.1% higher on a linked quarter basis. Seasonally lower net revenue was offset by lower operating expenses and again, a favorable variance in the provision for credit losses.", "A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our first quarter results to prior periods are detailed on Slide 20. The two significant items in the first quarter of 2010 were the net securities losses of $34 million, primarily representing impairment on our SIV exposure, and provision in excess of net charge-offs of $175 million. Note that the first quarter of 2009 included a $92 million on a corporate real estate transaction, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons of the other income line.", "Turning to Slide 21, net interest income increased year-over-year by $308 million or 14.7%, primarily due to a $13.5 billion increase in average earning assets, $13.3 billion of which was acquisition related. Net interest margin was 31 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to our ability to replace wholesale funding with low cost deposits and achieve overall lower funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $43 million, primarily due to a $3.4 billion increase in earnings assets, which was acquisition-related, and a seven basis point increase in net interest margin.", "The net interest margin improved due to the change in mix between wholesale funding and low cost deposits, and overall lower funding costs. Assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect the net interest margin to decrease modestly to the mid 380s in the second quarter of 2010, due to the impact of recent legislation on our credit card portfolio yield.", "Slide 22 provides additional detail on our growth in average earning assets this quarter. Year-over-year, average total loans grew by 3.9%. Excluding acquisitions, average loans declined by 2.9%. Average investment securities increased by $3.9 billion or 9.2%. Linked quarter average total loans grew by approximately $1.3 billion, again, due to the acquisitions, while average investment securities rose by $2.1 billion or 4.7%.", "Slide 23 breaks down the growth in average total loans by category. Looking at the chart on the left, you can see that the decrease in total average loans, excluding acquisitions, was essentially due to the 15.8% drop in average commercial loans, as retail residential mortgage and commercial real estate were all higher on a year-over-year basis. The majority of the loans related to the FBOP and Downey/PFF acquisitions were reported as covered loans and the $10 billion year-over-year increase was due to the acquisition of the banking operations of FBOP Corporation. On a linked quarter basis, the decline in average loans, excluding acquisitions, was again driven by the decrease in commercial loans, partially offset by increases in commercial mortgages, residential mortgages, and other retail lending.", "Moving to Slide 24, you can see the very favorable growth in low cost deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $22 billion or 13.7% year-over-year, partially due to acquisitions. Importantly, low cost core deposits, non-interest bearing interest checking, money market and savings, excluding acquisitions, grew by 23.5%. This growth reduced the need for wholesale CD and foreign branch time funding, contributing to the net interest margin expansion. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits, excluding acquisitions, declined slightly, principally due to lower non-interest bearing account balances in the corporate trust and wholesale banking divisions.", "Slide 25 presents in more detail the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Non-interest income in the first quarter of 2010 was higher by $130 million or 7.3% for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $72 million favorable change in significant items, non-interest income was higher by 3.1%. This positive variance was driven by a 7.5% growth of payment-related revenue, 24.8% growth in commercial product revenue, illustrating the success of recent investments and growth initiatives, and higher other revenues due to a lower end-of-term lease residual valuation losses.", "These favorable variances were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenue, which was $33 million lower than the first quarter of 2009, principally due to a 33% reduction in production volume, partially offset by higher servicing revenue and a favorable change in the MSR valuation and related cash. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $98 million, reflecting the fact that the first quarter of the year is the weakest revenue quarter for our company. Excluding the $124 million favorable change in significant items, non-interest income was lower than the prior quarter by 10.2%, and was driven by seasonally-lower payment revenue, and deposit service charges, which declined by 4% and 13% respectively, an $18 million reduction in mortgage banking revenue, primarily due to a 19% reduction in production volume, partially offset by favorable variances in servicing revenue and MSR valuation-related hedge, lower commercial products revenue and trust and investor management fees, which declined by 13% and 5% respectively, and finally, a decline in other revenue due to the fourth quarter 2009 contract termination gain, and an unfavorable change in the term valuation losses. Our positions have a minimal impact in the variance in fee revenue on a year-over-year or linked quarter basis.", "Finally, on Slide 26, we have provided highlights on non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $265 million or 14%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to acquisitions, which accounted for $121 million of the increase; higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects, which accounted for $42 million of the increase; FDIC insurance expense in the first quarter of 2009, we used the last of our four credits; and other loan expense primarily to costs associated with other real estate owned.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense was lower by $92 million or 4.1%, the net result of lower costs related to investments and tax advantage projects, which accounted for $58 million of the decrease. A decrease in marketing and business development expense, which declined by $45 million, and seasonally-lower legal and professional services expense, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits related to incentive accruals, and the seasonally higher payroll taxes. And finally, acquisitions, which increased by $53 million.", "Finally, the tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was approximately 24% in the first quarter of 2010.", "As you turn to Slide 28, I will turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Andy. Our company's first quarter results once again demonstrated the strength of our franchise and the advantages of our diversified business mix. We posted strong year-over-year revenue growth, maintained our industry leading efficiency, and we achieved linked quarter operating leverage, and we saw a reduction in credit costs for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to lend, gather core deposits and expand our banking franchise. We remain profitable, generating significant capital and strengthening our already solid capital and liquidity position. We are well positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery, as we continue to enjoy the benefits of the flight to quality, and we continue to invest in organic initiatives, M&A, and joint ventures and those investments including hiring the best employees and developing and empowering our leaders. We will continue to optimistically acquire and we benefit from core businesses that are scalable and can leverage as the economy recovers.", "We are more than just a traditional bank, dependent on loans, deposits, and a favorable interest environment to grow. We also bring so much more to the table with our breadth and scope of our franchise and product offerings, including global payment capabilities for our wholesale and retail customers, corporate trust offices and more. It is this diversification of products and services, in addition to our prudent risk management, that has allowed us to continue to grow profitably during the past very challenging two years. The financial services industry continues to face an uncertain economy, regulatory and legislative environment.", "The world has changed, and there is much more to come. We are actively participating in the dialog to ensure that the financial services industry and U.S. Bancorp play a vital role in the economic reform and the recovery. Our company is confident and focused on the future. We know that the momentum we have created has positioned U.S. Bancorp well to grow and prosper for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities, and importantly, our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill Parker, and I will now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hey, guys. Could you just talk a little bit about the revenue outlook and ability to capitalize on banks pulling out or cutting back on a number of product areas? We are seeing card home equity, CRE, a number of the big banks pulling back there. And you guys, you know, generally been gaining share, I guess, you know, we are always looking for more and wondering how much we will see in the near term here.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Matt. This is Richard. I think we are actually continuing to see robust forecast in that area. We are benefiting from flight to quality, and at the same time we know we have taken the measures to improve our corporate bank capability to be fully capable of not outsourcing any activities from anything from syndications to high quality bond businesses to eventually municipal bonds and things like that. So I think our timing is perfect to step into places where some of the companies have either backed down or actually exited. As a result, we are also getting more non-lending business that comes with it, because as you come into a deal, or a client says I need you to now be part of my syndication and if you are willing to be the last in, they are more often than not willing to let you have other business along with that.", "So we are enjoying the benefits of the payments and the trust along with this classic balance sheet banking and I think our timing is actually quite good. And to answer your question specifically, it is actually building momentum. So I think we will continue to see our books strengthen with new customers as well as the ones we have continuing to deal with this downturn pretty successfully.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And on the lending side specifically, obviously there is two factors going on here, there is the market share gains and just the weak demand. But when do you think we will actually start to see some net loan growth for you guys?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I don't think it is for a little while longer. You know, I might be a little less robust in my forecasting for the current economic situation, but lastly, housing prices are at record lows and they are staying there. And unemployment is at record highs and it is staying there. And our customers are a reflection of that world, and until we see either or both of those starting to move in positive directions, which eventually they both will, we are going to be likely to see our customers continue to withhold using the lines of credit they have already been extended and certainly new customers are not jumping in for large capital expenditures or big hiring activities.", "At the very early part of the cycle, we are starting to see more M&A, more IPOs, more interest as the early stream of companies starting to get healthier, but those are not the systemically core activities that cause long-term organic growth and we are not seeing that kind of activity yet in the actions of our customers. So I must say a couple of quarters till you see a real strengthening of core earnings up based on loan growth and not just from line usage, but from people coming back into the game.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, John.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Yes, hi, good morning. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on credit. Other banks are showing declines in their charge-offs and NPAs and are starting to draw down reserves. Obviously, every bank is different. Just wondering what is your sense of why you are a little different there, maybe a function of how bad things got for other banks or a loan mix, comment on that?", "Richard Davis", "Sure. Thanks, John. I will go first. I will have Bill follow-up. I have got to say I am actually quite surprised by the number of banks that have chosen to go from adding to reserves to not even meeting them but going to a recovery of reserves. So, I can't speak to their modeling, but I am surprised. I think we are all in the same environment and for me, until you get to a place where you are really sure that things are getting better, I think it is prudent to continue to have strong reserves for loan losses that you have yet to happen. So in our case, and I will speak just to us, we feel that while we are getting very close to that flattening point where loan losses, charge-offs, and NPAs are flat, which then portends that we can bring down reserve builds and eventually maybe bring them to equal, I don't see a time when reserve recovery is part of our future. I have said before, this management team is doing its best to make its estimates on where the loans will end up, where the losses will be, and where we want to have the cushion to go into the next cycle.", "I want this to be a fortressed balance sheet and the way we see it is we are continuing to appropriately do the math and the prediction to say we need to continue to strengthen our reserves for the future. Now, if there is an amazing recovery with both a speed and a slope that I don't expect, then perhaps we will get to that point, where one day we will be able to recapture some reserves, but we are not intending to do that. We think we are putting in our best dollar, hoping that it is the right amount, and giving us at least a prudent position to start the next cycle with a very strong balance sheet. So, speaking less for them and more for us, but I must say I am surprised as to how many people went back quickly to equal and then recovery is a surprise to me. And Bill, you want to speak to our details.", "Bill Parker", "Hi, John, it is Bill. Just one \u2013 I mean you mentioned the fact that you know our loss rates are significantly lower than most of our peers and I think that is part of it. I mean, we have gone up last \u2013 you know, looks now we are stabilizing. So we will start hopefully to be coming down soon, but we are not coming off of those very high peaks that some of our peers are.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then, a question on regulatory reform. Richard, what are the biggest issues for you guys in your business model, where do you have the strongest views? And then also, Andy mentioned the impact to the margin for the card legislation. If you could just remind us the totality of the impact of card legislation and Reg E as best you guys can tell?", "Richard Davis", "Okay. I will go first. I am actually very concerned about the pending reforms that are about, I think they are imminent in the next probably few weeks and I concern myself for a couple of reasons. One is, we are building these solutions at a time when everyone is very stressed and concerned and these will be, you know, decades kind of decision, so we better be careful and make sure that we get it right. I am all for consumer protections being strengthened, I am all for line down authority and the systemic importance of companies that we cannot have the taxpayer's bill at anybody again. I am all for all of that.", "If I had one thing to put at the very top of the list, it is to protect preemption. And let me just say very clearly, this is not a help the banks to protect themselves, it has nothing to do with that. Preemption is a situation that allows banks to provide products to our customers and they don't have to worry about whether they work in different states in different ways. It is a chance to say that if there is something in the state that they don\u2019t like, the current rules allow them to challenge that and protect their state customers or their state citizens. But right now to change the preemption, to allow the states to have a providing overriding view of whether or not things are safe for their customers, will create an amazing amount of confusion for both us and for them and I have to say, John, it will reduce the number of products that are available.", "So we are substantially aligned, most of us are with virtually all of the things that you are seeing in Reg reform, but there are some nuances, not the least of which is the concern for loss of national uniform standards of preemption and the concern that we don't have a circumstance where the pre-funding of losses or the slush fund or whatever you want to call it is burdened by some of those many of us who actually would never intend to use it and perhaps are being taxed some form of a levy, that isn't really fair. So we will limit our issues on those couple of points, because I think otherwise, why wouldn't we want the stronger protections, why wouldn't we want the non-banks to finally have the same oversight we have all enjoyed and why wouldn't we want to be assured that our industry is stronger going into this next time, where the taxpayers will feel a sense of confidence and the shareholders will feel a better sense of confirmation in the stability of our industry and so I welcome the majority of them, but I do worry about preemption and I do think that a back paying tax of any sort is unfair.", "Andy Cecere", "And John, from a dollars perspective, the card act legislation will cost us about $100 million in 2010. It started in the middle of the first quarter and will continue throughout the remainder of the year. The overdraft legislation in addition to some of the changes that we made, will cost us $200 million to $300 million in 2010, impacting us most specifically in the second through fourth quarters and that is principally in fee income.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And the card legislation is a mix, Andy, of the NIM and the fee?", "Andy Cecere", "It is a mix, John, but it is more heavily weighted towards the margin component.", "Richard Davis", "And John, let me remind you as well as the audience, in the beginning of this month, we started our migration towards new overdraft and NSF fees. We actually made some changes in the first quarter, we made more on April 1, where we started to limit the number and dollar amount of overdraft, and then, at the end of June or July 1 and August 15 with the new fed rules, we will be prepared to move into the final stage. So you will see some disruption in run rate or linked quarter impacts in quarter two versus quarter one. You saw a little bit in quarter one versus quarter four and then when we get to the run rate in the second half, we will have a better sense of how those customer behaviors will play out.", "I will repeat what I said 90 days ago and that is, we have, I think the luxury and I think the prudence to not force customers into a decision. We are going to watch and check their behavior, we are doing a fairly good job of serving their interest now, and we will create an outcome that allows them to pick how they want to deal with their banking relationships and we will be very smart to watch what the other actions in the community of banks do, and then responds to the best and most favored treatment. We are lucky enough that we have that luxury of time and I believe waiting to see what the right answer will be. But you will see negative biases kind of linked quarter for the next couple, as it relates to overdraft and in NSF fees.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", " (inaudible) either of those pieces of legislation or regulation affecting your payments businesses in either a positive or a negative way?", "Richard Davis", "You know, that is a great question. We are, actually, that is part of our study of customers and merchants to find out how they feel about if customers are going to be, let's say they don\u2019t opt in, and there is a significant higher level denial at point of sale, how do the merchants want to step in? Will they step in for their best customers or will they suffer a certain level of breakage that they haven't experienced before? I think as Andy discussed, slight negative bias because less things will be transacted until people figure out how they want to operate their checking account, but I don't think it\u2019s a very significant one and we haven't placed any dollar financial detriment to it at all in the future. And as we learn more, we will telegraph that. We don't see that as a problem yet.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, john.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Jon.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. A couple of questions for Bill. You talked a little bit about how the modification for residential and card customers, you expect that growth trend to continue and can you talk a little bit about which part of the business is driving it, and if you are seeing any light at the end of the tunnel?", "Bill Parker", "You are talking about residential modifications?", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Bill Parker", "Yes, I mean, that is both in our finance company and our home mortgage company that originates more of the Freddie-Fannie products. And we did about $1 billion dollars total HAMP in the first quarter. About 250 of that was on balance sheet, mostly in our finance company. We expect that number to be about the same in the second quarter, but there\u2019s already some of it and so we are working through the pipeline and that number should start to decline.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And then the other question, provision was up in the wholesale business a bit.", "Bill Parker", "Yes.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Can you talk a little bit about what drove that?", "Bill Parker", "Well, there is a little bit of lumpiness in some of our more leveraged portfolios, but other aspects of the overall portfolio of the middle market corporate book and we are actually showing improving quality trends, but we did have a couple of larger charge-offs in the quarter.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "No real trends to speak of?", "Bill Parker", "No.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Well, thank you very much. Can you talk about the loan pricing out there? I mean, some banks are out there saying utilization rates are increasing and you say they are relatively flat. But are you seeing an overheating and pricing cap rates dropping?", "Richard Davis", "Well, I will tell you what, we still do see the demand coming down. So I am surprised you are seeing that otherwise. Well, I will tell you what, we are saying is, there is the market has become more balanced, and I think, first and foremost, while the banks are getting paid for risk premiums, the people expect us to charge for that. Customers want a traditional bank, the alternatives are lesser than they used to be. So the margins are stronger than they were and I think there will be moments in time when depending on who is in the market, if you are in a community market or if you are in a large market depending on who might be a more aggressive player, you can see unrealistic prices like we saw a few years ago. So for all intents and purposes, we are seeing a nice kind of a firming up of reasonable and rational pricing in most of the banks that we compete with seem to be taking that at the same measured approach that I would expect, and you might mention that on the margin side.", "Andy Cecere", "Right, so Paul, you know, we continue to see that the loans that are renewing and new bookings are at a bit of a better margin than what is rolling off. So that phenomenon has been occurring for the last four or five quarters. You know, I don't think it is going to continue to be at the same levels, but firming up of loan pricing, I think is one of the factors in our improvement in our net interest margin in addition to our lower cost funding. The other thing I would highlight is that we are seeing utilization down a bit. You know, there is 30% on average for the fourth quarter. There was 28% on average for the first quarter of this year and when you compare that to a year ago, that was 37%. So, it continues to fall, albeit at a slower level.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Is there any other \u2013 is there some regions doing better than others in their loan pricing and utilization, or are they pretty much across your footprint?", "Andy Cecere", "I don't think there is a significant geographic difference.", "Richard Davis", "No.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Heather Wolf with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of more follow-ups on the modifications. First, can you talk a little bit about the sort of inflows and outflows to that $1.6 billion that you are showing on Slide 13, and can you also talk about re-default rates and where you see those going?", "Bill Parker", "Let me talk about re-default rates first. I mean, there is a couple of different ways to measure it. There is industry data, which looks at 12 months out and so few payment delinquencies 12 months out, that is we are at 30% and industry is at about 40%. And then we also look at, you know, those that ultimately go to foreclosure, and for that, our rate is about 20% for the overall residential mortgage portfolio. So those are a couple of statistics on the restructured loans. And again what I talked about on residential mortgages is that the on balance sheet we did about $250 million of HAMP in the first quarter. We expect a similar amount in the second quarter, but there are signs that that dollar amount is already declining, it may have already peaked.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "And were there any outflows or do you follow the once a TDR, always a TDR accounting?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, once it is a TDR, it is always a TDR.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And one last question. Of this $1.6 billion, is any of this covered by your loss sharing? Are any of the potential re-defaults covered by loss sharing?", "Bill Parker", "Not in these statistics here. No, that would the Downey portfolio, which is under the covered asset section.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Okay. So this is just modifications on your book?", "Bill Parker", "Yes.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS", "Got it. Okay, thanks so much.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Heather.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ian Forsyth \u2013 Bank of America", "Hey, guys, it is actually Ian Forsyth [ph] for Ken. How is it going?", "Richard Davis", "Good morning.", "Ian Forsyth \u2013 Bank of America", "Quick question. I wanted to dive into the fee items a little bit and kind of just talk to outside of some of the seasonality, what kind of areas came in stronger or weaker than you would have expected?", "Andy Cecere", "This is Andy. So, the particular area of strength was our payments group. We saw our payments in total go up 7.5% versus a year ago. Categories like merchant processing versus a year ago was up over 13%. We saw same-store sales increase 3.3%. So I think that is a reflection of us continuing to gain share and strength across all those categories. Commercial products year-over-year was up. That is again a function of us building the businesses that we have been talking about in the wholesale and corporate banking group, and those are areas of strength. You know, seasonally the first quarter versus the fourth quarter is lower, really across almost every category, probably $75 million to $100 million. So we would expect the decline in the first quarter that we saw. In addition, mortgage production is down a bit. You know, last year, we had a production level of about $13 billion in the first quarter, this year it was just about $9 billion. So that is another key factor in the year-over-year results.", "Ian Forsyth \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks, guys.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Chris Whalen with IRA. Please go ahead with your question.", "Chris Whalen \u2013 IRA", "Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "Chris Whalen \u2013 IRA", "Richard, how much of your growth is coming from taking share as opposed to the economy recovering? I mean, I am not so much looking for statistics as just as gut.", "Richard Davis", "My guess is 50-50. We have worked really hard when basically no one was really paying attention in the last two years, re-crafting this whole company's ability to work with customers at a deeper level, build a full-on first class corporate bank across the nation not across the footprint, reconstruct our wealth management. Chris, all the things that I will be able to talk about in a couple of years and describe to you all why we came out of this so much stronger, but at this early stage, for all of them, they are demonstrating a high performance and we are still really lucky. I mean, this company has benefited from the relative outcome of a negative environment, we could have changed on our own anyway.", "And so we are taking advantage of it. We have got a lot of higher quality people that we have brought into these new business lines. We have changed the culture to deal more with relationships than individual transactions. And I will tell you, those are the things that are probably 50% of our strength right now and what I like about that the most is when I got to bed tonight, I am going to know that it is the reason we are going to be so much stronger in the future, it is not a one quarter event. It is a momentum toward an entirely new kind of a run rate.", "And then the last piece that I said in my prepared comments but I want to put it in my own words again, this is a big deal to be a company that doesn't rely just on the balance sheet. I think in the near term, at least probably in the next few years, lending overall will be slightly depressed. The deposit gathering will be probably slightly more positive and margins overall will probably firm up, but they will move around as well with rates moving up and down. I love the fact that we have got this other diversified earnings stream in the trust and the payments businesses that they are not countercyclical, but they are definitely not aligned exactly with the behaviors of balance sheets, and I think that is going to portend as the recovery gets kind of an extra cylinder that give this company a stronger future going out.", "Chris Whalen \u2013 IRA", "Just to follow up on that, in terms of interest rates, if we are at the peak or we hope we were at the peak in terms of credit loss, what do you see in terms of the evolution of NIM going forward? And particularly, you know, a lot of institutions, as I think we are all aware, are wide open right now, trying to maximize net interest margin. How would you guys look at the interest rate risk environment in terms of re-pricing your liabilities and the attitude of customers in terms of yield, because they have all been starved to death by the Fed and as soon as the funds are able to offer them another quarter of a point, how do you think that is going to affect your stability in terms of both core and more volatile liabilities?", "Andy Cecere", "Chris, this is Andy. You know, we have been positioning our balance sheet. We never really positioned it significantly, assuming rates will go a certain way. We are always fairly neutral, but we have moved to the asset sensitive and we continue to position that way. So what that means is, for example, the securities portfolio, our purchases are more floaters than fixed, give up a little bit of yield in the short term, but I think we position ourselves appropriately for the long-term and that is the way we are thinking about it.", "Chris Whalen \u2013 IRA", "Thank you, guys.", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard. As you recall, a few years ago, we were starved on interest margin and protecting (inaudible) our deposit rates were at the very low, probably the low decile, and in the past couple of years, we have found ourselves now above the median and competing, not just \u2013 we are not losing on price, we are not competing on quality, and we have got price as a non-issue. That is a pretty big deal and this company is constructed the way we run it now, to be able to move lock steps with great changes and not need to withhold those benefits when they come along. We are going to get the benefit on the lending side, we will give it on the deposit side. We have come to learn that you don't build a bank without getting new customers. You start most often with the deposit and then you have a fighting chance to work with them with a relationship and that is another one of those underlying benefits that we have built over the last couple of years that I think will show themselves in the next couple of years.", "Chris Whalen \u2013 IRA", "Excellent. Thank you, guys.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead with your question.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "Good morning. Quick question on commercial real estate and your outlook on credit quality there, and I am talking about non-residential development CRE. Because there have been many predictions of disaster, you know, this is a lagging indicator, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just talk about that? We haven't really had a disaster in non-residential CRE and can you just talk about why not, why the predictions have been so wrong?", "Bill Parker", "I will go ahead. This is Bill. You know, if you go back to the early nineties cycle, that was one where there was really massive overbuilding and in this cycle, it is really more of a demand issue. You know, and I do think in general, underwriting was better than it was in the early nineties cycle. In our particular portfolio, you know, we have seen stress on some of the construction portfolio as it came online, you know some of the certain office retail and some of the really soft southwest market, but the permanent, the mortgage portfolio, the diversified \u2013 you know, our biggest asset class is affordable housing, you know, that has been less impacted by some of this downturn. You know, I think there is enough, we have already seen value starting to stabilize and we have recourse on our facility. So I don't view this as being that Armageddon scenario that some have predicted. And, you know, I think we will just \u2013 it is going to be soft for, probably 18 months, but I think it is fairly stable.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "Richard, a question for you. There has been a great deal of speculation about USB's possible entry into the southeast and you know, is that a geographic region that where you absolutely have to be, could you do that through an FDIC-assisted deal, you know, which didn\u2019t give you huge presence in the region, and then build upon that? Could you just talk about your appetite for sort of doing a non-contiguous acquisition?", "Richard Davis", "Right, thank you. The question was asked perfectly. Very low appetite for a non-transformational deal out of market, or the opposite of that is, I would only go out of market for transformational deal. We really aren't blaming our customers uninterested in banking with us because we are not in the 26 states that we don't currently have a retail presence. As you know, Nancy, we have made a commitment to get stronger and deeper in the 24 states we are and FDIC transactions are built perfectly for that and we will look forward to having more opportunities.", "If we were to go on a state, contiguous or jumping state, there would have to be a substantial transaction limit, number one. Everybody would say, wow, that makes so much sense. Number two, it would be a price point that has to make sense and good for our shareholders and we both know it would have to be a capital rate activity that we would only do if it was so reasonable and so useful to the company's future that it made sense. So we have to hit all those hurdles, and if it isn't going to be transformational, we don't see a need to do out of market in order to be successful in the next decade, we just, it will be an opportunity missed that we didn't pursue it, but I don't know if that is ever going to come across. So we are more than happy to be focused on organic growth and old fashioned quarter-by-quarter business that I think we are starting to demonstrate.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "I just want to go back to the slide on page 10 about the utilization rate and how it keeps going down. I would have thought, or one would have hypothesized that normally that line utilization should be tied to retail sales, inventory, receivables, and so on. Or I would say inventories and receivables and those should in theory be going up with an economic rebound and can you explain the disconnect?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, this is Bill. I mean, what we have seen really starting late last quarter is corporate America middle market companies are \u2013 they have downsized very effectively in reducing their costs, primarily through job layoffs, but they are generating a lot of cash. So the fact that there was inventory build-up occurring here in the first quarter, they had not needed traditional bank sources of funding. So the companies that we deal with, they are very flush and they are waiting for clear signs of that economic recovery.", "Richard Davis", "I will tell you what, I mean, you think about it, these businesses in America have figured out an entirely new level of productivity and efficiency, and I think we all surprised ourselves. This bank is one of those. I mean, we took a 5% expense reduction last February across the board to protect jobs and to protect our future and we did that because the world was different and we all surprised ourselves. Our customers are saying I did this for a couple of quarters and I\u2019ll be darned, I can actually be more efficient I can get along a little further than I thought. So they are very hesitant to turn back on the spigot and start spending money unless they are absolutely sure they see it.", "And in many recoveries past, I believe that businesses went first and followed by customers and consumers who followed them because the products were there and all of a sudden, the world got better. I think it is reverse this time, they are waiting for the consumers to move to consume their products, after which point it is undeniable because they are ready and waiting and then the inventories are too low and then and only then they will pop. So I am believing that we are in a new paradigm, where the recovery will be in part a bit different than it has in the past and probably slower based on the prudence of businesses that have learnt to be very efficient, and efficiently, they will just say, look I have got to spend money, but boy, our utilization rate is the best proxy for that, because they have got the loans, they have got it probably preferred rates, they are our best customers, and they are still paying it down until which time they don't need it.", "Secondly, we will be the best first to see it, because our cash balances, as they are rich with cash, we are holding it. And so we will be able to see them move from cash balances down first. Second is the actual use of our credit. So there are actually two steps to occur and we haven't seen the cash balances starting to fall either. So I think that is why I answered the question earlier that it is a few quarters out until we see it show up on the bank's balance sheet as a loan.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then, you know, I guess my second sort of big picture question is that I have seen the interest rate disclosure in your 10-K, but I guess I still think, you know, when I look at a company like yours with so much in core deposits on the right hand side and so much in what should theoretically be variable rate loans on the left hand side, you know, one would think that you would really be fairly dramatically asset-sensitive. And, you know, yours is a company that used to have a 425 to 450 basis point margin. And is there something structurally different in the world now that in a higher rate environment, generally would prevent you from getting back to that kind of level, a few years down the line, and say in a environment where rates are 200, 300, 400 basis points higher over time?", "Andy Cecere", "This is Andy. We try to manage the balance sheet, so we are not dramatically anything and we try to keep it fairly neutral. We are asset sensitive a little bit as we talked about. There are a lot of mechanisms that you can use to manage the balance sheet rate sensitivity and I am very comfortable with the disclosures we have in terms of our positioning should rates rise.", "Analyst", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just to confirm \u2013 just a administrative question on the net interest margin, the increase in the net interest margin and forgive me if you've already covered this, was up about seven basis points over the quarter. That seem to be largely due to the consolidation of assets on the balance sheet and that's one of the reasons why you are targeting somewhat lower net interest margin in the second quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "Matt. That didn\u2019t really have a large impact. The principal reason for the improvement was a little bit on the wholesale \u2013 on the funding cost, a little bit of mixed funding, move towards core deposits and a little bit on the loan re-pricing that we talked about. Those are the key factors. The principal reason that we are expecting little bit of a decline in net interest margin really relates to card debt and some of the legislative changes around that and that's the reason for the low-to-mid 380s.", "Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Can you give us the amount of the reps and warranties expense in the quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "The reps and warranties expense?", "Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo", "In terms of mortgages that have been put back to you by the GSES or other parties?", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you, Matt. That's insignificant for us. We've had a very good origination process. We are very good at dotting the Is and crossing the Ts and that is just not been a significant issue for us. Thanks.", "Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then one last question, I guess related to Nancy's question on acquisitions, but at a somewhat different take. Given the landscape has, really, for, in consumer finance rather than traditional mortgage landing. I've got to think the events over the past couple of years have made that market much more wide open for competitors such as U.S. Bank. Is there any appetite in here for you to purchase, perhaps some consumer-oriented finance franchise rather than bank, at this point given the somewhat lower competitive pressures in that business?", "Andy Cecere", "No. The answer is no. Couple of reasons, Matt, we have our wholly owned finance company in the bank that we started in 1993. Actually I was part of that, it\u2019s the old Star Bank and we have a very broad network of correspondence and brokers that we've worked with now for almost 20 years. We could turn that volume up in a second if we want to and as you know our credit in that portfolio is less quality than the bank that was much better, I said, is more like a near prime kind of business.", "So we don't have any interest in playing another avenue. I certainly wouldn't do a branch network. We actually had one years ago and closed down because it's not conducive for those kinds of customers. Your branch is really your best place for deposit gathering. So, I think if we wanted to turn on the spigot for consumer finance, you wouldn't believe how much we could do. So what little we are doing is a reflection of our fact that we only want to do is with the really finest people, we need to do -- a lot of it originated through our customers and be very prudent about how we deal with that side. And what you see will probably grow over time, but we are not going to take advantage. And I do think, by the way you are on to something, and that is that as the world starts to evaluate these consumers and small businesses that have failed, who is going to be the first to say, I will look the other way and bring back to a credit, and it isn't going be up.", "So if someone\u2019s going to do that, they are going to say, I will waive the bankruptcy, I won't make you go years, remember our parents used to tell, watch your credit history, it\u2019s your whole reputation. I am sad to say, I think one of the first things we see is people jumping back in and allowing failed clients to get back in and to meet us, that's a mistake. But we will be very careful and you won't see that move much more than increments over quarters.", "Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you very much.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch, Credit Suisse.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Moshe.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Operator", "Okay. I'm showing that he has withdrawn his question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hello.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Andy, most of my question have been asked and answered. But I've done a remarkably poor job in forecasting your other fee income line item, it bounces around a lot. I know in the release you talked about three things. One was the payments related gain in the fourth quarter. I think you talked about the low equity investment income and impact of retail lease residual valuation losses that have changed between fourth quarter and first quarter. Can you go over those swings with me on those three individual line items?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. Chris, so in the fourth quarter of 2009, we had payments related gain about $30 million that was \u2013 more about one-time event, not repeated in the first quarter. The equity gains \u2013 we have an equity investment portfolio, BMB [ph]. That was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, under 10 or $15 million. And finally in the lease residual category, we continue to see improvement. The improvement in the fourth quarter was more dramatic in terms of auto prices and so we had a little bit more positive fourth quarter than the first quarter and that was the other factor. You could take those things out, it was fairly stable, but those are three, sort of unique events that impact other revenue.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "The 135 or so, in terms of $135 million in the quarter. For the other, kind of the income line items, is that a decent -- I know it's lumpy but is that kind of a decent run rate to look forward going in subsequent quarters?", "Andy Cecere", "There is nothing unusual. Let me say it this way, there is nothing usual.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. All right, thank you very much.", "Andy Cecere", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group. Please go ahead with your question.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Meredith.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Good morning. How are you?", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "I wanted to take the opportunity, because lot of good questions has been asked. But to get more of a landscape type feel, because you see so much the consumer and the consumer activities and small business activity. There have been some mixed messages so far from the companies that have reported, in terms of where spending has come from and some retail sales numbers, it looks like, all but Wal-Mart, spending is coming from everywhere. If you take out gas, can you bifurcate the consumer because it seems as if the lower end still has less access to credit and shouldn't be spending that much. It's all driven by the high end or could you just add some color to that, and I have a follow-up, please?", "Richard Davis", "Yeah. I'll start and then let Andy pick it up. We do have a great view of the world at least to retail consumer world. Our merchant acquiring portfolio is like a third airlines, a third hoteliers and a third retail and our credit card business is pretty robust. So what we are seeing is a lot more activity in the debit card, not credit. It makes sense, right. They are using money that have and you\u2019ve all seen how consumers have gotten more prudent. And we have seen on a year-over-year basis in our merchant acquiring areas, a 13% increase, quarter one last year to quarter one this year. That\u2019s a nice spread between travels and retail activities but those are primarily the first large signs of quarter \u2013 year-over-year quarter-to-quarter growth we have seen and it\u2019s primarily found and demonstrated in the debit side. So we are also seeing consistency in people not using their credit card. Andy you might want to pick up on corporate cards, are also very strong. The government have now reported spending their budget and the money is being spent as we predicted but the credit activities are still going to be slow and I think you will see NSFOD [ph] reflect some of that lesser buying as well.", "Andy Cecere", "Right. That\u2019s right, Richard. We had our corporate card activity increase principally due to government spend. Same store sales again 3% up year-over-year. That compares to 3% down in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing some improvement there and I would say that improvement, Meredith, it was rather broad based. It was both domestic and international in our merchant acquiring portfolio in Europe and across most categories. So not a significant upward tick but across the board, everything was a little bit more positive.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Theoretically, those that have less in their savings account or checking accounts can spend less. So there should be a natural divide towards the higher end in spending. I guess I am trying to drill down in terms of where spending is really coming from if you take out gasoline?", "Andy Cecere", "I am taking out gasoline every time I answer. I would say that we get paid a great deal more on the actual transaction and the size of it. So everyone still go to the grocery store, they still go to the gas station, they still swipe the card and that\u2019s one of the benefit of the merchant acquiring portfolios, we get paid as much for the transaction as we do the size. So I am probably less clear on the impacts of smaller ticket size and debit than I would be in credit because it\u2019s the outstanding that it creates. But I mean, you are right, the people have less money, they are being more careful but I would say they are actually spending it more often. So they are going to the ATM machine to keep it simple for me. They will go there and pull out $20 five times in a week and they will pull out a 100 on Monday because they are just not sure what it would look like by the time payroll comes around. So we are seeing activities actually start to pick up. We\u2019re not necessary seeing average balances. And on the credit side, we are obviously seeing it slowing down and be careful spending money that they don\u2019t have.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Okay. When I do checks in terms of different regions, you\u2019re still real populous rates amongst small business centers and consumers vitriol against Wall Street, how Canadian banks are closing and what not? How are you addressing those needs? Is that where you are picking up market share? Is there \u2013 what does the small business lending environment look like as they fund themselves primarily through credit card going forward? And then I am done.", "Andy Cecere", "So the small business used to fund sales in great part sole proprietors with their home equity which is their ATM. And they typically would use their credit card. So I will say what, we are getting a flight to quality at some customer\u2019s small business that are looking for a place that they feel safer at. But we are not seeing a great deal of growth in small business qualified customers. So I mean they are a perfect reflection of this economy and either those who are looking for loans, who need it the most are probably the least qualified and we are simply not making that loan. We want to help them out. We are giving a lot of guidance. We are not making that loan. And I will say, if they don\u2019t have the access to the credit card and they don\u2019t have the home equity, that\u2019s what you are hearing from Main Street and that is we need loans, we want loans, and I will say what, we want to make them. But it would be imprudent for us to make them at a time of the cycle where they are least qualified. The best we can do is give them guidance on how to become more attractive as a future lending candidate but we typically will say no unless they are qualified and we are not changing our underwriting. So we are seeing a relative flight to quality but an absolute shrinkage in qualified people who are looking for a loan if they can actually pay back.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Okay. So in another words, you see a growing percentage of sort of a de-bank factor?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. I did.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "All right. Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Meredith.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead for question.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning, Betsy Graseck.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. Thanks. Two questions. One is on the administration's proposal recently for HAMP to have another way of restructuring loans to include principal forgiveness if the borrower qualifies and could you just give us a sense as to how you are thinking about that program and how that could potentially impact your portfolio?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Bill, why don\u2019t you do that?", "Bill Parker", "Yeah. Are you talking about the 2MP one [ph] or the (inaudible)", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Both.", "Andy Cecere", "Well, so they are different.", "Richard Davis", "Yeah. They are, yeah.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Correct. Well, my question was specifically on the first but what\u2019s the overlap to the 2MP would be helpful too.", "Andy Cecere", "Yeah. Well, on the 2MP for our portfolio, we have very few purchase money; second, and I think that is more of what that portfolio or what that program was buying for, or the first and second are done together and really act like one mortgage. So for us it was almost 90% of our portfolio coming out of the branches where it\u2019s just traditional home equity. We don\u2019t feel that program is really appropriate or designed for our type of portfolio.", "One the other program, I mean there is the home affordable foreclosure alternative. That\u2019s the one just to encourage short sales or to make short sales don\u2019t get in the way of a transaction that\u2019s beneficial to the homeowner. That\u2019s something we are already working on. We have already been doing short sales. We will continue to do that. The other one is the enhanced \u2013 what I\u2019ll call the enhanced half. That\u2019s the one that they say that might get in place by August or September. Well, they have temporarily relief for the job, et cetera, et cetera. That thing has got \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of details to be worked out on that. So it\u2019s not clear to us exactly how all that would work at this point. So that\u2026", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I guess, you still have\u2026", "Andy Cecere", "To summarize that. The 2MP or what\u2019s the HAMP for the seconds, we are not opting that. We are not because our portfolio doesn\u2019t really lend itself to that but I also just want to say when you opt into a program and the rules keep hanging you regret having opted in because you just can\u2019t predict and we are in the business of giving you guys a fairly good predictable company. And so I am telling you what, this company would do everything that\u2019s right for all the people that deserve it but in some cases we are not doing it because it\u2019s right now because we're mandated and the rules change. And I am very strong on that because we don\u2019t deserve to be told how to run the company. We are trying to do what\u2019s right and sometimes the rules are actually prohibitive of letting us work around some other constructs if the customers have unique circumstances.", "And I do think to Bill\u2019s point the enhanced HAMP is coming along. We will \u2013 we are in HAMP and we will provide support for everything we are asked to do. But we are going to continue to be vocal making sure that the rules aren\u2019t creating outcomes that make it harder for consumers to get what they want and/or that they don\u2019t create incentives for healthy consumers to find themselves in harms way to play into the game of the new rule. That\u2019s a really unintended consequences we have got to watch for.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That is very clear, thank you. And then the second question, I had is just on the dividend and the dividend outlook, could you just give us some updated views there?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure, I can. This is sadly not an update of new information, it is a repeat of what I said before. We believe a couple of key paradigms and one is that we are able to increase our dividend based on our forecast of our earnings. And based on the stress test upon which we know there are a number of variations and versions that we are using, we can substantially increase our dividend and be fine with the earnings. But we understand the government\u2019s needs, number one, to be absolute positive. This recovery is the same and on its way. And therefore, we understand that they don\u2019t want to be giving anybody permission to do that in case things would turn around and I think we need to follow that logic.", "And secondly, I understand that there is so waiting I think at these levels that you and I, both know, both of the domestic and global levels to decide what the final definition of the capital will be and what the final number will be. In fact, which final ratio will be? So we are soon to find out, what\u2019s the ratio will be used whether it will be core or new definition that they are now out for comment, whether they will be domestic or global and I understand that\u2019s going to be a little longer than I'd like to wait but I understand we're in queue with that knowledge that has to be understood as well.", "So I\u2019m waiting for permission. I\u2019m waiting for guidelines, if it was my own. Information that I have in hand and I can do it by myself, I will raise the dividend now. But I \u2013 we are prudent [ph] to do so and I\u2019m not going to challenge the regulators we are working well at them. We understand that they are giving us all information along the way and we're not going either sit back and wait around without making it known that we're out here and we're eager to do it.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Carol Burger with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, Carole.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Carole.", "Carol Burger - Soleil Securities", "Hi, how are you? Just to clarify on your last statement, it certainly sound like the regulators at this point don\u2019t want you or telling you not to raise dividend, is that what you mean to say?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. I did. I think people didn\u2019t realize probably in all the years we\u2019ve all been together, I\u2019ve known you for many of those, we always needed to get permission to raise the dividend. It\u2019s just that everyone was making money all the time, the dividends were always probably 40% or 50% of total earnings. And nobody ever needed to see it work. When the world turned down and company started to lose money and some were not able to cover the dividend, it became clear that the rules that we were all talking about, were present again and that is the federal reserve has the right to decide and approve on any divided action on at any time. And that\u2019s what we were dealing with.", "And so the fed has been very clear in telling us that whether you are ready in your own mind, we need to be sure that this economy is ready for you and anyone else that we might permit and we are ready to give you that answer. And so\u2026", "Carol Burger - Soleil Securities", "And have they given you the indication of what metrics they are looking at to decide that?", "Andy Cecere", "No. And that\u2019s my point earlier to Betsy's question. I feel like \u2013 I think they would agree that there are a number of uncertainties in terms of which ratio will use, whether it will be a national or global construct, how long we\u2018ll have to get there. And now as you know with Basel III or whatever you want to call it, now there is even a question of what will be the definition of core capital before we even decide what the number is.", "So all the moving parts are obvious to all of us and so it\u2019s not -- I\u2019m not surprise that we can get an answer because I understand the prudence of making sure that we don\u2019t do something as an industry that we will regret. On my hand, I have to be a vocal advocate from my company and make sure that we are collateral damage in the waiting game. And so we are good partners with the regulators and making a very clear. We are anxious we want to move on. We\u2019ll give them more numbers, we\u2019ll show them our stress test and we continue to argue the merits of let us move forward and at this point they think not yet and we are waiting for better guidelines.", "Carol Burger - Soleil Securities", "Okay. My other question was both on deposit pricing and loan pricing, do you think that the consolidation that we have seen is going to make a difference going forward and the fact that we probably have more rational pricers in the marketplace. And if you wanted to, could you comments on taking WAMU out of the game and replacing that with JP in your marketplace?", "Andy Cecere", "Carol, This is Andy. And I\u2019m not talking to specifically but your statement is absolutely correct. I think if you look at the last eight quarters or so, deposit pricing has become much more rational. At the same time, we\u2019ve moved up sort of from the lower quartile to the median in our peer group. And I think the combination of lower rates and the fact that deposit pricing has become more rationale allowed us to do that with very little impact to margin.", "Richard Davis", "I will say, Carol, the world is uneven. So the community banking markets, where we have a 1000 of our 3000 branches are later in the cycle and I will say it wouldn\u2019t surprise you that some of the banks were starting to stress kind of their ditch stage effort is to be very aggressive on deposit pricing or to be very unrealistic in loans. And so until -- I will say, until things have cleared up as probably a year or two from now when a majority of FDIC transactions have been recognized and reckoned with. I think we will see in different markets unreasonable pricing but it\u2019s a big market and the banks you are talking about we are seeing a much more solid rational performance in pricing and give us all a better sense of dealing with that community of banks that are looking together to not coalesce or to price together. But to working where we can pay for the risk and we do the right job of giving people the discriminate value for relationships and more business with better pricing.", "Carol Burger - Soleil Securities", "Okay. And just for my own edification, when you said, you moved up the rankings in terms of deposit pricing, have you moved up or has everybody else moved down?", "Richard Davis", "It\u2019s definitely both. We\u2019ve definitely -- we made a very discriminate move in the last eight quarters to pay up on deposits and many have come down and I think probably in the earlier conversation, there is a title range we can be in the top half and not need to be over priced or taking kind of risk that we might have had a couple of years ago.", "Carol Burger - Soleil Securities", "Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in queue at this time.", "Richard Davis", "Well, let me just close. I want to thank you all for your interest in our company and your support. I want to characterize that it\u2019s not very sexy and that\u2019s present company excluded of course. But this is a company that simple and straight forward and I think predictable and I hope that has value to all of you and therefore to our shareholders.", "And there is so much volatility and so much noise. We are very proud of what we have been able to accomplish in last couple of years. And let it be said what each quarter will continue to be predictable and hopefully repeatable and simple. I do think from the earliest questions this morning, if we are building a company that I know we are, you will see the real benefits in years forward when you will appreciate the kind of investments we made at a time when so many others were working on other things. And I am excited about, I think today was a very good demonstration of our core simple bank but I think it portends we\u2019ve got real good future based on things that are starting to emerge and I\u2019m looking forward to sharing them in the future years. So Judy, you want to close.", "Judy Murphy", "Yes. Thanks everyone for listening and as always if you have questions please feel free to call.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Judy Murphy", "Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to begin on page three of the presentation and review a few of the highlights of our quarterly results.", "U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $908 million for the third quarter of 2010 or $0.45 per diluted common share. Earnings were $0.15 higher than the same quarter of last year and equal to the second quarter of 2010.", "We achieved record total net revenue of $4.6 billion in the third quarter. This represented a 7.9% increase over the same quarter of 2009 and a 1.5 % increase over the prior quarter.", "Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.8%, benefiting from recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, average loans were down slightly from last year. Importantly, however, on a length quarter basis, average total loans grew by 0.7%.", "We continue to post strong year-over-year average deposit growth, particularly in the low cost categories, including non-interest bearing, interest checking, money market and savings. These categories grew on average 13.6% year-over-year or 9% excluding acquisitions.", "Once again credit quality improved quarter-over-quarter as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets declined by 10.7% and 4.6% respectively from the second quarter.", "Our capital position remains strong and growing with the Tier 1 common ratio and the Tier 1 capital ratio increasing to 7.6% and 10.3%, respectively, at September 30th.", "Slide four graphs our performance metrics over the past five quarters. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.26%, and return on average common equity was 12.8%. The five quarter trends of our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand of the slide four.", "This quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.91% was just slightly higher than the prior quarter and 24 basis points higher than the same quarter of 2009.", "Our third quarter efficiency ratio was 51.9%, slightly lower than the prior quarter, but above the same quarter of last year.", "We remain the best among our peers in terms of efficiency and the increase in this ratio reflects both ongoing investments and the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions on revenue and on expense.", "Turning to slide five. Our capital position remains strong and continuous to grow. Additionally, our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio rose from 5.4% at September 30th, 2009, to 6.2% at September 30th, 2010.", "Our company continues to generate significant capital each quarter due to the momentum in our diverse business mix in addition to our superior efficiency and our ongoing profitability.", "As I\u2019ve said before, we are confident that our capital levels and our ability to generate new capital each quarter can support a dividend increase and allow us to meet or exceed any capital requirements that maybe forth coming.", "Increasing the dividend remains a top priority for our management team and our Board of Directors, though we must continue to wait for final regulatory capital guidelines to be established and regulatory approval to be given before a dividend action can be taken. We fully expect, however, to be one of the first banks to raise our dividend once those guidelines have been determined.", "Moving on to slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion year-over-year. But as noted on the slide, excluding acquisitions, total average loans declined by 0.4% year-over-year as the average commitment utilization rate by our commercial and corporate borrowers declined from 32% in the third quarter of 2009 to 26% in the third of this year.", "On a linked to quarter basis, however, total loans increased by 0.7% as we experienced slightly higher demand for new loans from creditworthy borrowers and as the average utilization rate on commitments stabilize albeit at a historically low level.", "Notably, we recorded an increase in average commercial loans outstanding quarter-over-quarter. This is the first linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2008.", "At September 30th, total loans were approximately $3 billion higher than at June 30th. Again, signifying that we are seeing some improvement in loan demand coupled with an ongoing flight to quality as we continue to originate and renew lines and loans for our qualified customers, who want and who need credit.", "In fact, during the third of 2010, U.S. Bank originated over $16.5 billion of residential mortgages, originated almost $6 billion of other consumer loans, including installment loans, student loans, lines of credit and home equity lines and loans. We originated new prime-based credit card accounts with lines totaling $1.4 billion, and we issued $12 billion of new commitments and renewed almost $19 billion of commitments to small businesses, commercial and commercial real estate customers.", "Overall, excluding mortgage production, new originations plus new and renewed commitments total approximately $38 billion, about $2 billion higher than the previous quarter\u2019s total.", "Total average deposits increased by $15.3 billion or 9.8% over the same quarter of last year. Excluding acquisitions, the growth rate was 2.7% year-over-year. Total average deposits decline by $658 million on a linked to quarter basis primarily due to lower corporate trust, institutional trust and broker dealer deposits.", "Turning to slide seven. The company reported record total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.6 billion. The growth in revenue was driven by earning asset growth and expanding net interest margin, strength in our fee-based businesses, organic growth initiatives and acquisitions all tempered by the impact of recent legislative actions.", "Turning to slide eight and credit quality. Third quarter total net charge-offs of $995 million were 10.7% lower than the second quarter of 2010. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $171 million or 4.6%.", "On slide nine, you can see the early and late stage delinquencies excluding covered assets, improved again this quarter. The decrease in net charge-offs and nonperforming assets in addition to the favorable changes and early and late stage delinquencies and as detailed on the right-hand side of slide nine, the continuing favorable trend in criticized assets all indicate that we have reached the inflection point in credit quality.", "Accordingly, we expect the level of both net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets to continue to decline in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to slide 10. You can see that this is the first reporting period since the fourth quarter of 2007 that we have not recorded an incremental provision for loan losses. This compares with an incremental provision equal to approximately 2% of net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2010, and approximately 40% of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2009.", "Despite this positive trend in credit quality, we did not release reserves this quarter. Contrary to some of our peers, our loan portfolio and particularly a number of consumer loan categories has grown, and the economy, although showing some signs of stability continues to be uncertain with high unemployment and a very challenging real estate market.", "We entered this cycle with a strong and resilient balance sheet and we intend to protect that position going forward. Maintaining reserve levels commensurate with the growth and changing risk of our loan portfolio is an integral part of that effort. You will find additional credit information on all of the major loan categories in the appendix of this slide presentation.", "Finally, I wanted to address concerns about the validity of our foreclosure process and calls by many for a national moratorium. Our company\u2019s primary goal is to keep borrowers in their homes whenever possible. U.S. Bank participates in a number of loan modification programs including HAMP, which established affordable payment options for our customers.", "In addition, we have developed and implemented other foreclosure prevention methods that include early contact with delinquent borrowers, marketing outreach programs and participation of foreclosure provision workshops.", "In fact, since 2007, the U.S. Bank has modified over 34,000 loans with mortgage balances, outstanding of approximately $8.2 billion. The manageable size and quality of our portfolio allow us to manage the foreclosure process internally. Recall that U.S. Bank did not participate in the large scale origination and/or securitization of sub-prime or questionable loan structures.", "The foreclosure process that U.S. Bank follows well-established safeguards including both individual and committee review of each loan file to ensure that the foreclosure documentation is accurate. We routinely review our policies and procedures and we have just reassessed and reconfirmed the quality of our processes and controls. We will continue to review our processes going forward and comply with any information request we receive from our regulators or other government officials.", "We do not however have plans to halt foreclosures and we believe that any blanket foreclosure moratorium will seriously impair the national economic recovery.", "Before leaving this topic, I\u2019d like to spend a moment on discussing U.S. Bank\u2019s role as Trustee for mortgage securities as our company is referenced from time to time erroneously as having certain responsibilities with respect to transactions, where in fact our role is limited to very specific duties outlined in the documents that established the trust.", "As Trustee, U.S. Bank did not have a role in the servicing of mortgages that are used as collateral in the trust. As Trustee, we do not select the service of the mortgages or have a role in the actions the servicer takes in the foreclosure process. Further, as Trustee and/or Custodian, we do not have responsibility for determining the validity or enforceability of the underlying mortgage documents. That is the role of securitization sponsor.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I will take just a few minutes to provide you with a few more details about the results. I turn your attention to slide 12, which gives a full view of our third quarter 2010 results compared to those recorded in the second quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2009.", "Earnings per diluted common share were $0.45 for the third quarter 2010, equal to the prior quarter and $0.15 higher than the third quarter of 2009. The key drivers of the company\u2019s third quarter results are detailed on slide 13.", "The $305 million or 50.6% increase in net income year-over-year was primary the result of an 7.9% increase in net revenue and a $461 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was comprise of $46 million favorable variance in net charge-offs and a $415 million decrease in incremental provision expense. These favorable changes in total revenue and the provision were partially offset by a 16.2% increase in non-interest expense year-over-year.", "Net income was $142 million or 18.5% higher on a linked-quarter basis, a 1.5% growth in total net revenue and a favorable variance of $144 million in the provision for loan losses more than offset the slight increase in non-interest expense quarter-over-quarter.", "A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our third quarter results to prior periods are detailed on slide 14.", "The only significant item called off for the third quarter of 2010 were net securities losses of $9 million, not large enough to have an impact on the company\u2019s EPS.", "Earnings per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2010 included a $0.05 benefit related to the nonrecurring exchange of perpetual preferred stock for outstanding income trust securities. Other smaller items are listed for your review on this slide.", "Significant items impacting the third quarter of 2009 are also highlighted on slide 14. The largest item of which was a $415 million incremental provision expense.", "Turning to slide 15. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $320 million or 14.8% due to a $17.8 billion increase in average earning assets and an expanded net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets was primarily acquisition related.", "The net interest margin was 24 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2009, primarily to growth and low cost deposits, lower funding rates and improved credit spreads.", "On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $68 million, the result of both an increase in average earning assets slightly higher margin and day basis. The net interest margin was higher by just one basis point over the prior quarter as lower funding costs were partially offset by the incremental impact of the CARD Act. Assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect net interest margin to decline by five to 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the CARD Act and lower long-term rates.", "Slide 16 provides you with more detail on the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by $10.6 billion or 5.8% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, average total loans declined by 0.4% and as you can see from the chart in the left; this decline was driven by an 8.7% year-over-year decrease in average commercial loans outstanding.", "As Richard pointed out, the reduction in commercial and corporate lending year-over-year was primarily due to the utilization rate, which has declined from 32% in the third quarter of 2009 to 26% in the current quarter representing a decrease in excess of $3 billion.", "Covered loans, which grew by $9 billion year-over-year represent loans acquired through the FDIC-assisted transactions and include Downey, PFF and the banking operations of FBOP. The latter of which was acquired in October 31st of 2009.", "On the linked-quarter basis, the 0.7% increase in average loans outstanding was driven by increase in commercial loans, residential mortgage and total retail loans.", "Moving to slide 17. You can see the growth and total low-cost core deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $16.3 billion or 9.8% year-over-year partially due to acquisitions. Notably, low-cost core deposits, non-interest-bearing, interest checking, money market and savings, excluding acquisitions, grew by 9%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits decreased slightly, principally due to corporate and institutional customer activity, which was partially offset by low-cost deposit growth in the consumer bank.", "Slide 18 represents in more detail the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2010 was $70 million or 0.8% higher than the third quarter of 2009, this variance by growth in payments, commercial products and mortgage banking revenue. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower deposit service charges, which reflected the legislative and bank developed pricing changes and lower trust in investment management fees.", "On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was flat. Payments related revenue grew by 2.5% driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes and mortgage banking increased by $67 million driven by record high production volume and net securities losses were favorable. These positive items were offset by reductions in deposit service charges, the results as changes in overdraft policies and pricing, the Visa gain recorded in the second quarter of 2010 and a number of smaller variance in the other fee income accounts.", "Acquisitions had a minimal impact on the variance in fee revenue on a year-over-year or linked-quarter basis.", "Slide 19 highlights non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $332 million or 16.2%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to acquisitions, which accounted for $85 million of the increase, higher compensation and benefits expense driven by incentives, merit increase and the restoration of the 5% salary reductions taken as part of our cost savings programs in 2009 and additional staffing.", "Higher cost related to investments and tax advantage projects accounted for $22 million of the increase, an increase in professional services expense, and technology and communication expense related to investments and projects and high ORE expense, which will remain at the current levels as we aggressive manage the disposition of our ORE properties.", "On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense was higher by just $8 million or 0.3%.", "Finally, the tax rate on an equivalent basis was 25.9% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 25% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 25% in the second quarter of 2010 and 18.4% in the third quarter of 2009.", "Given the heightened focus on mortgage foreclosure and repurchases, we have provided more detail in the company\u2019s mortgage, repurchased related expense and the reserve or expected losses on repurchases and make whole payments on slide 20. We have also added this information to the supplemental financial data schedule attached to our quarterly earnings release.", "As indicated on the table on the left-hand side of the slide, are any reserve was $147 million at September 30th, and the addition to the reserve in the third quarter of 2010 was $70 million. This $70 million repurchased expense was booked as a contra [ph] revenue item in the mortgage banking fee income line.", "Mortgages repurchased and make whole payments in the third quarter totaled $53 million. Our company\u2019s conservative credit underwriting culture as well as our very disciplined loan origination process has resulted in lower repurchase volumes and expense relative to our peers.", "Given the current environment, we expect repurchase activity to remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters before beginning a moderate downward with quarterly repurchases expense of $50 to 70 million per quarter and any reserve levels of between $150 and 175 million.", "On slide 21, we have listed the two regulatory changes that have and will have an impact in our results and we wanted to give you a brief update, revenue assumptions related to these changes. We estimate that overdraft pricing and policy changes have reduced revenue year-to-date 2010 by approximately $140 million and we\u2019ll reduce revenue by an additional $110 to 120 million in the fourth quarter bringing our full year 2010 estimate to between $250 and $260 million.", "The annual run rate going forward is expected to be $440 to $480 million. This is slightly lower than our previous estimate and does not include any mitigating actions. Overall, our opt-in rate has been higher than expected. But our pricing changes are lower than anticipated; number of overdraft incidences keeps us from materially changing our estimates.", "The CARD Act has reduced total revenue year-to-date by approximately $100 million and is expected to reduce revenue by approximately $60 to 80 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect the total 2000 revenue impact to be in the range of $160 to 180 million with an annual run rate going forward or approximately $250 million.", "Finally, turning to slide 22, an update on the impact of Basel III. We originally presented this analysis at our Investor Day in September and we have now the numbers as of September 30th and the numbers have not changed materially. The impact of limits for mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets and investment of financial institutions remains at zero.", "The impact of the deduction for the pension liability, purchased credit card relationship intangibles and all others equals 38 basis points, while the changes related to our non-core capital elements are trust preferreds, net or replacement capital requirements is equal to 45 basis points. All of this translates to a pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio as of September 30th of 7.2% and a Tier 1 ratio of 9.4%.", "On a pro forma basis, this puts us above the Tier 1 common equity target of 7%, the Basel III level required in the year 2019.", "However, two items remain uncertain. First, the implementation timetable of the counter cyclical component of capital remains uncertain, and second, the systemic rib buffer has yet to be defined. Regardless, we have the capital we need today and we continue to generate significant capital each and every quarter. So, I\u2019m very satisfied that we can manage our capital requirements going forward.", "Moving to the right side, hand side of the slide, I would say first that our \u2013 and foremost that our liquidity has never been stronger. There is still a number of unknowns in regard to how Basel III will be implemented. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate deposits and liquidity, we feel any change will be manageable and we have already have a number of initiatives underway to ensure that we are prepared.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. To include our formal remarks, I turn your attention to slide 23.", "On September 15th, we held an Investor Day in New York City. The theme of the day was Position to Win. Our presentation has highlighted our strong foundation including our ability to manage credit and risk, our diversified business mix and our prudent capital management.", "We discussed how we have proven our ability to perform even during one of the most challenging and uncertain economic cycles. We talked about how we have invested in our business line and as a result are building profitable scale and growing our market share.", "Our third results fully support our belief that U.S. Bancorp is operating from a position of strength and remains position to win. We are moving forward with optimism despite the headwinds of new regulatory and legislative actions and oversight and still an uncertain economy. We are focused on the future and we are ready and willing to do what we can to support the economic recovery of this country. We\u2019re also standing our engaged \u2013 engaged and performance-driven workforce in creating superior value for our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Market.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, John.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hey, John.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions for you on lending \u2013 particularly commercial and can you talk a little bit about where that growth is coming from if that\u2019s part of your national initiative or the small business initiative that you have. Just give us an idea of where that demand is coming from.", "Richard Davis", "So, John, this is Richard. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Bill Parker to chime in. We\u2019re seeing it across the board slowly, just a little bit and just about everywhere. So, what we\u2019re seeing is the qualified customers are now starting to come back into the marketplace as you think about the most qualified are the ones who least needed to use our balance sheet to grow their companies and are starting now to see enough reason to incur some debt and to develop some inventory consider some investments.", "So, on the corporate banking side, as you know we\u2019ve continued to enjoy some growth there. But these customers who got a very strong capital market to use as well and in some cases, they\u2019re now using both the capital markets and the bank balance sheet and we\u2019re starting to see some growth there. It\u2019s probably our most important growth, comes from the commercial banking middle market area, where we\u2019re seeing continued slow, but steady increases across the entire geography.", "We currently see stress in entertainment and gaming sections as you would expect and then, all of our areas, where we have appraisals for owner occupied real estate. They continue to reflect decreasing values and there are some continued stress in all those areas as you would expect.", "Community banking is steady as it always has been, and agriculture looks to be very solid this year with a little overproduction being offset by higher commodity prices. And finally, small business continue to be very strong for us not only because we\u2019re starting to see a new lift in a number of small businesses getting to a point, where they\u2019re strong enough now to incur some debt.", "But a couple of years ago, we placed a full court press on becoming more involved in small business lending from traditional to SBA to small ticket leasing and those benefits are starting to yield results by the hundreds of new employees we put in place and the back offices we created to do a better job at small lending. So, for us, it\u2019s a lot of a little bit everywhere and a little bit of our good work a few years ago, starting to come into fruition.", "So, Bill, you might add to that?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, I\u2019ll start with small business. I mean I was up about 1% just in the quarter, second quarter to third quarter, and that\u2019s pretty much across the board whether it was SBA or the loan, small business loans originated out of our branches. We\u2019ve had fairly steady growth in that area the last several quarters.", "And then on the corporate middle market side, we have a strong emphasis on leading credits. We\u2019ve been able to successfully gain some market share in those areas. So, we\u2019ve seen pretty good loan demand here in the last quarter.", "Richard Davis", "You got more than one question, John?", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Yes, just the next question is more of a \u2013 just changing the retail. Obviously, you\u2019ve highlighted your Reg E issue and we have that will show off at some point. But how do you think about the retail checking product, some of your larger competitors have made some changes in terms of the account structure and just curios what you\u2019re thinking is. Is it higher minimum? Is it monthly piece, you know how do you get paid for your retail branch network.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, John. First of all, you know to our competitors, go forth. We\u2019re going to wait and I think after this last time, we, I think, have the luxury and we\u2019ve earned the positioned to watch and learn. I have no idea what\u2019s the customer going to want at this next range, and I\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re going to get it all back without knowing what that means.", "We have to have a value proposition. We have to have a relationship that\u2019s got more than a transaction account attached to it. We\u2019re building all those preparations. But I\u2019ll say, I think it\u2019s going to be a monthly service charge, but I think it\u2019s going to be for more than the standard checking account.", "I think people will be able to offset any of those charges like having deeper relationships and different value transactions with the company, but I am not going to move on that quickly. We\u2019re going to \u2013 I think I said this last time, we\u2019ll withhold some near-term earnings by not jumping into freight early, by taking a little longer to learn what the right answer is, perhaps take some market share while people are adjusting more quickly to figure out the right answer and then, we\u2019ll deliver something to you all when we have a better idea of what this next generation of checking pricing looks like.", "Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Okay, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Ed.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hi, Ed.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Good morning, guys. I was just wondering if you I could flip you back to page 21.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "And I guess I just didn\u2019t quite understand exactly what you were saying on that page in terms of the impact, if you could just go through that quickly one more time.", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. This is the regulatory environment, Ed?", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Yes.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "The terms.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So, you know, both CARD Act and the overdraft Reg E changes had been slowly impacting us more and more, each and every quarter of 2010. I would say we\u2019re getting to the full run rate in the fourth quarter. So, we were not at the full run rate in the third quarter and certainly, not in the first half of the year, so that 110 and 120 represents the full run rate and four times that amount is what you see for next year \u2013", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "The full run rate of the negative revenue impact on a free tax basis.", "Andrew Cecere", "That is correct, Ed.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "OK.", "Andrew Cecere", "And that is correct for both the overdraft and the CARD Act impact, and the CARD Act is both in fee income and in net interest margin.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Right, okay. So, this is a revenue \u2013 sort of a lost revenue estimate on a pre-taxed basis based on these regulatory actions.", "Richard Davis", "That is correct.", "Andrew Cecere", "That\u2019s right. Another great thing is quarter four is finally hitting stride multiply, kind of by four and you\u2019re kind of there without the mitigating discussion that we had John a minute ago.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. And then next question would be with respect to the net interest margin outlook for the fourth quarter down to five to 10 basis points. Obviously, we saw good stability and good net interest income growth. This quarter, you indicated it was below rate backdrop. Could you put a little more color around that and would you expect it to stabilize subsequent to 4Q or is this the beginning of a \u2013 a bit of a NIM compression trend.", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, there are two key factors that are driving the fourth quarter. One is what you just asked about, which is the full impact of CARD Act on our credit card rates and yields in the fourth quarter will be fully baked in so to speak, and that\u2019s going to cause a bit of that compression.", "The second item as you know long rates are down versus where we were in the first half of the year and that has a negative impact on both our securities portfolio and other earning assets. So, those are the two key drivers. Those are what\u2019s causing the five to 10-basis point declines in the fourth quarter, depending upon what happens with long rates in 2011.", "You know I don\u2019t know how that will look, but as we see today and what the yield curve looks like today, that\u2019s what the impact is. If it doesn\u2019t change a lot that in fact will be relatively stable. If the yield curve changes, that will adjust.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "[Inaudible].", "Richard Davis", "Yes, we\u2019re not trying to guess beyond quarter four, and we\u2019re just trying to say show you what moves.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Right. But I mean when you say be relatively stable, and if the interest rates remain stable, you mean it will get down to that level, but not \u2013potentially not compress a lot further than that or when you say relatively stable you mean \u2013", "Andrew Cecere", "[Inaudible].", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Ongoing down at that phase?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, had we been fairly consistent in trying to lock out 90 days because there was so many moving parts with margin. I would say relatively stable, given what I know today about the yield curve and about rates. But there are a lot of moving parts there and we\u2019ll be sure to update you every quarter like we\u2019ve been doing.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. And then last question, obviously, very strong mortgage origination revenue this quarter. Do you care to make any comments on your outlook for mortgage origination volume or revenue?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. So, Ed, we had about $16.5 billion of production, a record quarter over $20 billion of house, so another record. So, it was a tremendous quarter given the low rate environment.", "The hedge was neutral, so that we didn\u2019t benefit at all from the hedge. And you know as you compare it on a year-over-year basis year ago, we\u2019ve actually made about $67 million on that. I would expect the third quarter to be down somewhat \u2013 I mean excuse me; the fourth quarter will be down somewhat just given the seasonality in the mortgage business.", "Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Andrew Cecere", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, John.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hey, John.", "John McDonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein Research", "Hi, good morning, guys. Andy, just on expenses, if you could comment \u2013 give an outlook on expenses, if we\u2019d kind of think X the FDIC expense increase that you discussed coming on next year. Is this quarter kind of a good runway on expenses? Do you have any other kind of puts and takes to mention going forward that we should think about on expenses?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So, you know, John, when we talked a little bit about this last quarter and I said that the third quarter was a pretty good rate and our second quarter was a pretty good run rate for the third quarter and it ended up being that way. We\u2019re up $8 million. So, I would say that we have most of the components included.", "I think a couple of the unknowns are certainly as you mentioned, the FDIC expense you saw yesterday that the three basis point increase is no longer part of the equation. But the equation is still uncertain and the exact rates are still uncertain, so that\u2019s a factor.", "The fourth quarter is seasonally higher with our CDIC or tax credit related expense, so that will be up a little bit. But I don\u2019t see any other material changes.", "John McDonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein Research", "Okay. And Richard, you touched on the reserve release or the lack of reserve release compared to some of the peers. So, just anymore color on kind of what factors will drive whether U.S. Bank has any kind of recapture of reserves over the next couple of quarters as credit continues to improve.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, John. I think \u2013 as I said, you know, all the other quarters, it\u2019s a lot more mass than it is ours. So, we let the mass dictate where we are and I have to say that if we continue to see progression in our delinquency improvements and our nonperforming outsets, we will probably see a reserve release in the future quarters.", "As I also said about a year ago, if we end up doing that, it\u2019s because we failed in our ability to predict perfectly and that will be the case. But I don\u2019t think [inaudible] at this situation today. We don\u2019t ever put it away with the goal of getting it back later. We simply put it away based on the math of what we see in the current day.", "As Bill would tell you, particularly consumer loans are based on a four quarter full review. Commercial loans are a little more lumpy and more individual based on company and in bold cases, they\u2019re coming down. But I also want to make sure that we end this cycle with very, very strong reserve levels \u2013 adequate and strong reserve levels for our loan offices as we go into the improving scenario. So, I think that if we keep following the map like we have, you\u2019ll start to see some reserve capture, but it won\u2019t be significant and it wasn\u2019t intentional.", "John McDonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein Research", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, question just on the liability management side. When we talked about NIM compression, what you know could happen with the long end of the curve coming down. But maybe give us some color as to how you are healing the liability side, opportunities to bring down your cost of funding there and maybe you could speak a little bit to the possibility \u2013 yes or no of troughs redemption.", "Andrew Cecere", "So, a couple of things. We issued two \u2013 we had two debt issuances in the last few months, both at the lowest rate ever issued by a bank holding company in the U.S. to five-year paper and three-year. And I will tell you that we don\u2019t have a lot more issuance plan for the remainder of the year and we don\u2019t have a lot rolling off in 2011.", "Secondly, we have been growing deposit as you\u2019ve seen, low-cost core retail deposits which is helpful in terms of our funding cost and we will have the second component or the second half of the it\u2019s transaction that occurs late first quarter, early second quarter of 2011. Those are the key components. We\u2019re watching on the further redemption in terms of the rules around what counts as capital, but we have no plans to do an early exchange right now.", "Richard Davis", "And that\u2019s it Richard, let me just say, I\u2019ve instructed our team to be aggressive on deposit gathering. So, while you\u2019re hearing that there\u2019s going to be a growth of long growth, I ask you believe that we\u2019re going to continue to grow based on market share grab. I\u2019m going to make that assumption and therefore, we\u2019re going to keep going to deposits and I think whichever bank ends this downturn goes into the recovery with the most customers, with the most deposits especially cored deposits will end up winning the next cycle. So, we\u2019re not backing down. We have the ability to be aggressive in the deposit pricing based on relationships and we\u2019re doing it across the board.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Don\u2019t you agree the loan growth is not as significant as the funding side? It does give you some room to bring down the higher cost that you\u2019ve got on your balance sheet.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I think also, Betsy, it may lead us to build our securities portfolio a bit, not material, but a bit as we continue to build our liquidity coverage ratio and strengthen our liquidity on balance sheet.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All right, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Sure, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Good morning, guys.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Nancy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hi.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Okay. I realized that asking this question will be an exercise in futility, but I need to ask it anyway.", "Richard Davis", "Go for it.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Okay, a dividend question.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "You had said that you would like to pay the dividend or grow the dividend the first possibly opportunity. Jamie Dimon has said the same thing. Vikram Pandit had said don\u2019t expect anything in 2011.", "Do you have any sense, Richard, of whether the regulators are going to sign off on the resumption of dividend growth, wholesale for the industry as they did with the cuts or they\u2019re going to look at it company by company and maybe awhile some in 2011 and postpone the rest until later?", "Richard Davis", "Okay. So, this is \u2013 you set it up and I\u2019ll confirm. This is just my opinion and based on the data I collect, I think that it\u2019ll be the latter or the former. I think they\u2019re going to allow banks individually with permission to move forward on dividend resumption and/or stock buybacks.", "Here\u2019s my current, in my head, the timeline looks like this. G20 Heads of State meet in the end of November. They confirm what the finance ministers have said all along. They confirm the capital levels, then they leave to the domestic local domains to decide what kind of systemic important capital, buffer there maybe, and other things that each country may want to add.", "Once and when our government and our Fed and Treasury have decided what that is for our banks, I think they\u2019ll continue to pursue this stress testing that we have all been under and that we\u2019ve all been pursuing for quite some time, along with our capital plans and our liquidity plans. And if and when we can attach all of those acceptable actions to their requirements and we meet the test of the capital levels, then I think banks, as they find themselves satisfying those measures, will get out.", "And I think \u2013 I hope that\u2019s the case because I would hate that we have to wait for the lowest common denominator. And I also think it would be prudent for a lot of reasons for the recovery of this economy to allow banks significant dividend payers to give their shareholders what they\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time. So, I\u2019m going to stick with what I believe, because it serves us well to believe that will be the case. And we\u2019re operating on the basis that each of us will get out as we have permission and as we have earned it and we\u2019re working hard to earn it.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Secondly, could you just \u2013 I\u2019m assuming you were at the dinner with Elizabeth Warren on this topic of how she was going to structure her bureau going forward, et cetera. Do you have any greater insight into how that\u2019s going to occur and what we should be looking at in terms of timing for product requirements, et cetera?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, with the same disclaimer I gave a second ago. And in fact, I introduced her at that dinner in my role at the roundtable and had breakfast with her the morning of. And I\u2019m quite comfortable that her first most important activity as she builds the agencies, she\u2019s not running it, is to focus almost exclusively on disclosures, transparency and simplicity. As she has made clear to everybody that night, she\u2019s made it clear to a few of us even since then so.", "So, first and foremost, the Consumer Protection Bureau as it\u2019s beginning to become an agency is going to focus on clarity and simplicity of transparency communications and disclosures. We all welcome that, by the way, because we need a Safe Harbor to help us create these more simplified, easier to understand protocols when, in fact, we have so many issues on a legal side, that if we don\u2019t put everything in the 25-page document, we\u2019ll find ourselves in harm\u2019s way. So, I\u2019m looking forward to that as her first effort.", "I think, as you probably know what I know, the responsibility for that agency to be up and running isn\u2019t until mid-2011; at which point I believe they\u2019ll have the key players and they have the key mandate, which will then follow some of the rule-making that we\u2019re all going to be eager to get. But I think that\u2019s a mid-2011, so little come out of it beyond disclosures in the next couple of quarters. That\u2019s my thought.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Hi.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "I just wanted to get your take on the Mortgage Origination business at this point. You\u2019ve got a pretty good track record when it comes to this.", "During the bubble years, you weren\u2019t a big player and that helped you avoid a lot of the issues others are facing or have faced and are facing now. And then you\u2019ve been gaining share in the last couple of years, which I think has proven to be pretty profitable. So, a lot of the noise out there relates to previous originations, but there\u2019s just \u2013 in general I think a lot of uncertainty in terms of the prophesies going forward and what spreads will looked like. And I\u2019m just wondering what your take is on the business overall, and remind us how you think of retail versus wholesale channels.", "Richard Davis", "Okay. I\u2019ll go first, and then Andy can talk about spreads. This is Richard.", "We like the business as much as we did a couple of years ago, when we decided to stave off and more than double our investment in it. We were in the high teens as an originator and servicer a couple of years ago, and now we\u2019re four or five, five or six. Sadly, it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re so amazing. It\u2019s because so many between us have moved on or consolidated, so it\u2019s a little both.", "What I like about though is we haven\u2019t left our old-fashioned approach of doing it very, very close to the customer. We have six locations across the country, where we take care of our mortgage business. They\u2019re in large centers, which are handled by very, very capable people. And when we added to our business, we didn\u2019t add any new locations, we didn\u2019t add any new capabilities, we just added more people under the current management to do twice as much work.", "So, I\u2019m very comfortable with our approach. It\u2019s a low-cost approach. We have our largest centers in places like Oshkosh, Wisconsin and Nevada, Missouri and Owensboro, Kentucky. So, we have a great workforce and then a great cost of doing business, and we\u2019re just going to continue to grow at those points.", "Right now, we\u2019re operating, as you know, on a significantly higher refi market than origination market. That will serve all of us well to keep people busy for a while. But I think that when the recovery finally attaches itself, and probably a couple of years from now on the mortgage side, you\u2019ll start to see the old-fashioned originations outtake the refinances. And we\u2019ll be ready for that as well.", "The mix can be a little bit different based on refi versus origination, but we\u2019re prepared for both of those. And then, Matt, we also have a pretty good wholesale business. And we have not gotten out of all the broker businesses, because we weren\u2019t in any broker businesses we didn\u2019t like. Some of our peers are moving away from that.", "And like everything else, we are staying with the old-fashioned way of the way we did it in the first place. And Wholesale does have a pretty good volume stream that kind of mitigate some of the peaks and flows that what would otherwise happen in the retail side, although the margins are a little bit skinnier.", "So, we\u2019re a very blended, very basic mortgage business, just bigger than we were before. And frankly, we\u2019re going to keep investing in it because we think that, again, at the recovery point, he whoever has the most critical mass, whether customers or not being outsourced to anybody else to accomplish those needs, are going to be better off. That\u2019s the kind of the growth side. Andy, you might talk about the margins.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, on the margin side. Matt, again on sale margins are probably a little higher than what would be normal in this environment, maybe 125 or 150. They probably will moderate down a bit, maybe 100 to 125, but it\u2019s still be a profitable and well-run business for us.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. I mean, just as a follow-up here. I guess, as you think about the servicing side of the business, does not need to be repriced, given just the general higher risk? And what seems to be the higher cost of just the overall responsibility in that business?", "Richard Davis", "Well, I think that as we tried to demonstrate with the numbers and the additional disclosure we provided, we\u2019ve actually have a very nominal increases in costs there because we\u2019ve run the business very well. We\u2019ve been very prudent in our underwriting and our processes. And the put-backs that we have relative to the size of our book is actually quite small and manageable.", "So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the profitability and the way we\u2019re pricing right now.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Well, I guess, let me frame that another way. The cost of the servicing for most of your competitors has gone up quite a bit, so I think they need to find a way to try and reprice that over time. So, there could be some benefit for you. I mean, just in general, it feels like the servicing business for the industry wasn\u2019t priced for what we\u2019re seeing now in terms of the costs and the burden.", "Andrew Cecere", "I don\u2019t disagree with you, and I don\u2019t disagree with the fact that, that maybe a benefit to us given the way we run the business.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. I\u2019m glad you concluded that, because I think it\u2019s actually a net positive if we continue to stick to [inaudible]. So, we\u2019re going to see as a positive to a neutral.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Matt.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heather Wolf with UBS Securities.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS Securities", "I understand you guys don\u2019t want to make any guidance forecast going into 2011. But can you at least give us a sense for maybe the dollar value of securities that are coming due in 2011? And what kind of reinvestment risks you\u2019re seeing currently?", "Richard Davis", "Heather, so the way I\u2019d answer that question is I would expect our securities book net to grow a few billion dollars in 2011, so nothing significantly material. We\u2019re on a $49 to 50 billion book. It\u2019s going to grow up a few billion dollars.", "We\u2019re putting on \u2013 the majority of what we\u2019re putting on are floaters versus fixed. And as I talked about that five to 10 basis points going to next quarter that\u2019s part of the reason for the decline. But it won\u2019t have a significant material impact on neither the balance sheet nor the net interest margin as we see it today for 2011.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS Securities", "So, you don\u2019t think that the existing portfolio poses much reinvestment risk, given where 10 years are today?", "Richard Davis", "Well, it does post some reinvestment risk. But given the size of what\u2019s was rolling off versus we\u2019re putting on, it doesn\u2019t equate to a large number for 2011.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS Securities", "And what\u2019s rolling off is not rolling off at substantially higher yields than what you can find in the marketplace today?", "Richard Davis", "It is, Heather, as you know. But again, given the level of the roll-off and we\u2019re reinvesting, the math there just doesn\u2019t create a huge difference.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS Securities", "I see. So, you\u2019re just making it up in volume?", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 UBS Securities", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "You got it.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yes, thank you.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hey, Paul.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, how you guys doing. On increased loan demand, there has been some story that I think the Fed released a report saying that for the first time, they\u2019ve seen banks ease their credit standards.", "Can you add some color around that? How do you ease your credit standards, which has increased your loan demand out there, which helped you grow your balance sheet this quarter?", "Richard Davis", "I\u2019ll let Bill answer, but absolutely, no. Go ahead, Bill. Knock yourself out.", "Bill Parker", "Yes. Yes, I mean our underwriting standards haven\u2019t changed since 10 years ago. But I think when they site things like that, what they\u2019re talking about is when you go on to the down cycle, what used to be maybe a five-year revolvers for investment-grade credit collapse back to one-year and three-year revolvers.", "Now, they\u2019re going back out to five years. That\u2019s some of the things they\u2019re talking about when they talk about that \"easing.\" So, that\u2019s not \u2013", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Bill Parker", "For us, it\u2019s not an underwriting issue.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Richard. I also think that you will see \u2013 because the regulators are so keen on watching for quality, I think the only thing you might see is pricing issues, where some are going to be hungrier and take some risks on either pricing, and maybe even whole levels. But the regulators are very much on top of this. And by the way, we\u2019re all welcoming that because we\u2019d rather that they are giving us current feedback than a late feedback.", "So, I think you\u2019ll find any changes or adjustments will come in pricing, much less than in underwriting.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Did you hear a lot of stories about like people that need credit can\u2019t get credit, and people that don\u2019t need credit have all the credit in the world. And I\u2019m just wondering, we\u2019re starting to see people always talk about loan growth and is the first time we\u2019ve seen it. Is that things now losing up a little bit in the world, including for you guys, not necessarily underwriting standards, but much more willing to lend out there.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. So, it\u2019s not either though. We\u2019re not getting any standards. I don\u2019t think the industry is changing its willingness to lend either. I think it\u2019s a slow but predicted outcome that some of the customers, who restructure the way they live, both consumers, small businesses and large businesses and large corporate, they\u2019re now becoming more qualified because they\u2019ve done all the heavy lifting of getting themselves back in shape to now incur more debt and we\u2019re more attracted of them because they don\u2019t have those kinds of risks.", "So, it\u2019s really more of that, more qualified people and those who became more qualified by their good efforts in the last couple of years. A long recession is something we\u2019re all trying to figure out how to live within and among, but it helped us get more clarity around those who took early actions and are now getting more prepared for a better future.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, thank you very much, gentlemen.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, Mike.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Good morning. First on Basel III, are you running Basel II right now? And how many more quarters until you can go off running parallel, assuming you are on parallel?", "Richard Davis", "Mike, we are running the Basel I and reporting on Basil I today. We would enter our parallel run in 2011. The numbers I\u2019ve given you are Basil I, with Basel III rules applied.", "When you think about Basel II, with Basel III rules applied, they actually would be better than the ratios that I\u2019ve showed you of 90 to 100 basis points.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "So, if you were on parallel in 2011, maybe the ball goes bright in 2012, you could get off running parallel?", "Richard Davis", "That is the typical plan for the parallel run on this fourth quarter. It\u2019s correct. And while we begin in January 1 of \u201811. So, we\u2019re \u2013 remember we weren\u2019t $250 billion at the beginning of the Basel activity, so we had to opt-in a few years ago when we hit the $250 billion. So, we\u2019re ready to roll in January.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Okay, and a far as the eventual target, you said you needed to make sure that, that the rules were which makes sense. But would that mean you have to wait until the U.S. decides on what the minimum ratios are which could be another year or so?", "Andrew Cecere", "I guess the answer is whatever the Fed decides, right? So, the Fed will along with the Treasury will decide what to the U.S. answer will be to all of the requirements and Basel. And once they decide what qualifies in terms of where the buffers went it, where the systemic important companies would be charged, that\u2019s what I\u2019m waiting for.", "And so, I\u2019m not even trying to figure out what America is going to do. I\u2019m just waiting for the American response to whatever the G20 says and counting on people like the Treasury and the Fed to be thoughtful enough to let the banks that have shown and proven themselves to be ready to do that to get on and move on with that dividend.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. And then separately, loan utilization. I guess 26%, that\u2019s still the all-time low, isn\u2019t it?", "Andrew Cecere", "As long as \u2013", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Andrew Cecere", "We recorded it is, yes.", "Richard Davis", "It is, yes.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "On the one hand, we have an all-time low on loan utilization. On the other hand, you\u2019re growing loans a little bit more.", "Richard Davis", "Right.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "And we\u2019ve been hearing this from \u2013 everyone\u2019s kind of cautiously optimistic. Would you call yourself still cautiously optimistic? Or is this the real deal? We\u2019re getting loan growth back and it\u2019s going to take off?", "Richard Davis", "We\u2019re definitely cautiously optimistic because I do think we\u2019re starting to see the first glimmer now. One quarter doesn\u2019t in turn make void. It\u2019s a lot better than having to continue decreases.", "For us, a flattening utilization is exceptionally exciting because if our loan utilization \u2013 remember we just do wholesale. So, a lot of banks have high utilization levels, they have seen credit cards and consumer and all that. This is wholesale for us. ", "Just in absolute dollars and as Andy mentioned in the call, we\u2019re down $3 billion on wholesale commitment adjustment; just the same outstandings being used less. So, those commitments start to kick. That\u2019s on top of the growth that you\u2019re seeing today. Because as you said, were not getting it from utilization. We\u2019re getting it from old-fashioned new customers and new growth.", "So for us, we\u2019re quite optimistic that this can get much lower, and it will be the first thing we\u2019ll see as a consistent behavior, people are starting to use our balance sheet again over themselves trying to find everything.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "And then just one last question, a more general question. So, your revenue growth target is 7 to 8%. What would you need in the environment before you could achieve that sort of revenue growth target?", "In other words, I imagine 10-year rates, wherever it is right now, 2.55% is not going to do it. What kind of normal environment would you need before you could realistically say you might be able to get that sort of revenue growth?", "Andrew Cecere", "I think you said \u2013 Mike, this is Andy. I think you said it correctly via normal economic environment, so normal GDP growth maybe 3 to 4%. Normal long-term rates or normal yield curve and finally, normal levels of unemployment backed down to the eights. So, this isn\u2019t the environment that we\u2019re going to achieve that because we\u2019re not seeing a loan growth because yields are \u2013 the low [ph] at the long end is very low.", "But when we get to that normal environment, same-store sales, spend all those things get back to normal economic levels that\u2019s when we could achieve that.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Just one quick follow-up there. If you have 4% GDP growth for over the long term, how do you get from 4% GDP growth to 7 to 8% revenue growth?", "Andrew Cecere", "By a couple of things, pricing and taking share.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "All right. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Sure. Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, David.", "David Konrad \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. Just really a follow-up to Matt\u2019s question on [inaudible] I guess more specifically the servicing. I mean if the bulk of your market share came kind of relatively recent phenomena, would it be fair to assume that the advantages and the servicing portfolio are relatively recent rather than kind of driven by a \u201805, \u201806 period?", "And just wondered if you have any comment on exposure to private label servicing, if there is any?", "Andrew Cecere", "Second question first, no exposure to private label. Our vintages have actually are pretty steady stream. If you think about it, we\u2019ve been growing throughout the years as Richard mentioned.", "One of the reasons we\u2019ve moved up the ranking is people are no longer the list. So, I want to say we have a waiting one way or the other it\u2019s fairly linear.", "David Konrad \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great.

Just a couple of quick questions.", "On slide 29, taking a look at the home-equity delinquencies, they are up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Is there any color you can provide on that? Or was that largely expected?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I mean, believe it or not, there is seasonal patterns to the home-equity. And the seasonal increase this year was down substantially from last year and the prior year. So, it\u2019s been trending down, so very comfortable with the outlook there.", "Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay.", "Richard Davis", "It\u2019s [inaudible] to also say, it\u2019s one of our best portfolios. When this thing is all over, pull it back and with herald fewer portfolios in the quality of our home-equity portfolio. So, I\u2019ll also give it a bit of a pass because it\u2019s a very low level and I think the movement is pretty small.", "If we saw an upward trend over a couple of quarters, I might start to worry. But I think it has past the hundred \u2013 there\u2019s a high-water mark fast and you\u2019re going to see it steady out here for a while.", "Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then just a second question on net interest margin. What assumptions are you all embedding in your assumption for fourth quarter NIM in terms of loan growth?", "Richard Davis", "Similar what you see here in the third quarter.", "Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. So, basically no ramp-up in loan growth?", "Andrew Cecere", "Correct.", "Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay, super. Thanks very much, guys.", "Andrew Cecere", "You bet.", "Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.", "Richard Davis", "Good morning, Meredith.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Good morning. I have a little bit of an unorthodox question, when I still and speak to the much smaller banks that will be below the radar screen for any type acquisition, they obviously are very challenged by the cost of regulatory burdens. And I\u2019m wondering what opportunities want to have as banker\u2019s bank, what you can do for the smaller community banks and how that may provide a growth opportunity for you that doesn\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing in betweens, so you\u2019re seen as more of a friend than necessarily large competitor?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I like that question. We have got over 2,000 banks that we are \u2013 the bank too and a number of significant ways. And what we\u2019re doing know is we\u2019re trying to go back to them and talk to them about their cost structures and telling them that if they want to give us their credit card portfolio and let us private label. If they wanted to give us their corporate payments business and give them something they don\u2019t have that they want to handoff to us, some of our correspondent banking capabilities.", "We can help them reduce their cost structure. We can take the scale, we enjoyed and both of us can do better by performing something like that. Also the servicing ATM machines, we\u2019re finding a lot of interest.", "And so, if I was a small bank, I\u2019d say look, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to make it and I want to get my cost structure down, I\u2019m going to have to go somewhere or I might have not gone before and let someone I trust do that for me on a wide label basis and therefore, I can go out and have some of the stress and revenue side until I can get to the other end of the recession.\u201d", "So, actually it\u2019s a quite \u2013 you\u2019re very \u2013 it\u2019s not unorthodox. It\u2019s a great question and we see this as a very positive. I thought you were headed to small banks being available for sale and this is actually, in our case, a more attractive because it\u2019s got long and permanent approach to it.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Sure. And is that something that we\u2019d be able to see the growth structure? Is that something that\u2019s going to be material to earnings? Is that going to be a growth channel that\u2019s going to be meaningful to investors?", "Richard Davis", "The corresponding banking business for us is very big and because it\u2019s already big, it doesn\u2019t move a lot in terms of volume to show it. But to the extent that that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a really good idea. I think I\u2019ll introduce something in our next presentation to give you guys a sense of where it is today and then, we can use that as a measure to track because I\u2019m expecting that to be one of our growth initiatives as you just cited. So, we\u2019ll have that.", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Okay, terrific. Thank you so much.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Meredith.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks.", "Operator", "At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.", "Judith Murphy", "Thank you, all, for listening to our review of the quarterly results. And please, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call us in Investor Relations.", "Richard Davis", "And this is Richard, let me thank you for your attention to our call. We are standing ready anytime you have any questions. We are transparent and you know that, and we\u2019re only hesitating sometimes because the environment we\u2019re in would cause us to make mistakes by trying to guess too far forward.", "But I think you\u2019ve just heard a very consistent, predictable, repeatable story. And as much as it may not be that exciting, because it doesn\u2019t have a lot of unexpected outcomes, it is a one that we\u2019re proud of and we\u2019re excited to tell the story. So, anytime, give us a call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith Murphy", "Thank you, Deshante. Good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2011 results, and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at www.usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin on Page 3 of the presentation, and point out a few highlights from our first quarter results. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.046 billion for the first quarter of 2011 or $0.52 per diluted common share. Our earnings were $0.18 higher than the same quarter of last year, and $0.03 higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Included in this quarter's results was a gain related to the acquisition of the First Community Bank of New Mexico that positively impacted earnings per diluted common share by $0.02.", "We achieved total net revenue of $4.5 billion this quarter, which represented a 4.6% increase over the same quarter of 2010, with a 4.3% decline from the prior quarter, which primarily reflected our company's normal first quarter seasonality. ", "Total average loans grew year-over-year by 2.4% or 2.1% excluding acquisitions. Importantly, for the third quarter in a row, we achieved linked quarter loan growth as total loans grew by 1.1% over the fourth quarter or 0.7% adjusted for acquisitions. Deposit growth was exceptionally strong this quarter, with average low-cost deposit balances increasing by 15.3% year-over-year, and 6.7% linked quarter. ", "Excluding acquisitions, the year-over-year growth rate was a strong 10.2%, and a linked quarter growth was 2.1%. As expected, credit quality improved as net charge-offs declined by 14.1% and non-performing assets, excluding covered assets of the First Community Bank of New Mexico acquisition, which you may recall that not include a loss share agreement, declined by 4.7% from the fourth quarter.", "Further, this improvement in our credit quality supported a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, and the company recorded a provision for credit losses that was $15 million less than the net charge-offs in the first quarter. Our company continues to generate significant capital each quarter, and our capital position remains strong, with the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios increasing to 8.2% and 10.8% respectively at quarter's end.", "Slide 4 displays our consistent performance metrics over the past 5 quarters. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.38%, and return on average common equity was 14.5%. The 5 quarter trends of our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. As expected, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.69% was lower than the same quarter last year and the prior quarter, and Andy will discuss the factors that led to this change in a few minutes.  Our first quarter efficiency ratio was 51.1%, lower than the prior quarter, but above the same quarter of last year. We remain the best among our peers in terms of efficiency, and see this ratio continuing to average in the low 50s, reflecting both revenue growth and cost associated with ongoing investments, as well as the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions on our revenue and on our expense.", "Turning to Slide 5, as I previously noted, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. In fact, our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III guidelines at March 31 was 7.7%, well above the 7% Basel III level required in 2019. ", "Turning to Slide 6. We were pleased to announce the long anticipated increase in our dividend on March 18 after receiving word from the regulators that they did not object to our proposed increase or other capital actions. We announced a 150% increase in our dividend, raising the annual rate from $0.20 to $0.50.  In addition, the Board of Directors authorized the $50 million share repurchase program. We believe the ability to buy back stock is important, allowing flexibility and returning capital to shareholders over time. In 2011, however, buybacks are not expected to be meaningful until the final Basel III guidelines are established later this year.", "Moving to Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by $4.7 billion or 2.4% year-over-year. And in total, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments were over $35 billion this quarter compared with approximately $27 billion in the first quarter of last year, representing a 28% increase in new activity.  Importantly, total corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased by 9.6% year-over-year, and 2.3%, linked quarter, positioning us to quickly fulfill our customers' lending needs as confidence returns and recovery takes a firm hold.", "Total average deposits increased by $21.8 billion or 11.9% over the same quarter of last year. As you can see from the slide, a portion of that increase came from acquisitions, most notably the December acquisition of the Securitization Trust business. Total average deposits grew by $14 billion on a linked quarter basis or 7.4%, primarily due to higher corporate trust balances, which included the impact of the Securitization Trust business, as well as growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking and the Wholesale and Commercial Real Estate business lines.", "Turning to Slide 8. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.5 billion. The increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by earning asset growth, strength in our Fee businesses, organic growth initiatives and acquisitions, and tempered somewhat by the impact of recent legislative actions. This was a record first quarter in terms of total revenue for our company, demonstrating the positive impact that the investments we have made over the past few years are having on our results. ", "Turning to Slide 9 and credit quality. First quarter total net charge-offs of $805 million were 14.1% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets and assets acquired through the recent First Community Bank of New Mexico transaction decreased by $159 million or 4.7%. As you can see from the charts, this represents the fourth consecutive quarter of declining net charge-offs and non-performing assets, giving us further confidence that these trends will continue. ", "On Slide 10, the graph on the left shows continued improvement in the early and late stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets in the first quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 10, the trends in criticized assets again gives us another indication that we have reached the inflection point in credit quality. Accordingly, we expect the level of both net charge-offs and non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, to trend lower in the second quarter of 2011.", "Turning to Slide 11, you can see that for the second time since this credit cycle began, we recorded a provision for credit losses less than the total net charge-off. Specifically, we released $50 million of reserves. This compares with the provision for credit losses that was less than charge-offs by $25 million in the fourth quarter, while an incremental provision equal to approximately 15% of net charge-offs or $175 million was recorded in the first quarter of last year. The reserve release was primarily driven by the improvement in credit quality of the commercial and retail loan portfolios. ", "Before turning the call over to Andy, I want to make a few comments about the recent interagency review of foreclosure policies and practices. Let me say first that our company sets a very high standard for fair and ethical business practices. We are a relatively small participant in the mortgage servicing market, approximately 2% and have long been committed to sound modification and foreclosure practices. Any recommendations by our regulators for improvements to our processes are, however, taken very seriously, and we are committed to working with the regulators to quickly resolve any outstanding issues.  We have always regarded foreclosures as a last resort as we make every attempt to keep our customers in their houses through home retention programs. In fact, our home retention programs in 2010 outpaced new foreclosures by 50%. Moreover, our 60-day re-default rate, a measure of loan modification effectiveness, is significantly lower than industry average.", "I would also note that we continue to have sufficient financial staffing and managerial resources to ensure the proper administration of our foreclosure processes. As this was confirmed by the fact that no resource deficiency was cited by the regulators in the recent horizontal review. We will continue to support our customers during these challenging economic times, and we stand ready to assist them. I'll now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I will just take a few minutes to provide you with more details about the results. I turn your attention to Slide 12, which gives a full view of our first quarter 2011 results compared to the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2010.  Earnings per diluted common share of $0.52 were 52.9% higher in the first quarter of 2010, and 6.1% higher in the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings are detailed on Slide 13. The $377 million or 56.4% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of $198 million or 4.6% increase in net revenue, and a $555 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, which include a $225 million favorable change in excess provision expense, as we move from building reserves to releasing reserves. These favorable changes in total net revenue and the provision were partially offset by $178 million or 8.3% increase in non-interest expense year-over-year. Net income was $72 million or 7.4% higher on a linked-quarter basis. A $171 million or 6.9% decrease in total expense and a favorable variance of $157 million in the provision for loan losses more than offset the 4.3% decrease in total net revenue quarter-over-quarter.", "A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison over our first quarter results to prior periods are detailed on Slide 14. The significant items called out for the first quarter of 2011 were $46 million bargain purchase gain related to the recent purchase of First Community Bank from the FDIC, $5 million in net securities losses, and a $50 million reserve release.  The fourth quarter of 2010 included a gain of $103 million equal to $41 million after-tax related to the exchange of the long-term Asset Management business of FAF Advisors for an equity interest in Nuveen Investments, net securities losses of $14 million, and a $25 million reserve release. The two significant items impacting the first quarter of 2010 are also highlighted on Slide 14, and include a $34 million of security losses and $175 million incremental provision expense.", "Turning to Slide 15. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $104 million or 4.3%, primarily due to a $25.1 billion or 10.1% increase in average earning assets, and the benefit of strong growth in low-cost deposits. The increase in average earning assets was driven by expected growth in the securities portfolio and a higher cash position of the fed reserve, as well as growth in average loans and loans held for sale. ", "The net interest margin of 3.69% was lower than the net interest margin in the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the expected increase and lower yield in investment securities as the company brought more liquidity on balance sheet in addition to an exceptional and unexpected growth in deposits, which led to higher than anticipated cash position at the Federal Reserve.  On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $8 million, the result of a $14.1 billion increase in average earning assets, offset by a 14 basis point decline in net interest margin. The net interest margin was lower than the prior quarter, again, due to the expected growth in lower yielding investment securities and the higher cash position at the fed.  Assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline in the second quarter by amounts similar to the decline we experienced in the last two quarters as we continue to add to our securities portfolio. I would emphasize, however, that the anticipated reduction in net interest margin will continue to be neutral to net interest income and the bottom line as the decline in net interest margin is offset by an increase in average earning assets.", "Slide 16 provides you with more detail on the change in average total loans outstandings. Average total loans grew by $4.7 billion or 2.4% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, average total loans increased by 2.1%. And as you can see from the chart on the left, this increase was principally driven by strong growth in residential mortgages, and a 3% increase in commercial loans, which was the first year-over-year growth in average commercial loans since the second quarter of 2009. Importantly, commercial lending and commitments grew year-over-year.", "On a linked-quarter basis, the 1.1% increase in average loans outstandings were 0.7%, excluding acquisitions, was driven by increases in commercial, commercial real estate and residential real estate lending, reflecting a continued, modest demand for new loans. Average consumer loans decreased slightly on a linked-quarter basis as the decline in average credit card, home equity and second mortgages and other retail lending were slightly offset by growth in auto leasing and lending, where we continue to experience incremental growth each quarter. ", "Moving to Slide 17, you can see that the growth in total low-cost core deposits over the last five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $21.8 billion or 11.9% year-over-year. Significantly, low-cost deposits, non-interest bearing, interest checking, money market and savings grew by 15.3%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 7.4%, while average low-cost deposits increased by 6.7%, principally due to corporate trust and the recent acquisition, as well as growth in Wholesale Banking, Commercial Real Estate and the Consumer and Small Business Banking business lines.", "Slide 18 presents in more detail the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Non-interest income in the first quarter of 2011 was $94 million or 4.9% higher than the first quarter of 2010. This variance was driven by growth in payments in commercial product revenue and a favorable change in net securities losses in the First Community Bank gain. These favorable variance were partially offset by lower deposit service charges, which reflect the legislative and bank developed pricing changes. On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $210 million or 9.5%. This unfavorable variance was primarily the result of seasonally lower payments revenue, a reduction in trust and investment management fees, the net result of the sale of our long-time Asset Management business to Nuveen, partially offset by the December purchase of a Securitization Trust Administration business, and lower Mortgage Banking revenue, which declined by $51 million, primarily due to reduction in application volume, partially offset by a favorable change in the MSR valuation, and an unfavorable change related to a few significant items, which are detailed in the chart at the bottom of Slide 18.", "Slide 19 highlights non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $178 million or 8.3%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher benefits expense due to increase in pension cost and higher staffing levels, higher compensation driven by incentives and commissions, additional staffing for branch expansion and business line initiatives and merit increases, and an increase in professional services, marketing and business development expense on occupancy, primarily related to investments, projects and other business line expansion activities. Slightly offsetting these increases was a reduction in other intangible expense before run-off.", "On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense was lower by $171 million or 6.9% due to lower compensation expense, specifically related to incentives and commissions, seasonally lower professional services and marketing and business development expense, and seasonally lower investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantage projects.  Offsetting these favorable variances was an increase in benefits expense attributed to the higher pension cost and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Finally, the tax rate on a tax-equivalent basis was 29% in the first quarter of 2011 compared with 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 24.2% in the first quarter of 2010.", "Slide 20 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase related expense, and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Our company's conservative credit and underwriting culture, as well as our very disciplined loan origination processes has resulted in lower mortgage repurchase volumes and expense relative to our peers. Recall that we did not participate in the private placement securitization market. Our company originates conforming loans, about 95% of which are sold to the GSEs. During the current environment, we expect mortgage repurchase activity to remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters before beginning to moderate downward, with quarterly repurchase expense of $50 million to $70 million per quarter. I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide 21. Our annual meeting is scheduled for later today in St. Louis, and I look forward to reviewing our 2010 results with our shareholders, and demonstrating how our strong performance over the last year and the last 3 years and finally, the last 5 years, places us at the top of our peer group, and confirms the strength of our company's financial position and diversified business model.  More importantly, I will talk about the future and the momentum we've created by continuing to invest through this cycle, including investments in our core branch banking footprint, and in technology to enhance productivity and service, investments in new products and services and in our global presence. ", "We are well prepared to adapt to the changing legislative, regulatory and economic environment. We are also prepared to lend our voice and our energy to defend reasonable rules and policies that protect the safety and soundness of the banking industry, while protecting the investment of our shareholders. We are now looking forward toward the future. We have a clear focus and a clear mission, and we're ready to embrace the opportunities ahead, opportunities to serve our customers, further improve current processes, deepen our franchise, and build upon our reputation as a trusted provider of financial products and services. U.S. Bank is positioned to continue to perform and to win for our customers, for our employees, our communities and most importantly, for our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would be now happy to take questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Andy, was wondering if you could just repeat the guidance about the process of moving liquidity onto the balance sheet, the amount of securities that you'll be adding should look similar to this quarter, do you say? And then the impact on the upticks of the net interest margin, could you just repeat that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, I'd be happy to, John. So let me first re-highlight what occurred in the first quarter. We increased our securities portfolio by about $6 billion as we expected to do and as we talked about last quarter. In addition, as you probably noticed, a tremendous amount of liquidity in the marketplace and our customers, both wholesale and retail, have tremendously increased their deposit balances with U.S. Bank, which resulted in a long cash position of about $7 billion at the fed this quarter. Those 2 things resulted in our decline in net interest margin, about half and half. As we go into the second quarter, I would expect us to continue to build our securities portfolio in the neighborhood of about $5 billion plus or minus, which will impact margin again in that 8 to 10 basis points category. I do not expect a continuation or an increase in the long cash position but at the same time, I don't expect it to moderate much. So going forward, I would expect a decline, low 360, right around 360 range for margin in the second quarter.", "Richard Davis", "And John, this is Richard. As a reminder, everybody, I appreciate you leading with that question. I think last quarter, we may have confused some folks by talking about the NIM [net interest margin] coming down, but not reminding that the total balance sheet grows. So these activities are neutral, if not, slightly positive to our net interest income, and it's important that you know we're not harming the company's earnings by doing -- taking these actions to improve our liquidity.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Right. We see that, right? We see that in this quarter's result, right, and NII growth.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, we did. And Andy, in spite of the fact that there were 2 fewer days in the first quarter versus the fourth, which costs us about $30 million. So yes, our margin income continues to grow, even though net interest margin rate declines.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And what would be the duration of this process, Andy, will it extend beyond the second quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "The securities purchases, we expect to continue on through the remainder of this year. John, again, as we build on-balance sheet liquidity in conjunction with the LCR [liquidity coverage ratio] ratio.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "So that dynamic, neutral to NII [net interest income], but impacting the optics of the NIM, should continue through the third and fourth quarters?", "Andrew Cecere", "Correct.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And could you give us some broader thoughts, it sounds like on the Commercial side, you've got a little bit better loan demand in a way you were on utilization, and just your sense of where we are on the loan growth recovery curve here?", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard, John. It's still measured slow and slightly positive. But there's nothing remarkable about it. I think we have seen the economy slow a bit in the second half of the first quarter when we last had a chance in the public forum to talk to all of you, things are actually not quite as positive as we thought they would be at the middle of the quarter. You'll recall that in those 6 or 8 weeks since we last talked, a lot has happened. The GDP [gross domestic product] has come down from 3 to 3.5, to more of a forecasted 2 to 2.5, the supply-chain disruptions in Japan, oil prices and just continued confidence not being quiet where it needs to be, hasn't stopped things. It hasn't reversed things, but it hasn't created any additional momentum even with the seasonality included. So what we're seeing is actually our commitments are up 2%, linked quarter, for the Wholesale business, but our usage is still down even 1% from there. So we have people that were continuing to bank, that are ready to use their line, but they're demonstrating that even when they have the availability of credit, they're not using it. And likewise, as we've talked in times before, the first measure of our customers using their confidence to grow and to invest in things would be their use of their own demand deposits, and they're not using those either. As Andy said, we're at  record high levels, so we'll see the demand deposits continue to be high until they start to use it, then the line of credit will be used and then eventually, new loan originations will be more robust. So for us, it's slow, steady, measured, slightly positive but not strong by any means. And I do think it's fragile, so it's something we have to watch very closely in the second quarter, while we expect seasonality and all kinds of other normal things to occur, and we'll know that in a couple of weeks whether or not we're off to a decent 2011.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just a question on capital deployment. You mentioned that your Basel III numbers are already ahead of where you need to be in 2019, yet you've got a conservative approach on the buybacks. Is that a regulatory preference, Richard, or just a U.S. Bank being conservative kind of preference?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, it's a regulatory preference, because I might actually be more aggressive. The fact is that during the capital assessment plan, as you know, was a pass/fail test, and you didn't really get feedback along the way. So we made it very clear that we aren't going to take any risks to impair our ability to move first and forward with some dividend action and eventually, buybacks. So in our 1-year forward, 2-year forward capital assessment plan for which the first year, they used as the assessment for capital actions, we stayed below the 30%, as you know, forward year, for dividends, and we placed a number in there based on a buffer for capital, and a time for you to pun [ph] which would begin our buybacks. All of which were very conservative, all of which were regulatory driven. Each of which are still positive toward the shareholders, but not where we want it to be eventually, and were left to our own devices, it would've been more aggressive.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Actually, John asked two of my questions, but let me just ask you a little more detail in terms of the securities buying. Can you give us a sense of -- obviously, you're going to end the year with a heck of a lot more investment securities than you started the year, and you're even buying in 4Q as well. How can we get a sense that this is going to be match funded, and we're not going to be taking on more interest rate risk as rates rise with a much larger securities portfolio, is it real short duration? Is it floating? What are you buying? It seems like a lot of it's funded with deposits, which could actually go away if rates start rising. So just trying to get a sense of that a little bit.", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, Ed. This is Andy, so it is match funded. We're not taking any additional interest rate risk. One of the ways you'll see that is from our interest rate risk position that we'll publish in the Q every quarter, but I can assure you that we are not taking additional interest rate risk. About half of it's floating. Half of it's fixed. It's a duration less than two years, and we are being very careful about what we're putting on with the intention of not taking additional interest rate risk. And as you mentioned, we will probably end the year of somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 or so in our securities portfolio.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And no duration extension or anything in a rising rate environment or...", "Andrew Cecere", "We're staying very short on these purchases just for the purpose that you mentioned, which is to keep it interest rate risk neutral.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then I guess just a quick follow-up, I guess, to John's question with respect to the buyback. I mean, it seems like given where your Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is at 7.7%, and with some stock price weakness of late, with all the banks, it would be a great time to be buying the stock. And clearly, even if the Basel standards come in higher than we think or the systemic risk buffer is higher than we think, you guys are building capital very rapidly. So I think, Richard, what you're saying is you feel like your hands are a little tied based on what you ask for and how you ask for it within the capital planning process? Is that what you're saying in terms of the buyback?", "Richard Davis", "Well, no, we have permission to proceed with the buyback. So my hands aren't tied. My level of amount and speed might have been different. But the fact is, you already mentioned it, we're also waiting for the SIFI buffer, which might be -- for systemically important financial institutions, some number yet to be developed but what I understand, will be known in the next couple of months. That will help inform all of us what -- on top of the 7% we all need to hold, what will be the SIFI buffer. And then U.S. Bank intends to hold the buffer, a small buffer above that just for the vagaries of the denominator in the movement of some of the balance sheet. So that number for us is at this point, a guesstimate in our plan. And with that guesstimate, which we won't disclose, but we will be able to move forward with buybacks, we also are kind of sitting to see where that number comes in to see how well we guesstimated that number. I think in a couple of months, we'll have much more clarity around that, Ed, and we will be able to move forward. I would love very much to take some of that capital that we're building and use for that purpose for as long as we patiently waited to get to this point. I'm not going to take any actions until I have all the final facts, and that's probably just a quarter away, at which point that will be more clear on our timing and our amount.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. But I guess it sort of begs the question, given how fast you're building capital, even if that SIFI buffer is bigger than you suspect and bigger than maybe we're all suspecting, it seems like USB is already pretty forward in the lead, and would be building capital faster. So doesn't seem like you would be required to be at that level right away. You could build into that SIFI buffer, yet the market might be giving you an opportunity to buy back stock at a nice price currently. So just wondering why you're not sort of taking advantage of that.", "Richard Davis", "Okay, I understand, so the clarity that you may think we have, we don't. So while your argument and your logic make sense, the test was pass/fail. There was no sense of, let me ask you this or can we try that. And so it's not so much waiting for the SIFI buffer. It's the fact that the test was a 1-year test, forward view, all or nothing, in or out. And at this point, that's all the information we have. Now as we have learned more, especially with the SIFI buffer, we'll be going back in, asking for permissions to adjust, perhaps, what we put in the first round, but until which time we have that idea, you're right on all accounts, we're growing capital quite well. We can get to a point where we can set whatever level we want to be at and from that point, we can buy back stock or do other actions, capital actions that will keep it at that number or above. But Ed, as long and patiently as we waited to get to this point, 2.5 years, I want to get it right. I don't want to take any risks, and I don't want to push any levels of test when we haven't been given those permissions. So I don't think we're far off from that. I think it won't change though. We're building capital strongly, and won't change our options and our ability to move quickly, and are prepared to. But I think we're just one step from getting a little more clarification on the final part of the test.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then just one last quick one, Andy, if you don't get the kind of deposit growth you anticipate over the next few quarters, will you still be buying a significant amount of additional securities, or is that sort of predicated on the idea that you're going to continue to get this kind of deposit growth?", "Andrew Cecere", "No, that's two independent events, Ed. We continue to buy securities. Our deposit growth has been phenomenal the last quarter and really, that's led to our long cash position, which is separate and distinct from the security purchase. So we will buy securities, regardless, and our liquidity is sufficient, overly strong, in fact, to accommodate that.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "Sure, Ed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I had some of the same questions. But I was wondering about on your Wealth Management disclosure on Page 11 of the services, is that drop in Wealth Management revenues? Is that purely the Nuveen transaction?", "Andrew Cecere", "It is. Chris, it's 100%, over 100% from the Nuveen transaction with a little bit of core growth, and some addition from the Bank of America Corporate Trust acquisition, but the whole decline is due to Nuveen.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. And then on the slide with the non-performers, 9 in the conference call, do I read that, the FCB acquisition added $287 million to your non-performing base or your decline in the NPAs [non-performing asset] would've been $287 million without it?", "Richard Davis", "The decline without it was 4.7%. So adding the $287 million then put us up. So we did add $287 million of non-performing assets from the acquisition.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay, so that was the add. Okay, and then I guess just in general, can you talk if there's a geographic pattern to the recovery that you're experiencing, or are the trends that we see here in aggregate, are they kind of broadly dispersed through all the geographies that you operate in?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. I was going to say first and then I'll have Bill answer it. Geography isn't so much noteworthy in this recovery. It's more product type and customer type. Things like add continue to be strong but it depends on whether the consumer products or entertainment and gaming, whether these are companies that are looking for consumer-derived products that start higher up in the food chain. So for us, it's more product type and keeping Commercial Real Estate off to the side, which I'll have Bill talk about. Geography for us, and we're a national company, isn't really very noteworthy, but we are seeing product types. And as you might know, Chris, the strong companies are really showing themselves because they position themselves earlier in this recession to be ready. As a matter of fact, they got themselves ready. They are loan worthy and still in many cases, they're not taking actions because they're still not to that point. So they're ready to move, but they're just on the precipice of having the confidence to do it. So geography is the one thing we don't really see in the evidence, but we see a number of other things that I'll have Bill talk about it.", "P. Parker", "Yes, I mean, the one area geography is coming into plays on real estate and the coastal regions with the exception on Florida, are stronger. I mean, especially California, the closer to the coast you are, the stronger the markets are, both residential and commercial. Some of the East Coast markets are stronger, too, but that's pretty much limited to the real estate markets as opposed to just sort of general economic activity. And then the one property type that is pretty strong now is the Multi-Family, and I think that's a reflection of how the residential markets are somewhat stalled.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "P. Parker", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a few clarification questions here. I guess the first is if we look at your credit card spending volumes year-over-year, maybe I missed it, but do you disclose that still?", "Richard Davis", "We can in terms of same-store sales?", "Andrew Cecere", "So Matt, our same-store sales numbers, which is a key driver of our merchant or acquire activity, same-store sales were up 4.6% year-over-year here in the first quarter, which is down from the fourth quarter, which was about 5.5%, 5.4%, but up from a year ago, which was just about 3.5%. So we're seeing -- as Richard described, the economy overall, that's what we're seeing in spend, better than last year, but down a bit from the fourth quarter of this year.", "Richard Davis", "And Matt, I'll say that the same-store sales of that 4.6, a high percentage of that is T&E is up, in quarter 1, by corporate spend, particularly. Retail is up about 3%. So it's a little of in between those two. So we're seeing the companies, particularly airlines and hotels, being the higher percentage of T&E spend in quarter 1. Based on our portfolio, that's what's driving a good percentage of that. And not unlike I said earlier, the second half of the quarter seems to be slowing from what we thought we might be seeing as a trend in the first half. It's not coming to a screeching halt. It's just starting to taper down a bit as people move into quarter 2.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay, and then just separately, with credit continuing to improve, unlike other banks, you have not drawn down your loan loss reserves as much. And I'm wondering if there's more drawdown or the pace of drawdown will accelerate the next couple of quarters versus what we saw in the first quarter.", "Richard Davis", "Well, I'll tell you what, based on what you saw the first quarter, if we continue to see the improvement that we're seeing, we will continue to release reserves at levels probably equal to, if not, slightly higher than you just saw. But as I said, like a year ago, if that's the case, then we just didn't do a very good job going on the way up, because we simply didn't know when this thing would peak and when it would come back down. Let me also say, however, that once we get to a place where credit quality accelerates like a roller coaster does at the end of the fall, this credit quality is going to get to a point that's better than sustainable. I mean when you think about most things that have been originating any risky credits at all on the last couple of years, by the time the current customers are either recovered or gone, our credit quality across the board is going to be excessively positive and it will be here, too. But my point in telling you this is there will be a certain level that we'll set for ourselves no matter what the rule set may be, but our loan loss provisions will remain high enough to account for over the cycle kind of losses not at any one point exactly to the number that you see, because I do not want to have loan loss reserves back down to low unsustainable levels when things get so good. I want to have them available for when we get to the point over the cycle that I think will be more normalized. And we said for this company, that we think it's probably about 1% charge-offs annualized over the long cycle for this company. We're 1.65 right now. So we're still on our way to 1. I think we'll pass through 1, and we'll eventually come back to it. And so later in future quarters, while we'll do some reserve releases, it won't be lockstep exactly with the performance of the portfolio, because that's not going to be sustainable over the long run.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just lastly, if I may, as we look at the expense growth year-over-year of about 8%, there's obviously some deal impact. I think last quarter, you talked about a 5% to 6% expense growth as kind of a more normal run rate, and is that a fair growth rate year-over-year? And then going forward, is that what you're expecting as well?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. I think, Matt, that is a fair growth rate year-over-year. The other point here in the first quarter versus a year ago, we did have about a $50 million increase in pension expenses reset once a year when we reset our pension assumptions. And that's a factor in the first quarter which would remain more level throughout the year, accounting for payroll taxes and the like.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "I guess on the outlook for pre-provision earnings growing this year relative to last, that you'd given on the last conference call, I mean, in light of 1Q, generally positive results and your comments about the go-forward deceleration in the economy. Are you more or less confident in the ability to grow pre-provision year-over-year?", "Richard Davis", "Again, I think what we said Brian was accounting for sort of the significant items, for example, the Nuveen gain, that we are confident, and that hasn't changed.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "And then on -- the other point you had given on last call was revenue recapture from reg reform. The ability to recapture about 50% of lost revenue. There, again, are you kind of more or less confident and maybe what are some of the products, is it mostly just about instilling fees on existing products, or is it more traction with alternative products like prepay cards and checking account advances and the like?", "Richard Davis", "You just gave me the answers. So yes, it's both. We're going to continue to look at our pricing schemes to make sure that they're fair and that they're market favored. We're going to continue to involve ourselves in some of these more innovative products, both card products and what we'll call mobile banking alternatives. And I think Brian, if anybody has followed us as you have, we're a different company. Now we don't sell 1 product anymore. We don't deal with 1 customer at a time on 1 product at a time. We are much more relationship focused. That's yielding amazing amount of benefits and during the recession, the flight to quality, which we don't use the term loosely, it has brought a number of customers and their entire relationship to our company during this transition. So those are the things, including the pricing and the product development, that give me reasonably that at least 50% of the lost revenue will be accomplished by these new changes. I'll add that this is pre-driven. We don't have it driven yet in our numbers. We've given you the sizing for what that could be. Being as close as anyone is to the activities under Durbin, it's still a 50-50 call, and whether or not we're going to end up having the kind of the severe loss of income that's currently proposed. And if that's the case, then we'll have to go back and evaluate our product sets and exactly how we'll be pricing for, what will now be the debit products that are currently part of our checking products. But unless and until that happens, we're going to wait and see. And we're just a few months away from getting a better sense of that. Because no matter what happens, by the deadline that the fed has in July, we'll know the answer one way or the other. And by the next time we all speak, we'll have a much better clarity on whether the Durbin amendment is a negative or a wait-and-see activity for this company, and we have not decided how we would recover those losses at this point.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Aside 2 columns, when it relates to loan growth, one, are your negative comment and some positive trend, I'm trying to reconcile the two. So you said the second half, the first quarter was weaker, loan utilization is still kind of flat, and record high corporate deposit means you don't have a lot of loan growth. On the other hand, you had, if I'm doing this correctly, 2.4% linked-quarter growth in commercial loans and also, when I outlook at loan syndication year-over-year, your deal volume has doubled. So is this all market share or market expansion, and none with the economy, or if you can reconcile those two?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, sure. This is Richard. First, it's not very good, because it's not good enough for us. We really expected ourselves to be growing at that 1.5% to 2%, linked quarter, that we had in quarter 4. So we're just disappointed that we're not keeping at that pace. We're still very pleased that it's positive at all. Let me remind you that when I talk about commercial credit commitments, they're up 2%, but they're not using them. So for me, it's a proxy. If I were an investor I'd say, \"Gosh, if these deposits that you guys are growing are proxies for new customers, now these commitments that you're growing, whether they're being used or not, are proxies for future loan usage.\" That's what I want you to hear, but we don't have anything to show for it right now on the loan balance sheet. And so loan balance sheet growing on a adjusted 0.7 linked-quarter percent, that is wholly insufficient as far as I'm concerned, given the kind of money we have here that we can deploy back in the loan. But we're setting everything up for that moment when people finally decide to pull the string and use their lines of credit or use their own deposits or get a new loan. So intend to tell you that we're quite pleased with our performance against our peers in an environment where I think the overall loan growth is shrinking. I love the fact that we're positioning ourselves for a really good future when all of these starts to come around. But I'm not satisfied that 0.7% adjusted link loan growth is a very good outcome when we have this kind of earnings opportunity sitting under our nose. I will tell you however, there's no temptation, none, to change our underwriting criteria in order to adjust those outcomes, because that will be a mistake that we would live with many, many quarters and years from now. But as I've said before, we will take the permissions with good relationships to be a competitive on price, because we can afford to, and because relationships are easier to be more aggressive in pricing. And we will continue to do that, and that's part of what it means to protect customers and grow market share.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Last quarter, you said you were going a little more out of footprint, can you give us a status of that?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, as I said, last quarter, I meant for the last year or so, we've been out of footprint. Our commercial real estate is now national. Our Corporate Banking is wholly national, and we're seeing a great deal of benefit from that. Maybe as much in the out of footprint, as we are in the in-footprint, because we've been invited into so many new relationships. I think our branding, our national advertising has brought people to think of us for the first time in the other 25 states. I know that our flight to quality, particularly, at the level of CFO and Controller of large companies has said I need another bank in my stable of partners. I want to bring you in, and see how you perform. So we're getting a lot of growth from new entrants and new relationships, which for us is long-term, very, very valuable because that will be some relationships we can count on that we didn't have a few years ago.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And can I just get a little more color on the syndicated loans? I mean I'm not sure if your logic is a perfect source. But that has your year-over-year syndicated loan volume having doubled, you're not alone. But it would be great to get some more color, how much of the syndicated loan deals translated into higher commercial loan balances?", "P. Parker", "Probably not a lot in the balances based on what we've seen in utilization. But clearly, we're much more actively involved in that market. We've built out the capital markets capabilities in our bank and with the national corporate strategy, we've been able to bring a much better product set to clients and new prospects. So it's been great for fee income generation, probably less so on loan balance but hopefully, that will come.", "Richard Davis", "And Mike, the one thing that we love our position as the fifth-largest commercial bank, there's a lot of reasons I love being there. But the one area we have to watch for is that we don't have the balance sheet size that the top 4 do, so we have to be very competitive as it relates to hold levels and syndication. What we have found is if you can get in at a very meaningful level, Tier 1 or Tier 2, with our capital markets capabilities and our other products like our single plan and other capabilities that we have in corporate cards, we've been invited in to other products that the level that Tier 1 typically enjoys. So the perfect spot for us is to be a competitive meaningful partner in a syndication to get the other business and develop a relationship depth that we've never had before we had all these capabilities. So you're right, to see us much more visible on the tables. You'll see our syndication activity much higher. What you can't see yet is how much other business is coming from that, which is what I promised you all based on the investments you permitted us to make in the last couple of years in the Corporate Banking and in the payment space.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then lastly, and I guess, I'll say the one CEO -- say it very clearly, the second half of the first quarter has gotten weaker. Is that simply you and your firm's macro analysis, or are you seeing something on the ground that's really weaker?", "Richard Davis", "Well, it's not a whole lot different then. Whatever we showed you today is the same assessment I'm using. So you can look at the same data and disagree. But the only thing you can't see is what I was thinking was in the middle of quarter 1. We saw trajectories in what we thought will be line and loan usage, and what we thought would be in deposit levels starting to be used for growth. And instead, based on our expectations, none of those happened at the same level. Loan and line usage wasn't as robust. Deposit levels were exceptionally higher. People are putting more away than we thought. And as I described at top of the call, I think you'd agree there was some worldwide unprecedented events that all came together in the second half of quarter 1, and I'm not surprised about the reaction by our customers. They're being very careful. They're being very safe, and that doesn't mean they're not going to eventually do it. It just means they're not doing it as fast as we have thought, so it's not gloom and doom. It's just based on our rather positive expectation. They're not quite as positive, but they're measured and they're slow, and they're predictable and for me, they're painlessly slow.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Two questions here. Richard, could you just talk to us a little bit about the consent order from the fed, to the outside observers, it was a fairly broad brush assessment. And if you could just talk about your own situation, what they found and what you agreed with, or what you see as the deficiencies and what you've done to correct them.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Nancy. I appreciate the question. So the consent order, as you know, was the result of the 14 bank horizontal review last quarter 4. And in their findings, they discovered, what I'll call, a number of technical deficiencies in the way a bank's including -- we performed some of the perfected leans and some of the activities and modifications. I'm happy to report, as I hope you heard in my opening comments, that we were one of the very few, one of only two companies that were not found to be deficient in our resources applied toward modifications and foreclosures, which means we don't have a large staffing number to give you here on this call. In fact, parenthetically, we've added 48 people just to have a better point of contact. So it's not a financial issue for us. What it is though, is a case for us to -- the bar has raised on things like using attorneys and other states for the purpose of pursuing the foreclosure legalities. And in our case, we did not have them through the vendor program, which we actually didn't think we needed to. And so we will now put them through our vendor program and for us, it's going to be mostly formed well over a substance, but where we need to do a better job of documenting our activities, we will. Beyond that, for this company, it's really nothing more than that. As much as I'm respectful of it and we're going to do our level best to be the first out because I think our remedies are quite reasonable. But I will tell you as well that you won't hear us talk about another large amount of money put away for either litigation or for put backs. As Andy mentioned in his part of the call, we'll remind you that 95% of the loans we originate are either, I sensed all, they're Freddie or Fannie or the GSEs. The other 5% either comes through us keeping on balance sheet like some of our jumbo mortgages, or maybe a part of the acquisitions that we brought on, which are fully covered assets. So we don't have a large put back risk for those private securitizations that might be coming back towards us. And likewise, and somewhat connected, we don't have a large litigation. We don't have any litigation right now to speak of, so we have nothing probable or estimable to put in to any kind of reserves. So with 2% of the servicing market, even though we're the sixth largest, we see this as a very important activity to improve the quality of our foreclosure modifications. We actually -- we're not found to have any foreclosure that were incorrect, no fees incorrectly assessed. We simply didn't dot all the Is and crossed all the Ts with the new level of expectation, and we will do that going forward. So for me, it's a very important audit. And it has with it necessary steps for which we've created our special board committee, and we will pursue those with aggression, and we'll do it with respect. But I'm looking forward to getting past it, and I think you'll find very little to come from that finding as it relates to changes in our behaviors and certainly, not changes to our financials. And let me add, we're not part of the 5 companies that are apparently working with the attorneys generals on finalizing what will be the new mortgage foreclosure protocols, nor are we looking at how those final decisions on any kind of a penalty, to what money penalty may be. So we sit and wait, and are watching to see what comes from that, and we don't know exactly how that will affect our company. But assuming and the best or worst case, it's somehow equal to our market share. It's something that we can handle. It'll be a one-time event, and something we can explain to all of you very easily.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "And I have a similar sort of big issue question. I'm sure you're familiar with the Jamie Dimon, Dick Durbin smack down that seems to be going on. And one of Senator Durbin's concerns or statements that I'm sort of sympathetic to is the banks are talking a lot about raising fees. And clearly, in some quarters, this is being seen as a \"threat.\" If you have to recoup Durbin revenues, how are you going to present this to your customers, so that it is not seen that way? There just seems to be a sort of rising public anger about some of this stuff.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, Nancy, let me give you my sense. I'll add a step in between. Durbin, I think, his intention was good, and his intention was to make sure that customers aren't harmed by paying unnecessary fees of any type for any transaction and point-of-sale. I don't think he's trying to decide whether it was banks or merchants. He just wanted to go back to the consumers. Have the fed, in their first pass, provided an answer that was close to what would have been the cost of doing business for us to cover debit activities, including the stand-in for guarantees and the immediate credit and all the things you know, there will be a discussion here. Durbin's interpretation, as done by the Fed, would have been something we would have probably agreed that was fair and equitable, and we would've moved forward. But at $0.12, to be wholly 25%, 20%, 25% of what the real number is under anybody's measure, that was unexpected. And so I think what we're trying to say as much not to Durbin, as much as we are to the fed and those who will make the final decision, is go back, review all the facts, take the time to figure out what it really costs a bank to provide the kind of immediate credit and the transaction guarantee that occur for both the merchant and the consumer at the point-of-sale, let us give you some feedback on that, you make a final decision. And if after all that, the number is deemed to be whatever, and we think it's fair and equitable, even if it's not exactly the cost of doing business, I think that would change the outcome that we all feel. But should the fed decide to still come forward on July 21 with $0.12 for at least large banks, that will be still wholly insufficient for our shareholders. We're going to have to play that very delicate walk between taking care of our shareholders and taking care of our customers. And I will let our customers know that the cost of providing those guarantees have a value, and it will later show itself up in the form of a service charge or in many cases, customers can offset the service charge by the relationship value that they have in other things. I won't hesitate to make it a -- I won't make it a threat, but I won't make it a secret, and what will be sad about this is there'll be a number of customers on the edges, the less bank that will now become unbanked. And sadly, because of the way the rules are coming down, the unbanked will fall into an area that so far, with all the things that Dodd Frank wanted, silent to any activities of overseeing companies that are not part of the banking industry. So I worry about the unintended consequences, but we're not going to play threat. We're not going to put our customers in the middle of a dogfight. And I have actually quite a bit of confidence that somehow, between the congress and the fed, that $0.12 will be rendered to be a much more reasonable number, and any outcomes that we need to talk about here will be, in fact, invisible, and we'll just move forward.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Just a question on the Commercial lending and maybe, some trends that you're seeing in the Capital Markets business that you've alluded to a little bit earlier today. Middle market loans, in terms of average loan balances, were up quarter-over-quarter, and national corporate was up a little bit quarter-over-quarter from your supplement. I'm just curious if because of your position in some of these larger deals, you are continuing to see momentum in the capital market side of things, taking advantage of being able to bring some of these companies to market.", "P. Parker", "In terms of debt markets?", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Correct.", "P. Parker", "Yes, well, I mean, we clearly are -- I mean, we, 2 or 3 years ago, we really didn't have much in the way of Capital Market activity. Now we've got a robust syndication desk along with high-grade underwriting platform, so two products that we just really, we're not strong at didn't even exist 2 to 3 years ago. So for our middle market customers, our end market middle market customers, that's a whole new product set that we're delivering. And for our national corporate platform, it gets back to being able to participate at higher levels and up-tiering in these national corporate markets.", "Richard Davis", "It's Richard. As you might guess, the timing was fortuitous and sometimes, it's good to be lucky than it is smart. But to build this during the down market and to now have companies that are starting to look for growth and eventually, in some cases, M&A activities and more sophisticated solutions, boy, to have it all on and ready to go at this time has been just perfectly suited for us. And as I mentioned earlier, becoming national now and not just being regional, we've invited ourselves in to providing just guidance and in many cases, the guidance alone, the way we've talked to the customers, the way we've connected with the CFOs and the CEOs has changed the way they feel about a bank that can be a partner and in many cases, we won the business just on the audition.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "But in terms of the last couple of quarters, rather than the last 2 or 3 years, are you seeing an improvement in the momentum in that business, or has the market been relatively flat for that type of activity within U.S. Bank?", "P. Parker", "On the last couple of quarters, we've seen good demand in those spaces.", "Richard Davis", "But Matt, it's a little hard to tell because we're such a -- our base is so low, in other words, we're just going like crazy. We are adding people. We've got all kinds of new customers. It's a little bit of both. We're seeing the market receptive to this kind. As you see, the corporate bank, the corporate customers are more likely to be healthier and looking for opportunities, Capital Markets solution. But we're also growing like crazy just because we're invited to more conversations. So I'd say it's probably 50-50, half of us and a half of what's the market providing in terms of interest.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Richard, just a quick clarification on your comments in terms of the mortgage market, what's going on with some of the negotiations between the banks and other parties, presuming your comments related to market share were focused on any number of items, but I just want to clarify that your comments particularly related to potential principal reductions on home-equity loans or other mortgages, you think that that's going to be relatively less of an issue for you than for some of the other competitors?", "Richard Davis", "Matt, I'll tell you what, I don't even know if it's going to be principal reduction. I think that would be a big mistake by the way. That's absolutely, of all of the things to work on, that's not one of them. But let's just say that there's some superfund that's created by the larger banks in order to provide some relief for the foreclosure process, and to help kind of change the future outcome. I believe that we'll be part of that once and when those decisions are made. But at a 2% market share, and even something less than that, as it relates to the percentage of loans that are, for instance, say, foreclosed, I think the number will be -- no matter how big the pool is, I think there'll be a smaller number for us, something that's quite manageable. And for us, you'll see, we simply don't have -- in the DNA [ph] over the last few years, we don't have a lot of customers that were either underwritten or placed into harm based on some of our activities. So I think that the current actions that, as Nancy asked about the foreclosure review, we're all having independent reviews of the last couple of years of our modification or foreclosures. I think they will be deemed to be quite positive and quite good. If there's any remuneration, it will be small and if there's a large fund of money based on our market share and the quality of our findings, I think it will also be reasonable and something that we can isolate as a one-time event, explain it to all of you and move forward.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay.

I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith Murphy", "Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2011 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules, are available on our website at www.usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin on Page 3 of the presentation and point out the highlights of our second quarter results. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1,203,000,000 for the second quarter of 2011 or $0.60 per diluted common share. Earnings were $0.15 higher than the same quarter of last year and $0.08 higher than the first quarter of 2011. ", "We achieved total net revenue of $4.7 billion this quarter, which represented a 3.8% increase over the same quarter of 2010 and over the prior quarter. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 4% or 3.5%, excluding acquisitions. As expected, we achieved modest linked quarter loan growth as total average loans grew by 0.6% over the first quarter or 0.5% adjusted for acquisitions. Deposit growth was again very strong this quarter, with average low-cost deposit balances increasing by 17.1% year-over-year and 3.7% linked quarter.", "Excluding acquisitions, the year-over-year growth rate remained a strong 12.3%, while a linked-quarter growth was 3.5%. Credit quality also continue to improve, as net charge-offs declined by 7.2% and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 6.2% from the first quarter.", "Further, the improvement in our credit quality once again supported a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the company recorded a provision for credit losses that was $175 million less than the net charge-offs in the second quarter. Our company continues to generate significant capital each quarter and our capital position remained strong, with Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios increasing to 8.4% and 11%, respectively at June 30. Additionally, under the anticipated Basel III guidelines, the Tier 1 common ratio was 8.1% at quarter end. ", "Slide 4 tracks our industry-leading performance metrics over the past 5 quarters. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.54% and return on average common equity was 15.9%. The 5-quarter trends of our net interest margin and our efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.67% was lower than the same quarter of last year and the prior quarter, although slightly stronger than expected. And Andy will discuss the factors that led to this change in just a few minutes. ", "Our second quarter efficiency ratio was 51.6%, consistent with past quarters and our expectation that our efficiency ratio will remain in the low 50s. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis as well as on a linked-quarter basis when we adjust for the gain we recorded in the first quarter of 2011 related to our First Community Bank purchase.", "Turning to Slide 5, as I previously noted, our capital position remained strong and continues to grow. Our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III guidelines at June 30 was 8.1%, well above the 7% Basel III level required in 2019. Although we have not received the final regulatory guidance as to the amount of capital our company would be required to hold going forward, our SIFI buffer, we are confident that we can easily meet the new guidelines through internal capital generation, allowing us to continue moving forward with our long-term goal of distributing the majority of our earnings or shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Accordingly, at the very end of the second quarter, we began to buy back stock and we expect to continue to repurchase shares through the remainder of the year. ", "Moving on to Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $7.6 million or 4% year-over-year and 3.5% adjusted for acquisitions. Significantly, new loan originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $44 billion this quarter, compared with approximately $35 billion in the second quarter of last year, this represents a 25% increase in new activity. As a result, total corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased by 13.8% year-over-year and a 4.4% linked-quarter growth, positioning us for the eventual revival of our customers demand for loans.", "Total average deposits increased by $26.1 billion or 14.2% over the same quarter of last year. Total average deposits grew by $5.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis or 2.5%, 2.3% excluding acquisitions with strong growth in Consumer Banking, as well as Wholesale Banking and specifically in the national corporate and institutional banking groups.", "Turning to Slide 7. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $4.69 billion. The increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by earning asset growth, strength in our fee-based businesses and organic growth initiatives, tempered somewhat by the impact of recent legislative actions. ", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Second quarter total net charge-offs of $747 million, were 7.2% lower than the first quarter of 2011. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $217 million or 6.2%. ", "On Slide 9, the graph on the left illustrates the continuing improvement in early and late stage delinquencies excluding covered assets. In fact, delinquency rates in all major loan categories were lower than in the previous quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 9, the trend in criticized assets is again positive. Consequently, we expect the level of both net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to trend lower again in the third quarter of 2011.", "Turning to Slide 10. You can see that we recorded a provision for credit losses less than total net charge-offs. Specifically, we released $175 million of reserves. This compares with the provision for credit losses that was less the net charge-offs by $50 million in the first quarter while an incremental provision of $25 million was recorded in the second quarter of last year. The amount of the reserve release was primarily driven by the improvement in credit quality of the Credit Card Loan portfolios. Let me now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I will now just take a few minutes to provide you with more details about the results. I turn your attention to Slide 11, which gives a full view of our second quarter 2011 results compared to the prior quarter and the second quarter of 2010. ", "Diluted EPS of $0.60 was 33.3% higher than the second quarter of 2010 and 15.4% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's second quarter earnings are detailed on Slide 12. The $437 million or 57% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of $171 million or 3.8% increase in net revenue and a $567 million increase -- decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $48 million or 2% increase in noninterest expense year-over-year.", "Net income was $157 million or 15% higher on a linked-quarter basis. $171 million or 3.8% increase in total net revenue and a favorable variance of $183 million in the provision for loan losses more than offset the 4.8% increase in expense quarter-over-quarter. A summary of the notable items that impact the comparison of our second quarter results to prior periods are detailed on Slide 13.", "Items this quarter included net securities losses of $8 million and $175 million reserve release. The items called out in the first quarter of 2011 were the $46 million FCB gain, $5 million in net securities losses and a $50 million reserve release. ", "Finally, the items impacting the second quarter of 2010 are highlighted on Slide 14. They include $180 million credit to equity that was recorded directly as an increase to net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter. The ITS transaction item added $0.05 to earnings per share in the second quarter of 2010.", "Turning to Slide 14. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $135 million or 5.6%, primarily due to a $30.1 billion or 12.2% increase in average earning assets, and the benefit of strong growth in low-cost deposits. The increase in average earning assets were driven by expected growth in the securities portfolio as well as a higher cash position of the fed reserve as well as growth in average loans. The net interest margin of 3.6% was lower than the net interest margin in the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the expected increase in lower yielding investment securities and higher cash levels. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $37 million, a result of the $3.6 billion increase in average earning assets, offset by a 2 basis point decline in net interest margin. The net interest margin was lower than the prior quarter, again due to the expected growth in low-yielding investment securities, which impacted the margin by approximately 5 basis points. Offset somewhat by the positive impact of the lower cash position at the Federal Reserve.", "Slide 15 provides you with more detail on the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by $7.6 billion or 4% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, average total loans increased by 3.5%. As you can see from the chart on the left, the increase in average store loans was principally driven by strong growth in residential mortgages and total commercial loans, which grew by a very strong 8%, or 7.8%, excluding acquisitions. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in average commercial loans since the second quarter of 2009. ", "On a linked-quarter basis, the 0.6% increase in average loans outstanding or 0.5% excluding acquisitions, was driven by increases in commercial loans, which grew by 2.8% commercial mortgages and residential real estate lending, reflecting a continued modest demand for new loans. Average consumer loans decreased slightly on a linked-quarter basis as the decline in average credit card, home equity and second mortgages and other retail lending were slightly offset by growth in auto leasing and lending. ", "Moving to Slide 16. You can see the growth in total deposits over the past 5 quarters. Average total deposits grew by $26.1 billion or 14.2% year-over-year. Significantly, low-cost core deposits, noninterest-bearing, interest checking, money market and savings grew by 17.1%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 2.5% while our average low-cost deposits increased by 3.7%. ", "Slide 17 presents in more detail the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Noninterest income in the second quarter of 2011 was $36 million or 1.7% higher than the second quarter of 2010. This variance was driven primarily by growth in payments and commercial product revenue, as well as favorable variance in ATM processing, investment product fees and commissions and retail product revenue, which was driven by higher end-of-term gains and a favorable change in net securities losses. ", "These favorable variances were partially offset by lower deposit service charges, which reflected legislative and bank developed pricing changes. And the impact of the Visa Gain recorded in the second quarter of 2010.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $134 million or 6.7%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of seasonally higher payments revenue; deposit service charges and treasury management fees; higher commercial product revenue; higher mortgage banking revenue, which increased by $40 million, primarily due to the increase in application volume and a favorable change in the MSR valuation; and higher retail product revenue related to lower end-of-term losses.", "Slide 18 highlights noninterest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $48 million or 2%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher salaries expense due to staffing levels, merit increases and acquisitions; higher benefits expense driven by higher retirement and pension cost and staffing levels; and an increase in professional services, marketing and business development expense and occupancy, primarily related to investment projects and other business expansion activities and long-related compliance costs.", "Slightly offsetting these increases was a reduction in other intangible expense due to core run off and lower loan expense and conversion activity. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $111 million or 4.8% versus a seasonally lower first quarter expense level. Finally, the tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 30.4% in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 29% in the first quarter of 2011 and 25% in the second quarter of 2010.", "Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Repurchase activity for our company, including mortgage repurchase volumes and expense is lower than the peer banks due to our conservative credit and underwriting culture, as well as the very disciplined loan origination process. ", "Our company originates conforming loans, about 95% of which are sold to GSEs. Additionally, we do not participate in private placement securitization market. We expect mortgage repurchase activity to continue to moderate downward over the next few quarters. Our current outstanding repurchases and make-whole payment request balance at June 30 was $123 million.", "Finally, turning to Slide 20. We wanted to update you on the impact of recent regulatory change and oversight in our company. The impact from changes to overdraft policies and pricing, or Reg E, are now fully reflected in our run rate and will reduce revenue by about $460 million per year. The impact of Card Act is also reflected in the run rate and is expected to reduce revenue by about $250 million on an annual basis. Neither of these 2 projections has changed. ", "However, the Federal Reserve issued their final rules establishing a new debit card pricing guidelines late last month, as required by the Durbin Amendment. Under the new pricing, we would expect to see a reduction in debit fee revenue of approximately $300 million on a full year basis based on our current portfolio on growth assumption. The impact will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "We continue to expect to mitigate approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the reduction in revenue related to regulatory changes. By modifying our checking account products and pricing, many of the changes, which are in process today, as well as changes to our debit products going forward. I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide #21. The results that were reported today, once again, demonstrate our company's ability to produce and maintain industry-leading performance in a very challenging environment. We operate in an industry that continues to face a difficult and increasing complex operating environment, including economic headwinds, regulatory oversight, reputation risk and competitive pressures. ", "All these factors have, and will continue to have, an influence and how we allocate resources, manage our operations and capitalize on opportunities for our future growth. However, as our results show, our company has created momentum by adhering to our disciplined business strategy and by investing through the cycle. We've invested in our branches and new markets. In fact, this past weekend, we successfully completed the integration of the First Community Bank of New Mexico and Arizona branches, which we acquired in January. And further, we have invested in technology, invested in innovative new products and services and most importantly, invested in people. And the benefits are showing, through despite the slow to recover economy, are very successful results.", "We are the top-rated large bank in the country. We're growing our balance sheet including loans. We're increasing revenue and we're managing expenses, while we achieve industry-leading performance metrics. Our business model, are prudent risk management and our quality franchise have allowed us to adapt to this changing environment and focus on our future. We are positioned to win for the benefit of our customers, our communities, our employees and most importantly, our shareholders. ", "That concludes our formal remarks, Andy, Bill and I would now happy to answer any questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "On Durbin, I guess, 2 questions. First, the new impact of $300 million. Was the old impact $400 million? And if so, I guess, why didn't it come down more based on the new fed proposal?", "Andrew Cecere", "You're correct. The old impact was $400 million. This reflects a little bit higher growth because it's starting a little later this year and we're looking at 2012 in terms of the impact, Brian. So this represents about a 50% reduction from the level that we expect in 2012.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Got it. And then on the flip side of Durbin, is there any potential benefits to your payments business either from a -- with things like the beginnings of a share shift from debit to credit in spending volumes recently. And then, also, on the merchant acquiring side, some merchant acquirers, based on the way they're set up, seem to benefit by not passing through all the reductions. Some don't. And can you just remind us whether that's an opportunity for you or whether you'll pass it all through?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, Brian. This is Richard. Those are both correct. The latter first, it's not as big a number as you might think, but being one of the largest merchant processors and providers in the country, we do have the benefit of assessing exactly where these payments will go and how they'll be allocated back down to the merchant. So there is some pickup there, it's not substantial but it's included in that number that Andy gave you. And furthermore, as you've seen more and more of the customers' reticence to accept certain debit fees and certain projected charges that may be forthcoming, which we're watching very closely and not implementing it at anytime yet. We do think that there will be a shift to people using their credit cards more often, particularly for the rewards and for those who typically pay out their cards every month and don't revolve balances any way. So on both counts, you're right. The former, we've included in our thinking and the latter is an opportunity we haven't assessed yet.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "If I could sneak a last one in. The noninterest-bearing deposits on an end-of-period basis, the growth was pretty substantial and much higher than the industry. Is that -- can you just remind us if there's something seasonal or temporary or why that was up so much?", "Andrew Cecere", "Brian, this is Andy. We saw a strong growth in both our wholesale businesses, our -- both commercial and large corporate companies, as well as our trust businesses. And I would perhaps say that it's a little unusual versus other peer banks. We have a large corporate trust business that generates a lot of DD&A and they did -- they had a very strong quarter.", "Richard Davis", "Brian, it's Richard. I just want to add to that. We use this word, this phrase awfully often, flight to quality. But it shows up really, really strongly at times like this, where corporate CFOs, CEOs, municipality treasurers and things they do value the ratings and having the highest ratings it becomes a benefit that often we can't even assess until the quarter is over to see where people want to place their money under the safety and soundness of uninsured levels. So we're enjoying some benefit to that as well, and I think we'll continue to see that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Question on the reserve release. You obviously made a bigger statement this quarter than you have in prior quarters. And curious if there's any other categories that are potentially getting better, faster than you expected. And then also curious how we should think about the loan loss provision going forward. I guess, I see more room for this level of reserve release but just curious what your thoughts are.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Let me take it first. I'll hand it over to Bill for the details. This is Richard. I've said long ago that any reserve release will be a mistake having gone and putting in too much, and that's just because the math is the math. And now you're seeing that our card portfolios, particularly, and other areas are improving quite substantially. I think for the good of this industry, I'm going to make a plea here that we evaluate what will eventually become the risk of unintended consequences, where banks are going to find their credit quality over swinging as the pendulum does. And becoming so particularly good that if we aren't allowed to create some, over the time, allocations for -- unallocations for loan loss reserves, we're going to find ourselves reversing all loan provisions and then building in back when the cycle starts to build again. So we're not to that point yet. Our charge-offs a little over 1.5% are still 50 basis points ahead of where we think we'll be over the cycle at 1%. But I will predict for you that we'll probably fall below 1% before we settle there and reserve releases will continue. But I would hope, through a point, where we're allowed to keep some of that for over the cycle preparation for learning our lessons of pro-cyclicality during this last period. As it relates to more than credit card, we are seeing benefits. There's some lumpy and some more predictable portfolio. And I'll ask Bill to answer those for you.", "P. Parker", "Yes, Jon. So I mean we did see a solid improvement across all portfolios this quarter. So the go-forward look is positive. Cards, again, they exceed our expectations. It may do that again if it continues to improve. The other notable areas, just -- the C&I portfolio. The position of the corporate customers, the middle market customers continues to be one of real strength and resiliency. So that's probably another area where it's a better-than-positive outlook.", "Richard Davis", "And if you think about it, this is for everybody, the duration of this recession, despite somebody was saying it was over 7 quarters ago, it's not. And the length of this duration of this recession has allowed banks to be very careful for a long time. And in accordance with that, there are a number of lines that -- who haven't been originated now in years that would otherwise been risky. And many customers in their category of unsecured lending have been charged off and haven't been brought back into the market. So I think you're going to continue to see these numbers come down faster than they moved up and that's my earlier point that maybe we're kind of preparing for it, particularly overswing of some very, very good numbers in the next couple of quarters.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Couple of questions on the balance sheet. First, are you pretty much done with the liquidity changes that you've been making over the past couple of quarters, or is there any more to do there?", "Andrew Cecere", "Betsy, we entered the quarter at $65 billion on our securities portfolio, we would expect to end the year at $70 billion. So we have about $5 billion more to expect over the next 2 quarters.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then the loan-to-deposit ratio, 95%. I mean, we just went through a part of that as a function of corporate deposits going up. How do you think about where that loan to deposit ratio should be? Is 95% the right level given what might be flight to quality deposits, or would you seek to bring that back up over time as good quality credits emerge to 100%?", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, first Betsy, we don't have a target for that. I mean, we have ample liquidity on the balance sheet. We have ample ability to generate more funding if we need to, so we don't really have a target for a loan-to-deposit ratio. What that is, really, is a function of the great flight to quality we're seeing on the deposit side of the balance sheet and the somewhat slower loan demand that we're seeing in the marketplace overall. And what we want to do is gain customers on both sides of the balance sheet both loans and deposits and that's really how we target our business objectives, not any specific ratio.", "Richard Davis", "Then the evidence is in our actions. If you look at our commitments, they're way up. We continue to say that our utilization is flat and it remains flat because our commitments are up more than people are using what they have. But we are well and intending -- we will make as many good loans as we can make. And this bank was actually reversed many years ago. Our loan-to-deposit ratio wasn't even close to this. It's just as a result of what we think is good management of the balance sheet eventually the margin becomes a result of that and the loan-to-deposit ratio becomes a result of that. But we really wanted to play this good deposits and the good loans and we're making a lot of commitments. And so I think we're positioned, when people decided to use it, and you'll look at that as evidence of the fact that we're not setting any barriers or guideposts around loan to deposit.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Then just lastly on the commercial side, obviously, loans grew nicely in the quarter. Can you just talk about degree to which stuff coming from new clients versus existing lines?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I can. This is Richard. First of all I'm happy to report our C&I growth is all the way from down to small business, traditional small business lines and loans include SBA, it includes small ticket leasing and then all through the C&I more traditional space. Particularly, our best growth in the last quarter came from asset-based Lending, healthcare and government banking. Those are all areas that have momentum and continue to show that. The rest of the general growth came from those areas that are boosted by M&A activity or some tangent to something in that area. And our growing commitments, which are evidenced through the reports, include a higher position in each of the loan-syndicated deals that you will see over time. Both in our loan and high-grade fixed income lead tables, we continue to move up. We've been able to use the leverage of our new corporate bank to put ourselves in much higher positions and syndicated deals. And now we're starting the lead transactions, lead left and lead right and starting to make a difference in being able to not only outsource but actually be the predominant main provider for virtually everything for our larger customers. So it's a good story on C&I. Our loan average balances as we reported were up 0.6% linked quarter, 0.5% adjusted for acquisitions. But it was actually 0.9% end of period -- end-of-period linked quarter. So we see a little bit of momentum in the second half of the second quarter, which is the opposite of what we saw 90 days ago when we've said the second half of the first quarter was slowing. We're not courageous enough to make that a trend yet, but we are suggesting that it's got a favorable bias. And we continue to think our loan growth will be at the levels we've seen before and, hopefully, start to move a little bit more.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And net new is at the same profitability level, up, down, sideways?", "Andrew Cecere", "As I talked about, Betsy, I would say, versus 3 or 4 quarters ago, it's down perhaps 25 to 30 basis points, versus where we were beginning this cycle. It's actually still up against that and still very profitable transactions. And you can see from our loan, overall loan rates and our deposit rates, that we're still -- that the margin overall is flattish. The only reason we were down for the quarter is because of the securities portfolio and that was actually down more than what we have reported. So our margin is hanging in there pretty flat.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I'd like to dive into the loan growth questions a little bit more and on Page 9 of the press release. I guess, first of all, both for you and for the industry as a whole, if you look at the categories that are under the most pressure, it's construction and development, commercial real estate and home equity mortgages. And those are the numbers where I thought we'd see it, but with the fed numbers coming down constantly. And is there a bottom there in your mind at which those portfolios stop growing or is that still a long way off?", "P. Parker", "Well, I'll take the construction and development first. I mean there is -- ours continues to decline. There is some run-off there as the projects that started 2, 3 years ago come to fruition, get online and find permanent financing. But we have seen some -- there's actually pretty good volume in multifamily. Still limited in residential. There's also been a lot of build-to-suit. So it's probably nearing bottom of the runoff, at least for our portfolio. But we have seen some uptick in the commercial mortgage or the stabilized lines. So on a mixed basis, we're probably 6 to 9 months away from that, really, moving around. Home Equity, we've been steady as she goes, just through originating it out through our branches. Every quarter, we originate about the same amount of the same high-quality home equity. So that's been a good steady business for us. Residential mortgages and terms, again, that has been a strong area of origination for what we put on our balance sheet with the jumbled mortgage market and historically low rates. So we've seen good demand in those areas.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. And then the lease financing as opposed to commercial loans is running down. Why is that?", "P. Parker", "There was a little bit of some older small ticket portfolios that we ran off. But other than that, if you take that out it's -- overall, the equipment finance area is doing very well.", "Richard Davis", "Chris, it's really more aligned with traditional C&I lending.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. And then just on the credit card, I mean, it's small numbers, but compared to the fed loan numbers this quarter, your portfolio ran down a bit more than the industry. I would have expected you to be gaining share or is there a story there?", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard. Our year-over-year growth is down about 2%. And that's a little bit better than the average of the larger portfolios we compare ourselves to. More importantly, compared to kind of the peak when each of the portfolios are a much higher a couple of years ago. We're only down 3% and the industry is down more like 20%. So while one quarter a trend doesn't make, I think, you'll find that we're one of the few shops that are pretty close to our peak level because we either bought or acquired portfolios who continue to originate at levels that we didn't have to change because we weren't underwriting at levels we couldn't sustain before. So I wouldn't read into it. In fact, I would say we are probably a little better based on our calcs in the quarter, but it did shrink a bit. And that's a reflection of some of the final venality of the charge-offs finally going away. And our reticence to get into the game of trying to outprice ourselves for the next new customer. We're not going to do that. We don't think we have to and we want to make sure that our growth is the same quality as the portfolio, so we're not going to add some blips and origination that won't be sustainable. Otherwise, we're actually quite satisfied. And for us, it's a pretty big portfolio based on our total asset size. So it's a business we like a lot and we're putting a lot of energy into it and, hopefully, going to see some results over the recovery of the economy in the next year or 2.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Fair enough. And actually, while we're on the credit card business, I guess, there are considerable news -- press stories about HSBC's portfolio being available for sale and other portfolios potentially being on sale, available for sale. Is that a business that you would consider growing by acquisition?", "Richard Davis", "I won't talk about any specific portfolio but in credit cards or anything, you won't see us pick up a portfolio that's bigger than we are or big enough to change what we are in that category. There's a lot of commercial real estate portfolios out there as well. And I don't want to change the composition of what you all expect from us. I don't want to acquire somebody else's business no matter what the price if it's going to change the way we operate or the way we manage the balance sheet. So anything really big, as it compares to our size, we're not going to do. If it's marginal in terms of size, if it's opportune because it's exactly what we do and it's a chance we can't pass, then we might take a look. And we'll look at anything. I've said this before, where in virtually every due diligence that has any possibility of making sense. But nothing of substantial size where you see coming into our portfolio to change the way our mix or our composition looks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "If I could just drill down a bit into the capital deployment areas -- things. You talked about buying back some stock in the later part of the second quarter and expectations for buyback for the remainder of the year. Just remind us of what you have the ability to do right now and kind of what your thought process is on buyback looking beyond the next couple of quarters.", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, Matt, this is Andy. So we have an authorization as you know for this year, 50 million shares. We started buying back very late in the second quarter as we approach that 8% number in terms of that Tier 1 common Basel III. About 2.5 million shares late in the second quarter. You should expect us to continue that buyback as we move forward. We\u2019re still waiting on the final SIFI buffer. But as we talked about, we're starting at 8.1%. We're generating 30 to 40 basis points a quarter. So whatever that SIFI buffer is, we feel comfortable we've been able to achieve it and continue to distribute at capital for the remainder of this year and in going to next year. And from the perspective of our objectives from a capital deployment standpoint, and we've talked about this, we would, over the time frame expect to distribute 30% to 40% of our range in form of dividends, and 30% to 40% in terms of buybacks so you get to that 60% to 80%.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "But just as we think about the next few quarters here, the dividend is what it is, the balance sheet growth obviously is something that's the main focus. And then absent deals try to manage that 8% Tier 1 common or if it ends up being 8.25%, 8.5%, whatever it is, but we should think about whatever over 8% will go towards buyback?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. Depending upon whatever the final SIFI buffer is, which we hope to get some more guidance there. But that would be the correct way to think about it.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then what are other capital deployment opportunities, I think you have about $4 billion of trust. I believe half of them are either callable now, or at some point this year irrespective of any changes out of a -- from a regulatory point of view. What's the thought process in terms of retiring some of that given all the deposit growth you had and strong funding overall?", "Andrew Cecere", "You're right. Now we have $3.3 billion of trust-preferred. Some of it is already callable. You should expect us to act on those securities over the next year. Some of that could happen this year, some next year. I would say of the $3.3 billion, $2.2 billion have replacement capital covenants, so that would also perhaps entail some sort of issuance at the same time. But we will manage to those numbers and manage those securities over the next year or so.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then just separately, I've asked you a lot about operating leverage the last few quarters. It was positive, nicely year-over-year or slightly positive quarter-to-quarter. I can appreciate any given quarter there could be some noise and we do have the Durbin impact to digest, but how do you think operating levels will trend going forward from here?", "Andrew Cecere", "You're right. Any quarter, any particular quarter could have some noise. But as we talked about, we expected positive operating leverage in the second quarter, we achieved it. We're very focused on both the revenue and the expense side of the equation. And we're going to manage expense like we always do in conjunction with what we see from the revenue side. So that's the way we focus and that's the way we manage the balance sheet and the income statement.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "So targeting positive?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. This is Richard. We are targeting positive. That's the way we -- that's how you grow the company. And we are well aware that our revenue has been strong enough to account for these last 3 or 4 years. We have really invested in the company. We're real proud of that. As the world continues to be uncertain, we continue to be watchful on our expenses. And the 51.6%, we don't need to have a campaign or a program to watch our expenses, we do it every day. But we are continuing to watch them every day and you can well bet that until we see sustainable, foreseeable growth in revenue. We're going to tend to be very careful on our expenses and be very watchful. So that's one thing you don't have to worry about with this company.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Going back to loan growth. And I know you have a lot of questions on it, but we had a lot of banks release earnings already. And it seems to be some banks that can really generate some loans and other banks that are really talking sour on loan growth, with a couple of banks saying, \"Don't expect loan growth for the rest of the year.\" I just want to know, I mean, why the tale of the 2 different institutions? Because a lot of this is driven by the macro part of growth of GDP. Some of it utilization and relationships. But why are we seeing different, I guess, outlooks out there for loan growth from different institutions? I don't know if you can answer that or not.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. This is Richard. Happy to answer it. Couple of things, it's a tale of 2 stories like you said. But first, our story goes back 3 years ago when we started investing on kind of the barbell of the loan spectrum. We brought in a number of new small business lenders and originators and changed the way our branch managers become the center of small business activities and that is showing up in great form. Just our annualized loan growth in small business, if you go down and drill down, it's about 10.6% small business, card is like 19%. So we're getting in on that. And then the same 3 years ago, we started introducing to all of you this corporate bank that we're building out. And it wasn't just for the sake of a having a few more people on the East Coast, it was to really become a full service, top-flight corporate bank that can provide virtually everything our customers need. And that happened too, Paul. So we are getting not only more customers, we're getting a lot more invitations to the party that earlier in the call, we're being now moved up to the top tier of many of these opportunities for both the line and for the capital markets activity, number one. Number two, is we don't have anything running off that we can't replace. So as you know that's probably a 4- or 5-year old story, but it really is important that we just simply haven't had to change any business models from the beginning to the end of this downturn because we simply weren't doing things we could sustain over the course of that more difficult period, and I think that helps. You will see that we don't have a run off portfolio virtually anywhere, and we don't have any business plan that we wish we weren't in or that are atrophying. I think those 2 things, our investments coming to fruition and the lack of having to change the continuity that we created years ago are probably the 2 best reasons our story might resonated differently. I can't speak for the whole industry, but I think that's probably is a good insight.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then on loan pricing, I think a couple of individuals ask about the profitability of these loans because what we've seen -- what a lot of people have sat and told us that there's a lot of price competition that some banks don't want to chase down. I mean -- but it seems like they've built the lenders out there. But are you competing on price or is that something that you feel comfortable competing on?", "Andrew Cecere", "No. We are being competitive on price but I will tell you the margins are still very profitable. As I mentioned before, perhaps down 25 or 30 basis points, but what we're talking about is on wholesale side and the middle-market side. A 250 spread now is somewhere around 220, so still much above -- well above where it was in 2006, early 2007. So they're still very profitable deals. And deals that we are very happy and proud.", "Richard Davis", "We won't compete on price because with the other levers competing on underwriting, we won't do that, ever. So price is really very important to us and I don't think, based on our efficiency ratio, if anybody could catch up with the quality of the deal is good. And if there's a relationship attached to it. We won't go after a loan individually anymore. Those are the old days, there's no relationship in that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ed Najarian of ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Just 2 quick questions, maybe so that we can get a little more context on how you're thinking about capital and reserves over the long term. As you think about getting to normalize credit losses, say by 2013 or maybe as you indicated even slightly sooner than that, where would you be willing to take the reserve to loan ratio to in that environment? I think if we can get that sense, we can get a good sense of how you're thinking about reserve recapture.", "P. Parker", "Well, I'll take a stab of that, Ed. I mean, I've talked about that in the past and what I've said is there was, in the old days, there was sort of a benchmark of, industry benchmark of about 1.5% reserve-to-loan ratio. But even under the rules that are in existence today, there's more things that are under this 114 accounting methodology, which basically says if you have any kind of restructured loan you're going to look beyond the current period, look more of a lifetime loss. So with the issues in the residential mortgage business, in terms of all the restructuring banks are doing, that's just going to raise whatever kind of through the cycle reserve level banks go to. So I think you're going to be north of 2%. It's kind of an industry thing. I don't want to comment specifically on our bank on a long-term basis, but that's how I think about it.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "So north of 2% of the industry and your -- well, you just said you don't want to comment specifically, but it seems...", "Richard Davis", "Here's the other deal. This is, in fact, my only point. Every time you make a decision on what your loan reserves will end up based on actions of either add or taking away, your auditors and your regulators have to apply them. And so far, we have never come across where we've got any debates on whether or not we are at the right place. But I think we're going to test the nettle of that whole theory, whichever number you want to talk about, the is no single one ratio by the way. It has never been deemed as the most important. But I think that we're all going to need to collect our thoughts and work with the accounting FASB and everybody else to decide what's the right over the cycle kind of loan losses that we want so we don't visit a SunTrust 1998 SEC issue again. And recognize that banking is volatile. There's some cyclicality to it. And basically now it's stress testing. We offer pretty good idea and have overseers to decide what is the reasonable over the term kind of loan loss necessary level. And I think we should all work toward that and find an answer that's not there today so your question can be answered a bit differently. But that's one of the guidelines we haven't created yet through the course of this downturn. We, for one, are going to work to see if we can help inform that outcome.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then just a follow-up. I mean, obviously, the credit quality is continuing to improve. We're getting closer to this sort of normalized environment. How quickly do you think you can get up to that? And your capital ratios are building, how quickly you think you can get the bank to that 30% to 40% dividend payout ratio that you're targeting? Is that next year? Is that 2013 or is it longer out?", "Richard Davis", "I don't know. But I do know this, it's not just -- it's both, it's 30% to 40% on dividend payback and 30% to 40% on buybacks. Any combination of those up to 60% to 80%. I have a goal of getting there as soon as I can. I think first and foremost we have an annual stress test protocol now, which we will respect and move through. And we all don't know whether or not that's going to become more often than annual. But at least annually we'll put in our forecast. We'll stress test the company and we'll submit our request continue more buybacks and continue higher dividend. And over the course, if it was left to our own device, we'd probably get there sooner than I'm sure what the rules will be under our stress test scenario that says, \"But what if this happens and we need to withhold certain actions until we're certain that we're beyond this.\" So for us, I think, it's multi-quarter but it's not and it's not like half decade. I mean, we're just going to get there as soon as we can and based on where I think we are plus what I think our SIFI might be, I think we're going to get there very quickly and we're going to seek permission to be among the first to move forward on both of those to get closer and closer to our final payout. But I'd love to take this if I knew. I wouldn't just withhold it from you I'd be taking other actions with certainty, but right now, we're just going to follow the rules and keep pushing to get as much as we can given our good performance.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just one question on net interest margin, last quarter you'd given some guidance that it came in much better largely the benefit of all the great excess deposit growth that you referred to earlier. I'm just wondering if you can put into context again the additional liquidity build that you're expecting to add, and thoughts on how the margin can track or within that, just your puts and takes.", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, Ken. So we were down 2 basis points 369 to 367, quarter 1 to quarter 2. If you think about the 2 basis points, we were down 5 basis points because of the $5 billion additional securities portfolio purchases, which is what we expected. The cash flows of the Fed, however, went down from about $8.5 billion to about $6.5 billion, so that helped us by 2 basis points. And everything else was better by about 1 basis point. So you think about the fact that we expect to add another $5 billion or so in the second half the year, that implies another 5 basis points in the second half of the year of decline. I'm not going to assume anything on cash levels or deposits, but all other things being equal, we have a slight decline and then perhaps a positive bias on our core a few basis points. And that's the way we describe it.", "Richard Davis", "So you just said flattish.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Right. So core is flattish because of the combination of still good loan growth and good low-core deposit growth.", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. Our deposit pricing and our loan pricing has helped us. The net of those 2 is about a 1 basis point favorable and the cash position is about 2 and the securities was about 5 negative.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. Next, I want to follow-up just on credit and commitments. You mentioned that you're growing commitments a lot. I'm just wondering what's going on the pricing side of commitments. Are you changing the way you're pricing for commitments, and is that showing up in results? And the second part of that is just, are your corporate customers changing the way they view commitments in terms of fees are going up or are they just downsizing when they're renewing?", "P. Parker", "I wouldn't say they're downsizing when they're renewing. I mean, I think, there's more awareness in the banking industry of the cost of having the unfunded commitment out there. So I think that's been a nice balance, of course, our customers wanting lower pricing. So we've seen the commitment pricing hang in there pretty well.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Richard, a question for you. I mean your results have been quite strong this quarter and as you said you're building momentum and sort of a strengthening pattern of earnings, and that's generally true throughout the major banks with 1 or 2 notable exceptions. There just seems to be a bit of a disconnect from what's going on and what we're hearing about the economy. And clearly, part of what you're achieving and what your peer banks are achieving is sort of a recovery from the crisis. But how long can the banks and the economy stay disconnected? And are your earnings indicating that there's a better economy out there than we're seeing?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, that's a good question, Nancy. All of them actually. I would say first of all, my belief is that this economy will eventually come back and it will be corporate led, not consumer led, which is quite unusual. And I actually think that is a reflection what you're seeing in the strong banks balance sheet. For instance, in the recessions past, typically the consumer is the first to blink so they can't withhold making expenditures, doing things because they had basically the home equity, they have the housing values, they had certain other things that they were clear about. And that's not present this time. But we've gone longer and longer and longer than anyone thought from both the corporate and the consumer side of the balance sheet for people holding on and making things last until they can't finally go forward on growth. And I think the corporations are starting to build for that. The commitment line of usage is a reflection of when that finally happens. But the fact that they're building it up, and at a cost, says that they're getting ready to move when there's an opportunity. I actually think that at the highest level that this corporations will actually reduce their pricing to finally attract the consumer into the game and that will all start to create the recovery we're looking for whenever it occurs. So first of all, our balance sheets look like just the economy, people are saving like crazy. They don't know what to do with their money, but it's safer here than anywhere else especially given certain FDIC guarantees and things. There is nowhere better to put it unless it's a stock market and that's iffy and lumpy. So I think our balance sheet growing makes sense. I think at a low interest rates, you'll people not getting very clever on how they invest their money because there's not a lot of choices. So that make sense primarily in low interest deposit or some form of offset to service charges. And then I do think that the small businesses are starting to move forward where they can get some traction. The corporations are starting to building their lines. And it's just the basic consumer that's withholding because there's no other alternative for them. Their credit card is more important to them than their house. And housing may or may not come back for quite some time. So I don't think we're out of order with that. How long banks can put up with this? If it's forever, we're out of business because we don't make money if we don't deploy deposits into some form of loans or lines. But we all know that that's not going to be the case. So it's a matter of just who can hang on the longest. And in our case, we're blessed with this corporate trust and payments business, which creates this wonderful diversification of revenue that isn't based on balance sheet and isn't relying wholly on loans. So those of us that have diversified earnings and strong customer base, I think, can hold on for quite a while longer and still make money until which time it comes back. And I'm not Pollyanna. As you know, I'm quite realistic. But I think it takes another year or 2 for the economy to start to kick in, the corporates will start first and the consumers will follow.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Just one add-on question to that. You bring up the point that the credit card is now more important than the house. Have you modified your plans for the growth of the mortgage business in response to what seems to be a growing aversion to homeownership?", "Richard Davis", "Not yet. And I say not yet, meaning, that we're going to do it but they were not sure what we're going to do. I mean, we're now the sixth largest mortgage provider origination and servicing. By the way 6 is a really good place, don't you think? And so for us, we're going to wait and see on a lot of issues. We have first to wait and see what the happens with the AG settlement with the large 5 servicers. Not so much the financial fees, which for us will be, on any measure, less than 2% and something we can handle. But more of what are the long-term rules of servicing. Number two, we need to understand what the rules are going to be for modifications and foreclosures. If you think about it, Nancy, if we're told that in the future, a high-quality customer for origination and servicing purposes is still a very profitable activity, we'll do it. But if someone tells me that the minute they flip into some form of risk or modification or foreclosure, the cost of compliance and the requirements of going through all kinds of specific steps becomes so inordinately expensive, we're all just going to underwrite at a much higher level and make sure we don't have any of those modified customers. And therein lies perhaps one of the risks of slowing down the availability and affordability of housing. Never mind, QRMs, is something else we need to worry about because they may be a bit too pure in their definition. And never mind the minute rates do go up, and they will eventually, home affordability plummets very quickly, it's exponential. So I do think we have a risk here, the mortgages outside of high, high quality become less profitable to the banks, and I think we're all just going to have to assess what level of volume we want in that respect. But I'll tell you that mortgages are a great core product. They always will be. And people who have a mortgage with you, who you can trust, you will let you have the rest of their business, and that's what we're staying in the game for. So we'll stay where we are. We'll work quickly to manage through the current uncertainties and we'll wait to see what comes out, and we'll make our decision after that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim Partners.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I wanted to ask a little bit about the regulatory changes, and we're talking about the unfavorable impact that, if you add the 3 items together it's about $1 billion. And we're now kind of -- have kind of finalized all the uncertainty, so we know what to expect. And now we can start to move towards mitigating some of those issues. I was just wondering how do we kind of see that rolling out if we're talking about a $300 million to $500 million improvement over time to be able to mitigate some of those regulatory impacts.", "Richard Davis", "Well, first, we're already doing some of our mitigating actions by the way we have reconstructed our checking products. We have a product called Checking With Choice, where customers can provide other business that they have with us as alternatives to withhold any kind of fee payment. In fact 85% of our customers don't pay any service charge on checking, but they brought a lot more business to us and that's happening around the system. But those who do pay, have no other opportunities but to create some service charge. And that's part of the mitigation on the checking product. However, there's another piece that will come in the form of either cost to merchants over the course of time as we understand how to unbundle what the Durbin Amendment really means and the cost of providing fraud and immediate guarantees and immediate credit and all of that. And we also haven't really touched the debit product yet. We're not going to. Debit rewards will continue to be something we don't provide going forward, as we haven't for the last 90 days. But in terms of creating a cost per debit capability, we're not at all at that place. We're going to let others go first, and we'll see what comes up. And I don't think the consumers going to really want that. So Marty, that's why we say 30% to 50%. We probably have our hand on 30% mitigation and we have a just big kind of white board for the next 20%, which we're going to take a little while to decide and make a very thoughtful division over the course of probably the next 3 to 4 quarters. So 30% in the books, the other 20% is probably 6 to 9 months away.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And I guess as we see that roll forward what we would see is that -- because we're talking about the way that these activities occur within the products. It will be kind of cent by cent, kind of rolling in over probably an 18-month period, 24-month period.", "Andrew Cecere", "I would say it would be shorter than that, Marty. I would say in the next year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Now that we know the SIFI premium, 250 basis points for the biggest banks, I guess, you don't know your exact SIFI premium. Could that hold you back from doing a large acquisition because now you have not only the cost of the acquisition but the potential cost of having to hold higher capital levels?", "Richard Davis", "No. I mean, a large acquisition will be made first and foremost on the merits of whether it's good for us. It needs to be something that meets all of our thresholds for profitability and accretion. And the fact that, Mike, if it's a really good deal and we have to raise capital we would do it with the expectations that the market would want it enough to celebrate our decision and raise capital with pretty high certainty. The SIFI itself will have no bearing at all on how we feel about acquisition. But you also know that, that bar, as I said, is pretty high for us. And if nothing comes along that meets that bar, then it won't matter anyway. And if they do, it will be such a good deal you all want for it. On the SIFI side, we don't know where we'll fall between and up to 2.5 basis points but we do believe that based on the tiering that we've heard about and all the intelligence we can gather, we're probably looking at a 0.75 to maybe 1.25 kind of a SIFI surcharge. And if that's the case, then we're getting close to that already. Plus a buffer that Andy and I, along said we would put on top of that for this company, it's probably 50 basis points. So once we get that number, we can fill in all the blanks and we're ready to roll.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then switching gears back to loan growth, credit card loans period end are up 1.5%, when the industry is down, 2% to 4%. So what are you doing differently in credit cards that's allowing for growth? Is it a new product? Are you targeting certain regions? Are you taking some more risk, which maybe it makes sense since credit's getting so much better?", "P. Parker", "Yes. I'll take that. I mean we grew through the cycle we didn't change our underwriting. We grew through the cycle. Most of our major competitors, I mean, if you look at what they did, over the past 2, 3 years, their balance have declined significantly. So they're running off or charging off parts of their business initiatives that they had from prior to the recession. But we did not have to do that. So that's the main difference.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. So Mike, it's pretty much just having a steady core of customers that aren't leaving. We also have -- we do have some pretty good like our FlexPerks program, which we created a couple of years ago when we launched the Northwest Airlines card, it's a remarkable program, It gets recognized by Kiplinger and others. It's among the best. So we're in the game with a really good product, and a lot of our underwriting now is coming from customers to the branches, which creates a very high-quality customer with a lot of stickiness to it. So for us, we expected it to be that. In fact, the fact that it shrinks and all, even over an average period surprises us because we really haven't seen that over the course of this whole recession.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "What percent comes through the branches?", "Richard Davis", "I'm going to say the origination is probably 20%, 25% for the branches. The rest would come through more of the traditional ways. But you don't see us in your mailbox a lot because we're pretty selective on how we go after our customers in different co-branded ways and in some cases direct mail but it's very targeted.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then last question just going back to commercial loan growth. I mean, 14% annualized commercial loan growth, which is -- I guess, it's good as long as it's of good quality. So I guess, what's the loan utilization rate? I'm sorry if I missed it -- in the second quarter versus the first?", "Andrew Cecere", "It's down 50 basis points, from 25 to 24.5. First quarter average to second quarter average.", "Richard Davis", "Remember, we just look at the C&I piece. We don't have revolving lines of credit card or leases and things like that.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So this is really market share gains? You talked about in the last 3 years that you're expanding beyond your branch footprint for more national loans, you mentioned asset base, healthcare, government banking. So this is -- is that a fair way to characterize, it's market share gains, more lines, more customers?", "Richard Davis", "Bingo.", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. And Mike, it's important to note when I talk about the utilization going down 0.5%, underlying that is a utilization or a commitment increase of 4.4%. So really what happened was commitments grew tremendously and loan volume grew a little bit less than that but still grew well.", "Richard Davis", "That's right. I just said bingo because I want to see it in the transcript.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then of the $47 billion of commercial loans how much of that would be syndicated loans?", "P. Parker", "I'd say about 20%, 25%.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And what would that percentage have been a year ago? Because it seems like you're ramping that up some.", "P. Parker", "I don't think it would be substantially low.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Is it fair to characterize your commercial loan growth as having been the largest part through syndicated loans?", "P. Parker", "Some of that, but not necessarily. I mean...", "Richard Davis", "In fact, you said the same percentage a year ago, it's really not. Syndicated, maybe hold levels are bigger, it doesn't mean that we get the outstanding on it. So we are probably participating at higher levels. But a lot of this is brand new customers that are -- I just can't tell you what it's like to be invited into a 100-year-old credit that we've never been a part of. And they bring you in and they let you all the way in. It's really what we're doing in a lot of them.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "What our typical hold levels these days?", "P. Parker", "Well, I'm not going to disclose that. But I mean, it varies by the asset quality of the company and by the amount of relationship business we get.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I guess, just to close this whole discussion about commercial loan growth and syndicated loans, you talked about being a bigger player in the more corporate lending segment. Just what your sales pitch to get business if you're competing against, say, a money-center bank like JPMorgan, or a foreign bank like Deutsche Bank, or let's say a brokerage firm like Goldman Sachs. And now here's U.S. Bancorp at the table saying give us your corporate business with all the bells and whistles. Why choose U.S. Bancorp versus those other competitors?", "Richard Davis", "Number one is because our ratings, right? That really does weigh heavily. We open the door with the ratings. Then many of our employees out of footprint came from another really, really good bank and they had relationships with customers who they now under all the right legal approaches have now welcomed them to their new bank, which is us. So it's takes a lot of relationship selling as well. And then finally, we've been with customers for a long time but we've never had the capital market capability, which we can now come back to them and say we'd like to be more engaged in this 25-year relationship by being the bank that helps you with you all of your other offerings. And in accordance with that, we'd like to talk to you about our corporate payments, which a lot of our peers don't have and some of the transactional businesses that we've introduced over the many years even corporate trust. So Mike, for us, it starts with the ratings, that moves to relationship, and last and finally, new team on the block and a lot of banks have said well, our customers have said, I know I need more than 1 or 2 banks in my credit because I learned that lesson. I want to look at ones that would be around for a long time and they can check our references and they'll find out customers we've had over the cycle. We didn't change the rules. We didn't walk away and we didn't make it harder for them when it might have been easy for us to leverage a little bit more. I think those references get called out and we get called back.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Two quick things. I guess the first is, overnight, the Basel committee actually put out their SIFI buffer on a global basis. And what I found interesting was that probably only 2 of the 5 criteria would likely apply to you in a significant way. So the question is, I don't know if you have had any discussions with the Fed as to how they are likely to apply the criteria because it would seem, based upon that, you shouldn't be overly worried being anywhere towards the upper end of any ranges anyway.", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So we don't have the international exposure. I would say our interconnectedness is limited. You're absolutely right. Size we're certainly well below the top 4 banks so that's why Richard mentioned that the global is at 1 to 250, we would expect to be somewhere at the low end of that if not below that level.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Right. So I guess the follow-up to that is that it doesn't seem like you need to -- I mean, do you really need to wait until you get the precise number for those capital actions?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, you do. Because first of all, we're just a little tiny bank from Bloomington, Minnesota, just remember that. The stress test is a model, and the model requires us to fill in all of the blanks. And so this will be one step, a blank that everyone needs to fill in, in order to move forward with their capital action in the CCAR reports. So we're all hopeful that we'll have some clarity around that when we introduce the second annual input in late fall and get our results in early winter.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Got it. The second thing is you gave some clarity on your thoughts on Durbin, what you're going to do and what you're not going to do. Do you think you have something of an advantage because of the payments business, the ability to as opposed to the stick maybe a little bit of a carrot in terms of offering people other payments products? Is that -- can you talk about that a little bit?", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, the ability to offer the full service set certainly is something that is beneficial. The fact that we have the merchant side of the equation, as well as the issuance side is also a positive for us. And as Richard said, we're going to be very thoughtful the way we rollout any changes, thinking about the relationship.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. It's a net positive. We just haven't decided exactly what it means yet.", "Operator", "Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard. I just want to thank you all for your continued support of our company. I am quite pleased with this quarter, and I think it starts to get pretty close to something more normal. Our ROE is almost 16%. Our ROA is 1.5%. And those are close to numbers we promised we'll get to over the long period. So while we saw some reserve release, we'll eventually replace that with honest to God revenue. But we're getting very close to something more normal and I hope that recognized by you all. And I appreciate the fact that you've given us these last few years to kind of reconstruct the company and come out as well as we have.", "Judith Murphy", "Thanks for listening and as always if you have any follow-up questions, please give me or Sean O'Connor a call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; is Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. There will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time, through Wednesday, October 26, 12:00 midnight Eastern Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2011 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that there are forward-looking statements made today during the call and they are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'd like to begin by saying that I'm very proud of our third quarter results. The company achieved both record earnings and record total net revenue this quarter, along with positive operating leverage year-over-year and linked quarter. And we accomplished these results while facing the headwinds of a very challenging and uncertain economic environment. I'd like to point out a few of the highlights from our third quarter earnings, which are detailed on Page 3 of the presentations.", "U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1,273,000,000 for the third quarter of 2011; $0.64 per diluted common share. Earnings per share were $0.19 higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $0.04 higher than the prior quarter. We achieved record total net revenue of $4.8 billion this quarter, which was 4.5% higher than the same quarter of 2010 and 2.2% higher than the second quarter of 2011. Revenue was driven by growth in both net interest income and fee income.", "Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5% or 4.5% excluding acquisitions. And we realized linked quarter total loan growth of 1.7%. Once again, we benefited from strong growth in average low-cost deposits with balances increasing by 23.2% over the third quarter of 2010 and 4.7% over the second quarter of 2011.", "Credit quality continued to improve as we posted a decline in net charge-offs of 10.4% and reduction in non-performing assets excluding covered assets of 6.9% on a linked-quarter basis. Our capital position remained strong as we continue to generate significant capital each quarter through earnings. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.5% at September 30 or 8.2% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.8%. Finally, we repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. As a result, we returned 45% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter in the form of dividends and buybacks.", "The 5-quarter trend of our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on the left-hand of Slide 4. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.57%. And return on average common equity was 16.1%, significantly better than the 1.26% and 12.8% respectively that we reported last year. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right side of Slide 4.", "As expected, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.65% was lower than the same quarter of last year and the prior quarter. And Andy will discuss the factors that led to this change in a few minutes. ", "As I mentioned at the start, we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis leading to an improvement in our third quarter efficiency ratio. Our 51.5% efficiency ratio for the third quarter is consistent with our expectation that this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward. ", "Turning to Slide 5, as I previously noted, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III guidelines at September 30 was 8.2%, well above the 7% Basel III level required in 2019. We have not yet received final regulatory guidance as to the amount of capital we will be required to hold as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI buffer. Given our current capital levels, however, we are confident that we will be able to meet those guidelines through internal capital generation once they are established. In the meantime, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, eventually reaching our goal of returning 60% to 80% of our earnings. ", "Average total loans outstanding increased by $9.7 billion or 5% year-over-year and 4.5% adjusted for acquisitions. Significantly, new loan originations excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $46 billion this quarter compared with approximately $37 billion in the third quarter of last year, representing a 25% increase in renewal and new activity.", "Specifically, total corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased by 16.8% year-over-year and 5.8% linked quarter, indicating we continue to gain customers and market share, and we are well positioned to meet the demand for loans once our customers are more confident in investing in their businesses as the economy recovers.", "Although you may think of our middle market and large customers when discussing new commitments, numbers also include our Small Business lending. We just announced this week, that U.S. Bank has set a new company record for SBA loan approvals with a total of $630 million for the SBA fiscal year ending September 30. This represents a 123% year-over-year increase in loan approvals for our company. And SBA loans are just one piece of the Small Business lending that we do. In fact, our branches grew non-SBA Small Business average loans outstanding by over 12% year-over-year. ", "Total average deposits increased by $32.7 billion or 17.9% over the same quarter of last year. Total average deposits grew by $6 billion on a linked-quarter basis or 2.9%. With strong growth in Corporate Trust, Consumer Banking and Wholesale Banking over both time periods, the customers continue to hold historically high levels of cash, viewing our bank as a trusted safe place to turn. ", "Additionally, we've recently published FDIC market share data. It indicates that our company grew deposits significantly more in the U.S. markets as a whole. U.S. Bank grew deposits 15.8% between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2011 compared with the 6.8% growth rate for the total U.S. market, confirming that we have definitely increased our overall deposit market share.", "Turning to Slide 7, the company reported record total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% over the prior year's quarter and 2.2% over the previous quarter. The growth in revenue can be attributed to both our balance sheet and Fee business lines, all of which have benefited from investments and many growth initiatives made throughout the downturn of the past 3 years, partially tempered, of course, by the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions. ", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Third quarter total net charge-offs declined by 10.4% from the second quarter of 2011, while non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 6.9%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in both measures. ", "Turning to Slide 9. As the graph on the left illustrates, early and late stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, have continued to improve overall and are actually returning to pre-2008 levels. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that the trend in criticized assets was also positive this quarter. Both of these statistics provide us with assurance that net charge-offs and non-performing assets will trend lower in the fourth quarter. ", "With those statistics in mind, please turn to Slide 10. You can see that we recorded a provision for credit losses that was 78% of net charge-offs in the third quarter. This compares with the second quarter when we recorded a provision that was 77% of net charge-offs.", "The continued improvement on our credit quality once again supported the reduction in the allowance for credit losses, but the amount of the reserve release was $25 million lower than the previous quarter. The reduction in the amount of the reserve release reflected the fact that the net charge-off levels for several consumer loan categories, particularly credit card and auto loans, are beginning to stabilize. The underlying quality of the wholesale loan book, however, is expected to continue to show incremental improvement in the coming quarters.", "I'll now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. I'm going to take just a few minutes to discuss some of the details behind our record third quarter results. Slide 11 gives a full view of our third quarter 2011 compared to the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2010. Diluted EPS of $0.64 was 42.2% higher than the third quarter of 2010 and 6.7% higher than the prior quarter. ", "Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings. The 40.2% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a 4.5% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 3.8% increase in non-interest expense year-over-year.", "Net income was 5.8% higher on a linked-quarter basis. This positive variance was the result of a 2.2% increase in net revenue and a favorable variance in the provision for loan losses, both of which more than offset the 2.1% increase in expense quarter-over-quarter. With the exception of the $150 million reserve release, our third quarter results did not include any notable income or expense items that would have impacted the comparison of our year-over-year or linked quarter earnings.", "Turning to Slide 13, net interest income increased year-over-year by $147 million or 5.9%. The increase was largely driven by the $34.4 billion or 13.6% increase in average earning assets, as well as the benefit from strong growth in low-cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by predicted increases in the securities portfolio, a higher cash position at the Federal Reserve and an increase in average loans. The net interest margin of 3.65% was lower than the same quarter of last year due to the expected increase in low-yielding investment securities and the higher cash balances at the Fed. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $80 million, the result of an $8.7 billion increase in average earning assets and a 2 basis-point decline in the net interest margin. The net interest margin was lower in the prior quarter due to the expected growth in lower-yielding investment securities as the company continues to add liquidity on the balance sheets.", "The investment securities portfolio at September 30 totaled $68.4 billion. And we expect the portfolio to reach $70 billion by year end. We also expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at/or around that level for the foreseeable future given current Basel III liquidity requirements. ", "Turning to Slide 14, you can see more detail behind the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by $9.7 billion or 5% year-over-year. Excluding covered loans, which are slowly running off, average total loans increased by 7.6% over the third quarter of 2010. As indicated on the chart, the increase in average total loans is principally driven by solid growth in residential mortgages and total commercial loans. The latter of which grew by a very strong 11.9%. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in average commercial loans. And the growth has been improving each quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, the 1.7% increase in average loans outstanding was primarily driven by the increase in commercial loans, which grew by 4.6% as well as residential real estate loans. ", "Slide 15 tracks the growth in total deposits over the past 5 quarters. Average total deposits grew by $32.7 billion or 17.9% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, the growth rate was 13.2%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 2.8% or approximately 11% annualized.", "Slide 16 provides more details about the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2011 was 2.9% higher than the third quarter of 2010. This variance was driven primarily by a growth in payments revenue, deposit service charges and commercial products revenue. These positive variances were partially offset by lower trust and investment management fees, principally the result of the sale of our long-term Asset Management business late in 2010, and mortgage banking revenue. On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $25 million or 1.2%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of higher payments revenue, deposit service charges and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by lower trust and investment management fees. Deposit service charges benefited this quarter from the rollout of our new checking account redesign, as well as higher transaction volumes. A mortgage banking revenue which increased by $6 million linked quarter reflected a strong increase in application volume, partially offset by the unfavorable variance and then the net change in the MSR valuation and related hedge. ", "Recall that the new debit card pricing guidelines went into effect on October 1. Under the new pricing, we expect to see a reduction in debit fee revenue of approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter related to this pricing change, which is consistent with our previous estimate of a loss of $300 million on a full-year basis, based on our current portfolio and growth assumptions. As we have noted in the past, we expect to mitigate approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the reduction in the revenue related to all regulatory changes by modifying our checking account products and pricing, any other changes to which are in process and partially reflected numbers this quarter. We do not, however, have plans at this point, to assess a debit card fee.", "Slide 17 highlights non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $91 million or 3.8%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to a higher compensation and benefits expense, occupancy, investments in affordable housing and other tax advantage products, and an increase in professional services, primarily due to the foreclosure review project. The expense related to this project, about $25 million per quarter, is expected to be in our run rate for the next few quarters. Or until the foreclosure review is complete. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense was higher by $51 million or 2.1% due to compensation, professional services, and marketing and business development expense. Finally, the tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 30.4% in the third quarter of 2011 equal to the second quarter of 2011 but higher than the 25.9% in the third quarter of 2010. ", "Slide 18 is included to provide updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Note that we do not participate in the private placement securitization market. We expect mortgage repurchase activity to continue to moderate lower over the next few quarters. Outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at September 30 was $115 million compared with $123 million at June 30. ", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I will call your attention to Slide #19. To sum it up, we had a very good quarter. We grew both loans and commitments. And the overall credit quality of our portfolio continued to improve. We had excellent deposit growth, and gained market deposit -- market share. We grew both our balance sheet and our fee-based revenues, and attained record total net revenue. We realized positive operating leverage and earned record net income. Our capital and liquidity position remained strong and growing. We were able to return 45% of our earnings to our shareholders, and we once again achieved industry-leading performance metrics. All of this, despite the challenges of a difficult and uncertain economic environment, further demonstrating the value of our company's diversified business model, prudent approach to risk management and sound growth strategies. ", "We're a bank. And we're proud to be a bank. On one hand, we're managing our business through a difficult and complex environment, which includes a fragile economy, increasing regulatory oversight, reputation risk and competitive pressures. On the other hand, we're providing our customers, consumers, small businesses, large corporations, institutions and government entities with the products and services they need to achieve their own financial goals. We're in this together. And we're trying to strive to do our part, not at the expense of others, but for the benefit of all of our constituents, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders. ", "Our company has created momentum by adhering to the disciplined business strategy and investing through the cycle. We've adapted and will continue to adapt to this changing environment with a focus on the future. We're positioned to win during a difficult and strong economic time. This concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question kind comes from the line of Ed Najarian of ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. Richard, we obviously saw a pretty good across-the-board improvement in credit quality, and as well the delinquencies declining more than we're seeing with peers, which I guess is what gave you the confidence for your fourth quarter statement. How do you look at that in terms of increasing the paces or keeping or increasing the pace of reserve recapture from here? We're seeing a lot of banks that recapture a lot of reserves in prior quarters and are actually slowing that down. You guys, on the other hand, are speeding that up. I'm just sort of wondering how you're thinking about that in your head.", "Richard K. Davis", "First of all, we're kind of -- we're last to kind of come in to this because our credit quality was better from the beginning. And so, it probably never hit any kind of a peak. We're actually are starting now to come back down. So I think we'll declare the last quarter, quarter 2, the quarter before this one, as probably the peak of reserve release at 175. But you'll still continue to see reserve release because we're not yet at our sustained credit quality levels that we've said over the course, will be about 1% in total charge-offs. Having said that, you all note that we have a math that goes along with the development of our total loan loss provision, which includes a kind of a forward four quarter arithmetic around what's happening to consumers, which is actually showing some stability now, reaching that point. And on commercial, it's much more lumpy, and therefore, we kind of take it at 90-day increments. So that's why we're comfortable that the consumer portfolio continues to show improvement with the delinquencies, forecasting improvement in total charge-offs. That will continue to kind of slight soft landing, if you will, into something more steady over the course of time. But commercial, Commercial Real Estate are still lumpy and higher than they will be over the course, which also tells me we're not yet where we need to be. Going further, as I've told you before, we think this is about a 1% net charge-off over the course company, primarily because we have such a significant credit card portfolio. And I do predict that we will go below 1% in total charge-offs before we come back to it as we kind of overswing the economy will take us to that point. I've been pleading with the regulators and the accountants to let us, as banks, not miss this chance to soften the impacts of counter cyclicality and allow us to determine what our over-the-cycle minimum level of loan loss provisions needs to be. And don't ask us, don't force us to go beyond that, so that we all have to start building back loan loss reserves a couple of years from now when we swing back. I'm not getting a whole lot of resonance, by the way, on my plea, but at least I'm still out there asking for it. But you can see this company's moving down toward the 1%. It doesn't happen in one quarter. You'll see the steady pace we have is probably what you could estimate over the next few quarters. And so reserve releases will continue until we hit that point where we think we've got a sustainable level of loan loss reserves.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, thanks. And then, to follow up, you talked about getting to that 60% to 80% total payout ratio in terms of buybacks and dividends. Is that something -- I know you've got to go through the next round of capital assessments with the Fed, but is that something that you hope to get to as early as next year? And what is the kind of -- along with that, what is the kind of range of dividend payout ratio, you're hoping to get to for next year?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, there's a lot in there, right? And you said it first. I have to go through all the prescribed gateways to get what we want. But what we're going to be asking for in our stress test for the CCAR, which will happen at year's end, is an increase to our dividend that stays within our committed 30% to 40%, and moves beyond what was the last year's first CCAR test of maximum 30%. But we're going to stick with that 30% to 40% as a range against that we think is a reasonable forecast of earnings for this company. And of course, they'll put it against the very tedious stress test, which we do ourselves, by the way, and we can withstand a lot of stress. And on top of that, we'll let the other 30% to 40% move up as we do the buybacks, and we'll seek additional permission. Although, Andy will tell you here in a second, we have plenty left in our current permissions. And then what's left over, as we put back into the company 20% to 40% in the form of organic investments, which you've all allowed us to do over the last few years, and/or acquisition opportunities that follow the same time that we've been doing over the last few years. The difference only between now and what we said, I don't know, 5 years ago, was it used to be 80% to shareholders and 20% to the company. Now we've given it more 30% to 40% of buybacks, 30% to 40% of dividends and 20% to 40% of what could be investments that we don't want to miss through this challenging time. But I hope to get to 60% to 80% as soon as I can. And I suspect that if I were left to my own devices, I'd get there a little faster than I'm going to be allowed to. But next year will be a good target. And we'll see how close we can get. Andy might just cover a little more color on the remaining [indiscernible].", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So Ed, we are at 8.2% Tier 1 common Basel III and above the level impact that we think we need to be without the specificity of the SIFI yet here. So yes, we do expect to get back to that level in 2012. And we still have some buyback capacity remaining here in the fourth quarter.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. And then, just finally, any outlook in terms of this -- short-term outlook in terms of the net interest margin?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, this is Andy again. So the margin decrease on a linked-quarter basis was entirely due to our securities purchases. And on a year-over-year basis, it was entirely due to our securities purchases and the cash position at the Fed. You strip those 2 things out and we're basically flat. So we expect to continue to have securities purchases here into the fourth quarter, getting into that $70 billion, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. Simple math, is every $1 billion is a basis point. So I would expect the fourth quarter to be somewhere between 3 and 6 basis points down, depending upon the cash levels and the securities I just talked about. And however, I would also say that I would expect net interest income to be up, just the same phenomenon you saw this quarter, which was margin was down but net interest income was up.", "Richard K. Davis", "And then I'll add to that. History lesson for everybody, not that you asked for it. As you recall, about a year ago, we were given guidance by our regulators that our capital was quite sufficient and quite strong as it relates to the Basel III levels of total common. But at the same time, we were given the nod that we need to move up on our liquidity operation to have this balance sheet more fortress-ready. We've done that. And we're actually quite proud of that. And I don't think you heard us ever even indicate it as a problem for this company to achieve during which time we've been doing other things. We're glad we did it. And I think the timing was quite good. I'm glad we're virtually done with that liquidity build. I think you'll see that it's a good strong balance sheet with much more liquidity than before. And I'm glad we did it in the last year when probably it was more financially beneficial to do than to have to start it now. So with that as a backdrop, we really positioned ourselves. And every single way we've dealt with suspenders on, being a very strong company able to basically handle any kind of downturn that comes along. With that, we're hoping we'll get the permissions from the Federal Reserve to be recognized for that and allow us to move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Can I ask a couple of questions on cards? I guess first, there's a lot of concern that if industry starts to grow again, yields will get competed down and your card book is up. It looks like it's up a little bit more than normal seasonality, if I'm reading it right. But your yields are up as well, and I'm talking on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there anything -- I guess what's driving the yields higher?", "Andrew Cecere", "The yields have a little bit to do with the revolve rate, Brian, and then a little bit also to do with the reserve for credit there, which is improving on the interest margin. So you think about the interest reversals. There's a reserve established. And as credit gets better, that reserve gets better. So that's a little bit in a factor. I think if you strip those 2 things out, the margin would be relatively flat.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I guess, going forward, is the old 9.2% to 9.3%, the run rate? Or is the new 9.6%, the right run rate to think about?", "Andrew Cecere", "A little bit's going to depend on the revolve rate on a go-forward basis. But I expect it to moderate down just a bit because, again, we did see some improvement in that reserve component that improved the rate this quarter.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then you referenced the 1% normalized charge-off rate for the company, which at least when you first presented it back at the investor conference a year ago now, had a 5.5% credit card charge-off rate. Do you still feel like that's the normal level? Or obviously, we're going to be below that for a while here. Is there some argument that the new normal for cards is lower?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, we're certainly not a 5.5% credit card. Right now, you see us at the mid 4s in the credit card. And I think that's probably that kind of sustainable level you can expect. It will bounce up and down depending on the number of days in the quarter and even now on your spending trends. But I think you will see, of course, all of our portfolios, they're just at the high quality. We don't have any book of prime in our portfolio. We have some joint issuances with people like Kroeger. And we have some co-branded cards with some REI and others like that. But they perform very, very well. So Brian, I think you'll see us over the course have a boorish kind of a credit card charge-off. But we'll continue to grow that book. And it does affect the total 1% because it's a fairly significant part of our total charge-offs. But we think that's the right mix and probably the right quality to go after. And we're not going to get greedy and try to reach further back and change the underwriting that we have under credit cards, as the world gets maybe a little bit better. We're going to stick with our old knitting.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, and I'll just add. Remember the 1% was a -- more of a through the credit-cycle type number. So it's not at any given point in time now or a fairly stable unemployment. So that's why we're seeing the good results right now.", "Richard K. Davis", "By Bill Parker. Professor Bill Parker.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "If I could ask one last one on the same theme, I mean, just the overall competitive environment in cards, as well as the data you get to see from a spending perspective in terms of the health of the consumer, how would you characterize both?", "Richard K. Davis", "I was looking for Bill. I thought he was going to answer. I would tell you that we've got a couple of things that give us insight to the consumer behavior. They -- first of all, Brian, are -- there has been encash [ph] on the deposit side, and they're very, very careful using their money on the credit side. So we expect to see same-store sales be a pretty good proxy for the kind of increase we have in the balance sheet, as the season starts to heat up for the holidays. And then they'll pay it back down. People are using their cash before they are using ours, so that's why you'll see kind of a moderate use of credit cards. But our insight says, that those that are creditworthy are actually pretty comfortable with their ability to use the charge card and to pay it down pretty quickly. And we don't have anybody know our portfolio that isn't creditworthy because we didn't have, in the first place, and anybody who's on the margin has since charged it off and haven't underwritten anybody new since. You won't go to your mailbox and see a ton of U.S. Bank direct mail. We do a lot of this origination through our direct customer contact, through branches and call centers and online. We deal mostly customers we know or have other relationships. And if we do extended it, it\u2019s through this partnerships with other very high-quality companies, then we prefer this sense of trust. As you may have seen the other day, we introduced a new idea with REI where a customer can go into REI, make application for a credit card online, get approved while they're in the store and use the actual transaction as a credit line. Those are the kind of customers we'll deal with. But we will only deal with them at a very high credit quality level, so that we're not reaching down to try to grow the balance sheet at the risk of putting some less prime customers on in the future. I think you'll see -- what you see is we're a nice trajectory. Everything in our company, you all, is going to be a nice, steady, slow methodical recovery down to that average of 1% credit charge-offs over the course. And you'll see us sit there for quite a while because we're going to continue to underwrite at that level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Richard, really, just to clarify the commentary about the capital return. Last year, the Fed said requests for dividend payouts north of 30% would be given extra scrutiny. Did they give any informal cap that last year on like the total return that, that should be limited to 50% or anything like that? You noted that you had done about 45% this quarter, total return?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, John, they did not. Last year, in fact, the buybacks were silent. The entire issue last year was a maximum 30%, for what we included is common and preferred dividends, which is as you recall, which is why we want to leave a little room and then go right to the top. We haven't got any new guidance since then either, but we have had permission to move forward on our buyback plan, which is obvious because we've been doing it. So that kind of came inter-test. Now as the new test comes forward, I don't have any guidance on what they're going to propose. But given that they've let us get up to that 30% in dividends and approved us to do some actions on buyback, everything we did this quarter was within permitted balance. And 45% is the result but it wasn't a target. It just happened to be what we got to. I'm hoping that our current performance and our future stress test guidance will give us permission to at least go from this point now forward from 45% and up toward that 60%, dated [ph] that we spoke up with that.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And did those approvals around the buybacks that came subsequent to the dividend approvals, is that kind of a quarterly thing? Or is that just -- okay, you could do this for the rest of the year?", "Andrew Cecere", "That was a full year view, John, so we had a full year projected buyback plan consistent with the capital ratios that we set out in our plan, and that was approved as part of the overall CCAR.", "Richard K. Davis", "So John, what happens -- each company did it different because the rules were so vague last time, and I'll just give you an example. We put a proviso in our stress test plan that said, if and when we get to a certain capital Tier 1 common capital level, without any of us knowing what the SIFI buffer would be. In fact, a year ago I don't think that phrase was even out there yet. But if we get to this point then do we have permission to begin the buyback if we never go below that stated level? And that will be proviso that said yes. And as it -- we turn out, we actually got to that point sooner than we thought. And we also have permission to move sooner than we originally thought, and we got it. So kind of the interim test but it had to be kind of set up as part of the structure in the first round. And so lesson learned, is we'll make sure we set a lot of options for us to negotiate with them in the second year once we pay out the CCAR in January.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Right. Okay, got it. That's very helpful. So question for Andy on the NII. Outside of the impact of securities purchases, how have you been able to keep the NIM pretty flattish at a high level amid this kind of low and declining rate environment? What are some of the puts and takes that allow you to do that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. So first of all, the margin on the loans has been relatively stable the last quarter. We had seen a bit of a decline in quarters 2 compared to prior quarters, but it stabilized a bit. A second, is we still have some room on the deposit side of the equation. Across both wholesale and consumer deposit pricing, we've moved down a little bit, consistent with the marketplace. We're still in the middle of the pack but we had a little room there. Third is we continue to have -- we have had and continue to have opportunity in terms of debt maturities and then the reissuance of debt. And we'll continue to see that in 2012. And so all those factors are part of the equation that gets me to that sort of 3 to 6 basis points.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe one for the Professor. Bill, do you -- what do you make of the flattening out of the home equity delinquencies? And that some other banks are kind of -- sound a little worried about mortgage credit double-dipping and turning in home equity. Charge-offs may be going up. But just -- can you give us your view there?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, this is -- there's definitely a little seasonal pressure this time of the year. So that would be normal. I mean, our state, pretty flat. We're further and further away from kind of the originations that took place pre-'09 -- or pre-'08. And so we continue to work through whether it's modifications or just attrition of the older portfolios. So that gives us some confidence that we'll continue to see improvement. It'll be modest going forward because they're, obviously, with the home prices the way they are, there's still a fair amount of pressure on those old vintages. But we have good modification programs that we employ for all the products, so.", "Richard K. Davis", "John, this is Richard, in the OMG category, don't forget, we had this amazingly high-quality credit portfolio for home equity. I mean, if you look at anything, we didn't grow a lot in the first half of that 2000s. It was home equity. I mean for our size, you had to stick out. Where were you guys, because you weren't growing at that, fast. We did it through people we knew. And our customers are primarily people that we have other relationships with. And our seconds, in many, many cases follow our own first. And that people where we follow someone else's first, they're underwritten at very conservative levels. So that is -- of all the portfolios, it's probably our best, most pristine portfolio in the original stress test of -- in April 2009, our numbers were so low in the forward view, they asked us to take the next bank's -- next number because they couldn't model our number being that low. So it's a point of pride for us that we have really high-quality home equity. And our branch originators understand that we will only do those kind of home equities. So you will see very little volatility in risk as it compares to our peers.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And even with a little bit of pressure on severity from the home price, do you still expect the charge-offs to grind down both there and in the first mortgage book, too, Bill?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. Slowly, but surely, yes.", "Richard K. Davis", "Underwriting comes through in the end.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Two questions, one on Durbin and then one on Commercial Real Estate. On Durbin, you mentioned that you expect to be able to offset about 1/3 to 1/2 of all the regulatory issues including Durbin. I'm guess I'm just wondering over what time frame and how much of that is in the run rate? You mentioned some of it was?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, okay. So let's do our setup here. We think that those 3 categories where the Reg E activities, Card act and now Durbin. And for that total we're expecting to reach -- achieve a 30% to 50% recovery. We're, right now, Betsy, at 30%. That's in our numbers today. You get to 50%. I'm going to take all of next year. And the reason I'm going to do that is because we're not going to rush to judgment, we're not going to make a mistake here and we don't have to. And so right now I'm making something very clear. We will not get that $75 million that we started the quarterly loss for Durbin beginning this month. We're not going to try to hive it back this quarter or even in the first quarter of next year. We'll start working our way toward different ways of charging for services and customers are willing to pay for. We've got a great laboratory of watching a number of banks that have been doing the debit fee and we'll learn whether or not that's inelastic or elastic. We'll find out if customers complain and move, or just complain. We'll take all that in time and we'll make our decision. But over the course of now, to the end of next year, we will have achieved 50% of that total cost of loss, but it will take the rest of the year to get the extra 20%.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and that's -- so it's about $1 billion in total for all 3, and so you're talking about that $200 million or so incremental?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. Yes.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and then on your slide deck, you talked about Commercial Real Estate. Obviously, with all the other asset classes and credit quality on Page 25. So I just wanted to see if we could dig in a little bit to how you're managing down the Commercial Real Estate portfolio in terms of the NPLs there. I mean, obviously, you had a big improvement in construction NCOs this quarter. But when I look at the last couple of quarters, the NPL decline in Commercial Real Estate looks like it's coming down pretty similarly, a little bit less than in net charge-offs in that asset class. Is this just something that you'll charge off and that's how we're going to down NPLs over time? Or is there something else going on that could accelerate that?", "P. W. Parker", "No, I mean it'll stay lumpy going forward. But it's on a overall downward trajectory. I mean, the overall construction book continues to decline. I think it's down 20% approximately year-over-year. So as we -- if the portfolio, the higher risk construction book continues to attrit, and as we work through the different deals, either we'll do loan sales or take the charge-offs, and just otherwise it was all the assets.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and as the current run rate of about $100 million or so decline in NPLs q-on-q, what you would expect to continue or?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, if you look at -- there's a chart in there, and it's going to be lumpy. But overall, it's on a downward trajectory.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and then you could also talk a little bit about the performing TDRs? You indicated that, that was due to accounting. But maybe give us some color about whether or not you dealt with them differently because of the accounting or not?", "P. W. Parker", "No, we don't know. We don't deal with anything differently because of the accounting. I mean, there were 2 things we did. We -- historically, we really only looked on the commercial side at those over $5 million and tagged them whether they were TDRs or not. Now we basically go down to 0. We have basically some formulas we run against the below $5 million to identify TDRs. And then we used to use internal rates for determining market rate. And now we use an external benchmark, which is a little bit higher. So -- but it doesn't change how we handle customers.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Right, and they're all performing -- so you don't have any non-performing TDRs [indiscernible]?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, there are definitely non-performing TDRs, too. But those have no impact because you're already doing a 114. So there's no financial impact at all there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is the follow-up on Ed's question. You seem very conservative with your tone with regards to reserve release. But then, when you were answering John's question, you were very confident in the strength of your underwriting. I guess, is what's missing in the equation in terms of what's driving for your conservatism, the continued uncertainty in how the economic recovery plays out?", "Richard K. Davis", "No. It's the math. I mean, we're at 130 -- what are we at? 131, and we're going to be at 100 basis points. So as you start to slide into that new run rate, you don't have that much left. And so I hope we actually get to the point where the reserve release ends. It's the only thing I don't like about our numbers because it's not sustainable, repeatable and consistent. So it'll come down just like a nice, slow slide into home plate. I mean it's just going to be steady and methodical, and eventually, our loan losses will equal our charge-offs. And we'll be back to normal. I just hope it's actually sooner than later.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just a follow-up on the margin, we saw an 18 basis-point compression on commercial yield. I guess, in terms of looking forward, do you expect a similar level given what you're seeing in the pipeline, given what you're seeing in terms of pricing? Or do you think it'll be a little bit lower from here?", "Andrew Cecere", "This is Andy, Erika. That decline is really a function of the decline in rates overall in the marketplace. So when I talk about spreads, I'm talking about both the rate on the loan as opposed to bunding cost in that loan which stabilized a bit in the third quarter. So on an absolute basis, it's down because rates, on a relative basis, it was down a little bit, quarters up to a quarter 2 and stabilized a bit, and right now, I see stabilization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of Friedman Billings.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On the mortgage banking side, it's one of these areas I think you have been growing market share, and even though it's still relatively small. But with Bank of America getting out of the correspondent business, is that something you guys are taking a look at? And secondly, can you talk a little bit about what type of mortgage loans you're putting on your books? I don't know if you answered in the beginning, but we've been running around this morning. Just what type of loans your portfolio-ing?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right, so first, I'm going to answer your second question first. The loans that represent the majority of the increase are in 2 categories. Number one is a product called smart refinance that's originated at our branches. It's a refinancing product for high quality core customers that come through the branch. The second category would be prime jumbo loans originated through our mortgage banking group. So these are not Freddie and Fannie qualified, but again, they're high-quality loans. And then that smart refinance, I would note that the term of those is probably in the neighborhood of 15 years or less, so they're not long-term 30-year mortgages, that's the principal area. In terms of the mix of businesses and the way we originate from a retail and correspondent basis, I would not see a significant change on that going forward.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On the smart refinance, what type of yield do you give them?", "Andrew Cecere", "Again, I'll go from a spread basis because that's how I think about things, and so in the neighborhood of 200-plus basis points.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "200-plus basis points. And most of its 15 years or less?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, 10 to 15, yes.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, and on the other issue, on your deposits, like a lot of the banks are collecting a lot of deposits out there. Can you talk about where that's coming from? Is it mainly coming in retail or through your business relationships?", "Andrew Cecere", "Paul, it's coming everywhere. So first on the consumer side of the equation, we have a number of products, smart savings and a number of different products that have allowed us to gain market share. Richard talked about that. You saw the FDIC data that indicated that. So we are absolutely gaining market share on the consumer side of the equation. On the wholesale lot side of the equation, it's additional cash being held by corporations as they're shrinking the balance sheet, additional market share. And then finally, on the corporate trust side of the equation, we continue to build that book also, and that is adding to our deposit categories particularly DDA. So we're seeing across all 3 categories, Corporate Trust, Wholesale, as well as Retail.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just on a percentage basis, is it an even mix across 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, or is wholesale like 56% of -- then consumer, 20% to 30%, just on that mix shift?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, so wholesale's the majority of the increase. And Wholesale and Corporate Trust is the majority of the increase that you see in DDA balances, which is a big piece of the increase. And I would say the remainder is sort of 50-50.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about -- given your comments about credit quality, particularly, as they stand in contrast to some of the larger banks being a little more conservative, are there areas in which you think you're going to be taking even more market share, kind of over the course of the next 6 to 12 months from a loan perspective?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. We're taking it now. You'll see it in the wholesale side. And it'll be always in Small Business to Middle Market up to Corporate. Starting backwards, Corporate Banking, as you know, we are getting, for the last few years, since we've really established our national Corporate Banking capabilities, we've been getting a lot more bites to the apple. We've been invited into more syndicated deals. And now, over the last year, we're now leading a lot of deals and leading syndications and playing the lead partner for these companies, which is a big step. And then, as you might have thought through this, the international banks are now not typically showing back up at the same level they were when there's a renewed syndicated deal. And so we're not only invited in but we're invited up. And so we're finding a lot of market share gain in deeper relationships and more customer -- more position with customers that are really, very impressive-like corporate -- top Fortune 100 kind of customer. The Middle Market, they really seem to appreciate the quality of the balance sheet. They like our top ratings. And those companies are sophisticated enough to know they want to put their money and get their line from a bank that's really safe. And we've been invited to do more business with them, and particularly, non-credit businesses come along with the loans that we've had. And through Bill's good work, we've taken higher positions on whole levels for customers that we really feel good about. And on Small Business, we've been growing that, Moshe, like in anywhere, 9% to 12% in origination year-over-year, whether it's SBA or business lines or business loans on the Small Business side. And we're getting a lot of new bites of the apple there because the company's focus on Small Business in the last 2 years has been yielding a lot of benefits by changing the course of what used to be a bank that did Small Business when it was available, to kind of leading relationships now with Small Business, I mean, getting all the ancillary deposits and key businesses to go along. So it's going to be anything wholesale. You're going to see it. It's in our numbers now. We're going to see it even more in future. And I'll just recap by saying the opportunity presented by some of the international banks deciding to change their posture is going to help a lot in the next year.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just one other, kind of, separate question, that is, I think when we've talked in the past, there have been some thoughts about acquisitions outside of the banking space. And it's been very quiet there. What -- I mean, what can you tell us about the environment? Are there conversations or the things we should be looking for? And what -- what are your areas of focus on that?", "Richard K. Davis", "And you mean outside of the traditional like?", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Traditional commercial banking, yes.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, okay. For us -- you just quoted the Corporate Trust and Payments businesses. And you'll see more of what you've seen so far. We keep looking. We'd love to grow those 2 businesses. The best capital use or low capital users, they're great fee businesses. The cost of entry is almost 0 for those who aren't in it. And for those who are, it's a scale business. So we're not slowing that area at all. We're not seeing perhaps as many deals to show you, but it's not for lack of looking. And if I have my way, you'll see continued branch and small bank deals. You'll see continued Corporate Trust deals. You'll see portfolio purchases and you'll see opportunities for us in the payment space, which might include more mobile banking activities. So what you see is more what you're going to get. And we're going to do our best to keep filling the pipeline with those kind of small deals that come together in a nice way in the end.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up, how much of the commercial growth and the growth in commitment is driven by the wholesale and large corporate business?", "Richard K. Davis", "A big part of it, and that's part of the reason why I started -- I mentioned to Moshe's question backwards. Let me just say that as I look at the wholesale -- traditional wholesale, which is the larger Middle Market, Corporate and Commercial Real Estate, our line of credit continues to grow. Our utilization is pretty flat, but it's only in fact a little bit down. It's because we keep growing commitments by more and more. So on a book of about $70 billion of commitments for those larger corporate side, we grew in linked quarter $4.1 billion in commitments. So $70 billion going to $74 billion. The loans themselves went from, like, 17 to 18 of about $1 billion. So we continue to have nice growth of 4.6% on that book, linked quarter on loans, but 5.8% linked quarter on the same book for commitments. So that also says people are positioning to continue to be ready for something when they're ready. And we're getting robust business across the board. I would say if I had to split down the large CRE in the large corporate versus the middle market side of it, it will be probably 2/3, 1/3. So it's really happening at the corporate level, at the highest-level most.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up on a comment you just made, you talked earlier also about the confidence of customers and how utilizations are relatively flat and you think you need confidence to lead the stronger balance growth. I'm just curious if you could give us some, maybe qualitative stuff on what your customers are spending and how much of an issue is the confidence question?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, so one of the stories of the U.S. Bank this quarter would be, that most of the new opportunities in Wholesale Banking is driven primarily by refinance activities. And if we were only refinancing our own customers, there wouldn't be any balance sheet growth. In fact, there might be margin deterioration. But the best proxy I have for you, is we are bringing in other people's customers and refinancing new credits for us, someone else's credits for them, at rates that are sufficient enough for us based on our cost of funds to be good. And so the majority of it, it doesn't matter which of the category they talked about, has a lot to its refinance activities, and coming to us. It can also be in the form of a refinance. And that's getting a higher bite of the position, or, in fact, leading the positions. So by far, John, that's the majority of what we're seeing here. It's really market shift. Otherwise, its customers who are either in M&A. And we're getting a bigger piece of that because more often than not, our customers on the M&A side of the transaction, or in many other cases, we've got like good ad businesses. In the Community Bank, we've got the Small Business growth I've talked about. It kind of fills in the rest of the gap.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Question is when you do your Basel III calculation and you're only taking out from 8.5% to 8.2%, are you giving yourself any credit for the better-than-performance on their credit, that you actually can get a positive impact even though a lot of the legislation says we're not supposed to eventually get that? But are you giving yourself any credit for that as you go through that calculation?", "Andrew Cecere", "No, is the short answer because that's Basel II. And our constraint is actually Basel I/III. Our Basel II numbers are actually higher than our Basel III numbers, so I don't get to use any of that credit.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then on what we're seeing in the commercial growth, as we're seeing really less access to market, less competition from alternative providers of this, is part of what we're seeing, especially with your commercial loan growth, just maybe the first sign of what may be a new paradigm for banking, that the pie may be smaller but we're going to get a piece of it as we see business start to come back?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. I mean, I can repeat your answer, but that's exactly what we're saying.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and I just think your positioning in the commercial side, that's the first place we're going to see it because there are refinancing going on. And as they move back into the banking system, you're getting the benefit of that. Eventually, that will roll down in the Middle Market, I guess, and also some of the -- even closer to smaller business?", "Richard K. Davis", "Marty, that's right on. In fact, what I just told the numbers back to John and Moshe -- I mean, our utilization of those large per customers is like 24%. I mean -- and we just keep building more customers, and more opens to buy. I mean, when the recovery hits, then it will. I can't even tell you how much we have in terms of opportunity for our loan book to grow without adding one more new customer because we're having so many that are positioned eventually to take and use our balance sheets. It's pretty good stuff.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A follow-up question just on securities, yields and deposit pricing. I know you talked about these expectations for slight margin compression. But I'm just wondering, underneath the purchases first on the security side, the pieces that you're adding for liquidity, can you just give us come color what's going underneath in the securities yields? And do you expect that to hold up as you continue to reinvest going forward?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So Ken, we are -- first of all, I should highlight we ended the quarter at about $67.5 billion. And we mentioned in the notes and in the call that we're going to probably end the year at $70 million, and sort of be in the holding pattern then because we're going to be very close. So the level of build is -- that remains is not significant, so I'll start that there. Secondly, from the purchases I would say, it's about 2/3 or 3/3, 1/3 or one-quarter floating. And the fixed is probably just around 2%-plus. And the floating's probably LIBOR plus 135 to 140.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. All right. That's helpful. And then secondly, the all-in deposit costs and the all-in liability costs were stickier for you guys relative to a lot of other banks. I know you talked about the ability to continue repricing the right side of the balance sheet lower. Can you help us at all think about how much is left either in deposits or what you're doing on the deposit side? And then also remind us about what you may have benefits from in terms of lowering the long-term debt costs?", "Andrew Cecere", "I would say a good deal of the deposit pricing opportunity is reflected in the third quarter. There might be a little bit more opportunity but I would not call it significant. We have between $7 billion and $10 billion rolling of over the next 12 to 15 months on the debt side of the equation that will offer us additional opportunity.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is that -- so a lot of banks are talking about just the ability to reprice the entire deposit complex lower. Obviously, with your interest checking and money market savings at 14, there's not much more you can go. But can you give us the amount of, kind of, where your go-to rates are on the CD side? And what the roll-off of the CD book is, kind of, like you just did with the debt book?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, the CD book does represent a repricing opportunity, both on new CDs as well as renewals. But just from -- and you can see the math in terms of the balance sheet and income statement. It's not a significant component of what changes on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "You've talked a lot about your market share expansion in the commercial loans, but 20% annualized growth in commercial loans, how comfortable are you with the credit quality? Of the new loans, I guess there are a couple of hung deals in the syndicated loan market this past quarter. I didn't see your name associated with that, but you're seeing some signs that everything's not as good as it had been. So I guess I'm asking about the quality of the new loans, what you're seeing in the market overall and if you plan continue that pace of expansion?", "P. W. Parker", "I mean the quality of the loans is excellent, right? So I mean we're very selective about how we go after the large corporate customers. So -- and these are companies we know well. We can provide a full suite of services. And you're right, we don't have any hung syndications.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And which geographies are these loans in? I mean you've been consistent for last year saying you're expanding, you're going to gain market share. You are. Is that more in the Midwest, is that Southeast? Where is it?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, the national corporate, it's a national platform. So that's all over the United States.", "Richard K. Davis", "Mike, if you compare it back to a few years ago, though, it's the out footprint. Because we didn't have it. And now it's quite robust for us, but in market we're growing there, too. It's just that the net new -- if you just take a couple-of-year horizon, it's really coming outside of the 25 states because of this national -- gone from regional, the national corporate bank.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And how much of that -- if 2/3 of the growth came from wholesale, how much of that would be international? Like capturing share from the international banks which are all pulling back?", "Richard K. Davis", "We don't do any international.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "No, you know what I mean. In other words, you had some international bank competing in the U.S. market, they're pulling back, how much of your growth might be attributed to that?", "P. W. Parker", "That's shown up just more recently. [indiscernible]", "Richard K. Davis", "It's our future growth. It's what I may be talking about in the next few quarters.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And just -- I'm going to repeat the question just so I know what to tell other people. They say, U.S. Bancorp had 20% annualized commercial loan growth, why?", "Richard K. Davis", "Because we are taking more position, buyer positions with customers we now come to know. We're being invited to syndicated deals for the first time and for the second time at a much higher level. And we're rolling new customers just the old-fashioned organic way because I've added hundreds of new people in the last few years, from a lot of really good banks with really good skills, and really good customers who now work here.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "All right, great. And one last completely separate question, when you look at home prices through the end of next year, what do you plan around? What kind of flat, down 2, down 5, what do you think?", "Andrew Cecere", "Mike, this is Andy. We're down 0% to 2%.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "NIM obviously held up a lot better than we've seen at other banks. It seems like you managed the surge in noninterest-bearing deposits better than some. How sustainable do you think that increase is? That $10 billion increase in noninterest-bearing since its in the Wholesale and Corporate Trust?", "Andrew Cecere", "So, Matt, first of all, I think you're right. And our Treasury group works very closely with our Consumer group and our Wholesale groups, in terms of pricing. And we really try to target those solid customers and really try to work with the customers with different alternatives. So we're not pushing customers away from the bank at all or charging them. Second is, I do think that the growth that you were seeing reflects a little bit of the fact that the corporations are very strong right now, in terms of their own particular balance sheets, and are not yet choosing to invest those dollars. So we probably will see some decline in those over time. The final factor I'd mention is that, as you know, there's unlimited insurance in DDA till the end of 2012. So certainly in this environment, that's a very safe place to put your money, and that may change once the unlimited insurance changes at the end of '12.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, it's helpful. And then just totally separate topic, one of the interesting things that's probably going to happen in the next several years is some movement in the payments business in terms of how customers and corporates pay. You've got, obviously, these changes in the debit card fees. You've got mobile payments that is probably going to take off at some point. There's stubbornly high unemployment, so there's a lot of government transfers. Can you just talk about -- obviously, you're in a lot of the areas of payments. And can you talk about some of the new products that you have or are working on or some of the themes that you think you will benefit from over the next, say, the next 6, 12 months, but a little bit longer term maybe?", "Richard K. Davis", "But 6 to 12 months is long [ph]. Two categories here. One is your consumers, and our mobile banking -- online banking capabilities are at the top of class. And I've said a number of things about this company over the years, and a few years ago, you never said U.S. Bank and innovation in the same phrase. And now you should put it at the top of the class because we have spent a lot of time and energy with that price revenue office, and building a whole new set of suite of new ideas and new ways to move money. Because we're in the business of moving money for corporate payments for 20 years. And now we extended that capability. And I'm putting money behind getting amazing talent and amazing skill to get this kind of mobile banking in the top of class. And you'll see amazing things in the next couple of quarters. Back to corporate payments, and the thing we haven't talked about much, but I'm so glad we have it. 20 years ago, the legacy of this bank started the corporate payments business, which you know is a huge government provider of card big key [ph] payments. It's a huge, kind of sophisticated way of treasury management on steroids, and moving money along before it was going to be popular paperless. And all of that continues to grow and expand in terms of the capabilities we have. And by the way, Matt, the cost of entry there is too high for -- there's only 4 or 5 of us in this space. So this corporate payments world is going to become very robust for us. Customers are going to get smarter and don't want to move anything that they can't see in a nanosecond. They don't want it on paper. They want to have the next new idea. So while we appeal to consumers, we're going to be able to get even further ahead because of our starting position with corporate and commercial payments. So I'm totally jazzed about both of those and I'm glad you brought it up.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "There's obviously a revenue opportunity from this. But as people use banks differently as banks have to charge customers differently, does this make you think about the expense base differently than we've seen one bank who was going to be very aggressive in expanding its branch network? Talk about maybe toning that down a little bit. I think you're more, kind of complete and haven't had this ambitious expansion. But just as you look out in the next couple of years, you're going to be doing business differently and I would think that might mean some reallocation of cost.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, not really. We kind of the like where we are and I think we can handle just small nuances to the way we spend our money. The branch network's probably going to go to 25 to 50 branches net a year. And yes, that's exactly what we've done for the last 10 years. So it's nothing remarkable. We have a disparately large position in what we call grocery branches and on-site corporate and public location branches in the same guide category because they are growing well. They're exactly what customers want, the hybrid between, be where I need you to be but I don't need the same old-fashioned branch with marble columns. And I'll say over the next few years, you'll see, like everyone else, we're going to take the branches we do have, make sure that they pass the test to be in locations for which more than check-cashing occurs. And we'll probably remodel them in a way that make them much more attractive as a point of destination for conversations and private discussions. But pretty much what you see. And we're not going to make much of a change in course because we kind of like how it got us here. And we don't have anything we need to either retrofit or back-out of because of having been to excess in the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. Richard, you've spent a lot of time over the last couple of quarters talking about the investment bank and the gains that you've seen there. I'm just curious as to what the trends were in the investment bank this quarter relative to underwriting volumes, and things like that. Obviously, the market's been pretty weak for underwriting. But at least in terms of your line of business numbers, it didn't look as if the Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate numbers were down all that much. So if you could just provide some color there, that would be helpful?", "Richard K. Davis", "Let me just say, a lot of businesses I thought you were talking about our fee businesses where we provide the guidance and trust and support to our wholesale clients, which is growing very nicely especially since it started from 0, 2 years ago. So for us, it's icing on the cake and there may be deals that we're not showing you yet because they haven't even come to market or they didn't come to market yet. But we're now in conversations and the folks that we have in Charlotte and New York are at the top of the people's call lists, as it relates to providing services for any kind of the underwriting or the high-grade activities. In many cases, that does derive more business on the balance sheet for us. But primarily, Matt, it's going to be our fee business that you should look at that really derive, kind of, the benefit of that. And I would say it's in inning 3 as this company is growing this business, and growing a respect and a capability. The talent is already there. We're ready for the phones to ring but the market will find us as it continues to heat up. And Andy, you might put some numbers on.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, I would say that from the -- if you look at the commercial product revenue line, which is with the majority of that fee revenue at glance, our high-grade bond business, our municipal underwriting business, I think in all cases were building and taking share, and building -- moving up on the lead tables. And I think you should continue to expect that. You are correct that the third quarter was down a bit in overall activity, but we were up because we continue to gain share. And I think once the activity starts to become robust, we're going to move even more in those tables.", "Richard K. Davis", "And then I might add lastly, not unlike the conversation we had on the wholesale loan book, this business is going to be benefited by the foreign bank's decision to retreat from some of those participations with some of those levels in involvement. So this will be another place we will see, I think robust benefits next year that are just starting to show up.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That make sense. And if I can, just a follow-up question on the commitments. You mentioned the commitments are growing a little faster than loans. I'm just curious as to the trend in the pricing of commitments if that's gotten substantially more competitive over the last couple of quarters?", "Andrew Cecere", "It kind of flattened out a little bit. I mean, we did see year-over-year pricing come down 25, 30, 40 basis points. But third quarter, basically said, it's still an uncertain environment out there, so people are still willing to pay.", "Richard K. Davis", "And I would add, as this recession gets older and as people kind of start thinking through what's worth it to them, we are prepared to compete on price. We've always said that, and I'll say it again today. We're not having to use it as much. People have more and more value that even I expected them to ascribe to our ratings and to our balance sheet strength, and probably now our multi-year commitment in following through on things we've promised. So we're actually not having to spend as much as I'm willing to spend to win a high-quality deal because they're actually coming to us, saying that's a fair price for the quality of our relationship, I'll take it.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then finally just a question on the CCAR exam. Richard, am I correct in assessing sort of the color of your comments relative to the 2012 exam versus 2011, as maybe the regulators being not quite so prescriptive this go-round versus last time? Maybe because of familiarity with the whole process, but also because we're a bit further away from the challenges of 2008 and 2009?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, what you heard was my aspirations that I'm right. Honestly, I don't have any insight except the way they've treated us during the year, the way we continue to communicate well. And my hope is that, that distinction will be recognized. I don't have the facts that -- and I really won't know until we do this second. We only have 2 points to connect. We have one test and the tea leaves to read. But so far, we're prepared to perform well in test. And I hope that the teacher will give us a high grade and let us move on to the next class.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "I have a small picture question for Bill and a big picture question for you, Richard. I'll ask the small one first. Bill, the impression is that the credit standards have changed dramatically on the consumer side over the last few years. Could you clarify whether that is indeed true at USB? And just sort of maybe give us your sort of average FICO on the consumer side now versus where it was in maybe 2008?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, and I said this before. I mean, in terms of U.S. Bank and our underwriting, if you look at our cards or autos, our underwriting really did not change a lot. I mean in cards, you have to make adjustments in a downturn based on region and stuff like that, but basically, straight prime books. The one area that did change, we changed along with the industry was the 100% financing of a home, which we did some of that in our finance company. And we do some of that on our home equity. So backing away from 100%, we still do 90% home equity in kind of our branch. But that's the one area where there was a change at U.S. Bank. And obviously, even bigger changes in the industry. And the average side, we do disclose on our residential mortgage and home equity originations. They're in our schedule that we hand out and those FICOs are, I think, they're in the 760s.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Richard, the question for you is this, I think it's recognized in the banking industry that you're one the CEOs who has pretty good relationships with the regulators, i.e., you're not out there yelling at them or insulting them in public. So I would ask you -- I mean, what do you see as sort of the general relationship between the banking industry and its regulators right now? And do you see any -- where are we in this sort of whole new regulatory revolution or evolution? Do you see any new initiatives that are going to be coming down the road at us?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, Nancy, that's a big one. Let me say, first of all, we have a handful of people that are still in appointed or unconfirmed positions, and that is worth starting at because until the comptroller, the head of the FDIC are finally confirmed and until the CFPB is finally appointed, you don't get the same kind of definitive answers, you don't get the same kind of definitive progress on things when people are watching progress but not necessarily setting a long-term objective. So I think we're a bit -- I'd say I'm frustrated by that because I'd like to have a better sense of where the endpoint is so we can all start marching toward that. But directionally, we all know where we're headed. I would say if you take a look at the Dodd-Frank, 20% of the whole activity hasn't even -- has only been slightly accomplished, 80% even yet to be defined. You look at things like SIFI buffers. We're sitting in wait, wondering what will be called and what the number will be. We're eager to know whether or not there's going to be a standard coming out of this CCAR test coming up, that we just mused about here not knowing. So the uncertainty is everywhere. But I also balance it by saying, and so it's been that way for 3 years. I mean, we've been operating under uncertainty for a long time. We've been operating under a difficult economic environment for a long time/and so I think the answer to your question is nothing's getting more clear or progressing very fast, but our ability to now understand that it's not going to happen fast and our willingness to accept the fact that we have to make up some of the answers until there's a final one. It's probably much higher. So I believe that my peers and I are still frustrated to the highest level that we don't have better guidance. But we're not, in most cases, frustrated or surprised by it. We're now managing to kind of a new normal in understanding it will take quite some time. And on the other hand, until you tell me I can't do something and it's not harmful and it's good for your customers and it seems to be in line with good regulatory behavior, then we're going to do it. And we'll wait and find out if they want us to change that later, but we're not sitting on our hands waiting for guidance on how to run the company. We're just trying to be a little more logical. So I'd say it's because it's old and it's not that different, we're probably more balanced in our view and probably not as surprisingly frustrated as we would otherwise be.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "There was an announcement last week or a report that the CFPB is going to start examining mortgage servicers for hidden fees, et cetera, et cetera. Do you expect that you will get targeted in that? And do you expect that then they're going to go from mortgage servicing to credit cards, et cetera, et cetera?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I don't. I don't. I'll tell you why. I think the CFPB is still a long way from being configured. And in fact, I don't have a CFPB person assigned to me yet, so we have no CFPB evidenced at U.S. Bank. And so until that time, the OCC and others will continue to watch over what would be consumer regulations and we'll watch it ourselves. But I think when it comes to things like mortgage, there are so many other entities looking over that topic. It would be surprising if the CFPB picked one of their first things to get into the middle level of. It would be something that someone else is working on. I think from talking to Rog Tate [ph], it's clear to me that they're going to stay pure on focused on transparency disclosures, customer clarity on all products, could be mortgage, too, but credit cards and mortgages to start. But it won't be intrusive or redundant, the things that are being done in a more provocative sense of servicing rules and foreclosure exams and things like that. I think they're going to stay pretty pure first. What we all really want more than anything is that we want them to appoint someone so that the non-bank entities can be brought into the same umbrella of oversight that we all share. And I think that's the most important thing we should look forward to, which is why I've always been a supporter of the CFPB because I think it brings more guidance to a level playing field than it does additional work for those of us who already doing it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of John Dunne [ph] from Meredith Whitney.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I think in the past, you guys have sort of downplayed the idea of buying credit card portfolios -- I mean, sorry, commercial real estate portfolios. It seems like maybe you've softened your stance on that. Is that because there's a lot of weak players out there and you might be able to get something at a good price? Has your view changed?", "Richard K. Davis", "No, we haven't softened our stance. We've typically pretty much -- might want to underwrite stuff that big and that important, and know where it came from, and know our customer. Not to say we wouldn't find what we might like, but the more recent deals you saw, we took a quick look and said not for us, and we've moved right along.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Yes, it's a critical test to know who we're doing business with, that's not the space where you just buy indirect.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, and we're not desperate for us to asset growth. And I'd mean that in the nicest way. We're simply not looking to go buy other assets because we have a balance sheet issue. We can handle where we are now. And eventually, gosh, I can't wait until these lines of credit get used and then we're going to be very, very pleased that we didn't over-encumber ourselves with loans that we didn't know.", "Operator", "That was our final question. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Tiffany. I just want to thank everybody for their continued interest. I am really proud of this quarter. And we've always said we want to focus on consistency, predictability and repeatability. I call it my CPR. And I think we're getting close to consistent. I think we're getting close to predictable. And I certainly think we can keep repeating this kind of clean and unjaundiced performance of just doing business the old-fashioned way. So I hope that's clear to you and I appreciate the time you gave us today.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Yes, thank you all for listening.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.

I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com. ", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. ", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share our results with you today, and I'll begin with the highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2012 or $0.67 per diluted common share. Total net revenue was higher by 9.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 7.3% growth in net interest income and 11.3% growth in fee revenue. ", "Total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 6.4% and 1.5%, respectively, and we also experienced strong loan growth and total average deposits of 11.7% over the prior year and 2.2% linked quarter. Credit Quality continued to improve as net charge-offs declined by 8.2%, and nonperforming assets decreased in total by 8.5% from the prior quarter. ", "We continue to generate significant capital each quarter. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.7% at March 31, or 8.4% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.9%. Capital actions this quarter included a 56% dividend increase, and we repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the first quarter. ", "The 5-quarter trends of our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on the left-hand side of Slide 4. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.6%, and return on average common equity was 16.2%. We've stated that our company can achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Both performance ratios have now reached their respective ranges. ", "Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.6% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year but equal to the prior quarter, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a couple of minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 51.9%, and consistent with our expectation, this ratio remained in the low 50s. ", "Turning to Slide 5. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. At March 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio, using anticipated Basel III guidelines, was 8.4%. At 8.4%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above the level of which we believe we need to be. ", "Turning to Slide 6. On March 13, after receiving the results of our 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review from the Federal Reserve, we announced a $0.28 or 56% increase in our annual dividend. In addition to the dividend increase, the board authorized a new 100 million share repurchase program. As we've indicated in the past, our long-term goal is to return between 60% and 80% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the first quarter, we returned 66% of our earnings to our shareholders, 29% of which in the form of dividends and 37% in the form of share buybacks. ", "Average total loans outstanding increased by $12.6 billion or 6.6% year-over-year. As expected, linked quarter loan growth and average total of loans was 1.5%. Significantly, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $36 billion this quarter. This represents a 4.5% year-over-year increase in new and renewed lending activity. ", "Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 25.7% and 5.1% on a linked quarter basis while utilization remained fairly consistent at approximately 25%. Total average deposits increased by $24 billion or 11.7% over the same quarter last year while total average deposits grew by $5 billion on a linked quarter basis or 2.2%. ", "Turning to Slide 8. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, an increase of 9.1% over the prior quarter's -- year's quarter, but 3.4% less than previous quarter. Recall, however, that the fourth quarter included a $263 million litigation settlement gain. Excluding this gain, linked quarter revenue growth was $88 million or 1.8%. The company's revenue growth can be attributed to both our balance sheet and our fee businesses growing as we continue to benefit from our investments in growth initiatives over the past years. ", "Turning to Slide 9 and Credit Quality. First quarter total net charge-offs declined by 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2011 while nonperforming assets decreased by 8.5% or 5.9%, excluding covered assets. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 1.09%, improving from the 1.19% recorded in the fourth quarter. ", "Turning to Slide 10. As the graph on the left illustrates, early- and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, improved this quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 10, you can see that the trend in criticized assets continues to show improvement. Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge-offs and nonperforming assets will trend lower in the second quarter of 2012, although net charge-offs may show a more modest reduction than in recent quarters as the pace of improvement slows in the consumer categories. Given the first quarter's credit results and the expected improvement going forward, we released $90 million of reserves compared with $125 million in the fourth quarter and $50 million in the first quarter of 2011. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 11 gives you a view of our first quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Diluted EPS of $0.67 was 28.8% higher than the first quarter of 2011 and 2.9% lower than the prior quarter. Recall that the fourth quarter EPS included $0.05 related to 2 notable items. ", "Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings. The 27.9% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a 9.1% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 10.6% increase in noninterest expense. Net income was slightly lower on a linked quarter basis. The unfavorable variance was the result of a 3.4% decline in net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and a $16 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the impact of the 2 notable items detailed on Slide 13, net revenue increased by 1.8% quarter-over-quarter and noninterest expense was flat. ", "Slide 13 provides you more detail about the notable items that impacted the comparison of our first quarter to prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total noninterest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the termination of a merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related to mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related matters. ", "On a net basis, these 2 items increased fourth quarter net income by approximately $92 million and EPS by $0.05. The first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the acquisition of First Community Bank of New Mexico from the FDIC. Also noted in the bottom of Slide 13 are 2 revenue and expense classification changes that had an impact on comparisons to prior periods. ", "Moving to Slide 14. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $183 million or 7.3%. The increase was largely driven by the $26.1 billion or 9.5% increase in average earning assets, as well as the benefit from strong growth in low-cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by planned increases in the securities portfolio and growth in average total loans, partially offset by a lower cash position at the Federal Reserve. ", "The net interest margin of 3.60% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year due primarily to the expected increase in lower yielding investment securities, partially offset by lower cash balances at the Fed and the inclusion of a credit card balance transfer fee. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $17 million. ", "Average earning assets grew by $4.9 billion, and net interest margin was flat to the prior quarter. Margin was slightly better than expected this quarter primarily due to the inclusion of balance transfer fees and lower cash balances at the Fed. Given the current rate environment, we expect that net interest margin to be down a few basis points in the second quarter. ", "The investment securities portfolio at March 31 totaled $74.3 billion. The balances were higher than December 31, as we took the opportunity to manage down our cash balances and purchase investment securities. We expect to main the investments -- maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters. ", "Slide 15 provides you with more detail behind the changes in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by 6.4% year-over-year. Excluding covered loans, our runoff portfolio, average total loans increased by 8.7% year-over-year. As you can see on the chart, the increase in average total loans was principally due to strong growth in commercial loans and residential mortgages of 17.3% and 19.1%, respectively. Commercial loan growth has continued to accelerate over the past 5 quarters while growth in consumer lending has been less robust. On a linked quarter basis, the 1.5% increase in average total loans outstanding was also primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew by 3.4%, and residential real estate loans, which grew by 4.3%. ", "Slide 16 provides more detail on the growth in total deposits over the past 5 quarters. Average total deposits grew by $24 billion or 11.7% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by $5 billion or 2.2%. Importantly, average low-cost deposits accounted for the majority of the increases on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. ", "Slide 17 provides more details around the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Noninterest income increased by 11.3% over the same quarter of 2011. Mortgage Banking revenue was very strong this quarter as production increased by 58% year-over-year and gain-on-sale margins improved. Offsetting a portion of the growth in origination and sales fee income were an unfavorable net change in MSR valuation and related hedging of approximately $32 million and an increase in the repurchase reserve. ", "In addition to Mortgage Banking, merchant processing services, deposit service charges and commercial products revenue also posted solid increases year-over-year. These positive variances were partially offset by lower credit card or debit card fees due to legislative changes to debit card interchange, as well as the change in classification of balance transfer fees. Offsetting the impact of these 2 items were legislative-related mitigation activity and higher transaction volumes. ", "ATM services revenue was lower as the result of the change related to revenue passed through to others. And finally, other income in the first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the FDIC transaction. ", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $192 million or 7.9%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of the merchant settlement gain in the fourth quarter of 2011, seasonally lower payments-related revenue and the revenue classification changes, partially offset by very strong Mortgage Banking activity. ", "Slide 18 highlights noninterest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $246 million or 10.6%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to: higher compensation and benefits expense, representing additional staffing in the branches mortgage-related activities and business expansion initiatives; an increase in professional services, primarily due to technology and foreclosure review projects; as well as marketing and business development expense and other expense related to regulatory and insurance-related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by a decrease in net occupancy related to the change in ATM revenue pass-through to others. ", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was lower by $136 million or 5%, primarily due to the fourth quarter mortgage servicing accrual, occupancy expense, partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits. The tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 30.9% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 29% in the first quarter of 2011. ", "Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage, purchase-related expense and the reserve for unexpected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. For outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at March 31 was $134 million compared with $105 million at December 31. The increase, in addition to recent changes in the GSE sampling method, specifically higher sampling sizes, caused us to increase our mortgage representation and warranties reserve to $202 million. We do, however, expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters. ", "I'll now talk -- turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to Slide 20. The momentum continues. Words from the cover of our annual report that appropriately describe our 2011 accomplishments and performance, and our first quarter results demonstrated the momentum we've built over the past several years continues to build into the new year. ", "In the first quarter, we grew our balance sheet and our customer base. We grew our net revenue. We continued to invest in our organic growth initiatives, as well as small but important fill-in acquisitions, including: the 10-branch banking franchise of BankEast in Knoxville, Tennessee; the Indiana Corporate Trust business from UMB Bank; and an institutional trust business from Union Bank in California. ", "In the first quarter, our credit quality continued to improve. Our capital liquidity positions remained strong. And we grew our earnings and achieved industry-leading performance metrics for the quarter, and we were able to return 66% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. ", "We continue to benefit from our investments in growth initiatives and innovation and in acquisitions. We continue to benefit from our prudent risk management and our diversified business model, and we benefit from our markets, both established and new. ", "Today we'll be holding our Annual Meeting here in Minneapolis, our headquarter city. In addition to conducting the official business of the meeting, I'll be sharing our story of how we have managed this company through the downturn and we are continuing to capitalize on the momentum we've built. I'll also tell the shareholders how exceedingly proud I am of what we've accomplished and of the 64,000 remarkable and engaged employees that have contributed to our success. I look forward to the coming year as we grow even stronger for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and, importantly, our shareholders. ", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "First of all, I guess I just wonder if you can give some color commentary around loan demand trends through the quarter. Do you still see -- are there any particular pockets of strength, weakness, sector -- either by sector or by geography?", "Richard K. Davis", "Sure. This is Richard. As we stated 90 days ago, we thought that the trends would slow from quarter 4, partly because of the seasonality of the new year. And we saw the ending of the quarter kind of slowing down, and we turned out to be correct. In this case, we're starting to see what I expected was a slow but seasonal increase as we move into quarter 2. Quarter 1 got stronger as it aged, and quarter 2 is looking at least as good as quarter 1, if not with slight biases on the positive side. It's across-the-board, Chris. Corporate Banking, commercial banking, Community Banking, small business, consumer, credit card, they're all showing slight improvements in terms of volume and applications. All of them are showing improvement in credit quality. And except for Commercial Real Estate, where we see strengths on the coasts and the larger cities that kind of line the 2 oceans, we don't see any other distinct geography to note except a nice, steady, kind of even increase across all business lines across all states where we do business in all 50. So we're feeling quite positive about the year as it ages. And as spring has sprung, we're looking -- things looking up pretty nicely. I've got Bill Parker here with me to maybe bring a little more color to the quality and the application volumes.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. So I'll highlight small business because we did see a pretty good uptick in our small business application volume. It's been double digit in all of our different areas, whether it's SBA or the branch-originated small business. So that bodes well to see some strength in the small business markets. And I'll just comment on the credit and Commercial Real Estate. Multifamily is the one area that's very strong and particularly on the coast. In the other areas, Class A properties are highly valued. But if you get below Class A and the other asset classes, it's still -- I don't want to say weak, but it's not as strong, so. But overall, pretty positive.", "Richard K. Davis", "And we won't \u2013 we've said this before. We can compete on price, and we will to the right level, but we won't engage in price competition where it doesn't make sense for our company. And we won't get our loan volume on lower underwriting. We simply won't do that, and we haven't had to and we're not going to.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then the other thing I wanted to ask about was your mortgage servicing portfolio has started to grow significantly, and it had been flat the prior couple of quarters. And the last 2 quarters, it's kind of grown significantly. I'm wondering is that just a function of the strong production volume that we've had recently, or is -- or do you see that as a particular strategic growth opportunity in that some of the larger players are probably constrained in how they can grow their servicing business?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes and yes. So it is a function of -- the latter informs the former. So we're having really nice market share improvement because we've stayed very active in this. We've added a lot of resources to continue to be relevant as a mortgage originator and a servicer. And because the market -- the dynamics have changed, we continue to enjoy even greater growth maybe than we might have thought. We have no limits on the kind of resources that we might pursue to this level because we see a market shift that you only get once in a lifetime. And we intend to enjoy it now and come out of this as probably, I don't know, in the top 5 for sure of mortgage servicing and production, and we're seeing that to come sooner than we thought.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And specifically, that -- is that something that you could imagine getting into the kind of stand-alone mortgage company kind of business and through acquisition? Or do you want to maintain mortgage production primarily out of the branches?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, we do it through the branches and through corresponding networks, so that's not going to change. But like everything else, we don't want to be dominant in any one line of business. So no more that I want to be a credit card company with branches attached to it, I don't want to be a mortgage company with a credit card business. We really want to be a business that does the work for most of our customers and meet their needs, where we know them firsthand and where there's opportunity to extend that based on market share improvement, we'll take that as well. But Chris, you'll see us continue that kind of balanced view of revenue achieved through spread and fee income on a basis of diversity of types of business as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Could you maybe kind of flesh out some of your comments on the capital front? I mean, obviously, you're now kind of -- you're past the point where you would likely see any SIFI buffer or anything like that, and obviously, 2/3 of the capital is a nice capital return. But as you kind of look out there, are there acquisition opportunities that we should be thinking about? Or how could that evolve over the course of the next year?", "Andrew Cecere", "Moshe, this is Andy. So our Tier 1 common Basel III standard is at 8.4%, probably a little higher than we would plan to be at, and part of that is the volatility around that ratio as it relates to OCI and the available-for-sale portfolio, as we enjoyed a bigger gain this quarter due to lower interest rates. So you'll see us somewhere in that 8.2% to 8.4% range depending upon that gain. Our capital plan was approved. And as we've talked about, we have a target of that sort of 30 to 40 dividends, 30 to 40 buybacks, somewhere within that range. That leaves us plenty of room for opportunities that present themselves in the marketplace for portfolio purchases or small deals, just like we've done been in the past. And I think we're sort of in a normal, regular ongoing capital distribution methodology as we sit today with some dividends, some buybacks and some return for internal investment.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Moshe, what you saw last quarter would be a great proxy for future quarters in terms of M&A branch opportunities where they come along, FDIC or otherwise, payments businesses, corporate trust opportunities. The stuff you've seen us do over the last 4 years, 5 years. We see a pipeline for that opportunity. And as Andy said, we have plenty of room left within our retained capital to do that.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just a follow-up on the Corporate Trust. I mean, there've been some recent lawsuits looking at the questions around the trustees' responsibility as -- in some of the sub-prime securitizations. Do you have kind of any thoughts on -- as to how that might shake out?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, absolutely. I'm glad you brought it up. And as you know, it's not new. We've been dealing with this for as long as I've been here. One of the benefits of Corporate Trust is it's a really good business, particularly when the market is strong. It's a good relationship and fee business, and it provides -- there's pretty high cost of entry. So you're either in it and you're good or you're not in it at all. We've got the benefit of being in it and good. But with it comes the risk of confusion, and it's a reputation risk that we manage every single day. And it can be anything from foreclosed properties, where we are often cited as the owner of the property, or REO property, where there's some problem with the quality of the structure, and we're identified as the owner. And it turns out we're most often the trustee. And in fact, that causes people to be confused because that's still a complicated topic. When a company might file bankruptcy and we're acting as trustee, it looks like we were the lender who put them into a bankruptcy. And then more times than not, as you're talking about now in some of the MBS and other kinds of structured deals, we are often hired in as the appropriate legal source and the broker between 2 parties and often confused as the party in between. So we will deal with that confusion because the business is so good, and it has such a great upside potential and we're so deep into it. We just recognize it's something we have to manage. And each time we get a chance to clarify and educate either for us or civic leaders who are confused about it, we find an opportunity to do so. But it will take quite a while for people to understand what trustee looks like. I'll close and give you my pseudo-legal point though, that as a trustee, we don't have the rights to reach in and touch the properties or change the rules of the engagement on the escrow. It's our responsibility to execute as the law would have us and to do that within the bounds of whatever the construct of the trustee relationship is. It's not ours to overreach or to step in and fix something we weren't asked to do, despite the temptation by, sometimes, people who want us to do that. So we'll deal with the confusion. And the more times people give us a chance to clarify, the more times we'll take it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You've obviously been outgrowing the industry in the loans. You've talked about some NIM pressure going forward. When you put it all together, do you think you can still grow net interest income dollars from here?", "Andrew Cecere", "I think the short answer to that, Matt, is yes. So our NIM pressure was principally related to our increase in our securities portfolio, and that's true on a year-over-year as well as linked quarter basis. We took advantage of our long cash position this quarter to accelerate some of our purchases. But I think we're going to remain fairly stable in that securities portfolio going forward. And we have a good amount of debt at higher costs rolling off in the second half of the year, so that'll create some stabilization. As I mentioned, I expect us to be down a few basis points in the second quarter, but then I expect some stabilization.", "Richard K. Davis", "Let me also add, Matt, that I know this would be the case for everybody. But as well as we're doing on loan growth, we're doing even better in commitment growth. And while that doesn't show up in the balance sheet, it shows up in the future. And I think you're all going to be very pleased that whenever the robust economy comes back, and it will, we're going to stand to enjoy a second round of, I think, a comparative benefit because the commitment growth is so significant and yet to be tapped because utilization stays flat. We're actually quite optimistic that to answer your question with a strong yes.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then separate topic, in terms of buybacks and just capital return overall. Not that I'm looking for a specific price in which you'd be buying back stock but you have had some banks come out and say, \"We'll be aggressive buyers up to here.\" And I'm just wondering conceptually, one, how you think about valuation? And then two, one could make the argument that maybe special dividends, over time, might make more sense. So how do you just think about balancing that over time?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. Matt, this is Andy. As you know, the trade-off with the buyback is buying back the stock at times 0, or the cash flows at times 0 plus 1 and forward. And we do have a specific view on that. We look at that every month in the perspective of our company. And we have a very good view on the future. At this price, we are still buying back our stock. And there is a price well above the level we are at today that we would have consideration about holding back a bit, but we're not to that level now. So we're very comfortable buying back at today's price. We're also comfortable with the balance between dividends and buybacks, because it gives us the opportunity to move in terms of buybacks up or down, give other opportunities in the marketplace that we talked about before.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Penala with BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is on home equity classification on the credit side. I know this is a much smaller piece of your pie, but we saw from larger banks an increase in problem loans as they reclassified some of their seconds that are still paying as the first is in trouble. Did you stick to that cost, or did you also stick to that same classification this quarter? Or is that already reflected in your numbers?", "Richard K. Davis", "Erika, I'm going to have Bill answer the technical issue. But for us, I just want to highlight, it is very, very small, and the numbers that you've seen from some of the larger banks are significantly greater than. So for us, we're talking $15 million to $30 million, well below the $1 billion-plus that you've seen elsewhere. And so for us, we believe that the classification we have today is accurate and reflects appropriately, and we did do some actions last quarter that Bill can talk about. But I'll also say that if we discover that there's a prevailing view on how things should be handled, then we can do that. But if you look at our nonperforming loans, they improved by almost 8% linked quarter. If we were taking that $15 million to $30 million, they would've improved by 7%. So just to reiterate, the immateriality of it and the fact that it's not a big number is important for me to highlight. And, Bill, you might talk a little deeper dive.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. So I mean, if -- our home equity portfolio has 2 distinguishing features. One, a lot of it is -- about $5 billion of it is actually lines that are in the first lien position, so there's not even another loan to look at, so obviously, that's very high quality. And then those that we do service, about 30% of the portfolio, that's where that $15 million, $30 million comes from. So it's just not a material number. The other part of what that reclassification was about was really on the reserving side, and that's, I'd argue, the more important side. And we'd implemented that sometime last year. So we feel very comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves on home equity.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just to veer into another topic. Richard, could you give us a sense or an update on your ability to reprice the deposit product in 2012 on the retail side? I know a lot of banks had talked about mitigation efforts sort of in the first half of last year in anticipation of debit interchange reform. And just wanted to get a sense on how some of the fee transfer to the consumer is panning out this year.", "Richard K. Davis", "Erika, we've said that of the total loss of revenue that was derived by CARD Act, Reg E and Durbin, that we would eventually get to 50% of that back. And I think we said we were at 30% last time. Our plan is to get to that 50% by year's end, and I also said it won't be before year's end because we're going to be very thoughtful about this. But I'm comfortable we can do it. And in doing so, there's a couple things. One is market share gain really helps a lot. You can improve your fee revenue by just having more customers who are paying the current fees that you offer and feel good about that, with our Checking With Choice and some of the way we packaged our products, people are seemingly happy to pay those fees and get the services we provide, especially some of the things we're adding to the capabilities, like mobile and more technology. I would say, however, there will also be some increases in certain fee categories that we will continue to provide because we need to do that to return to the shareholders what they've been waiting for. But we had to be very thoughtful about market positions, and we are not a one-size-fits-all. We have basically business in every state. We have 25 states where our consumer business is located. And if we have to have 168 different solutions for that many different pricing markets, which is how many we have, we would do that. So we're going to be very careful and thoughtful and look at where the market competition will allow us to increase the current fees. And we're really going to go after with some market share grab and competing to have more customers that pay what we think is a fair assessment for the service we provide. Nothing magic. And what I did say is we will get to that 50%. We'll use the whole year to get there. I'm not rushing it. We've got a good momentum everywhere else. And I'm not going to mess up what's happening right now and the good momentum we have in the branches where they're getting more customers, deeper relationships and not putting them through the fits and starts of having to decide what prices we change all the time, because we're very consistent and I wanted to give them that benefit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just a broader question. You guys are executing well. Your profitability ratio is within the targeted ranges. Kind of wondering where do you think you're still under-earning, whether it's low interest rates or mitigating some of the reg reform, where are areas that you can improve the profitability over the next couple years?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, the best part of the story, and I mean, the best part of the story is that we're just so not finished getting great at what we already do. So hard as it is to talk about organic growth and pursuit of investments from prior periods, that's really what the story is all about. And in fact, John, the recent quarter 1 2012 was as good as it was, was because of things we did in third quarter 2010 and the commitments we're making through employee engagement and technology. So I would tell you, we hit our peak in capital investments in 2010, but we'll have to continue to work that off. Our investments in the first 5 years of 2001 to 2006 were 45% less than they were in the last 5 years of 2006 to 2011. So we've spent quite a bit of money, with your all's knowledge and permission, to reinvest in the company, and that's starting to show up in capital. Acquisitions are all accretive, most of the time on day 1, and I think those continue to show as beneficial. But this last part is organic growth. And I know it's so unexciting to talk about, but it's exactly what's happening here. And so from Wealth Management building out to become a national first-class wealth manager, to adding our new Ascent ultra-high net worth business, which is only a couple of quarters old, to this amazing buildout you've seen us take to a national level on our Corporate Banking capabilities and then adding our payment skills across the globe and our consumer retail bank and small business now taking altogether new levels of performance. Add it all up, and that's what you get. So I think on top of that, a stock market that's actually, at best, kind of flattish and interest rates, which we all know are as low as they're going to be, we've got upside on every single cylinder. And if this is an 8-cylinder car, we're running at about 4.5 right now. So if you like what you see now, just wait until things start getting better. I think there's nothing but upward bias toward what we can do the old-fashion organic way.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. Richard, that's helpful. Maybe a question for Bill. Where are you on the kind of cycle of reserve release, and how do you see that playing out over the next couple quarters? And then also, if you could just comment, what drove the higher reserve build for the rep in warranty? Is that due to higher origination volume or something else?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. So the reserve release, I mean, we're in the point of the credit cycle where we'll continue to get credit improvement, probably for another 18 months. We have Commercial Real Estate assets that still need to be resolved, and that's going to take some time. And some of the residential mortgage portfolios are still stressed, so that's going to take time. But the improvement is slowing. I mean, some of our portfolios are performing at extremely good credit levels. Credit cards, auto's doing extremely well. So you're not going to see a lot more improvement in those areas. I think of the reserve release as something that will -- it will continue, but at a lower level. That will continue to decline.", "Andrew Cecere", "And, John, this is Andy. Regarding the mortgage question, the principal reason for that was the recent changes from the GSEs in terms of increasing their sampling size. So I would not expect a significantly higher quarter-to-quarter loss rate, but perhaps a longer or more extended period. And that's why we have a higher reserve level.", "Richard K. Davis", "And -- yes, John, let me just add because God knows I've got to speak if you guys speak. It's only fair. I want to remind you that as you saw our charge-offs hit a level of 1.09%, we've said to all of you for a long time that over the cycle, this is a probably 1% charge-off bank, especially because of our credit card size. We're hitting that 1%. We're hitting close to it, and I predict we'll go below it. And my goal is to do our best to make sure that our reserves, within accounting rules, stay to a place where we don't have to rebuild them all back later on. As an industry, I'm arguing for that as well because I think we've learned a lesson and we don't want to do that. But you have to appreciate that I think Bill and I both think that 1.09% goes to 1% and probably falls under that for a little while, not as a goal necessarily, but over the time and term of our long history, we think that we'll be at 1%, and we're getting very close to that.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then one just follow-up for Andy. To the extent there's a nuance change in the GSE sampling behavior, is that them looking at a wider range of indices, Andy, or putting -- trying to put back stuff that's been paying for longer? Any color on that?", "Andrew Cecere", "It's just, John, just going deeper in the loans that we're looking at and going back further. So it's deeper and further in terms of the sampling size. And there's going to be -- the more you look at, the more you may find, and that's why we increased the reserve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Question sort of asked, but maybe I'll ask in a slightly different way. So you're 109 basis points on the charge-off ratio this quarter and have given that long-term guidance of 1%. Richard, you've said in prior calls you expected to dip below that 1% level. That sort of looks likely now for next year. Any thoughts as to how far you might dip below that level as you sort of continue to clean up credit and we see this big decline that we're seeing now again this quarter in the delinquency trends? I mean, could we go down to 70 or 80 basis points at some point?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, yes. I mean, Ed, I don't know where we end up. When I say under 1%, I just want you all to know that it's probably going to be -- it's going to overperform for a little while there. It could be 90 basis points, could be high 80s. I don't know. It's not going to be 50 or anything like that. We're still making loans. We're still taking calculated risk, and you want us to do that. But we're also not -- what I'm also telegraphing to you is we're not going to start reaching into riskier categories. We're not going to start underwriting more aggressively. We're not worried about protecting our position as one of the larger market share growers in the credit. We're doing it the way we're doing it, and we're not going to change. So I'm also telegraphing to you that we're not expecting it to get so pristine that you think we're missing opportunities. But I do think this a high-quality book. The stress test would have said so each time they do it. And I think you guys should be comfortable that if we fall below 1%, it's not a goal. It happens to be an outcome. But our goal is to manage this company right around 1% because that, we think, is the right level of risk and reward.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then secondarily, if I add back the repurchase provision on mortgage side, I think I'm getting to a mortgage gain on sale, sort of gross number of about 230 basis points on the production. First of all, is that about -- do you agree with that? And then second of all, what are your thoughts on how long that can last or the pace that, that might decline, over what time frame? Or we all know that's a very wide number, but I think we're all struggling with how quickly and over what time frame that declines.", "Andrew Cecere", "Ed, so the production gain is based on net applications net of a projected fall-out number, so it's closer to 200 basis points in terms of the math. And it is wider than I would expect it to continue in forward quarters, but we are enjoying robust business in our Mortgage group as we talked about. We're taking share, and we're expanding our capabilities. So I would expect it, the second quarter, to have another strong quarter in Mortgage, and it's hard for me to see beyond that right now because there's just too much uncertainty out there.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "But at least for the second quarter, it looks like another quarter in terms of very wide gain on sales spread?", "Andrew Cecere", "Our pipelines continue to be strong. There might be some slowdowns just given the -- about 75% of our first quarter activity was refinanced activity. I would expect that to slow somewhat given that rates have stabilized, but the pipeline continues to be strong.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. But that's more of a comment on volume. I'm just talking about the gain on sales spread.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, in the first few months of the quarter here, I would expect it to continue strong.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Two quick questions on loans. Number one, Commercial Real Estate is an area that's started to grow again a little bit for you guys, and just wanted to understand how much of that is still moving over from the C&D book versus opportunities that you're starting to see in the marketplace? How is CRE looking as far as maybe the next part of the loan book to pick up, and where are you guys in terms of your aggressiveness in that market?", "P. W. Parker", "This is Bill. The -- it's not really moving over from the construction and development. That continues to decline. So the growth we've been picking up is more in stabilized properties. And they're going to be Class A properties, a lot of them with our institutional investors. We have a pretty high-quality group of clientele that our Commercial Real Estate group has enjoyed many years of performance with, and that's where we pick up the loan growth.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, in fact -- Ken, it's Richard. It's unremarkable in where it's coming from. It's remarkable it's coming from everywhere. And I think also the buildout of our Corporate Bank capabilities, as you've been hearing about for the last couple of years, make us more of a one-stop shop for some of these larger real estate national companies that have used us now for higher positions, allowed us to be in the deals longer, have used us for capital market capabilities. So for us, it's just like I said in the beginning, it's everywhere. It's a little bit of every category and I think it's the flight to quality that we continue to enjoy that I don't know how long that lasts. But every time we get to talk to you, it's still there, and we'll enjoy it until it's not.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And my second question just relates to just loan pricing. Obviously, yields came down a little bit in both C&I and CRE. I just want -- if you had some anecdotes to share in terms of how you see loan pricing across the markets and across the commercial products.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, this is Andy. We've talked about the fact, the last few quarters, that loan spreads have stabilized. And I would say that continues to be the case in the first quarter. There are pockets of increased competition, particularly in the commercial area and maybe a little bit below that. But overall, commercial wholesale loan spreads are stable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I had a quick follow-up question on the pushbacks. You talked about increased sample size from the GSEs, a change in policy. Can you just add more color to that?", "Andrew Cecere", "I don't know how else to define it other than they're looking at more loans, both from the perspective of the depth of the categories as well as the time frame. So if they were looking at 10 loans before, they're looking at 12 now for whatever period, and that's it. So we applied a similar expectation on that increased sample size. It could be that the increased sample size will result in actually a lower loss expectation. We just don't know until we get through the data.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the loan portfolio, which has grown very nicely for you guys. But one of the areas that has grown is residential, and I think part of that's probably because or your market share increase in the Mortgage Banking space. Is that mainly jumbo loans, or is any of that 30-year conforming product?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. There's definitely jumbos; that primarily come through our private client channels. So we do book those jumbo loans that are not GSE qualified. And then the other area of origination is out of our branches, and we have -- it's a refi product only. Average loan size is less than $100,000. These are low loan-to-value first-mortgage refinance originations out of our branch. So those are the 2 main categories.", "Andrew Cecere", "And those are likely to have a life of 10 to 15 years. Schedule of 10 to 15 versus 30 years.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And what type of yield?", "Andrew Cecere", "The spreads on those are probably 50 to 75 basis points above what you might expect from a GSE qualified.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then one last question on HARP. I know there's been a lot of media reports, and we've been publishing a lot of stuff about how HARP is better than expectations. And as April 1, I believe, banks like you can start to pick at other servicing portfolios with somewhat limited reps and warrants. I just wondered, are you going to continue to try take market share and maybe go after some of these loans and other portfolios?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, we'll -- first of all, I'll just comment that our HARP volume has been pretty strong. We had about a 47% application increase quarter-over-quarter, so we have seen a good HARP refi production. Hard to say how aggressive we'll be on going after the other people's business. I mean, we've been very active in our own portfolio, and we'll continue to be active on our own portfolio. That's our first priority.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up on Ed's earlier question. So what -- if you're 200 basis point mortgage gain on sale now, what would be typical? And again, why is it greater than average? And it's not just you. It's the whole industry.", "Andrew Cecere", "Typical, Mike, would be somewhere between 125 and 125 (sic) [150]. It's higher right now because there's so much demand in the marketplace, and there's a fairly long -- healthy pipeline. And the number of suppliers in the marketplace is down. So it's just a function of supply and demand in the current market, and that gives us some pricing opportunity.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And did you mean 125 to 150 is normal?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, correct.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And who are you getting share from in your pursuit to be the top 5?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, we're already there actually. I was just being generous. We're taking it from the large -- some of the larger guys ahead of us. There's a couple of large banks that are backing it down on that business and just not putting their energy into resources. And then on the other side, there are some smaller partners that are getting out of the business and looking like they're trading. So it's exactly what you see, Mike. I don't have to name names, but you know who's in it big and who's growing and you know who's either backing down or not very present. And we're getting it from there.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then switching to your Corporate Banking buildout which you've talked a lot about. But when I look linked quarter, period-end commercial loans without commercial leases are up 18% annualized. And we can look at average, and average is up 15% annualized. However, you want to slice that, that's a big number. And my question relates to how much of that growth is due to syndicated lending, and how much of that growth is due to purchases of loans?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, we are -- I mean, in the large corporate space, you're going to be active in the syndicated market, and that complements our corporate bond issuance area. So that is a piece of it, but we're also active in the middle market. So our middle market group is included in those statistics. We have a ABL unit that's enjoyed nice growth. So it's really across the board.", "Richard K. Davis", "And, Mike, we haven't done much to buy. We're not big acquirers of somebody else's loans. There've been a couple of deals we've looked at. We pass on almost everything that you see in the public market. And if there's a deal, we'll cherry-pick a loan or 2. It'll have to mostly be a customer we already know and just a position and a hold level we're willing to take, but it's not a growth strategy for us to go acquire portfolios. If they come along, we'll look at everything, but we are not as hungry for some of those deals as some others are.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, as you pointed out, your profitability ratios are within your targeted range. But are you leaving money on the table by not having a greater variety of capital market features to give your clients, especially with your Corporate Banking buildout?", "Richard K. Davis", "O-M-G, no. And I say that because we like -- we only do what we understand and that we can control. And as trite as it sounds, I really like the consistent, predictable, repeatable business we've given you all. I thought you were going to ask if we're going to stop at 16 and 1.6, and that would be no way either. Are you kidding? But we love what we are because I think you can count on it and you can -- it's an annuity. And you can watch it grow, and you can watch it adjust if you don't see any big surprises. And adding to some of those additional opportunities are not hurting us at all because we've got all the ones we wanted to in the last few years by building out our Wholesale Bank and capital markets, nothing left we covet. There's nothing we don't have that we want, and there's nothing we have now that we don't want to keep. So what you see is what you're going to get for quite a while.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Richard, a question for you. We still are yet to find out about the G-SIFI. We kind of know what it is, but not really. Volcker is yet to come. Are there any other major regulatory pieces outside whatever the CFPB may do that we're waiting for?", "Andrew Cecere", "Nancy, this is Andy. Only one I -- that I know we're all watching is the final LCR ratio. There's a definition out there today. I know there's some discussion occurring with Basel and the Fed in terms of potential adjustments to that. We've built a lot of liquidity on balance sheet. And whatever those final ratios are will guide us to whatever we finalize from the securities portfolio, but that would be the only other one I could think of.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. Nancy, I was about to say, \"No, I don't think so.\" And then I'm getting the eye cross from Andy like, we have one thing. But let me say what I would characterize. Between Volcker, Dodd-Frank, CFPB, as it relates to the financial impacts to our company and to shareholders, substantially, most of that has already been seen by those other activities of Reg E and Durbin and CARD Act and things like that. Now it'll change the course of how we run the company because we'll have to maybe dot our i's and cross our t's twice. We'll have to confirm certain behaviors. We built our capital markets business knowing that the Volcker Rules were going to change. Dodd-Frank, at just probably 65% of Dodd-Frank will touch our company, and the big majority of it's going to be more paperwork transactions and managing the details, but not the financials. And CFPB, I remain optimistic that it hasn't done anything I haven't seen yet to argue with, and we'll watch and see to see how they perform. But I think if their original true goal of being transparent, clear and helping customers understand what they bought, we're going to be in great shape there. If they get into things like price fixing and things like that, then we'll deal with that when we face it. And it'll affect everybody, and as usual, probably affect us a lot. But for now, I think, we're, as a management team, keeping our eye on so many things but not sitting here worrying about the peril that it will create for the investment that you guys have in our company. And if it's a deal, we'll manage it like we have before and we'll find an offset.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "So you think the regulatory regime, as we see it right now, is pretty much what we get going forward?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, I think the details are -- yes, I've got the canvas. I've seen the paint on the side, but no one's has painted it yet. But I mean, I don't think there's a hidden trap door that -- of any significance that we can't at least predict or work within as the next couple of years go forward. But as you know, I mean, Dodd-Frank's only 25%, 33% done. Volcker's got a lot of TBDs, and CFPB is new. So I'm not saying it's at all known or done, but I'm telling you what I think. Its worst-case scenarios are something we can manage.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "And, Richard, would you care to make an intrepid prediction about when you might get the ability to make or to decide capital actions without going through the CCAR, et cetera, et cetera? I mean, are we at a point now over the next several years where capital actions are done once a year based upon the results of the CCAR, or is that going to change?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, Nancy, I really don't have any facts around it to offer. But I would say we're going to learn a couple things this year, because we know there are a couple of our peers that are seeking midyear capital actions based on what they didn't get in the CCAR. And I think that will inform all of us because we have no evidence that it will be anything less than an annual activity. And then I also am betting that it will take a few more years, few meaning more than 1 or 2, for the global regulators to believe that banks can manage themselves without oversight. But I think the stress test is an annual event that makes sense. And as long as the rules are understood and we know how to participate in predicting our own outcome and make our own decisions that are hopefully approved, I don't think it becomes a burden all but one that we all just have an extra step than we had before. But I think in terms of annual nature, I think we're about to learn that this year some of our folks have -- for a midyear correction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the commitments. You called out the 5% q-on-q growth in CRE and C&I. I'm just wondering, you've been having nice commitment growth for a while now. How long does the commitments take to translate into outstandings?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, currently, forever. I mean, really, our commitment levels, just to give you an idea, when I give you 25%, this is for the large corporate and middle market clients. So it's not credit card. It's not consumer. It's not even small business. Back in 2009, that was 37%, right. So 37% of $65 million was used as a line of credit. Last quarter, we have 25% of $90 billion. So while the growth -- the actual loans outstanding are virtually flat, the increase in the outstandings open to buy is remarkable. So I got to tell you, in a recession, it really is. I have no idea how long it will take. But what I know is when it happens, it'll be amazingly quick. And you guys can watch us like a Doppler radar. The first thing that happens when companies start getting ready to move is the cash balances get used. And then the line of credit gets used and then new loans are made. And so we are still at record levels of deposit held based on companies being strong enough right now and kind of husbanding cash until they know what to do with it. And that's the first, I think, canary in the mine that says, no one's actually taking any big steps at this point in time. But they are getting those lines of credit, Betsy. And they're planning to use them, I suspect, because they're paying for them, and it gives them a lot of alternatives. And I think the country's business community is much stronger than people think it is because they are cash rich. They are line of credit capable, and they're ready to jump when something comes along. We just need that trigger event, and I don't see it on the near term, but surely it will happen because of the cycle.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. I see the macro numbers in your release. I just wondered if you, in tracking individual companies that you're extending commitments to, is that translating into loan growth at all over the last year or so? And I guess your answer is not yet.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. Not yet. And it's a great question because if I -- I would tell you, if that 25% was a few companies that are 100% and the rest at 0, that would be information. But it's not. It's the average company has a line of credit and uses a part of it, and then the rest they leave open to buy. And so for us, this represents a behavior, a consistency, but an absolute growth opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Ketron from UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. One, the of course, commercial loan growth has continued at a very impressive pace, and maybe some color -- it looks like you would be getting market share, and maybe some color on the strategies that you're undertaking to approach the wholesale or commercial lending business.", "Richard K. Davis", "Sure. This is Richard. Warning, here comes something else that sounds not that exciting. We work on advocacy. And we've been training all of our lenders, many of whom have been doing this for 30 years, on a special training program we created here in our company on customer advocacy. And that is, Greg, code word for building deeper relationships and having the entire company available informationally to a customer when we meet with them. So we're not -- we don't have the relationship manager now calling on a line of credit, talking about line of credit, praying for a line of credit and coming back home. This relationship manager is working with an entire team doing pre-call activities, bringing the right people out to the client, selling the entire company, if not now, later, and getting a lot of market from other places. So the relationship depth we have is intensely higher than it was before. And to answer a question about 45 minutes ago, amazingly still, an infant in its growth opportunity. So what we're doing now is just getting started on a new way of taking market share. Our guys figured out that flight to quality is a real deal. It translates to new business. So telling the story better helps us do a better job. And so it's really training and making the entire company available through every relationship manager. See, I told you it wasn't going to sound exciting. But I'll tell you what, it's a big deal and it's a big change from where we were a few years ago.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This has legs that could run for beyond next couple of quarters if it's...", "Richard K. Davis", "That's right. This has years of legs because it's got nothing but upside. And again, if you like what you see now, just imagine what we can do when we really get good at it.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And, Andy, a question for you on the margin. On the liability side, what remaining opportunities do you have, such as may be debt restructuring or elimination, that may help support the margin through the rest of this year?", "Andrew Cecere", "We have some TGLP paper coming off here in the May-June time frame. And then in total, if you think about the second half of the year, another $7 billion to $9 billion of higher-cost debt rolling off, some of which will be replaced, some of which will be sort of re-substituted with deposit growth that we're enjoying. So that benefit will start to show in the margin in the second half.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So you'll see your cost come out of debt that will be replaced with lower-cost funding sources?", "Andrew Cecere", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Chris Gamaitoni with Compass Point.", "Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "I just had 2 questions, one around deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits looked like they decline about 5% quarter-over-quarter and that looks to be mostly in the community bank, small community bank segment. Can you just give a little color on that? Is that people becoming more comfortable and willing to spend and thinking about their current position?", "Andrew Cecere", "I would attribute more of it to seasonality, typical seasonality related to tax activity and just first quarter spend. So I don't think there's so much of a decline or utilization as much as the seasonal impacts.", "Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the deposit service accounts charges, they were down 10%, 10.5% quarter-over-quarter. It was attributed to seasonality. I haven't seen the same trends across other banks. Is there a geography issue or a business change that's impacting that?", "Andrew Cecere", "There is no geography issue. There are fewer days, business days, in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, and that's the principal reason for the decline and the key driver of that number.", "Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to clarify a statement. You talked about a significant increase in HARP volume. Was that HARP 1.0 or was that HARP 2.0?", "P. W. Parker", "We implemented 2.0 in the first quarter, so it'll be some of both.", "Operator", "I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Davis for closing remarks.", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, obviously, thank you, guys, for your continued support. The questions were great, and they helped us clarify what's on your mind. I'd also ask you to remain optimistic about this economy. I mean, it's starting to show some real signs of permanent but slow recovery. And we're going to be watching every step of it and being engaged in part of it. And hopefully, the banks in America will get a little more credit for the kind of good work we're going do to help get America back on its feet. So spread the good word. That's what I would say, and thanks for your interest in our company.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Yes. Thank you, all, for listening.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday July 25, at midnight. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Holly, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Judy, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our record quarterly results with you this morning, and I'll begin with the highlights on Page 3 of our presentation.", "U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2012 or $0.71 per diluted common share. Total net revenue was higher by 8.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 6.6% growth in net interest income and 9.7% growth in fee revenue.", "As importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. The total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 7.7% and 1.9% respectively, and we experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits -- strong growth in total average deposits of 10.5% over the prior year and 1.3% linked quarter. Credit quality continued to improve as net charge-offs declined by 8.9% from the prior quarter and non-performing assets decreased in total by 6.9% or 12.3% including covered assets.", "We generated significant capital this quarter through earnings and ended the quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 8.8% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.7%.", "We repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share buyback total to 29 million shares. Since the beginning of the year, we have returned 62% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 4. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.67%, and return on average common equity was 16.5%. Our company's long-term goal is to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Both performance ratios are within their respective ranges.", "Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.58% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year and, as expected, a few basis points lower than the prior quarter. And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 51.1%, lower than both the prior year and previous quarter, and we expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s.", "Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.1 billion, an increase of 8.1% over the prior year's quarter and 2.8% higher than the previous quarter. The company's net revenue benefited from growth in both our balance sheet and fee-based business lines. And mortgage banking and payments were particularly strong this quarter.", "Our growth in average loan and deposit balances is shown on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $15.3 billion or 7.7% year-over-year. As expected, linked quarter growth in an average total loans accelerated slightly from the previous quarter as balances grew 1.9% compared with the first quarter's linked quarter growth of 1.5%.", "Excluding covered loans, our runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 10% year-over-year and 2.4% linked quarter. The increase in average loans outstanding was primarily due once again to strong growth in commercial loans, which grew by 23.2% year-over-year and 6% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans also showed strong growth, 19.6% over the same quarter of last year and 3.5% over the prior quarter. Consumer lending was more muted, with the exception of auto loans and leases, which have been showing solid growth for a number of quarters.", "We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments total over $45.5 billion this quarter.", "Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 24.3% and 3.7% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remains fairly consistent at approximately 25%. This increase in commitments, coupled with the quarter's strong commercial loan growth, indicates that we're continuing to gain market share.", "Total average deposits increased by $21.9 billion or 10.5% over the same quarter of last year, while total average deposits grew by $3 billion on a linked quarter basis or 1.3%.", "Turning to Slide 7, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter declined by 8.9% from the first quarter of 2012, while non-performing assets decreased by 6.9%, or 12.3%, including covered assets. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.98%, improving from the 1.09% recorded in the first quarter and now below the 1% through this cycle net charge-off rate that we expect given the current mix of our loan portfolio.", "Turning to Slide 8. As the graph on the left illustrates, early- and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, improved again this quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 8, you will see that the positive trend in criticized assets also continued. Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge-offs and non-performing assets will once again trend modestly lower in the third quarter of 2012.", "Given the second quarter's improvement in credit quality and our expectation that this improvement will continue going forward, we released $50 million of reserves compared with $90 million in the first quarter and $175 million in the second quarter of last year.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our second quarter 2012 results compared to various comparable time periods. Record diluted EPS of $0.71 was 18.3% higher than the second quarter of 2011 and 6% higher than the prior quarter.", "Slide 10 lists the key drivers of the company's second quarter earnings. The $212 million or 17.6% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of an 8.1% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 7.3% increase in noninterest expense.", "Net interest income increased year-over-year by $169 million or 6.6%. The increase was largely driven by a $26.2 billion or 9.4% increase in average earning assets, in addition to strong growth in low-cost deposits.", "The growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio and growth in average total loans, as well as loans held for sale, partially offset by a lower cash position at the Fed.", "A net interest margin of 3.58% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the expected increase in lower-yielding investment securities and a decrease in loan yields, partially offset by lower cash balances at the Fed and lower deposit costs.", "Noninterest income increased by 9.7% year-over-year. Mortgage banking revenues was very strong again this quarter as production increased by 150% year-over-year and gain on sale margins improved. These positive variances in mortgage banking and several other major categories were partially offset by a 17.8% decrease in credit and debit card fees due to legislative changes to debit card interchange. Offsetting the impact of this unfavorable change in debit card fees was legislative-related mitigation activity, including the final elimination of the unused rewards and higher overall transaction volumes.", "Noninterest expense was higher year-over-year by $176 million or 7.3%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits expense, an increase in professional services primarily due to foreclosure review and other expense, which included an accrual related to the Visa settlement. This accrual accounts for the temporary reduction interchange included in the settlement terms.", "Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $77 million or 5.8%. This favorable variance was the result of a 2.8% increase in net revenue and a 2.3% decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in noninterest expense.", "On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $23 million or just under 1%. Average earning assets grew by $3.7 billion, and net interest margin was, as expected, 2 basis points lower than the prior quarter, as the negative impact from the repricing of the investment securities portfolio and slightly lower loan yields were offset by a reduction in cash balances at the Fed and the positive impact from repricing of maturing debt.", "The average balance on our investment securities portfolio was $73.2 billion in the second quarter, $10.2 billion higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $1.7 billion higher than the previous quarter.", "During the second quarter, we transferred approximately $12 billion of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, reflecting our intention to keep these securities until maturity and subsequently reducing the volatility of OCI going forward. Assuming stable cash balances and the current Basel III liquidity requirements, we expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters.", "Also, given the net interest rate environment, we expect net interest margin to be fairly stable in the second half of 2012, as repricing pressure on the securities portfolio is offset by the benefit of a reduction in funding cost as higher-cost debt matures and is replaced by lower-price debt and/or deposits.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $116 million or 5.2%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of strong growth in payments and mortgage banking as well as increases in the majority of other fee categories. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $41 million or 1.6%, primarily due to the Visa settlement accrual and mortgage servicing review project, partially offset by lower marketing business development expense.", "Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. We have included estimates of our Tier 1 common equity-to-risk-weighted asset ratio using the Basel III proposed rules published both before and after June 7. Based on our preliminary assessment of the full impact of the proposed rules for the Basel III standardized approach released for comments in June, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was approximately 7.9% at June 30 versus the 8.4% estimated at March 31 under the prior proposal.", "The reduction in our estimated ratio was primarily the result of an increase in risk-weighted assets under the newly proposed rules of approximately 7%. At 7.9%, we are both well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement but slightly below our targeted ratio of approximately 8%, which includes a cushion for a yet-to-be-defined SIFI buffer and our own internal buffer. We expect to reach our target ratio during the third quarter.", "Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balance at June 30 was $164 million, compared with $134 million at March 31.", "As you may recall, we increased our mortgage reps and warranty reserve in the first quarter of 2012 in response to changes we had seen in the GSE sampling method. During the second quarter of 2012, we accrued $45 million and believe the level of reserves at June 30 is appropriate. We continue to expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. So to conclude our formal remarks, let me turn your attention to Slide 13. The momentum continues this quarter and hopefully beyond. We grew our balance sheet and customer base and we gained market share. We grew net revenue, we achieved record earnings and industry-leading performance metrics for the quarter, as well as positive operating leverage. We continue to invest in our businesses, and we saw our credit quality continue to improve. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong and they're growing. And we've returned 62% of our earnings year-to-date to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.", "Our company continues to invest for the long term in our diverse and stable mix of businesses, products and services and in our employees and in the communities that we serve. Consistent, predictable and repeatable. Our straightforward approach to doing business has allowed to deliver industry-leading performance and returns to our shareholders, and we look forward to doing more of the same during the rest of 2012 and the years to come.", "That concludes our formal remarks, Andy, Bill Parker and I will be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala, Bank of America.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is for Andy. Could you walk us through, in terms of the components, margin stability for the back half of the year? And I guess, my more detailed question underneath that is, could you give us a sense of how much debt is maturing in the second half and at what rate and what replacement rate you're assuming, as well as, I notice on an end-of-period basis, the cash balances were actually up, what size bond portfolio you're assuming for the rest of the year?", "Andrew Cecere", "Okay, Erika. So the key moving parts are the negative is the investment securities reinvestment risk, and the offset to that is the debt repricing, which will be at a lower cost, replaced by either additional debt issuance and/or deposits. The differential of those 2 things is essentially causing us to be -- to have an expectation of neutrality in net interest margin for the rest of the year. In terms of the cash balance, Erika, any day there's fluctuations in that cash balances. And I'd like to look at it more at the average for the quarter, which was down from about $4 billion in the first quarter to about $1.5 billion in the second quarter. And again, the level of loan growth and deposit growth is fairly stable, as you saw in the second quarter. So I would expect a little movement around that but not substantial.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You don't happen to have the dollar number of the debt maturing and the rate at which it's maturing for the second half of the year, do you?", "Andrew Cecere", "I do have that. In the second quarter -- in the third quarter, we have about $6 billion maturing, and I would say the debt that's coming off versus what's coming on is favorable right around 100 basis points.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And my last question before I step away from the queue relates to CCAR. I guess perhaps it's too early to tell, but now that the NPR proposal is out, do you anticipate that the CCAR is going to take into account Basel III ratios rather than Basel I when thinking about approving capital return for the banks next year?", "Andrew Cecere", "Well as you know, Erika, the last CCAR actually took into consideration both Basel I and Basel III. It was Basel III under the stressed environment and -- Basel I under the stressed environment and Basel III under sort of the glide path. And I would expect a similar sort of set-up constraints in the new one next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom, RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A question for maybe Richard or Bill on Slide 7, the credit trends. Richard, you've talked about this concept of the industry over-earning in the past.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And just curious if you'd be willing to take a stab at going below 1%. How long does this phenomenon last and how low can the charge-offs potentially go for the company? Just kind of big picture would be helpful.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. I'll start and Bill can clean up. The 0.98% is about where I thought we'd be right about now because in the last few years, we and the others have not been taking much risk on lending, which is probably, at end of the day, what we are supposed to do but have to be very careful. I think that we stay below 100 basis points for a few quarters just because the math of it says that we don't have any loans that would be coming to some point of stress, I don\u2019t believe, in the next couple of quarters based on our prudent underwriting of the last year or so. I will say, you'll remember that we have a credit card, fairly important credit card book, that does affect our overall ratios, and that's probably the one that's coming now to its most nearest bottom, where it'll start to move up probably sooner than the rest of the portfolios. But for the rest of it, I think we're going to stay under 1 for a while. My hope is that based on appropriate accounting trends that we can continue to have a certain level of unallocated reserves remaining so that we don't find ourselves releasing reserves to a point of unsustainable performance only to have to build them back as things start to move up. I'll also close by saying I don't think the 0.98% falls to anything like 0.5 or 0.6. I think it floats around the high 8s and high, midpoint 9s, but it probably eventually gets above 1. And I'll actually be looking forward to that because that means we've been optimal in doing the right risk/reward balance and making sure that we're taking the right risks and rewards for our customers. But I would say it's another few quarters and not very aggressive in its movement from here. Bill, do you want to add?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, I'll just say, John, that how long it stays below 1 and how low it goes is in a large part a function of how strong the economy is. If it stays at this very moderate growth level, that's positive. But we wouldn't necessarily see that loss rate go way down, given the continued high unemployment rate. But if we do enter into a very robust economic growth and see unemployment go way down, see loan growth go way up, then clearly, we could get a much lower rate. But a large part of it remains a function of the economy.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow up on that, obviously, the pipelines are strong. But are you sensing any incremental borrower caution or any potential changes in activity between now and the end of the year?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, a little bit. This is Richard. I like to characterize things in quarters. So I think quarter 4 was a pretty strong ending as it related to our customers' sense of things. Quarter 1 remains strong for a quarter at the beginning of the year. And then quarter 2, I'd say the last month that quarter 2 started to taper off a bit in terms of appetite for risk. No surprise, but as you think about it, we're getting close to a number of moments. We're coming close to the election. We're coming closer to the fiscal cliff decision. We're certainly not getting better news from Europe as it relates to the confidence of our customers. And then the economy isn't strengthening. It's not falling apart, either. It's just not getting better. So I would say that we saw slight tempering in the end of quarter 2, and I think we'll continue to see that between now and the solution that is in the opting [ph] for any of those outcomes, particularly the election, the fiscal cliff, which at least have deadlines on them as we all know. For us, as it relates to our loan growth, we're 1.5% linked quarter in quarter 1, 1.9% for quarter 2. Our current forecast shows us pretty steady to that level where we've been right now. So I don\u2019t think we're going to see a ramp up, but we're certainly not seeing things go backwards. But our customers' behavior, both on their continued decision to take on commitments that they are not using and their caution in not extending themselves in places that they're not comfortable continues to remain. And that story is kind of just more of the same, with a slightly negative bias to their confidence.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I guess a couple of questions. First just generally on mortgage. Another pretty strong quarter, and you guys obviously have beefed up in that business pretty considerably over last couple of years or few years. So just curious, anecdotally your thoughts on how long it can stay strong given the rate environment and any additional opportunities you might see there.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. This is Rich. I'll go first. We know that this is an unsustainable moment in time because refis are so robust. They're about 2/3 of our originations right now. And with interest rates this low, they're not going to stay there forever. So we're going to continue to enjoy the benefits that accrue to a high-quality producer like we are with a good brand, and we're not going to withhold any opportunities that come along. But we're not building this church for Easter. There are number of things we're doing to make sure that we have the right people and the right processes in place. But we're also building with a certain level of temporariness as things will eventually start to flatten out. I think our market share will continue to grow as it has as much for our own efforts as it has been the changing in the marketplace. And I think in the future, say, 3 years forward, when there is a more normalized environment, we should have very significant market share of a more traditional new home market business for which we will build an infrastructure that can withstand that and grow with it but not put ourselves over our skis at moments like this, where it's probably not sustainable. I'll have Andy talk a little more about the margins we're getting right now. And you're right, the pipeline is strong in quarter 3. It looks a lot like quarter 2.", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So you know, as Richard mentioned, about 70% of our activity in the first quarter was refinancing, and that dropped to low 60s in the second quarter. Gain-on-sale margins fell a bit from about 2.30% to about 2.18% from quarter 1 and quarter 2. So our expectation for quarter 3 is a similar volume, perhaps a little bit of further pressure on gain-on-sale margins. And then again, fourth quarter is going to depend a little bit about where rates are at that time.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. It's helpful. I appreciate that. And I just wanted to ask another question. You guys are in the journal, I guess it was yesterday or today on that Los Angeles lawsuit. And you've talked about sort of the market confusion regarding being a trustee versus actually owning some places when these lawsuits come up. I was just curious if you had any thoughts on that most recent one?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. I do. Besides the fact that I hate it, is the -- we don't own any of those properties. And it's a classic case of misinformation and the confusions created by the role of the trustee. The trust owns these RMBS. But in turn, they're owned by the investors, and we have a limited duty as a trustee. And in fact, we don't have any rights to go in and touch the properties. And while that doesn't pass the test in the public jury, it is accurate and it's the way the trustees were built. We have in this particular case since they had their bully pulpit yesterday for wholly incorrect information. I guess I have mine now to say that none of the information that they have provided was accurate. We've been working with them for 18 months to try to understand what they really wanted, and we're even willing, above the duties of our responsibility, to connect with the servicers and help try to figure out where these properties are falling into disrepair and to no avail. For the record, we have 46 of those properties in LA County, for which they were actually -- we can get our hands on, and U.S. Bank owns only 18 properties outright in the LA County that are foreclosed, and every single one of them, with pictures to evidence, are in good shape and in great repair. So we will continue to manage this through the courts and do our good duty of making sure that people understand the role of the trustee. But I think at this point, it's disappointing but it's not altogether surprising because, if it's not here, it's sometimes in bankruptcies or other places where the bank gets tagged as the owner or the creator of the problem, and we just have to go back through the right courses to explain our position. And usually we don\u2019t have to do that after a press conference, but we will have to do that this time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin, Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Richard, I was wondering if you give us a little more color on other parts of the loan book. I noticed that commercial mortgage grew a little faster this quarter. If you can walk us through that. And also your appetite for continuing to build the residential mortgage portfolio. I know it's a relatively still small percentage but just from an asset liability perspective, if you can give us some color on that.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, a little color on all of it. So our loan growth in the C&I market business was actually strong, and I'm happy to report across the board 6% linked quarter, and it was all the way from small business, including SBA, up to middle-market and all the way up to large corporate. In terms of markets, we said last time and we'll say it again, we're not seeing a real distinction across geographies except in commercial real estate, where the coasts are stronger for reasons that make sense, I think, than some of the markets in the Midwest. Our investment in all these businesses can continue to be attractive to me because it's an opportunity for us to slightly and quietly move market share get opportunities with business with other customers we haven't had before it. Namely, on the more corporate side, I would say our growth is first and foremost, our own new marketing efforts and being more -- invited to more opportunities, including syndicated deals and now the chance with Capital Markets to lead many of those deals. Second in order would be our own customers giving us more of their business, and third, and probably the diminishing level from prior quarters, would be the benefit of the European banks starting to retreat. In the other parts of the market it's just old-fashioned market share and customers giving us more business. And in Commercial Real Estate, it happens to be a business we're very good at. We have, as you know, from stress test results to prior quarters review, we have a very good book and an amazingly strong team. So that probably is a place where without a European benefit so much, we've been getting invited to a lot more opportunities because I think we said no to a lot of people in the last cycle, and as much as they might have hated it then, they're back saying, \"Look, you said no when it was easier to say yes and the fact is I suspect you're going to take care of me all the time because your best interest must be mine, so let's sit down and talk.\" And I'm going to continue to see growth in Commercial Real Estate, which is what I think you're seeing a bit latent. CRE is always late, last in and last out, and I think we're getting the benefit that we saw with C&I a couple of quarters later. So Bill, I'll stop there and turn it to you in terms of more color around the loan book.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. In terms of the mortgage, obviously, there's not a lot of construction activity other than multifamily. We do have a fairly robust multifamily construction pipeline. But on the mortgage side, we have a lot of large institutional customers, a lot of REITs. There's been a lot of repositioning of Class A properties, and we're more than willing and able to provide financing to those institutional clients for that mortgage category.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Got it. My second question, just to put it to the deposit side for a second. Continued good growth, and I'm just wondering, is it from new customer adds? Are you seeing any flight-to-quality benefit? And also just a little color on this broker/dealer list that you saw on the large time deposit category?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. It's across all those categories. We're seeing good growth in our retail customer base across the branches and savings account principally. The DDA growth is principally driven by wholesale as well as our Corporate Trust business, which is a great source of DDA deposits. And we have a very robust broker/dealer group that will have fluctuations up and down. But from a core basis, in terms of long-standing deposits, those are growing across the board.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And last little nitpicky one, just the professional services was up on some mortgage-related stuff that's been elevated in the past. Can you just explain that and then talk about like is this going to be just a continued kind of elevated type of expense that we're going to have to deal with just until all of the stuff is settled out?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, Ken. So that is principally due to the mortgage consent order review that many banks are facing. It's a third-party review that's going on. It cost us just over $50 million in the second quarter. We would expect a similar level in the third quarter and then start to fall off in quarter 4 and going into 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron, UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Richard, maybe a question for you on the Visa MasterCard litigation and maybe your view on that. It looked like you have accrued some charges for the quarter. But maybe how the settlement plays out for U.S. Bancorp, especially given the fact there could have been a larger negative overhang as the year progressed. And now it looks like, for the most part, it has been resolved.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. So I'll talk about a settlement that seemingly nobody likes. After 7 years, you would have thought we got that right. As you know, we are not a party to that directly, but we are influenced by the outcome. And in fact even if we were a party, we would have been allowing Visa and MasterCard to do our bidding. In this case, I think the settlement itself was acceptable because first and foremost, we have, like other banks, have a great deal of money reserved for this particular lawsuit for many years especially once they both became public companies. And that money for the most part was used for this and that's what we wanted it to be used for. The overhang of 10 basis points for 8 months, as you can see, we accrued for that, so that's now behind us. I do worry that it might pierce the veil in terms of what merchants will want to do on month 9. So I think we need to keep our eyes open and make sure that, that satisfies the Court's requirement. And we will also have 8 months to see whether that money actually does get passed along to consumers or to retailers or where it goes. And then probably the trump card, Greg, biggest issue is the surcharging and the permission now that's granted. As you know, AMEX doesn't have that opportunities. So it will be interesting to watch between those issuers, between MasterCard and Visa versus AMEX, how that plays out. And I do think it's very interesting and provocative to see what kind of actions the retailers will take because typically surcharging is a negative feeling and impact to consumers, and I would suspect that most of them probably won't jump on it. Lastly, and you know what I've read, but there -- it's not final. They still have an opt-out opportunity, so it'll be interesting if all the large merchants and some of the chains of, say, the fast food chains or the convenience store chains, all accept this or not because it may in part be just a starting point to the continuing saga that's now 7 years old. So I don\u2019t expect it to be conclusive. I think we have a lot to watch. I actually appreciate the extra time we'll have even over the holidays to see how this all plays out. And it's not going to be hugely material to U.S. Bank. We're also an acquirer so at the end of the day, there is some counter hedging benefits to whatever the solution is. But I think it's a very instructive to watch. And it's very different than Durbin. It had nothing to do with congressional oversight. It had nothing to do with customers weighing in on it. This is a retailer versus card business, and I think it's got probably halfway through the game. We'll see how it goes in the next couple of months.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. I appreciate your insight. And Andy, on margin, when you look at the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, it was down about 43 basis points for the second quarter. Do you think there's appreciably more room to down price as we work our way through the rest of this year and into 2013?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, Greg, there's some room. You think about that average, that includes some deposits that are very low. Some are between 3 and 5 basis points, and then some are well above the 40 basis points. And the opportunity would be for those set of deposits that are above 40, and we still have some room there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby, Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question -- 2 questions about this overall economic activity. If you're looking at -- just curious on Page 6. If you look at the deposit growth and you kind of work from third quarter to second quarter, we're seeing deposit growth go from 18% down to 10.5%. On the other side, you got loan growth growing up from 5% to almost 8%. So the gap between those, while we're not seeing a big shift in dollars, the growth rate gap is closing. That's gone from about 13% down to about 3%. And I just know given the kind of position you all have in the marketplace and the growth that you're seeing on the revenue side, do you think that this is related to kind of some underlying tones to the economic activities?", "Andrew Cecere", "As we talked about, Marty, your observation is correct. The differential between loan growth and deposit growth is condensing so that they're almost at the same level now. So we are at the 1.09% and the 1.3% on a linked quarter, and in fact, flipping to loan growth being a little higher. So there was a period last year where there was very limited loan activity and tremendous deposit activity as particular corporations were building liquidity on their balance sheet, and effectively on our balance sheet. That seems to have slowed and sort of leveled out. So there's more of a balance right now, and that is sort of what we're anticipating going into the third quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And so it's not really the quick shift that we've seen in the past but maybe there's a slow boil that's kind of going on underneath?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. It isn't a massive change all in one quarter, but it is over many quarters shifting a little bit. That's correct.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Would you also say given your transaction processing business, what are you seeing in the activity levels there? Is it encouraging at all? Or is -- we had a nice uptick this quarter from seasonality, but how was that relative to your expectation?", "Richard K. Davis", "I'd say that in terms of same-store sales, Marty, we have both a good view of the whole domestic market and even a little peek into Europe given our position over there. But year-over-year sales for our Elavon business was up 2.2% and primarily led by government, financials and apparel. Without the airlines, which is a huge portfolio for us, it's up almost 3%. On the negative side, furnishings, consumer purchases and entertainment were on the downside, are negative. So what you're seeing is I think the reduction of a long, torturously long recession with a slow recovery, where people are spending on what they have to spend on but they're probably still lagging on spending on the more discretionary benefit. And for us, the 2.2% year-over-year growth is pretty much what we thought it would be and expecting it to probably be settling into the summer months, somewhere in that same range, not getting much better, not getting much weaker. And consumers are less affected by those issues I mentioned earlier like the election and the fiscal cliff. But as we get closer to those points in time, for better or for worse, they'll start to become more engaged in that dialogue and their actions and behaviors may be affected by it. But for now, we think it's pretty steady state.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just last question detail, you mentioned Visa accrual in a couple of places. In the press release, you say that noninterest expense was up $41 million primarily due to Visa. Can you -- what was the actual number for the Visa accrual this quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "$65 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman, Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Richard, I have a couple of questions just in terms of the loan growth. One, in terms of the Commercial Real Estate, and you specifically referenced the multifamily opportunity pipeline. But I'm curious obviously you have more room to grow that portfolio relative to the overall size. And I'm just curious as you think about your risk balance, if you will, how do I think about just kind of that risk balance and the ongoing growth in Commercial Real Estate, multifamily in particular, how much -- where are you in terms of pricing and kind of thoughts in terms of where you want that portfolio to go, all else being equal?", "Richard K. Davis", "First of all, let me remind you that historically, gosh, you can go back probably a decade, we've always had a fairly large Commercial Real Estate book. So in any point in time, I'm not worried about the size of that as it compares to the size of our total assets. So we're comfortable with that because we're good at it. I have the same management team for 19 years running that business, and so I would take more opportunity, like you said. But let me jump on one thing -- multifamily. We're not always a bellwether, but we had a strong opinion 2 quarters ago, first part of the year. We felt new construction, strong as it is, is risky in overheated markets. And we've been actually walking away from deals in certain markets where we think that the total housing stock is going to be too high once you put the foreclosed properties back into the marketplace and you have what has yet to be built multifamily. So you might be disappointed or impressed, I don\u2019t know which, but we're not engaging in some of those opportunities in overheated markets particularly like Boston and Chicago, but we just think it's just too risky. So we're passing on opportunities not because the credit quality doesn't look good today. We just think that the future as we see it isn't going to be strong enough to account for it. You've got other categories, though. New housing sales, we're at historic lows and we'll continue to be light, and we're going to continue to participate with the only high-quality national builders. Office buildings, new constructions continue to be limited. Vacancy rates in the big cities are about 15%, ranging from 7% to 20%. And major suburban markets were even worse, more like 15% to 20%, so there's not a lot there but to work with your current customers, refi them or take higher position. On the retail side, there's new construction, which is virtually nonexistent unless you're building a next phase or a fill-in to finish off a project. Hotels and motels are experiencing pretty good trends right now, but new construction is still limited. Industrial, limited by the same views that C&I customers are when they're not sure what we're going to need in the future. And as I said earlier, the coasts are stronger than the middle of the country, where we have a lot of our business. So for us the growth you're seeing is an extension of invitations by customers that we've not worked with before and current customers, reducing the number of banks they're using and giving us first shot in many cases to have a higher position. Nothing magic but there's no -- I have no guard rails on this one. If the right business is there, I trust this group and our underwriting to take all that they can. I'm not concerned about the concentration, but I'm also telling you, we're not going to get probably half as much as we could have because we simply don't think it's strong enough right now to get that deep into that business.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. I am assuming again within that portfolio, you haven't changed kind of the underwriting standards in terms of what you traditionally required in the past, as you mentioned.", "P. W. Parker", "No, I mean, This is Bill, no we -- short answer: no, we haven't changed our underwriting standards.", "Richard K. Davis", "By the way -- by the way, anywhere.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then I'd just segue into the card portfolio. Again, stabilizing credit metrics over the last couple of quarters. If you could just kind of give us an update in terms of where you think that portfolio is headed at this point, if you're doing anything different from a marketing or point-of-sale customer contact position?", "P. W. Parker", "One of the efforts we have, which has been very successful, is telling through the branches. So we've -- obviously we've always had direct mail as a source, but we've made a point of improving our originations out of our retail branches. That gets a very high-quality customer, one that we can provide other products and services to. So that's one change we've really focused on, especially this year. And in terms of just the outlook, I mean, the credit conditions are obviously very favorable for cards right now. It's a competitive market, but the credit outlook is very strong.", "Richard K. Davis", "And so -- this is Richard, but we're not going to go downstream on that line. We're not going to sub-prime or near prime. We're just not going to do that. And that's probably a lot of opportunity, and I'm not even saying those doing it are making a mistake, if they get paid for. We're simply going to stay in the very prime and, as much as we can, customer-generated business, where we know our customer and that we believe that they would think that relationship is strong enough to make it first among few to be paid back. So I see it as a growth business. Our group is very good at it. We'll continue to extract more opportunity from the customers we have, but I'm not going to go into an underwriting game here to try to improve the volume.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes. The point that I was just trying to make was you're kind of within your normalized band now today. I'm just kind of more curious in terms of do you see more the growth opportunities staying within that band?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. And so I think the answer is, within that band, yes, but not to extend the band to get more.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush, NAB Research.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Sort of a big question for you. I don't know if you listened to the Bernanke testimony yesterday. But one of the senators went through this long litany of evil deeds associated with the banking industry, including LIBOR and blowing up hedges and everything else, many of which are not directly applicable to you but unfortunately your company gets caught in that same web. But I think more ominously, we're hearing from a lot of investors who are just looking at the returns from the banking industry over not just the past several years but a very long term and just saying, you know what, the returns haven't been there. How do you remedy this? And how do you get your company out of this? \"It's a bank, therefore, I don\u2019t want to invest in it\" kind of psychology that seems to be developing pretty quickly here?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. That's a big question. And I saw parts of the testimony. If there was a long rambling senator, I probably checked out. But I will tell you the way for us to tell the story for U.S. Bank and it does derive to the entire industry eventually, but the thing you got to love about a bank, and you hate about a bank, but you love that it's an annuity, technically and literally an annuity. And unless you have big surprises, which what we're dealing with in the last couple of years, you really can pretty much bank on it, pun intended. But you know this. I mean, you've got --  you can't kill it and you can't change its course very quickly because the loan book and the deposit book move fairly slowly. But first of all you've got to ring-fence the risk and describe to your investors what those risks might be and convince them in a way you didn't used to that you have your handle on the risk and that you're not willing to take additional risks for rewards that are unsustainable. The second thing for the U.S. Bank story, and I'm preaching to the choir here, is that the derivative of our income, 50% or thereabouts, is coming from fee businesses like trusts and like payment businesses, also serves as kind of a buffer against the vagaries of interest rates and market perception. We hear only have half as much about what Bernanke is thinking about interest rates as somebody else because while they're all affected by the economy, you and I both know we have these other cylinders that provide us with this fee business, which is less consistent but also has a whole lot less variability. So ours is to tell the story of the composition of earnings, to talk about the simplicity of the business, remind them of the annuity function of it, identify the risks, call them out, ring-fence them, and let people know that we've got a pretty good handle on it and always be straightforward and as consistent as we can be. And when we have to guess -- prove that we were as close to right as possible so that next time we guess, you're going to trust it. I will say that as a ring-fence stat. [ph] The second piece goes for the industry, Nancy, I don't know that I'll be here long enough for the industry to get its legs back and the reputation it probably used to have. We have done a lot of studies. We know that people love their bankers. That's who they pick. They actually like their bank, that's what they pick. They actually hate this industry because they've been told to hate it. And every once in a while there's another break-in in the neighborhood that doesn't help. So I think we have to work from the bottom up and let each bank rehabilitate its own relationship with its customers. Eventually that will pass through. And I think high tide helps everybody. And when the economy does get better, and it will, and the banks can prove themselves to be the catalyst to that big recovery, a situation which we used to do and I think we will, just de facto be one of the reasons for it, then I think a lot of that criticism starts to fall away, and a future senator in a future hearing won't feel the need to pick on a bank for the popularity of beliefs but actually might actually thank the bank for having been there when they need it to be. But that's years away. So in the meantime, we'll mind our own business, tell our own story and cross our fingers.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. This story that's in L.A. is sort of demonstrative that it's nebulous, it's not true, but these municipalities feel that they can throw that out there and get some bucks in turn from some settlement somewhere. And as we look at the Wells Fargo settlement, we see that actually does work. I mean, how long do you think it's going to take this stuff, specifically around your company, to go away? Is it just a residual of the housing crisis and when the housing crisis turns, that kind of stuff finally goes away?", "Richard K. Davis", "I think the housing crisis is the original issue, but let's agree that it's basically an economy. So the weak economy causes the City of LA to have a city attorney looking for places to raise up revenue. And what they're asking us to do there is change the legal bounds upon which a trustee's responsibility because they can get to the original servicers. So the housing is the reason for the topic, and frankly, people forget that there are 3 places where people own houses. There are the GSEs, by far the majority. There are the banks that own them outright, which people spent all their time on. And then there's this private group of trusts that own the RMBSs, and no one can get to them. And there's no construct to get that group together. It's like a bad co-op getting together for their annual meeting in Apartment 16B. I mean, you can't get them together to identify where they can agree to reduce the value of their trusts in order to get the houses onto the market. So they're going to go through another door. I should only hope that it doesn't impede the original goal of the trustee because if the changes the rules of what that means, then I don't know that anybody would want to be a trustee if all the responsibility falls to them eventually through some eyes of the law, and so far that hasn't happened. But I think answering your question I think as long as the economy is weak, everybody, everywhere will seek a place where there might be a deeper pocket to try to find an opportunity, even if it's not legal, to raise the specter of question and try to find some opportunity. I'm not a settler, I don't like to settle much at all because I think right is right and I'm a fairness doctrine guy. At the end of the day, I'll settle if it's better for my shareholders, but not at all in the first, second or third pass because it's just wrong if it's not right.  And so we'll hold on a little longer to make sure we get treated fairly at the end of the day. We'll do what's right at the end. I'll tell you, Nancy, this a multiyear issue, and we'll probably face this and many others we haven't heard from yet as an industry for the next couple until the economy is assuredly on its feet and doing well again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo, CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I think you've talked some about the interest rate environment but you could elaborate more? How much more negative impact could there be if rates stay at these unexpectedly low levels.", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, Mike, this is Andy. We're expecting them to stay at this level for the rest of the year certainly, and that is the environment for which we're projecting relatively stable net interest margin because again, the headwind of the reinvestment risk on the securities portfolio is essentially offset by the opportunity on the reestablishment of our debt at a lower cost. And those 2 things right now as far as we can see the rest of this year stabilize our margin to today's levels.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "But more generally, if over the next 3 years we have the rate curve the way it is today, are you half done with the pain or you expect a lot more pain for you or for the industry? Because one bank yesterday said, well, it's all done. It's all in the numbers and these low rates shouldn't hurt anymore. Whereas I thought you gave one presentation saying, oh no, it could actually hurt some.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So Mike, for the rest of the year, again, it's stable. If this exact rate environment went into next year I think for us and for industry, it will be a little bit of a negative bias because the yield curve is relatively flat. Low rates are at the low, and the short end rates are as low as they're going to go. And we are, as you know, positively biased to an increase in rates. We're asset-sensitive, so we would benefit from an increase in rates or a steeper yield curve. I don\u2019t think it's material next year if it stays at the current level, but there's a negative bias.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And longer term, you go 2 or 3 years out?", "Andrew Cecere", "I would have the same answer.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So not material, though?", "Andrew Cecere", "Continued negative bias but not hugely material.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then separately, as far as acquisitions, what's your appetite? One thing you can do on an environment with some revenue headwinds is cut more costs or buy other banks. Where do you stand on that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, we always look at opportunities that are presented. I will tell you that right now it's a fairly quiet environment in terms of M&A. There isn't a lot of activity going on from the traditional bank standpoint. What you've seen us in the past look at are small corporate trust transactions, payments transactions, that's both on a merchant acquiring side as well as the card issuing side, and those types of things are always in the works. None of them are huge and material, but those are the types of things we're focused on.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Mike, we have all the powder we need, both time, energy and capital, if we want to go after something. So it's not an issue of not wanting to. We just don't have anything that's out there we like. And we look at a lot of things and turn them down because the price points aren't very attractive. I think you'll see between now and the end of the year a number of payments and/or corporate trust deals that won't register at headline level but they'll continue to be the calling together of opportunity that we think present itself for scale and/or efficiency in markets and we're going to continue to deliver those to you all. But in terms, as Andy said, of traditional bank deals, they're simply not out there at the level we like and we're not reaching for them because we don't need them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David George, Baird.", "David A. George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Question on capital. You bought back looks like 13 million shares. You returned over 50% again of your earnings to shareholders on the quarter. I notice you released kind of your estimate of the new Basel guidelines at 7.9%, using that math. Does that make you think any differently about buybacks? Are you -- does that change your view on returning capital near term?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. This is Andy. We, as you know, the new rules came out in June 7. On June 7, as we worked through the new rules, we paused our buybacks for the remainder of the second quarter. The new rules resulted in about a 7% increase in our risk-weighted assets. We are bound by the standardized approach because our capital ratios would actually be better or higher under the advanced approaches. So we're bound by the standardized. We -- as you also -- as we also talked about, moved about $12 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity in our securities portfolio because we intend to hold those securities and because it reduces the volatility. So given all that, our target capital ratio under the new calculation is approximately 8%. And as you mentioned, we're at 7.9%, so we expect to be there in the third quarter and expect to continue to go back to the buyback program in the third quarter.", "Richard K. Davis", "So let me -- this is Richard. Let me just make it easier. I'll do the math for you. Last quarter, we're at 8.4% Tier 1 under Basel III, and we've stated our goal of 8.15%. That 8.15% was 7 plus 0.5 for a buffer for domestic SIFI, which we have no guidance for, and 0.65 for just other buffers. Based on the actions that Andy just talked about, we think that the OCI volatility is lower. So we're bringing that 8.15% down to 8%, which is 0.5 and 0.5. And we're now at 7.9% under the new rules. So we went from 8.4% compared to 8.15%. Now we're at 7.9% compared to 8%. And based on your question and his answer, we'll accrete back to 8% very quickly in this quarter, and then we'll continue our way.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Paul Miller, FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I want to go back to the again your average balance sheet on your NIM. And I think one of the first questions you talked about -- somebody asked a question about how much borrowings you got repricing. Are they short-term borrowings or long-term borrowings that are repricing?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, It's a combination of both, Paul, and it's about $6.5 billion that is going to mature. So it's not repricing. It's maturing third quarter that will be replaced by either other issued debt or deposits.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then on your time deposits, you have $14 billion that same relatively consistent. My guess is most of that is a 1-year paper. Is that repricing also and what type of level are they repricing at?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So I would say our deposit balances in total, including those time deposits that you're referring to, are repricing, but the differential on what's coming on versus what's coming off is not as dramatic as the debt side of the equation.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So you have CDs that you're repricing above 1%?", "Andrew Cecere", "We have either the differential between what's coming off and on is not nearly the same again as what the debt differential is. And that's why we focused on that because that debt differential is the big tailwind [indiscernible] on the securities. That's right.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the security portfolio, did you guys disclose, if you did, because I've been jumping all around today, what type of CPR rates you were seeing on those portfolios?", "Andrew Cecere", "We did not, and it hasn't changed dramatically. We have a little bit higher prepayments because of the rate environment, but it wasn't a dramatic change from where it has been the last few quarters.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And your duration. I think you said it's short-term. But have you disclosed what it is? I think it's -- is it around 3 years?", "Andrew Cecere", "It's under that number. What we're putting on, what the duration of -- what the average life of the book is stated in our Q. The duration is in that 2-year neighborhood.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Good, thank you, Holly, and thank you all for listening to our results. If you have any follow-up questions, as usual, feel free to call. And we will talk to you next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern standard time, through Wednesday, January 23 at 12:00 midnight Eastern standard time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Christie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was a great year for our company, and I'm very proud to share our fourth quarter and full year results with you this morning. I'd like to begin with a few full year highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.", "U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.6 billion, or $2.84 per diluted common share, for the year 2012. We achieved record total net revenue of $20.3 billion, which was higher than the previous year by 6.2%, driven by growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. We achieved industry-leading profitability, with a return on average assets of 1.65% and a return on average common equity of 16.2%, an efficiency ratio of 51.5%, and we realized positive operating leverage year-over-year. Average loans grew by 6.9% over 2011, and we experienced strong year-over-year average deposit growth of 10.6%.", "Credit quality continued to improve, with a decline in net charge-offs of 26.2% and an 18.9% decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger, with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9%, and we were able to return $3.4 billion of our 2012 earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.", "Now turning to Slide 4 and our fourth quarter highlights. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, or $0.72 per diluted common share. Included in the current quarter was an $80 million expense accrual for the recently announced mortgage foreclosure settlement, which reduced EPS by $0.03. Recall that the fourth quarter of 2011 included 2 notable items that increased EPS by $0.05.", "Total net revenue of $5.1 billion was slightly higher than the same quarter of last year. Excluding the prior year merchant settlement gain, however, total net revenue grew by 5.6%. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year.", "Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.4% and as expected, 1.5%, or 6% annualized linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth -- strong growth in total average deposits of 9.2% over the prior year and 1.9% over the third quarter of 2012.", "Credit quality continued to improve. Total net charge-offs decreased by $70 million, or 13% from the prior quarter. You may recall that the third quarter net charge-off included $54 million of incremental charge-offs related to a regulatory policy clarification. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 4.6% linked quarter. We generated significant capital this quarter and ended the quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.1%. We repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter.", "Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 5. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.62%, and return on average common equity was 15.6%. Both ratios declined from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of the mortgage foreclosure-related expense accrual. As a reminder, our company's long-term goal is to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%.", "Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.55% was 5 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year and as expected, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.59%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 52.6%, slightly better than the prior year but higher than the previous quarter, primarily reflecting the $80 million mortgage-related settlement expense accrual that was included in our current quarter's results. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and expect that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward, as we continue to invest and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 6. The company's reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion, a slight increase over the prior year's quarter and a 1.3% decrease from the previous quarter. As noted on the slide, the year-over-year increase in total net revenue would have been 5.6% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of 2011 gain. The company's revenues benefited from continued growth in both our balance sheet and fee-based businesses, particularly mortgage, as we have significantly increased our market share over the past few years.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $13 billion, or 6.4% year-over-year. Overall, excluding covered loans of runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.6% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by a strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 18.4% year-over-year and 3.3% over the prior quarter.", "Residential real estate loans also continued to show strong growth, 19% over the same quarter of last year and 5.3% over the prior quarter. Within the other retail loan category, home equity line and loans continued to decline on average, while auto loans and leases showed steady growth over both comparable periods.", "We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $49 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled over $176 billion for the full year of 2012. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 15.6%, and 2.5% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained stable at approximately 25%, basically what it's been through the entire year of 2012. Total average deposits increased by $20.5 billion, or 9.2%, over the same quarter of last year and by $4.6 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost deposits particularly strong quarter-over-quarter.", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $70 million, or 13%, from the third quarter of 2012, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $100 million or 4.6%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding declined to 0.85%, indicative of the high quality of our portfolio.", "During the fourth quarter, we released $25 million of reserves compared with $50 million in the third quarter and $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Given the mix and overall quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable to modestly down in the first quarter, while nonperforming assets will continue to trend lower.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.72 was 4.3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2.7% lower than the prior quarter. Slide 10 details notable items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included an $80 million foreclosure-related settlement expense accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.", "In the fourth quarter of last year, noninterest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the termination of a merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related to other mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related matters. On a net basis, these 2 items increased EPS by $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "The key drivers of the company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 11. The $70 million, or 5.2%, increase in net income year-over-year was a result of a slightly higher net revenue, slightly lower expense and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the net after-tax impacts of the notable items detailed on Slide 10, net income year-over-year was higher by approximately 17%.", "Net interest income increased year-over-year by $110 million, or 4.1%. The favorable variance was largely driven by the $17.1 billion increase in average earning assets, in addition to strong growth in low-cost deposits and reduced rates on wholesale funding. The 5.8% growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio, as well as growth in average total loans and loans held for sale.", "As expected, the net interest margin of 3.55% was 5 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the increase in lower-yielding investment securities, partially offset by growth in low-cost deposits, lower-cost wholesale funding and reduction in cash balances held with the Fed. Noninterest income declined by 4.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the settlement gain recorded in 2011. Excluding this prior year gain, noninterest income was higher by 7.4%.", "Mortgage banking revenue was strong year-over-year, largely reflecting a 27% increase in production and improved gain on sale margins and higher servicing revenue. Also contributing to the income growth were increases in trust and investment management fees, retail and corporate payments revenue, commercial products revenue and investment product fees and commissions. These positive variances were partially offset by a 6.3% decrease in merchant processing, the net result of higher volumes offset by lower rates and the reversal of revenue share accrual in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "In addition, ATM processing services revenue was lower, the result of a request within occupancy expense, and other income declined as the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $29 million Visa gain. Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $10 million, or 0.4%. The majority of the favorable variance can be attributed to the net $50 million impact of the notable items listed on Slide 10, as well as lower ORE and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services, primarily due to the mortgage servicing review-related projects, higher compensation and benefits expense and an increase in tax credit, investment cost and technology expense.", "Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $54 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to the $80 million settlement expense accrual. Excluding this charge, net income was essentially flat to the third quarter as a result of a 1.3% decline in net revenue, partially offset by a 9.2% reduction in the provision for credit losses.", "On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was flat, as growth in average earning assets, which grew by $3.3 billion, was offset by a 4-basis-point decline in net interest margin, primarily due to the repricing of the investment securities portfolio and lower loan rates. The average balance of our investment securities portfolio was $72.9 billion in the fourth quarter, $4.1 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and just slightly higher than the previous quarter. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $67 million, or 2.8%. This unfavorable variance was primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage banking revenue. Although mortgage production was higher linked quarter by approximately 2.7%, applications were lower by 6.7%.", "The change in mortgage banking revenue also reflected a lower gain on sale margin and $16 million increase in the addition to the reps and warranty repurchase reserve to cover the 2004 and 2005 vintage Freddie Mac loans.", "Other income also declined linked quarter as a result of the net effect of the third quarter credit card portfolio sale gain and the write-down of our investment in Nuveen. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by just $77 million, primarily due to the $80 million settlement expense. Going forward, as a result of this settlement, professional services expenses will decline, as the costs associated with the mortgage servicing review, which had been running approximately $50 million per quarter, end.", "Turning to Slide 12. Our capital positions remain strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was approximately 8.1% at December 31 versus 8.2% at September 30. At 8.1%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.", "Slide 13 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. As we indicated in December, after discussions with Freddie Mac, we booked additional reserve to address the put-back risk of the loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Consequently, the addition to the reps and warranty repurchase reserve this quarter was $16 million higher than the third quarter of 2012. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at December 31 was $131 million compared with $118 million at September 30. We continue to expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. 2012 was a record-setting year for U.S. Bank. We achieved record earnings and record total net revenue, resulting in industry-leading performance metrics. And further, we continue to invest in our businesses and strategically acquired new partners. We added more customers and grew market share. We maintained strong and growing capital and liquidity positions. And we returned $3.4 billion of the company's earnings to our shareholders, and next year, we expect to return more.", "In 2013, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of U.S. Bank. Since our charter was signed in 1863, we have managed through the times of prosperity and adversity. We've grown by investing in our business through acquisition. We have learned from and capitalized on the lessons of our past and become what we are today, a company with a well-diversified business model and a prudent risk management, a company with the ability to produce consistent, predictable and repeatable results. We're focused on the future and continuing to build momentum into 2013 for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Question for you on loan growth. Good average loan growth, but it looks like the period-end loans are maybe even a little bit higher, a little bit better. And curious if there's anything notable about the growth and if you've noticed any change in sentiment of the borrowers, maybe positive or negative, early on in the year.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. John, this is Richard. There's -- it's pretty much the same story. I think the fiscal cliff uncertainty caused the very last couple of weeks to be a bit muted. But if you take quarter 4 and look into quarter 1, I think at the end of the day, you're going to see a pretty sustainable range of that 4% to 6% annualized. We came in at the high end of that range in quarter 4. I think we're on track for the high end of that for quarter 1, but I wouldn't jump outside of that range based on what I'm seeing. I don't think that people care as much about the debt ceiling and the debate that will occur later in the quarter as they do about the bottom line to their paychecks, as they did about the fiscal cliff. But I do think it's still a fairly uncertain environment, and people at the first of the year aren't jumping on anything new.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you touched on it but maybe if you can provide us a little more color on how you're thinking about capital allocation on 2013. You talked about returning more money to shareholders, but just kind of walk us through your thought process.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, John. This is Andy. We -- our goal has always been a 60% to 80% return, the combination of dividends and buybacks. We were within that range in 2012. We would expect and we plan to be within that range in 2013. That's how we submitted the CCAR. And as discussed, we'll hear back somewhere towards the end of March regarding the results.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And Richard, you said more, I believe was the phrase in your...", "Richard K. Davis", "I did so, yes. We're in the lower end of that 60% to 80% range. It's our goal to get -- move further into that range. I doubt that we'll get to 80%, and part of the reason for that is we're still investing in the company. You guys are allowing us to do that, and I think we're getting good returns for those investments. But the CCAR results will be known in a couple of months, and we've put in a request that we think is very fair and reasonable and will help us move that deeper into the 60% to 80% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On your mortgage production side, can you -- do you break out what you do for retail versus wholesale?", "Andrew Cecere", "We don't break that out. But let me give you a couple of facts, Paul, just to maybe round out some of the story. Right around 69% of our production was refinance activity, and gain on sale margins that you see are down a bit. But I think an important fact, too, is the application because we booked the majority of our revenue at app. And our net apps or our gross apps, both of them, were down about 6.7%. Now some of that can be attributable to -- attributed to the seasonality factor that occurs in the fourth quarter, particularly around the holiday season. We still expect the first half of the year to be relatively strong from a mortgage perspective, but the fourth quarter was down a bit principally due to seasonality.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then, when you're saying gain on sale margins is down slightly, was it mainly -- was that also due to seasonality? Or is that more of a -- did you do more wholesale versus retail in the quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "Probably a combination of a little bit of both. And if I do my gain on sale from a perspective of apps, it was down maybe 10 or 15 basis points.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then, on your loan growth, are you seeing any -- I mean, I know -- Wells Fargo talked about seeing a lot of C&I and whatnot in the late part of the -- in December as people try to get some things done before the fiscal cliff. Do you -- did you see the same thing? Or could you add some color around that?", "Richard K. Davis", "We -- not really. I wouldn't have brought it up. I knew you'd ask. And the M&A activity was higher at year's end for all the reasons that people were trying to time and sequence their activities before a fiscal cliff possibility, but not notable. To us, it was not a real impact. As I said, everything kind of slowed down at the very end of the year. That happens anyway, but to a more of a screeching halt just because people were waiting to see what happened, and there's a bit of that recovery in the first few weeks, as John's question might have belied. But if you take the 2 quarters in total, I don't think you'll see any distinction about that fiscal cliff when it's all said and done. And for us, the -- I'd like to give you color on loan differences by geography or loan type or customer, and it really isn't much different than the last couple of quarters we've had in 2012. So for us, it's a lot more of the same. I guess, the recession was -- ended 14 quarters ago, as I'm told. It probably doesn't feel like it to all of us, but whatever recovery we've been under continues to be slow and methodical, and we're feeling the exact same thing. Just a little bit better every month, every quarter, but it's so small you have to go back and add it together just to notice it. So we're seeing that same phenomenon. Not much to report.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Andy, what are some of the puts and takes for the net interest margin looking forward? And what's your best guess on the near-term outlook for the NIM?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, John. So we talked about the fact that we expected the fourth quarter to be down 4% to 6%, it was down 4%. I would expect a similar decline in the first quarter, perhaps a little bit more because the first quarter is seasonally lower with regard to loan fees, both on the wholesale as well as retail side. So down similar level, perhaps a bit more because of loan fees.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And if rates stay low, the longer they stay low, does the reinvestment rate pain begin to ease eventually? And when does that happen if rates stay where they are today?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, it does, John. So the reinvestment risk right now is that $2 billion to $2.5 billion that runs off every month, putting -- and I'm putting it back on in a conservative fashion. The differential in spreads or rate is about 70 to 75 basis points. Because the duration is not that long, as I move into the end of this year and into '14, that starts to compress because what I'm -- what's coming off now is at a lower rate. So that will dissipate over time.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And with the loan growth dynamics that Richard talked about, do you still hope to grow net interest income this year?", "Andrew Cecere", "That is our goal.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then on credit, Richard, I expect -- you still expect charge-offs to move lower, but it sounds like maybe at a slower pace. And then, just what was the outlook on reserve releases?", "Richard K. Davis", "The answer is yes and slightly a little bit more, but we're coming to an end on reserve releases. So we're at 85 basis points for the portfolio, and we've always said, especially with our credit card business, we should be at about 1%. So we're going to move below that 85 probably into the high-70s. Reserve releases come down to 0 over the course of the next few quarters because it should. And our reserve coverage is sufficient. Both -- it has always been and will be, I think, well within the range of what some of the regulators have been seeking because we don't want to under-reserve or prepare for over this cycle. Our credit portfolio has been really, really predictable, and if you just draw a straight line, you can just keep drawing it with the sloping, settling curve on charge-offs and a continued kind of transition to lower nonperformance for a little bit longer. Bill, do you want to add any color to that?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. No, the -- I mean, we're getting at the bottom for some of the gross charge-off rates if you look at credit cards, autos, even some of the commercial. And some of the commercial real estate categories are pretty strong now. So on the wholesale side, some of the impact will be really on the recovery levels that we see, which can -- those are more difficult to project. So we might see a little bit up and down based on recovery levels. But overall, it's just still working out some of the residual residential mortgage and home equity, which will still take another year or 2.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And regarding the new FASB proposals suggesting a life of loan expected loss approach, do we have to start thinking -- or do you have to start thinking ahead to that now or is it too early yet?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, we're certainly going to comment on it now. There's a comment due from the industry, and we'll comment on it between now and April. Probably the biggest area of impact, which is still the most uncertain, is credit cards. Credit cards take big reserves, and it's just not clear what life of loan means on an open line of credit like that, so a lot more work to be done.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And it's not affecting your reservant behavior right now?", "Richard K. Davis", "No.", "P. W. Parker", "No, no.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. Last thing for me. Does -- the foreclosure settlement cost, Andy, that $50 million a quarter, will that pretty much end in the first quarter and you'll be done with that right away?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. Well, we experienced about $50 million in quarters 3 and 4. We may have a little bit of a tail on that in the first quarter, $5 million to $10 million, but then it will go away.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.", "Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question was just a follow-up to John's. In terms of the foreclosure review expense of $50 million, is that directly going to impact the bottom line so we shouldn't expect the bank to reinvest it back into the franchise?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. The answer -- it's Richard. The answer is yes. That is the cost that we had primarily to third-party overseers. The entire mortgage servicing business has gotten more expensive because of the new rules, some of which will get finalized in a week or 2 from the CFPB. But under the consent order, the rules have been very stringent, and so we have many, many more employees in run rate cost to managing the servicing portfolio than we used to. Those do not change. For the $50 million that Andy cited, we're primarily the third-party overseers, and that does end. And yes, we can reinvest that back in the company.", "Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So we shouldn't necessarily just lop off $50 million from the second quarter run rate expense?", "Richard K. Davis", "You could, that's a --I'm saying but there are other costs that we're not talking about, which are still burdened in there on a comparative period from prior period. It's a lot more expenses around the mortgaging servicing business than it used to be. We're up to it. We're making enough to offset it. But I didn't want you to think that $50 million was all of the -- was the incremental cost of doing this business, because it's gotten a lot more expensive over the last couple of years.", "Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I see. And just my second question is on capital return. Your message on capital return is always dead consistent. If we're just sort of looking at what could be different from this year versus last in the process of the CCAR, what was interesting to me and some investors is in the adverse-case scenario is the Fed is now requiring to stress test against rate shocks, which clearly impacts the securities portfolio. I guess, as you went through the process, I understand the color you may give us may be limited, but does the adverse-case scenario even matter, as you thought about your application for this year? And is the message from the Fed, as they think about accelerating capital return from the banks, as credit risk diminishes, do we have to start thinking about AOCI risk on a go-forward basis?", "Andrew Cecere", "So Erika, certainly, the adverse case matters. But in our case, anyway, the severely adverse case was more of the binding constraint from the perspective of capital return. So -- and that was the harsher economic downturn, the lower GDP, the higher unemployment. That was a more material factor principally related to credit costs for our numbers. And with regard to OCI, as we've talked about, we are keeping our own cushion of 50 basis points over and above what we project to be our CP buffer of 50, so we get to the 8%. And that's to accommodate the fluctuations of volatility that occurs with OCI, and that's why we keep that cushion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Ian Foley for Ken. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the mortgage business. Specifically, if volume does start to fade next year, when we look at expenses, how much is fixed versus variable and how quickly can you kind of bring those expenses down if you do see a falloff?", "Andrew Cecere", "Ian, I would say that the variable expense component of the mortgage business, depending upon the type of production and where it's originated from, would be anywhere between 25% and 40%.", "Richard K. Davis", "We've been very careful not to build a church for Easter Sunday. I mean, we're not -- we're able to accommodate all of our volume today, but we've got a pretty good variable capability of reducing quickly, adding quickly. And as you look at the future, while it may be higher refis today, we're building this bank to handle new purchases and then be a market leader in that area, which is why we're spending so much care on high quality today because that will affect the reputation we have for the clients that we'll use as the new purchase money when rates start to go up and we start replacing the refi activity. So we're going to overperform the service quality. We're going to have more than enough people in all the places today, but we can adjust very, very quickly. It's one of our best talents around here, and you can well bet that we won't be caught with overhang if there's a change somewhere along the way.", "Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question is more involved than the servicing side. And I think with the refis, people often overlook just kind of what it means for the MSR and revaluation. I was just hoping you guys could comment on kind of how the hedging strategy has changed and if refi rates do decline, what that could mean for just the servicing income stream in general.", "Andrew Cecere", "We're fairly -- our mortgage team is very good at the hedging process here. Our net hedge results this quarter was about a $29 million gain versus about $9 million last quarter and about the same level, $30 million, a year ago. So we are very conservative in our approach, and we do try to take into account -- we do take into account all the factors that you described.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Richard, could you just comment on the QM, what your general impressions were of the QM and whether you think there's going to be an impact to the QM on other retail lending?", "Richard K. Davis", "So my impressions are actually very positive. I thought they did a nice job of, what I'll call, soft landing, again, to what otherwise was a risk of really muting a slow but assured recovery. Not only is the 43% debt-to-income a fair assumption and a fair starting point, but the very, very slow transition they're going to have with the Freddie/Fannie rule standards and being able to imply those for quite some time, it's -- I'd like to say it's not a non-issue, but it's not a huge issue. And I think they gave us a lot of time to manage that, never mind we have the whole rest of 2013 to get it right. So I think for the industry, it's something more like 5% to 10% impact. We would be in that same range. And I believe that as we look over the course of time, if I look at it in the cold light part of day, if some of those rules had been around for the industry, particularly the sub-prime and non-bank providers, we actually would have had a better outcome and less of a problem. So I actually think they were quite good. What it means for the rest of the other loans, I don't think it has an infectious impact yet. I only say that because I haven't heard that as one of the next steps. I think there's plenty of other things to work on with the CFPB, particularly non-banks and other activities related to deposit gathering and service charges and things. But, Nancy, I think undoubtedly it will start to take on non-mortgage activity, things that are asset-based but are not necessarily in the same category of the higher risks of bringing down the world. So probably over the next few years, we'll see some -- the same attributes. But I don't think that they are at all immediate, and I don't think when they do come they'll be that bad.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Question for you, Andy, or maybe for both of you. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago about the fact that the banks are not making public their Basel leverage ratios. Could you just comment on that? And they inferred or implied that there was risk weighting asset kind of trickery going on. Could you just give me your commentary on that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure. In our case, Nancy, our risk-weighted asset number to total GAAP assets is about 88%. So we don't have a big difference. The differentials for a bank like us and our business model is just not that material. And if you think about our leverage ratio on a -- it's not significant. In fact, it's higher on a Tier 1 number versus our Tier 1 common number, so it isn't a material impact for our company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I have a bigger-picture question. If you look at revenue growth in 2012 compared to 2011, you guys put up some very nice revenue growth in light of the environment. And as you look into 2013 with maybe slower loan growth, maybe the risk of the mortgage weakens in the second half of this year, which remains to be seen, and you think about revenue growth in 2013, how do you think about that? What are the areas that you think you can achieve it? Do you expect it to actually slow compared to 2012?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. I'll go first. We do expect it to slow compared to 2012 because we're prudent and careful, and I tell you that because I also promised you positive operating leverage for 2013, so that just means we're going to be watching our expenses. And, Greg, if you follow the story for the last 5 or 6 years, you and your peers have allowed us to be pretty aggressive in spending and catching up on our CapEx. Some of our acquisitions and some of our just investments in the company have been pretty high, and yet we've continued to keep our expense relationship to revenue quite good. That's what we're going to continue to do. But we're on the tail end of that area of investing so extensively, and so the good news is this is a good year for us to keep our expenses more run-rate-related, more in check from not having to play any kind of catch-up. And it's going to be perfect because revenue is expected to grow a little bit less than last year, still positive. They'll both grow. Revenue will grow, expenses will grow by less. We'll grow the balance sheet. We'll have positive operating leverage; we'll make good net income. But each will be muted from the year before. And if, by any chance, things start to get better and the world warms up and we can benefit from that, then the expenses are easily adjusted and we can be more aggressive in some of our investments inside the company, more organic. So we've got a pretty good ability to move those levers quickly, but I want to make it easier to turn clearly. We will grow revenue, but we will just grow it at a pace that's commensurate with the kind of expenses that are needed to keep that in positive operations.", "Andrew Cecere", "And I would also -- I would comment that we have a couple of businesses that are at the early stages of the growth curve: our commercial products group, our high-grade bond business, municipal underwriting, our wealth management area, all areas that I think will grow in an accelerated fashion in 2013.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And I guess, along those lines, maybe things that we're not seeing that's coming through revenue growth. Do you feel like the U.S. Bancorp business model has even more leverage when we see the business conditions improve and we actually could see even more positive operating leverage generated as a result of that?", "Richard K. Davis", "We do, yes. Greg, we do. In fact, one of my favorite lines around here is we might be doing really well in tough times but we're building the bank to be great in great times. That's a real important distinction because we're able to handle the kind of muted environment. But when things get good and they get good fast, when that happens, we want to be out in front. The highest debt rating in the business, the reputation we've been able to create over our service quality and some of these new businesses that have kind of rounded out the rest of the capabilities for this company are serving us really well right now. But those are the things that were really meant, I think, the kind of profitability we want in good times. So I'm quite optimistic about it. We used to call it a window of opportunity, where our high position compared to our peers, the high quality of the company, the balance sheet was serving us benefits. That window has been opened longer than I thought it would, and it's getting wider as time passes. And I might close with our staff is better now at leveraging our strength. They're more proud of the company. They're more assured that the company is distinctively performing better in most categories, and they take that story to the customer. And they do a better job of developing better relationships and getting more business. So I'm quite robust in my comments about what this will do for us when times start to get better. We just need to get over the transom of the industry until the economy warms up again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Stern Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Just, Andy, going back to your comments in terms of reps and warranties, the repurchase requests remaining relatively stable. Just curious, with the settlement now and basically capturing all the vintages and the improved dialogue with the GSEs, is there a sense that -- I guess, what I'm saying or suggesting is on a go-forward basis, the requests are more in line with the production? Or alternatively, why wouldn't we necessarily see more of a decline in terms of those requests relative to these settlements and the dialogue?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. I think it's just a timing factor, Todd. So I don't expect a blip like we saw this last quarter, like we saw last year. As the vintages increase, I do not expect that, and it will work down over time. But in the short term, I think it'll just be relative relatively stable because it takes a fair bit of time for the requests to work their way through the process.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms -- like your provision have kind of varied over the course of the year. Can you give us a sense of kind of where you find that kind of settling out relative to that request outlook?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. The provision blipped a couple of quarters, and the principal reason for that blip was the increase in the time frame that the GSEs were looking at. So, for example, you saw a $16 million increase this quarter. That was entirely due to that increase in vintage, the '05 and '04. So again, absent that, which I do not expect any more changes going forward, I would expect that to moderate and go downward.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, on the mortgage side, one of the things that's been a focal point -- everyone's kind of -- has a good outlook in terms of at least the first half of '13. But I'm curious, specifically for U.S. Bancorp, what is being done kind of on the front end as the companies look to ramp up the production side relative to that refi, that, at some point, is going to tail off. Your servicing income continues to grow fairly steadily, but I'm just curious kind of what you're doing to prevent a more -- a significant decline in mortgage revenues on a go-forward basis, particularly as refis slow.", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, this is Richard. We continue to add people, so we're actually flying into the face of the wind here by continuing to believe that until the refi business is assuredly slowing, which we thought 2 years ago, we thought a year ago and I actually don't think even this year will slow. But if it did, we can handle it, for the earlier question. But we're also actually putting more into it. So until it isn't strong, we're going to be stronger. So we're putting more and more into that business, Todd, and building kind of market share value. And as I mentioned, we're also probably putting a little bit more in even than some of our peers, because we want our service quality to be tough quality. We want people to want to do business with us because they'll come back again in the future when they're looking for purchase, as opposed to a refi. We want to be a market share leader in both circumstances. And I'll tell you what you already know, but unless the refis have just absolutely hit some saturation, which they haven't so far and nobody has ever figured out how many times people can refinance a house. They seem to be able to do that endlessly. But when that happens, it's going to be probably as a result of rates starting to trip up. And when rates start to move up, there are other things in the company's balance sheet and income statement that actually will offset the loss of what would be mortgage momentum and then will turn it into a different spread on a different, more purchase-related portfolio, and we'll be getting benefits somewhere else. So it may not be an exact moment in time, but we actually see that to be a pretty good transition when that happens. But more importantly, we're adding more and more to our business and growing it right now while refis are strong and then able to turn that in a heartbeat if and when that moment comes that you've talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Given what your comments about kind of revenue growth and operating efficiency and kind of slightly positioning the company for a better environment, can you talk a little bit about what areas you'd likely want to reinvest the most to drive more growth? I mean, where do you think you can be the most kind of competitive?", "Richard K. Davis", "So Andy teased it out a minute ago when we mentioned that we've got some business lines that are still in kind of their teenage years, our capital markets, some of our wholesale lines of business, wealth management for sure. And those investment curves are behind us, Moshe, but the benefits are still ahead of us. And in fact, in a couple of cases, they've been actually net negative to bottom line in this course of getting them to where they are now. So we've got some natural intracompany opportunities that will mature in another year. It gives them the chance, no matter what the environment is, to get better and stronger. The second thing is we're continuing to build into our technology, in our infrastructure, the mobile banking and mobile payments capability, which you know is -- everybody has a little of that, but that's one of our sweet spots. If you think about U.S. Bank a couple of years ago, you liked us for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is you like our payments business. But you should expect us now is to make that payments business more than corporate, more than government, more than merchant and more now mobile payments for all consumers. And by the recent acquisition of FSV, the prepayment company, and some of the other activities we've been doing in payments, you should expect a lot more from us there, a real leadership position. That investment curve is probably in its middle stages but already parts of it are going to start driving some benefits. And those are fee-based opportunities that don't exist today, that we haven't yet been able to bring to the income statement. So I'm quite optimistic about our own intracompany maturity and the things that we've invested in that will start coming to bear. And that's why I said we'll do well even in tough times. When times get really good, all that stuff got kind of a trebling effect, and it's all very positive.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just one other quick follow-up, and that is on a somewhat related topic. In the past, you've talked originally thinking to try to recapture the lost revenue from Durbin by pricing up your checking account product, then wanting to be more competitive. How do you see that kind of shaking out from a competitive standpoint, the core retail banking offering product in your markets?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. So we did 2 things there. We promised you that we would still get to that 50% recovery. But we told you we're not quite there, and we're not there yet. Two things have happened because we've given ourselves more time. One is we're just growing a lot more net customers. You guys don't suffer through us talking about net customers and going through that because it's a real hard number to measure and everybody can say it. So I just don't waste our time on that. But the fact is, is that our numbers would belie, in hindsight, that we are growing the company. We don't have a free checking product, which is a good thing because we do have customers now that are here on purpose. They don't have second and tertiary accounts that really don't make any money. We've established a relationship on a package basis, where we can add attributes and/or upsell them into something more reasonable, but for which they know they're buying and for which they have value for. And on top of that, we've taken the same time on consumers, and we've gotten really good at Small Business. Rick Hartnack is the Head of Consumer Banking, who's retiring next month. He actually succeeded me in running Consumer Banking and Small Business. The thing he did that I didn't do when I ran it was he took Small Business and put it on the map for our company, and we are now a very capable and an industry-leading small business provider, both checking accounts and loans and lines. And Moshe, that has been a huge benefit, kind of under the watermark. You can't see it under the surface, but it's a huge driver for the company. It is driving a big part of the closures, some of that fee business is, that we lost to Durbin or some of the CARD Act and things like that because now we just have more of those customers. And they're buying stuff, paying for it, they're aware of it and they want it. So I'm pretty excited about what that cause does to do, which was get good at more things for more people. But we're still not quite where we needed to be to recover all that fee. We'll have to do it again over the course of time. And I think mobile payment is going to -- to tie in my last question -- is going to be one of the things that will help us to derive a new revenue stream that doesn't exist today.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "How much of your residential originations were HARP in the fourth quarter?", "P. W. Parker", "It was about 11% again. It's been pretty stable.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And would you expect an increase in volume due to the changes in reps and warrants provision rules that were implemented by the FHFA on January 1?", "P. W. Parker", "Essentially, no. I mean...", "Richard K. Davis", "We're not a big HARP company, and so those are small nuances for us, Kevin. But our company, based on the way we originated in the first place, we just don't have a lot of our volume attributed to that. So when you saw last year a lot of the volume in refis was HARP-related, it was a good question to ask was when does that start to slow. For us, it won't matter in the first place. It was never a big part, and those new reps and warranties and things coming out are very de minimis for us, and they're not going to change our forecast.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. You mentioned a major increase in the servicing costs due to deregulation. Are there anything you could do or are there any mitigating factors that you can implement in order to lower those servicing costs on a go-forward basis?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. There's -- the answer is of course. And that comes in the form of getting better at it, centralizing more of it, automating more of it. But a fair amount of it is a derivative of what started out as the settlement discussion with the big 5 mortgage services, which we weren't a part of, then the consent order. And now what we're waiting for is what will be the final servicing rules that the CFPB owes everybody by January 21. Whatever those will be, I suspect they won't be any more onerous than the consent orders provided, which requires us to do very, very high-bar servicing. So, for instance as an example, the thing called single point of contact, if you were customer in a modified situation, we have to assign you a person. You get Andy Cecere. But if Andy Cecere weren't available at any time for you, then you have to know that Richard Davis will be there for you. And Andy and Richard always have to be there, 1 of the 2 of them, and if perchance they're not, then we have to make sure that Bill is there and that you know Bill is taking over. And it's very, very tedious, right? So I suspect that might be an overreaction to a consent order process to make sure that we all get something right that wasn't at the level they wanted it. So that's the kind of cost we're bearing today that weren't around a couple of years ago. And is it worth it? It's a better servicing model, I'm sure. But I think the new rules will give us kind of a steady answer. So 90 days from now on this call, ask me again and we'll tell you, looking back, what the final rules look like. I suspect they'll be more expensive than they were before rules. I suspect for our company they might actually be less than they are today because we're trying to overperform in the consent order to make sure we can get out of it.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "So if you were to estimate the additional cost of to service a mortgage as it compares to what it was 2 years ago, would you say it's approximately double what it was? Or do you....", "Richard K. Davis", "No. It's probably 25% to 50% higher. So if we're double, we're out of the business because there's not much margin. But it's a new run rate that we've had in the company now for 6 quarters. So for us, it would only be upside if it were to be lesser than it is today. And if it were the same, then we're already bearing that burden, and we can manage to it because the overall business is worthwhile. But it's -- I don't expect it to get worse. So the good news for us is I think we're at a high watermark, and we look forward to, I think, some sustainable new results. And that's why it will go back to consolidating and automating and getting the rules set. Once we know it's permanent, then we can lock down a final protocol.", "P. W. Parker", "And it's the back-end costs that have gotten more expensive. And as the housing market improves, we see fewer and fewer people with underwater mortgages. So over time, the volumes will go down over the next 2 to 3 years.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "But overall, you would expect core servicing expenses to be roughly -- would you say 25% to 30% higher than that what they were on a normalized basis when delinquency levels were much lower?", "Richard K. Davis", "Kevin, I won't give that number. I'll tell you it's not 0, and it's not 100%. I don't know what it is. We really actually don't think of it that way because we don't think we're in a permanent circumstance. So we're -- I can answer that question in 90 days when we figure out and look back on the new servicing rules. It'll be higher than it used to be. But it won't be inordinately too high and won't want to stay in the business.", "Operator", "That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the presentation back over to management for any further comments or closing remarks.", "Richard K. Davis", "I just want to thank you all for giving us the support you've given us last year. Much as I wish we had some huge banner headlines to give you, I'm kind of glad we don't. I also appreciate the fact that we try to tell you what we know when we know things. Even -- when we have an opportunity for a public disclosure, we'll tell you what we see. We'll continue to refresh that in March when we get another chance to be in a public setting. And we just -- we value transparency and consistency and predictability, and we're going to continue to deliver that to you. So thank you for a good year.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Great.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time through Tuesday, April 23 at 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's first quarter results. I'd like to begin with a few quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2013 or $0.73 per diluted common share. Although a total net revenue of $4.9 billion was slightly lower than the same quarter of last year and the previous quarter due to a reduction in total expense, we achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year and linked quarter. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.8% and as expected, 1% or 4% annualized linked quarter. We experienced strong growth in total average deposits of 7.3% over the prior year and 0.5% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Credit quality remained strong.", "Total net charge-offs decreased by $35 million or 7.5% from the prior quarter, while nonperforming assets declined at 9.9% linked quarter or 2.8% excluding covered assets. We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.2% at March 31, with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.1% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11%. We repurchased 17 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, which, along with our dividend, resulted in a 69% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter.", "Slide 4 provides you with the trends in our industry-leading performance metrics. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.65%, and return on average common equity was 16%. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.48% was, as expected, 7 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.55%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 50.7%, better than the prior year and the previous quarter. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue trends. We expect that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.1% decrease from the prior year and a 4.7% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by Mortgage Banking, while the linked quarter variance reflected both a reduction in Mortgage Banking, as well as normal first quarter seasonality within our business lines.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.8% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, our run-off [ph]  portfolio, average total loans grew by 8% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 16.8% year-over-year and 2.3% over the prior quarter. Total average Commercial Real Estate also increased over the prior quarters. Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 19.2% over the same quarter of last year and 4.5% over the prior quarter.", "Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loan outstanding fell slightly as consumers paid down their balances, and average home equity lines and loans continue to decline as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. Auto loans and leases, however, posted good growth year-over-year.", "We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments increased year-over-year by 11.9% and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained stable at approximately 25%, basically where it's been for the past 5 quarters. Total average deposits increased by $16.7 billion or 17.3% over the same quarter of last year, and by $1.2 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost savings deposits particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.", "Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the first quarter decreased by $35 million or 7.5% from the fourth quarter of 2012, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $59 million or 2.8%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the first quarter declined to 0.79% from 0.85% in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we released $30 million of reserves compared with $25 million in the fourth quarter and $90 million in the first quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter, while nonperforming assets will continue to trend lower.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our first quarter results.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.73 was 9% higher than the first quarter of 2012 and 1.4% higher than the prior quarter. For comparison purposes, recall that the fourth quarter 2012 results included an $80 million foreclosure-related settlement expense accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.", "The key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $90 million or 6.7% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and a lower provision for credit losses, slightly offset by a reduction in net revenue. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $19 million or 0.7%. The favorable variance was largely driven by a $13.9 billion increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a decrease in net interest margin. The 4.6% growth in average earning assets included increases in average total loans and loans held for sale, as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio.", "The net interest margin of 3.48% was 12 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower-yielding investment securities and lower loan rates, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and wholesale funding and a reduction in cash balances held at the Fed. Noninterest income declined by 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to Mortgage Banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing revenue and favorable change in the addition to the mortgage reps and warranty repurchase reserve. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were lower equity investment gains, retail products revenue, primarily due to fewer cars coming off lease, and commercial products revenue. Offsetting these declines were increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments and merchant processing revenue.", "Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $90 million or 3.5%. The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to favorable variances in regulatory, insurance and litigation items, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and an increase in tax credit investment costs, net occupancy and technology expense. Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $8 million or 0.6% as a result of an 8% decline in expense and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 4.7% decrease in net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower as growth in average earning assets of $1.8 billion was offset by a 7-basis-point decline in net interest margin and the impact of 2 fewer days.", "The 7-basis-point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loan and securities rates and seasonally lower loan fees. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $164 million or 7%. This unfavorable variance was primarily the result of a decrease in Mortgage Banking revenue and seasonally lower payments and deposit service charges, as well as commercial products revenue. The variance in Mortgage Banking revenue largely reflected lower origination and sales revenue, offset by favorable variances in the addition to reps and warranty repurchase reserve and mortgage servicing rights valuation. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was lower by $216 million, mainly due to the fourth quarter $80 million settlement expense accrual, lower professional services expense due to the reaching of that settlement, favorable variances in insurance and litigation items and seasonally lower operating expense, offset by higher benefits, including pension, and the expense related to low income housing and other tax-advantaged projects.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.2% at March 31 versus 8.1% at December 31. At 8.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.", "In March, we received the results of the 2013 Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review, the CCAR, including the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently, we announced a new 1-year buyback authorization totaling $2.25 billion, effective April 1. And we expect to recommend to the Board of Directors that they approve an 18% increase in our common stock dividend in the second quarter. These capital actions will allow us to maintain our goal of returning 60% to 80% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2013. In the first quarter, we returned 69% of our earnings to shareholders, including dividends and repurchase of 17 million shares of common stock.", "Finally, Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The addition to the reps and warranties repurchase reserve this quarter was $36 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. Recall that we booked additional reserves in the fourth quarter to address the put-back risk of Freddie Mac loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Our outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balance at March 31 was $66 million compared with $131 million at December 31.", "I'll now talk -- turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 13, you will see the cover of our 2012 Annual Report, \"A Rich Heritage\" and \"A Strong Future.\" And today, we're in Boise, Idaho, the site of our 2013 Annual Shareholders Meeting. I'm looking forward to presenting our shareholders with a brief look at our past and a view into our future. Idaho, in fact, is part of our company's rich heritage, which began 150 years ago, with the signing of our national bank charter in 1863.", "The presentation will include the story of how we achieved the size and scale we are today and in particular, what we accomplished in 2012, including record revenue, record earnings and industry-leading performance metrics against the backdrop of a slowly recovering and uncertain environment. Even more important, however, to all of our shareholders is that we have positioned U.S. Bank for a strong future, a future that includes continued investment in our well-diversified mix of businesses, prudent risk management, a focus on operating integrity and compliance, strong capital and liquidity and superior returns for our shareholders. We're looking forward to the future as we move into 2013 with our first quarter now complete, and we remain focused, as always, on producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America.", "Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Richard, your comments on cautious -- your cautious loan growth commentary during the Citi Conference really resonated with the investor community. So I was wondering if you could give us an update on your outlook for the balance of the year.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Erika. Yes, much as I wish it were more positive, I think we just need to be realistic in this environment. And while you'll recall that in quarter 4, we grew our linked quarter loans 1.4%, we then suggested, a month ago, that while we wanted to be in the range of 1% to 1.5% for this most recent quarter, we'd be on the low end, and here we are at 1%. My guidance for next quarter, which is as far as I can see, is somewhere between the 1% and 1.5% again. If we get the seasonal lift that we expect and we normally see in the springtime, then we'll in be the middle of that to the high end of that range. If we see a continued cautious nature by our customers, which we've now seen for the last few months, then it might be on the low end of that range, but it'll be somewhere in between. So what I'm saying is it's not going to be robustly coming back on all cylinders, and that makes sense to us because there continues to be a withholding by both consumers and businesses in this uncertain environment, particularly now, on the heels of both the higher FICA costs and what we all know to be some of the slow but eventual sequester impacts, the higher gasoline costs and the lack of any other catalysts for the business community to jump on the need to take action any earlier now, with the commitment of forward interest rates being low for so long. So longer view, second half of the year, I would hope we start moving into the higher end of the 1% to 2% quarter -- linked quarter range. But for now, let's say, we're going to be pretty set in that same kind of range, bound [ph] 1% to 1.5% linked quarter until we see some catalyst.", "Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And my follow-up question would be on the expense side. Thank you so much for the color on looking for a low-50s efficiency ratio. And -- but you also mentioned the word \"flexible\" in your prepared remarks. If we fall into the lower end of the range on loan growth, and clearly, Mortgage Banking is a big question mark for the rest of the year, is the main message here is that there is still flexibility remaining in terms of managing the dollar number to keep the efficiency ratio in the low-50s no matter what happens to the revenue side for the rest of the year?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, for a couple of reasons, the answer is yes. I'm fairly comfortable that, as you know, we manage more to operating leverage than we do efficiency ratio. And we've promised that, as this year will be a harder year for revenue growth, at least at the conservative manner in which we run the company, likewise, we're going to be conservative on our expense growth. And as long as revenue grows faster than expenses, you know that you have positive operating leverage and your efficiency ratio gets better. So efficiency for us is a result not a goal, but because of that, I can assure you it will stay in the low-50s. I don't see any reason for that to be any different than it has for the last many years. I'll also add, you'll recall that while we are moving through this consent order and have substantially less cost in compliance for that purpose, we do see the cost of compliance and operating integrity going up, but well within the range of the amount that we are now going to be able to redeploy. So even on a linked quarter basis for a company like ours, while I hated all the money we were spending on the consent order, it now serves as a backdrop for us to use for some redeployment for what I know to be higher expenses in compliance and audit going forward. So we have really no reason -- and if loan growth were to stay slow, as you know, because of our kind of 50-50 mix of spread income and fee income, as long as the seasonality continues to happen, along with our trusts and our payments businesses, and some of the non-balance-sheet items, I also have confidence we can stay in the low-50s as an outcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I realize there's a lot of seasonality in fees quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, yet you highlighted some of the declines, obviously, in mortgage and private equity. But I guess, just generally speaking, it felt like fees, broadly, were a little bit weaker year-over-year, as we looked at the service charges, the cash management, corporate areas, just some areas that I thought would be grinding higher. I don't know if there's anything kind of unusual that just happened to all hit at once or is it just kind of sluggish client activity overall?", "Andrew Cecere", "Matt, this is Andy. So first, you're right. The first quarter is seasonally lower across a number of categories. In addition to the seasonality, I'd highlight 2 things. One is in our corporate products -- corporate payments revenue, we have about a 30% exposure to the U.S. government, with a high percentage of that related to the defense department. And government spending is down approximately 15% to 30% depending upon the category. So that is a driver of our -- principal driver of the lower year-over-year and a little lower linked quarter growth that you see in corporate payments. So that's going to depend upon what the future is in terms of government spend, but that is an unusual item that you see there. The second category I bring up is our commercial product revenue. We have particular strength in our high-grade bond underwriting. That's doing very well, and you're reading about the marketplace and how a lot of bond issues are occurring. However, the marketplace is also indicating that FX, loan syndication and some of the more onetime fees are slowing down a bit because -- somewhat because of that high bond underwriting activity. So those are 2 things in addition to seasonality that I would call out.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just separately, following up on the net interest income -- or sorry, the loan growth outlook. As we think about the NIM component from here, any outlook comments on the net interest margin percent?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, so I  -- we had indicated that we would be down 5% to 7%, we were down 7%. I will tell you, my expectation was that is the most it will go down this year. My expectation for the second quarter is closer to 4% to 6%. Part of the reason for that is first quarter has seasonally lower loan fees. And secondly, the compression of what's coming on versus what's coming off is dissipating. So you'll see continued improvement throughout the year and again, second quarter 4% to 6%.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then when you combine that with the low-single digit or low 1% loan growth, do you hold net interest income stable or can you get a little growth out of that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Relatively stable to perhaps a little bit growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Andy, quick follow-up on the net interest margin. Your margin was very resilient for a lot of the low interest rate environment, and the last couple of quarters, you've had a little leakage down. What's the dynamic there? Did you have some funding cost ability to push that down and that's starting to dissipate? Or can you just give us a little color there?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, John. So that is the reason. In 2012, we had about $12 billion of debt that either matured and was not replaced or was replaced at a much lower cost. That helped us, particularly in the last half of 2012. In 2013, we have a much lower number of debt coming due, so we have less of that repricing that will help us. However, as I said, sort of offsetting that is the difference between what's coming on and off, particularly in the securities portfolio. We'll continue to improve each quarter, so that'll be an offset. But that is the principal dynamic last year versus this year.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just remind us of your positioning to higher interest rates and which interest rates matter most for you?", "Andrew Cecere", "We're asset-sensitive. We continue to be asset-sensitive. What you saw in the fourth quarter annual report is very similar to what you'll see in the first quarter Q. So we are biased towards positive rates, and the most important part in the curve for us is 3 to 5 years.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the credit side, Richard, I guess you -- do you envision being able to run at a below-average charge-off rate for a considerable amount of time here, both you and the industry? As there hasn't been much lending and housing's improving, do you see credit kind of running below average for a while?", "Richard K. Davis", "I do, and I think we've predicted that a year ago, that we would all fall below our over-the-term rates and it would take years to come back. I mean, it's just the way the math works. The temptation is for certain companies to decide that now is the time to take maybe a higher level of risk because: a, it won't show up for a while; and b, to stretch [ph] for that asset growth is pretty high. And that temptation is present in our company, but it isn't going to happen. So the fact is, is that we're going to continue to be prudent, and we'll take our hits, if you guys don't like the loan growth. But we're not going to put on, structurally, a deficit asset onto our books for the fear of them being a problem in many years forward. We're just not going to do that. So you'll see us be prudent, and we're not going to -- we're not in the leveraged lending business, to speak of, so we're not enjoying that particular run-up right now. We're not going to get into things like enhanced lease residuals or get into some of the noninterest-related activities. But as I always say, we'll continue to fight for our own customers and continue to build some growth in market share by using our pricing advantage, which, you all know, we have a pretty substantial one, which we can give a part of it back to our best customers and new customers. I'll also remind that our commitments grew almost 12% year-over-year, and annualized linked quarter, 7%. And so we're continuing to enjoy bringing a lot of new customers, and they're still sitting at that 25% usage level. But once and when they start using it, we would hope that whoever has the most customers on their balance sheet with open lines of credit will be the one that does the best, and we're counting on being one of those.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And while it does sound like you'll run below average or over the cycle, you don't see much more improvement from this kind of 79-basis-point level. Do you think you'll just kind of hold somewhere in there?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I think we fell through the 70s, and we stay in there. And I thought -- 6 months ago, we fell to the low-80s, so it got better faster and probably more sustainably than we thought, which is why you saw some of our actions. But just because of our large credit card portfolio and the mix of business, it shouldn't get much lower than that or we're -- then, we really left too much on the table. Bill, do you want to..", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, yes. This is Bill. Okay, I mean, the area that still has room for improvement is anything related to the residential mortgage, so residential mortgage, home equity, still high. And over the next year or 2, depending on housing prices, that should continue to come down.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Bill, it looked like the home equity NPLs and charge-offs ticked up a little bit in the first quarter. Is that a seasonality issue?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, they will come down again in the second quarter and should be down for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So on the Mortgage Banking side, a lot of people felt that we've been writing it off for the rest of the year. What's your views for the gain on sale and volumes throughout the year?", "Andrew Cecere", "So Paul, I'm going to give you -- I don't know the whole year. I'll give you what I can see in the second quarter. And so the first quarter, our fees were down about 15.5%, and that's principally because apps were down. We book about 80% of our revenue at app and the remainder at close. Apps were down about 20%, and gain on sale margins were down 10, 15 basis points, and the offset was positive servicing revenue and the gain on sale -- or excuse me, the servicing hedge. So those are the gives and takes. What we look -- as we look into the second quarter, we believe mortgage revenue will grow, and we believe the application volumes, what we've seen thus far, will increase. So we think that this first quarter was a little bit seasonal, a little bit impacted by the blip in rates that occurred in late February. We're starting to see some strength there, so we expect an increase in mortgage revenue Q2.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Paul, we're sticking with mortgage. We like it, and we do it well. We think, as I said before, that there will be a purchase money future out there, and we want to have that same market share position, if not greater, with purchase money. So we continue to prioritize our new customers and make sure that their servicing and their -- our performance on their onboarding is exceptional so that they'll be pleased. A refi is also important, but it doesn't have the same time parameters attached to it because you don't have another party involved. And we're going to continue to grow this business and do what we can to improve the mix of where the originations come from, more retail, if we can. But at the same time, we have a very good variability on our expense control, so if things were to continue to fall and be less than we expect, we can adjust to that very quickly, probably within 30 to 60 days, based on the way we staff and the way we've set up our occupancy costs [ph] . So we're able to flex with it, but we like it and we're going to plan on it continue to be strong.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you have a lot of HARP-eligible loans. I mean, what type of HARP production you're doing right now?", "P. W. Parker", "About 11% is the HARP for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just wondered if you could just expand on the mortgage side. Can you talk about how your mix of originations has changed? And any market share dynamic changes as you -- as Richard, as you talk about that being prepared for purchase market?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, so first of all, from an origination standpoint, if we think about production, about 72% of the production is refinancing. Only about 62% of the applications, however, are refinancing. So again, that increase in rates that occurred did impact apps, and refinancings did come down in the first quarter. We're starting to see it shift back to more of that 70-30 refinancing. And again, we expect strength in the application volume into quarter 2. Given -- we don't have the full market data yet, but we continue to expect that we'll be either stable or slightly increasing in market share.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. My second question, I wanted to ask you about noninterest-bearing deposits did decline, on average, a decent amount. And I just wanted to ask you to flesh that out a little bit. How much of that was seasonal? How much of it is customers behaving differently? And any changes with regards to even customers starting to potentially use some of their deposits instead of borrowing?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, I think a factor there, Ken, was the elimination of tax. So what we saw at the end of the year was a shift, perhaps, of about $6 billion out of noninterest-bearing, which, at -- until year-end, had unlimited insurance, into a more interest-bearing category. So I think customers thought about it, and said, \"I'm going to go after a few basis points since I don't have unlimited insurance.\" So I think that's the phenomenon that we saw.", "Richard K. Davis", "Ken, you make a great point. As I've often said, it's a canary in the mine. The first good news for all this industry is the deposits in total moved down because people are using them, then they'll use the lines of credits that they have open to buy and they're paying for and then, eventually, they'll get more loans. This is not that. This is not that first mover, where we're seeing total deposits moving down as a result of customers using it for other things, particularly for growth. They're really withholding. They continue to be cautious, and they're just building up the balance sheet. No matter where they placed it, they're just kind of moving it about to seek a little higher yield.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And Richard, on that point, this should be my last question, just can you just  talk us through -- when you are talking to customers, we've continued to hear about this delay and cautiousness. What are customers looking for to make that change in their minds? So everyone is very flush with cash. Companies are strong from a financial perspective. We're seeing that in credit. But so we continue to hear about delay, delay, delay. What are customers waiting for?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, that's a great question. And it has a lot of answers, but mine would be that it is particularly the lack of a catalyst, perhaps more than it is the uncertainty. Even I'm tired of talking about uncertainty without a very good definition. We could tie it, last year, to fiscal cliff. We could tie it, last quarter, to the pending sequester. We can try to say it's going to be the national debt. It's probably not any of those anymore. There's no reason to take a bite right now at the apple and invest in something that will cost you more, with the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there's going to be a customer base for you. So what I would say to you, Ken, is you've got the interest rates being decidedly low for a long time, so there's no catalyst for a company to rush to make a decision because rates are eventually going to move up. They probably should be thinking that way, but based on the calculus and what the Fed has done by tying it to unemployment, everyone can see that it's not imminent. So absent that and absent a good deal, where you see the M&A market still has some life to it, most companies are going to continue to just do what they do well, stick to their knitting, be very cautious and be proud of the fact that they're still being profitable. And they're going to wait for a catalyst, which, I think, will be interest rates eventually starting to move up and people taking advantage of that and/or the consumer getting much stronger, starting to seek more purchase, consumer products and services and then the companies starting to meet that demand. None of that's present today. It's not horrible. It's slow recovery, it's torturously slow, but there's no catalyst to jump on something earlier than you need to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "I wonder if I can follow up on this point you made about it's tempting at this point in the cycle to stretch for growth and maybe people getting to mid and even late cycle underwriting standards in certain products. You referenced leveraged lending is one. Are there other parts of the market that particularly concern you? And maybe if I could specifically hone in on auto a little bit, since you have some slides on it in the back of the deck.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I'm going to have Bill answer the hard one. I'll take auto because that's very timely. We're one of the larger -- we're the seventh largest auto lender, so it's meaningful, 2.3% market share. But we're also one of the larger auto lessors. And we've been in that business for as many years as auto leasing has been around, so we're good at it. It has a lot of other attributes to it like end of term, used market sales values, all those kinds of things.", "And it would be -- one of the opportunities you would have is to enhance your residual value. And so if you're going to get a loan from Bank X, and they're going to say, after a 3-year term, your value is going to be x. And you will get it from us, and we say, after a 3-year term, your value is going to be, let's say, lower, then you're going to have a higher payment with our company because we're going to have you take a larger spread. When the car comes back in 3, 4, 5 years, that's when we have to meet our maker and decide whether or not we expected the value to be higher or lower, and then take an adjustment well outside of the interest income that would have been derived. So as an example, we're just -- we've done this business long enough, we're not going to do something any more than we would take a structural interest -- a structural -- a credit risk on a customer, hoping that they're going to get better when we don't see the evidence. And so autos has a leasing issue that's probably more germane. Let's pause for a minute though and also look at what happened with the CFPB last week, as they're starting to ring-fence the discretion at the pricing level in the auto sales rooms, and you know that the banks are now going to be held accountable for disparate lending behaviors by auto dealers all through the country, as it relates to the kind of upcharges they might provide a customer or add-on products they might deliver. So that's also going to be well worth watching in the next 90 days, to see what the banks are going to do. We immediately responded by ring-fencing the amount of latitude we give our dealers. We'll probably lose a little market share in the beginning, but we know that's the endpoint so we wanted to adjust quickly. And I think you're going to find that this starts moving toward a much more, probably, predictable pricing scheme in auto dealers across the country and probably margin compression, and that may well end up becoming an issue for affordability, as the dealers want to take on some of that profit back in another manner. So auto lending is really in flux given what just happened. But germane to your question, we're simply not going to enhance residuals or take the risk outside of what would otherwise be credit structure. So Bill for the other topics?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, I think the other category would be commercial real estate. Historically, banks have liked commercial real estate because it's actually a pretty easy area to generate instant outstanding. There's always a developer with a project and seeking money. So that's an area that, over the years, has been subject to too much money going into too many projects. The way we manage that is we start with our customers. And the first thing we do is really underwrite, understand our customer. It's common that we do not necessarily do every project for our customer base. We look at the ones that we like. It's been a successful strategy for us for decades. So the commercial real estate is the other area.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "I wonder, as a follow-up, if I could almost ask the opposite question. I mean, you've been pretty good at being countercyclical and maybe extending into products when others are still afraid to do them. And are there any opportunities that are still out there like that? And the specific one, I guess, I'm getting at is in residential mortgage. Alt-A has become maybe a dirty word, but at the same time, the whole market's doing 760 average FICOs. You cite yours at 765, with a weighted average LTV of 64%. Is there an opportunity to do some kind of prime minus business? And is this a good point in the cycle to be thinking about that?", "P. W. Parker", "I'd say less than -- a little different answer than the prime minus. I mean, we've held a lot of our underwriting fairly steady there, and we have the capability to do home equity up to 90% loan-to-value. We haven't changed that in several years. The issue being a lot of people are just not taking advantage of that, getting back to Richard's comment about sentiment, so it's available. We use it in some of our piggyback loans. But the volumes are just not that great. And I think it's less us changing our standards and more the market eventually coming back to them as people get more confidence.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Murray with Nomura.", "Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just ask you a question -- you're talking about loan growth. Are you seeing the ability to take share? And which particular loan categories are you seeing it?", "Richard K. Davis", "This is Richard. Small business for sure. Five years ago, we started a trip to become a really high-quality small business originator, and we won -- we did it through our branch managers. And you're welcome to call any of them, all 3,100 of them. It's -- their job is to be a community leader and know that whole neighborhood like it was a small little town, and part of that goes along with being the bank for the small business owners in and around that location. So we've been taking market share. That continues to be one of our strongest growth both in what you'd call traditional small business, as well as SBA lending. We're the second largest SBA lender at national level at this point as well. So we see a lot of value in being good at that, and it is a real execution game. It's not so much just pricing and product, it's knowing your customer and giving them what they need. The other thing that I would say that we're continuing to focus on in terms of market share grab would be second -- first-position second mortgages. We've been very, very successful at that. It's -- for a lot of people, it's a way to get into the equity without having to go through the typical steps you would have to go for a first-position traditional mortgage. They're very high-quality customers. They like the product. They like the access, and particularly, they don't want to do another credit card. They still feel comfortable using the equity in their home, and those have been 2 really growth businesses for us. Bill, did I miss...", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. Well, I think, the other big area is really our corporate bank and especially their inroads into the investment-grade space, whether that's through commitments and taking joint lead or lead positions with a number of our clients. And with that, comes the investment-grade underwriting that we established in Charlotte. So I'd say that's another area that's come a long way in the last...", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, 4 years ago, 4 years ago, Keith, we didn't really even have that, and now we're leading transactions. And what comes with that too, Bill, is the fee business, which is part of the quid pro quo. So yes, that would be another good place. So we feel we've got a lot of room and space for market share growth in places we're still getting better at. But I think we also have the advantage of being ahead some of the curves on that, and we're going to play it out.", "Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", ".", "And then on the payment side, you've mentioned the government spending piece of it having an impact. But what's your growth outlook for that business? A lot of clients ask the question. It looks like growth has slowed there. Just what's your view on this space?", "Andrew Cecere", "So it's -- let me put it by piece. So the merchant growth is going to be a bit of a function of same-store sales growth, which will range somewhere between 3% and 5%, we expect, for the rest of the year. We'll grow a little bit above that because we're adding new customers, but same-store sales drives that. On the card side, it's going to be consumer spend and that -- what we're seeing is spending relatively stable, but the paydown of the loans continues to increase. In other words, revolve rate is such that people are paying down their outstanding debt, so that's what's impacting outstandings. And then on the corporate card side, as we said, we have a fair exposure to the government and T&E spend, both of which are weak for the reasons that Richard already has gone through. So purchasing, the traditional purchasing is stronger, the T&E and government is a little weaker so that will depend, again, on the sentiment on a go-forward basis.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Keith I'll add, one of our hidden benefits, and it is hidden because it's still growing, is this international growth in our merchant acquiring. You've heard that we closed a deal with Santander last week. We've got this continuing growth in this early stage kind of nascent partnership with Citi down in Brazil. I was in Mexico City just a couple of weeks ago, where we have 400 employees, and we've been working on partnerships with some of the largest merchants in Mexico. And so these are businesses that are fairly young, a few years old, but they're the kind that have the great growth curve. So they're moving from red to pink to gray to black in terms of bottom line, and they've got great trajectories of growth. And that's probably something you'll hear about in future quarters, which isn't present in today's run rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A couple of questions, follow-ups. One, you mentioned earlier the mortgage origination revenues, 80% at app, 20% at close. Is there -- what drives that difference? Is it a function of the type of loan that you're originating?", "Andrew Cecere", "No, you principally book the gain at lock and you book some of the miscellaneous fees at close.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And for your budget, when you're looking out 1 and 2 years, what kind of interest rate environment are you basing that on?", "Andrew Cecere", "The budget that we planned under is very similar to the CCAR base case budget, Betsy, which is a basically low rate environment for the next couple of years at the low end, with some increase at the longer end towards the end of this year into next year.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So is it fair to say it's in line with what the FOMC is suggesting they're going to do with rates or not?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, it's very close to the Blue Chip consensus.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, on payments space, so obviously, there's a lot going on in the payments industry right now. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about positioning USB longer term, specifically around some of the payment strategies in the U.S. You know that JPM and Visa have signed into a unique partnership. Is there anything that -- in that make -- would make sense for USB? Obviously, you've got your own merchant acquirer, so I wanted to see what your thoughts are there. And then, separately, in non-U.S., you've been increasing your footprint pretty significantly in the merchant acquiring. Is there any more that you could do there? And then lastly, on the Internet space, what kind of options do you have to increase your share of wallet?", "Richard K. Davis", "Great. This is Richard. I was going to say payments can now mask as either cards or mobile banking, right? So we'll take those separately. On the traditional payment space, we, too, have relationships with partners that we just are working on. And we don't necessarily announce them, so you can read between those lines. By the way, it's not exclusive, what you mentioned with the other banks. So we are in R&D mode in a significant way with all types of ways to use our acquiring partnership with merchants, and in some cases, directly to consumer, a la Square and some of those things that you've read about. So we're not left out of anything. Nothing has come across our desk that we wish we had been a part of, and we're just more likely to announce it once it's been tested and out, as opposed to the fact that we're going to test it. So just trust us, we have a different cycle in which we announce that. As it relates to international, once we get this beachhead down in Brazil, there's a lot of good growth in South America and, as our reputation builds, like I believe it will, as a partner with Citi, where they have a great deal of relationship, we'd expect to see us moving through South America rather like we did moving from west to east across best -- Pan-Europe and then, eventually further along, perhaps down into the Pacific Rim. We're more careful in Asia Pacific because we're not exactly sure of the politics in some of those environments. But like anywhere else, our entire story has always been built on the partnership of another bank that's local to that market, and we work with them to become their preferred merchant provider. It's usually a rent-to-own kind of a relationship, and we bring our international platform, that we've built years ago, and bring it to any country and flip it on and we start doing business. So there's really very few parts of the world, I would tell you, we're not interested in, but we're going to be careful because of the politics that go along with doing business in countries that we may not have the experience, and the partner is going to be more important probably than the country itself. And then as it relates to just mobile payments, we're spending an inordinate amount of time and energy on that as well, both keeping ourselves open for all channel options and for all partner options, which, in many cases, are mobile providers and some of the less-known brands that are being built in garages across the country. So we're spending an inordinate amount of time on that. And you'll see some of our M&A will very likely be the continuation of traditional merchant acquiring, but I will bet you're going to see some purchases of some less-known capabilities and technologies as it relates to the channel of moving money in nontraditional ways, particularly through mobile. So more of that will come, but you'll hear about it, in our case, after it's working, not the announcement of the idea.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then, on the mobile side, that would be something that you could then provide to other financial institutions that you are running their payments business for?", "Richard K. Davis", "Excellent point. So we will -- as a correspondent bank is to smaller banks, we've been that in the merchant acquiring space forever, where many of these regional banks, smaller banks use us to be their merchant acquirer under private label. We will do exactly the same thing with mobile technology. We'll build it, we'll brand it, we'll white-label it, we'll sell it to them and they can have the benefit. We'll also get the markup.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I hear what you say about consumer confidence and people not wanting to lever up. But I guess I always kind of viewed that loan growth, and especially consumer loan growth, kind of should go with nominal GDP. And you see auto sales up 40% off the bottom. And while you were speaking, housing starts hit the tape. It was over 1 million units for the first time in a couple of years and 2x off what it was on the bottom. And you think about all the furniture and rugs and all this stuff that goes with housing starts. And just how can it not translate into loan growth? And I'm wondering is it purely consumer behavior or is it some of the new strictures that are on you. Is it like the inability to raise card limits and so on? I just -- how does all this other activity, this   [indiscernible] activity not translate into loans?", "Richard K. Davis", "Chris, those are all good questions, and we consider them all the time, too. First of all, let's talk about auto loans. Auto loans are probably the squeeze play between the lack of equity in homes and the lack of people's willingness to extend their unsecured credit card any further. So it used to be home equity would mask a great deal of the auto purchasing, and even credit cards would end up allowing people to feel more comfortable that they had other alternatives to pull on. People are paying down their credit card more than they're using it, and people's equity, while probably starting to warm up, hasn't been that good that long for them to be comfortable. So it makes sense to me that autos are probably the single and exclusive space of strength in the consumer side. That's how I've put it into my head at least. But as it relates to kind of the next steps, you've got the consumer is -- like a small business, like a large corporation, they've figured out that they can be better with their budgets than they thought they could. They can find out they can live on less than they thought they could. And they do not want to get -- once burnt, twice shy. And so the behaviors are reasonable, but they're more emotional than they are practical or financial, and I think this will eventually recover as people feel more comfortable. They now know what their cost is going to be in their paycheck every 2 weeks now that FICA has been changed. They're probably getting a better sense of what's going to happen in terms of the cost of gasoline as we move into the summer months, and they start looking whether they've got money for a vacation. This is the perfect time of the year where we're in a flux to figure out where things are going to settle. And in our company, April and May pretty much tell us the rest of the year. We don't trust the first quarter for a lot of reasons. I don't go -- have to go much past May to know how the year is going to go, but we're right on the heels of figuring out what the consumer behavior will be. And I'll tell you it's probably going to be cautious because, for the same reasons I mentioned for corporate, there's no catalyst, but for to be careful and protect yourself, given the uncertainty of what things could happen.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So your view is it's purely behavioral, it's not the new regulations and structure?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, thank you. For our company, it's not the latter. We are not bound by capital, by regulators, by any enforcement actions. We're simply doing the business we think is safe, sound and repeatable, and so far that's been aligned with what the regulators would expect.", "P. W. Parker", "Yes. And I'll also point out the -- I mean, the housing starts statistic is heavily weighted now with multifamily starts, so the single family, I see, is actually down. And so when you talk about consumer sentiment, I mean, it's, yes, you build an apartment building, you need carpet, but what you're talking about is this consumer going out and buying a new home and refurnishing and et cetera, and that's a different behavior. And that's still fairly tepid.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Werner with Morningstar.", "Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I apologize if -- I got in the call late. With regard to the allowance of loan losses and given that you're improving asset quality and even provisioning slightly less than what you're charging off, where do you see the loan loss reserve long term?", "P. W. Parker", "Well, I'm not going to comment long term but...", "Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Or at least for the rest of the year.", "P. W. Parker", "That's still very...", "Richard K. Davis", "That's forever.", "P. W. Parker", "We usually go a quarter at a time. But in general terms, there's still a little more room for improvement in the credit profile. There's still wholesales almost back to what I'd call prerecession levels. But there's still a few things to work out so that will give us a little more relief on the allowance. But basically, it's similar to what it's been doing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Andy, a couple of questions, just some follow-up. First, in terms of kind of you were mentioning on the spread outlook kind of stable to maybe some growth. What I'm curious about is how we should think about the earning asset mix with the balance sheet. Obviously, it's been growing. And one of the things that stands out is really the growth in mortgage held on balance sheet, and this quarter, we saw a bit of a drop-off in terms of held for sale. So I'm just wondering how to think about kind of the ongoing mortgage retained on balance sheet, how you think about perhaps the fee income versus the spread component in conjunction with your comments on the spread.", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So there are a few questions in there. First, let me make it clear that qualifying mortgages, Freddie, Fannie, we are not holding in our balance sheet other than held for sale, so we are selling those. What you're seeing in terms of mortgage traditional loans on the balance sheet is first, our Smart Refinance product, which is that branch-based mortgage originated high-quality customer, that is not a Freddie, Fannie product. That's what you're seeing growing, and we would expect continued growth there for the reasons we've talked about. In terms of, I want to be also clear, net interest income, we expect to be relatively stable to some growth. We do still see some expectation for that 4- to 6-basis-point decline more than [ph]  offset by the earning asset growth. And finally, I would say that I expect loan and securities growth to sort of be in sync. So we've stopped in terms of the build on the securities portfolio and it'll grow in conjunction with overall balance sheet growth.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And then, just switching gears a little bit, in terms of, again, like the mortgage outlook, if you will, but in particular on the reps and warranties. You guys had a nice drop-off this quarter in terms of the associated costs on the repurchase risk, as well as on the legal side, as well. I was just wondering how we should think about the provisions, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Is that more in sync with current production levels? Are we going to see more of a drop-off and decline in the reserve? Or how should we think about that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So as you recall, in the fourth quarter, we increased our reserve, principally due to the look-back period on Freddie Mac going back a couple of more years. So that was unusually high. The first quarter may be a little bit low because of timing and some of the work-through of that additional look-back period. But I do expect that to sort of be stable to down in future quarters. So I think we've reached the peak there in terms of the addition to reserve, and we'll start to see it come down.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, similarly, I don't know if the question was addressed before, but just in terms of litigation. Again, relative to some of your bigger peers, the legal, while it's difficult to predict, if you will, it seems like we might be in a better or kind of more stable run rate, if you will, in terms of how we think about the legal going forward in terms of in your existing accruals.", "Andrew Cecere", "There is no unusual legal accruals in the first quarter. As you recall, the fourth quarter had the $80 million, but first quarter was relatively straightforward.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So first quarter looks like more of like consistent in terms of the outlook?", "Andrew Cecere", "Nothing unusual from a litigation reserve standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "15% markup in the MSR this quarter, and the MSR looks like it's valued at about 7.7% of total Tier 1 common equity per Basel III. Could you just talk about how you expect to manage that if the MSR continues to mark up, if we have an increase in rates here?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, so you're talking about the potential impact to reduction in capital?", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, so we have plenty of room there. So part of the reason for the increase in the value was the increase in rates that we talked about. But from an overall standpoint, we could almost double our securities port -- or MSR book and still not have the haircut from a Basel III perspective. So we're not bound by that. We continue to expect to grow the mortgage business, as we talked about. And again, as we talked about, we expect that to grow more in the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of the seasonality, but we're not bound by MSR in capital.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Is part of that due to deferred tax liabilities associated with MSR?", "Andrew Cecere", "A lot of -- there's a lot of different calculations, but that is not a binding constraint right now.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then also you had -- 11% of your loans were HARP, which is similar to what you had in the last couple of quarters. Was the reason why the HARP mix continues to stay elevated due to you're doing cross-servicer refis? Or is it just your own book where you're doing HARP loans?", "Andrew Cecere", "It's primarily our own book.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio with KBW.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Andy, I want to make sure I wrote down a couple of things right. Did you say the gain on sale was down only 15 basis points? Because I'm coming out with a much bigger hit to the gain on sale margin this quarter.", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, and the reason for that -- and I know, Chris, where you're coming from. So the reason for that is you calculated it on production, which is what we're putting in our reports. And I'm doing it on net apps after fallout expectation.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I just make sure...", "Andrew Cecere", "And our apps -- right, so production while it looks sort of flattish, apps are down closer to about 20%. So if you go through the math on that, you'll see the gain on sale margins down 10 or 20 basis points.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that explains the difference from what I was doing. Staying with mortgage for a quick second. You mentioned that 2Q could be up over for -- over 1Q in terms of Mortgage Banking income. There's kind of 4 puts and takes in mortgage. There's production volume, your gain on sale margin, I guess, servicing and your rep and warranty expense. Of those 4 little subsets, which one is going to be better than first quarter in order to drive an upward pressure in Mortgage Banking, first to second?", "Andrew Cecere", "Application volume. The others might be better, too, but the application volume is going to be the key driver.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And that's just because of seasonality.", "Andrew Cecere", "Principally seasonality and principally because of that slowdown of the curve with the increasing rates in the middle of the first quarter.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you're pretty confident in this?", "Andrew Cecere", "I tell you what I know.", "Richard K. Davis", "We only say what we know.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "I have a capital question for you, Richard. I mean, the big discussion, if you want to put it that way, today, is the proper level of capital for the systemic banks and this whole Brown-Vitter and is it going to be 10%? Is it going to be 15%, whatever? I think we're all sort of coming to the conclusion that the largest banks are probably going to have to have more capital even than Basel dictates. So do you see this as a competitive advantage for you? Or do you think that these demands for higher capital will then trickle down to the next tier of large banks, in which you and a number of the other large regionals reside?", "Richard K. Davis", "Nancy, good question. First of all, we're just a little tiny bank from Bloomington [ph]. I want to make sure you all know that. I'm convinced that there will be a ratability here. There will be a sliding scale. Even if it doesn't look like it at first, if you recall the G-SIFI or G-SIB requirements, we were the first bank not to be given one, but we were uncomfortable to have 0 as a buffer in our minimum capital charge. We just know it couldn't be 0, but we were not given a number, so we picked 50 basis points. I think that this whole \"too big to fail\" issue has been -- we have failed as an industry to provide confidence to the people who worry the most, that we really have ring-fenced this problem by 6 ways to Sunday. And as the bank that might otherwise look like an advantaged bank, because we're not typically in that first conversation, we're going to be affected by it, in some manner, as well. And I believe, for the good of this country, we need to have banks larger than us and we need to have banks smaller than us. But we are preparing to be part of something, and we think we'll get our pro rata share. I don't think it'll be excessive, but I don't think it'll be advantageous either. I think we'll get our fair measure of whatever the rule is here to try to make banks safer. And if capital's a measure, so be it.  If it's loan losses, it might be that. It might be a liquidity ratio. It could be all kinds of things. I'm worried that \"too big to fail\" is just introducing the idea that we need so many different ways to protect the banks that we'll become so risk-free that we'll end up losing our benefits to those of you who invest in us. So that's a bigger worry, but I think we will get whatever is fair and assigned to us based on our size and our complexity. I don't see it as an advantage or a disadvantage. I think the whole thing, though, is a disappointment, because we should do a better job of convincing people who are worried that we really have this ring-fenced.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Do you think that the concept of risk-weighted assets is going to still be with us? Or are we going to go back to just assets?", "Andrew Cecere", "Nancy, this is Andy. I think we'll still have risk-weighted assets, and maybe a tangible ratio will come into play in addition. One of the things I want to highlight, in our bank, our risk-weighted asset Basel III to our total GAAP asset is about 87%. So we're not -- we don't have a huge discount on the risk weightings that you're reading about in some others. So it may come into play, but it won't be a big deal for us.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Back on the payments. I guess looking at least through the first 2 months of the year, Visa had, had -- had kind of talked about their volume in U.S. credit. And your consumer business seems to be somewhat slower. I know you mentioned T&E being somewhat slower, but are there any other things going on? And kind of got a follow-up on the partnership thing that you had mentioned.", "Richard K. Davis", "Moshe, on the merchant side, our portfolio is heavily weighted toward resorts, airlines, hoteliers, not retail. And those are areas that are typically very slow in first quarter, they always are. And they're even slower right now based on the T&E spend of some of the corporations. So that's why we might be slightly disparate, because we're not heavy -- as heavy on retail as the averages you would hear from MasterCard or Visa.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And you mentioned kind of talking to Visa about potential partnerships, but waiting until they're a little more clearly defined. What's your view as to what that could accomplish?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, I won't talk to any one specific deal, but the goal that everyone's trying to figure out is who's going to carve out what space, as it relates to the interlopers that are not financial institutions, in moving money for people in nontraditional ways. I should write that down because that was a long sentence. But the fact of the matter is that's what we're trying to do. When you're a merchant acquirer, you're the only group that has a shot at it. And if you blow it, then you're going to have an interloper come in and take a position that we've otherwise had as one of the people -- trusted parties in a transaction between consumers and merchants, so that's really where this is at for us. That's why I tell you we're dealing with many partners, we're dancing with a lot of different folks. We can do all kinds of different dances if we need to, but we're not leaving ourselves out of the conversation. We're in virtually every one to decide what we think is the surviving technology or the surviving partner or the surviving customer behavior, and it's changing pretty quickly. So all you should know from us is that we're not waiting and going to be left standing by ourselves. We're out trying all kinds of different things. I just think it's a more prudent approach to deliver on things and show you even pilots before we announce partnerships. You can just trust me on this call. We're partnering with everybody you'd want us to, to make sure we're not leaving out the advantage that accrues to a 30-year merchant acquirer, who's already in this space and does it very well and everybody wants to be a partner with.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got you. One last follow-up and that is, you did mention M&A. And it's interesting because, after a couple of years in which Visa, MasterCard, American Express have been making a lot of acquisitions and there'd been a lot of acquisition in this space, it kind of died out. Could you talk a little bit about what you might be thinking about in terms of relative size of transactions? Because you sounded like there's stuff going on.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, yes. It wouldn't be very big. I think I tried to mention it would be names you haven't heard of and people who put it together in a garage 2 years ago. It's a technology, intellectual property we'd like to buy. We're big enough that we can bring it in-house and we can manage things and do them ourselves. But kind of a nascent technology that we think starts to work is better brought in-house. We can then own it, probably bring them in with us and have them help us to derive some of that. But we're better off to buy their idea than have to try to create a laboratory where we have everyone trying to come up with something new. And there are people out there doing that today. It will not be names that you're going to be looking at today in the paper, and they're not going to be big transactions that would cause you to change the sense of balance of how we make our money.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Okay. Thanks, Brooke, for hosting. And I want to thank everyone for listening to our call.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, July 24 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Lorie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's second quarter results. I'll begin with a view of our quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.", "U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2013 or $0.76 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.2% and 1.2% or 5% annualized on a linked quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 7% over the prior year and 1% or 4% annualized linked quarter. Credit quality remained strong.", "Total net charge-offs decreased by 9.5% from the prior quarter, while nonperforming assets declined linked quarter by 5.4%.", "We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules issued in early July was 8.6% at June 30, while our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.2% and our Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.1%. We purchased 18 million shares of common stock during the second quarter. These buybacks, along with our dividend, which was increased by 18% in June, resulted in a 73% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter.", "On Slide 4, you can see that our performance metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.7%. The return on average common equity was 16.1%. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand slide -- side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.43% was, as expected, 5 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.48%. And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 51.7%. We anticipate that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $4.9 billion, a 2.4% decrease from prior year, but a 1.5% increase over the first quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower Mortgage Banking revenue and net interest income. While the favorable linked quarter variance reflected strong seasonal fee revenue trends led by payments, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $11 billion, or 5.2% year-over-year, and 1.2% linked quarter, accelerating from the 1% linked quarter we experienced in the first quarter. Overall, and excluding covered loans, which is a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.2% year-over-year and 1.6% linked quarter.", "Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 11.2% year-over-year and 2.2% over the prior quarter.", "Total average Commercial Real Estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average construction loans growing by 9.9% year-over-year and 4.9% linked quarter.", "Residential real estate loans also continued to show a strong growth, 19.7% over the same quarter of last year and 3.9% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loan outstandings fell slightly as consumers paid down their balances. And average home equity lines and loans continue to decline, as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. Auto loans and leases, however, posted a very good growth year-over-year and linked quarter.", "We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $48 billion in the second quarter, compared with $46 billion in the second quarter of last year and $36 billion last quarter. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments increased year-over-year by 10.2% and 2.2% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained flat at approximately 25%, close to where it's been for the past 6 quarters.", "Given early industry indicators, our linked quarter average loan growth of 1.2% signifies that we are continuing to gain market share. Additionally, our current expectation is that linked quarter average loan growth will accelerate again in the third quarter to the higher end of our previously stated range of 1% to 1.5%.", "Total average deposits increased by $16.1 billion, or 7%, over the same quarter of last year, and by $2.4 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost money market and savings deposits particularly strong on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.", "Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter decreased by $41 million or 9.5% from the first quarter of 2013. While nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $108 million or 5.3%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the second quarter declined to 0.70% from 0.79% in the first quarter.", "During the second quarter, we released $30 million of reserves, equal to the first quarter, and $20 million less than the second quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our second quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.76 was 7% higher than the second quarter 2012 and 4.1% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's second quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9.", "The $69 million or 4.9% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in net revenue.", "Net interest income declined year-over-year by $41 million or 1.5%, the result of a 2.7% increase in average earning assets, offset by a 15 basis point decline in net interest margin. The $8.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and the securities portfolio.", "Offsetting a portion of the growth in those categories was a $3.1 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of community development entities, and a $1.1 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity this quarter versus the same quarter of last year.", "The net interest margin of 3.43% was 15 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower-yielding investment securities and lower loan rates, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and wholesale funding, including long-term debt.", "Noninterest income declined by 3.4% year-over-year, primarily due to Mortgage Banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing revenue and a favorable change in the addition to the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase reserve.", "Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were reductions in corporate payments, the result of lower government and transportation-related transactions, and other income, which reflected fewer equity investment gains in the prior year and lower retail products revenue, primarily due to end-of-term lease valuations.", "Offsetting these declines were year-over-year increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments, merchant processing revenue, deposit service charges and investment product fees.", "Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $44 million or 1.7%. The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to a favorable variance for professional services expense, primarily due to the reduction in third-party foreclosure settlement-related costs, as well as an accrual for a Visa-related settlement charge taken in the second quarter of last year, and lower intangible expense.", "These favorable variances were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and increases in marketing and technology expense.", "Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $56 million or 3.9%, as a result of a 1.5% increase in revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 3.5% increase in expense.", "On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower, as average earning assets declined by $2.1 billion and net interest margin declined by 5 basis points. The decrease in average earning assets was a result of the reduction in other earning assets and loans held for sale, while the expected 5 basis point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loans on rates and securities.", "Given the current interest rate environment, we expect net interest margin to be relatively stable in the third quarter, which, combined with our expectation for a linked quarter loan growth, should lead to a modest increase in net interest income in the third quarter.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $111 million or 5.1%. This favorable variance reflected seasonally higher payments and growth in all fee categories with the exception of Mortgage Banking revenue. In June, we had expected Mortgage Banking revenue to be higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, primarily due to very strong application volumes earlier in the quarter. However, since the time we made that statement to the end of the quarter, rates moved up by about 60 basis points and refinance activity slowed significantly. As a result, Mortgage Banking revenue actually came in slightly lower this quarter than last.", "The $5 million decline in revenue reflected an increase in origination and sales revenue, including a favorable change in the reps and warranty reserve, offset by a lower gain on hedging activity than the prior quarter. Although applications were higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, the increase in volume was offset by a reduction in gain on sale margin. We calculate gain on sale margin based on applications expected to close.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $87 million or 3.5%, mainly due to other expense, which include higher insurance and regulatory expense relative to the first quarter. In addition, marketing and business development expense and professional service expenses were higher in the current quarter versus the prior quarter due to the timing of business line projects and initiatives.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules for the Basel III standardized approach released earlier this month, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio at June 30 was 8.6%, compared with 8.3% calculated under the previously proposed rules. At 8.6%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.", "Turning to Slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared an 18% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result, in the second quarter, we returned 73% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 30% of the return to shareholders and the 18 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the remaining 43%.", "Of note, our tangible book value per share rose to $13.48 in the second quarter, which represented an 11% increase over the same quarter last year and a 1.6% increase over the prior quarter.", "Finally, Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage, repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Rep and warranty's repurchase reserve was reduced this quarter by $43 million and the outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balance at June 30 was $64 million, compared with $66 million at March 31.", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Last Friday, Andy and I had the honor of commemorating the 150th anniversary of the signing of our national bank charter, by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. We were joined on the stage by 10 U.S. Bank employees who proudly represented and celebrated the rich heritage that they and their coworkers, along with many who came before them, have helped to create and build over the past 150 years.", "Importantly, as we took that moment to observe and reflect on our past, we also celebrate the present and the strong foundation upon which we are building our company's future. U.S. Bancorp posted record earnings for the second quarter, while once again achieving industry-leading profitability metrics.", "We continue to build our future as we have in the past by investing in our well-diversified mix of businesses, by maintaining prudent risk management, by focusing on operating integrity and compliance, by sustaining strong capital and liquidity and by providing superior returns for our shareholders. As always, we remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. Just a question, I guess, on your Mortgage Banking expectations going forward. Are you looking for higher purchase volumes? Or do you see the same level of refis? I mean, we're part of the way through the third quarter, what's your outlook?", "Andrew Cecere", "So Jessica, let me tell you, first, from the perspective of what occurred in the second quarter. From a production standpoint, repurchase activity went from about 71% of the book in the first quarter to about 59% in the second quarter. And applications were also down about 10 points in terms of refinancing. I would expect that trend to continue. We do expect, again it's early in the quarter, but given the current rates there, I expect mortgage revenue will be down a bit, given the rates are today and we'll continue to update throughout the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Looking at the sort of the slowdown in deposit -- average deposits growth, I'm wondering on your perspective, and maybe this is a broader question, around the whole loan demand question. But do you think that the banks generally are exhausting really what's out there from a deposit take? Or are we starting to maybe see -- maybe a little bit of cash being deployed on the deposit side into investment and business activities that could maybe possibly lead to an expansion of loan growth in the back half of the year? Just curious of your observations there.", "Richard K. Davis", "Jack, it's Richard. I think it's what you are predicting and it's what we've been saying for a long time, the first good movement we'll see on bank balance sheets is customers using their own deposits. And I'm happy to report, our deposits, while they were up, the number of customers with deposits was up as well. But the customers who already have deposits that are using some of those to, we think, employ them in some form of growth. After that, we would hope to see our lines of credit, especially in the wholesale side move from a utilization of 25% to anything -- 26% would be great. We used to be at like in the mid to high-30% utilization level. So there's a significant amount of pent-up opportunity and customers are paying for those lines to have them available and to keep them current. And then finally, there may be new lines and loans that will occur, particularly on the large end, when some transactions start to belie underlying growth. I will say, we do read it like you do. I think it's a positive that it's not growing anymore than that, as long as the number of customers are growing. And to follow our prior comments, I do think we're starting to see some of these green shoots that we mentioned 90 days ago, as being real and sustainable, and more green shoots. It's not a rush to a huge recovery, but it's absolutely and positively no longer a concern of going backwards. We're just seeing customers being thoughtful, careful. But one at a time, they're starting to get more comfortable about their future and they're starting to invest, starting with their deposits, sometimes getting lines of credit with the intent to use, and in many cases, starting to make decisions that have long-term outcomes for the long view of the economy.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Great. And then just the ratio of NCOs on the card book look like it walked up a little bit. I know in the Appendix you talked about lower recoveries, obviously, dollar amount down and the trend is good. Can you talk about what that means on the recovery side and what you meant by lower recoveries and how you're thinking about that going forward?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, this is Bill. Part of that is really a timing thing as we brought more of the collection activities in-house on the recovery side. Not all of the recovery collection activities, but some of them. But as we do that, that delays the recognition of the recovery. But I don't expect it to have a material long-term impact, so it's really more of a timing issue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted -- on the fee side, I just wanted to ask you about just the payments businesses and specifically, in the corporates payments business is still having a bit of a tough revenue trajectory. Just wondering if you could specifically talk about that one, but also talk about just your outlook for the 3 payments businesses as we look ahead?", "Richard K. Davis", "The whole payments business is, 59% is our issuing business. And the 29% falls in -- 39% falls in the Elavon or merchant acquiring, and 10% falls in the corporate payment side in terms of revenue. And to start with your question, the corporate payments is about 1/3 of that is government and that continues to be down 20% year-over-year, particularly based on government spending, probably some of the trickle effect of the sequester and certainly just the budget increase or decreases that have been evident on the federal side. But the rest of it continues to actually start showing some support again. The PCAR growth is up 13% over last year. We're starting to see a flattening and a stabilization of T&E for the first time, year-to-date. So on the corporate side, while it's 10% of the total, the government piece, which is 1/3 of that, is still under some form of stress, but the rest is starting to show some positive trajectories. As it relates to the Elavon, which is our merchant acquiring, which also has a nice diversification of geographies, it's a global business, we're continuing to see growth in same-store sales that would reflect what you've seen in the statistics that both the federal government and some of the European government has said. So there's a nice second quarter lift there. We'll have pretty stable margins in terms of how we get paid. And we're actually quite encouraged by what we see on the Elavon side, both domestically and globally. And then finally, on the bigger part of it, the 59%, which is led by our issuing side, we're also seeing nice support there. As you know, the average net receivables or the outstandings were slightly down year-over-year, and that's particularly because people are just starting to have a higher payment activity and the payment rates were probably 1.5% higher than they were last quarters or last year, so people are starting to pay them off. But they're using the card. And so credit's been -- was up almost 3% year-over-year, following another 3% in quarter 1's growth. So we're seeing active accounts growing nicely. They're using their card more often. They have -- they're right now, they're paying them back more prudently. And at the end of the day, that will slow and they'll start to let that outstanding roll over and that will be another benefit. The credit card sales for us is 9% year-over-year absent the portfolio that we sold. And I couldn't be more optimistic about the payments business, as you see a nice trend in quarter 2, we should continue to see that growth.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the second question, just an expense question, an operating leverage question. On a -- at least, on an as-reported basis, we're looking at a little bit of a year-over-year decline in revenues, but a little bit of a year-over-year step up in cost, and you did call out the regulatory costs this quarter. So I just wanted to try to understand the balance between revenues, expenses and how do help us understand that regulatory cost, if it's now run rated or was that kind of a onetime catch-up?", "Richard K. Davis", "Good question. And I own that, good question because I tell you, we shoot for positive operating leverage every year. I think we are still very much in the game to be able to create positive operating leverage, even in the next couple of quarters, but it will be more challenging. And here's my real clear direction for you. As much as mortgages will probably be down, mortgage revenue, in the next couple of quarters, just based on the elements, and you know we're a heavy purchase shop, so our decrease might not be as significant as some of you reported. But I'm not going to take an expense reduction into important investments in the next quarter or two just to accommodate lower mortgage revenue until which time the middle of the curve starts to bend up. And if it does and the market starts to get stronger, then I think we'll be fine. So I'm not going to do any near-term adjustments just to appeal to a finally [ph] negative operating leverage if that's what it has to be, but we are going to continue to watch our expenses. The cost of compliance, as you recall, about a year ago, but in particular, the consent order, was almost $50 million a quarter, and that is trimmed down now to a substantially less, call it, $5 million to $10 million a quarter, as we wind down some of those mortgage-related activities. But I will tell you that we've continued to add compliance personnel and compliance protocols across the company to accommodate this higher requirement that we achieve near perfection on all of our operating activities. And so not all of that 50 is going to be given back. Most of it, however, though, Ken, is burned into the current run rate and you'll see it stabilize. I'm just a little concerned that mortgage might drop off more than I can accommodate in expense reduction dollar-per-dollar and we're not going to overachieve on that because I don't want to suffocate the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones for you. Just curious to hear your take given the new -- the final capital rules that we got out there, and really my question to you is a little bit more big picture. I mean, do you feel that you guys kind of have a real competitive advantage versus some of your larger kind of brethren, given what we're seeing out of those rules?", "Andrew Cecere", "Well, the new rule effectively increased our cap ratio about 30%. Our binding constraints Tier 1 common under the standard -- 30 basis points, Tier 1 common under the Basel III standard. So last quarter, we were at 8.2%, using the same calculation, we would have been at 8.3% this quarter and the new calculation allowed us to get to 8.6%. 8.6% is about where -- above where we think we need to be. Our internal guideline is about 8%. And that is based on an assumed SIFI buffer of 50 basis points and an additional internal buffer of 50 basis points. So I think from a capital standpoint, we're in very good shape. We're not in a situation where we're trying to build capital to a level nor are we in a situation that we're overcapitalized and have no use for the capital. So when we're in a situation like we are today, where we're returning about 70% and reinvesting 30%, it allows us to reinvest at a level to accommodate the loan growth and earning asset growth that you're seeing. So we're in a really good spot. It allows us to make the investments we need to make, at the same time, allow for the growth that we are seeing right now.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, and just to put an exclamation point, Steve, we really like our position. We like our size, we like our simplicity, we like our diversification. As it relates to capital leverage and liquidity, we think we're substantially where we need to be before any fine-tuning that needs to occur. And I think all the rules that come out continue to remind us that being not a G-SIB is a positive outcome, but being big enough to matter. And being able to manage a very significant portfolio of a simple balance sheet allows us to be in a pretty good shape and we like the future we have.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Definitely, it looks you're in a real sweet spot going forward. And then the second question I had for you was just kind of in the same vein of kind of those investments for the future and you kind of touched on a little bit, talking about some of the expense initiatives going forward. Just kind of curious if there was any, maybe that you wanted to kind of flag for us just so we're aware, some of the things that you've got going on, some of the things you're investing in and maybe some of the timing of those things, how they might affect the expense line going forward?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, good question, Steve. A couple of things. One is we're going to continue to build our Wealth Management businesses. As you know, we started this trip 3 years ago. It was the one piece of the puzzle I didn't think U.S. Bank had sufficiently demonstrated leadership, and not only in our Wealth Management, but in our ultra-high net worth, under a brand called Ascent. We'll continue to open those offices. We're continuing to provide technology to our teams to create a unique experience and you'll see our continued expense initiatives in Wealth Management. Secondarily, you all know that we've just recently bought a company called FSV earlier this year in Florida, which is a prepaid card provider and processor. We continue to extend our position there. We now have no third-party partners in any part of prepaid because we have cradle-to-grave capability and a significant leadership position. I want to continue to add to that investment and build a stronger and a unique position of strength for prepaid as it adds to our card provision. And then finally, Corporate Trust, which you know we recently took across the pond and continue to see opportunities even outside of America to grow our Corporate Trust business. We've recently become more of a provider on hedge fund servicing and other areas by some recent acquisitions. There will be more where that came from. It could be both in the form of M&A or in the form of organic growth, but I'd say those 3 areas which are the 3 areas that continue to make us unique: payments, Corporate Trust and Special Wealth Management growth. I think those are areas you'd want us to invest in. They've got great trajectory now and I want continue that momentum so that when the world is better and ready to roll, we'll already be there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just had a few follow-up questions and the first is on the dollar cost trajectory for the remaining of the year. Should we take out the $66 million in quarter-over-quarter increase in regulatory expense when we're thinking about the run rate for the third quarter? Or will some of that stay?", "Andrew Cecere", "What I would say, Erika, is the first quarter is seasonally low and then we had a little bit of a positive insurance recoveries and other expense. And I think the second quarter is more reflective of our run rate of expense with normal increases. So I would use second quarter as more of the basis for expense.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And the second follow-up question is you mentioned that mortgage revenues would be down just a bit. But we heard another large bank mention that they think if rates stay -- loan rates stay here, that the mortgage market is going to be down 30% to 40%. Is the message from U.S. Bank that you will outperform the market? And if that 30% to 40% decline is correct, where are you in terms of your outperformance relative to that number, just in proportion?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So first, Erika, as you know, mortgage application, or gain-on-sale revenue is one component of mortgage revenue. There are other puts and takes, including servicing revenue, the net hedge and so forth. So my expectation is not have our mortgage revenue decline to the level you just described. It's going to be less than that, but I do think it will go down. Application volume is a component of that, but there are a lot of gives and takes. And again, we'll update as we see more throughout the quarter, but I do expect mortgage revenue to be down a little bit, principally due to the gain on sale, principally due to applications, but there are some offsets.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Erika, it's Richard. It will be down unless rates were to turn. This thing turns so fast. We'd be crazy to try to predict the next 10 weeks when we can't see it that far. But we also have a -- always had a focus on purchase. So it's coming our way as a real base to what we're being good at and what we're focusing our market reputation on. And as you'll also remember, we never were as big on a HARP kind of a product, which is probably more likely to be one of the victims of increasing rates. And we didn't rely on that a lot because we didn't have a portfolio that allowed us to have much to refi. So in some cases, we probably should do better than average, but it will definitely be down and we're projecting the second half of the year to be less than the first half.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just one more follow-up, Richard, it was loud and clear as you answered Ken's question on taking out expenses near term to accommodate some of the swings in mortgage revenue. I guess, no matter what, we should just look to your consolidated guidance of 50% on the efficiency side as we think about the puts and takes of --", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, that's a really good way to think of it because we never set that target, it's always a result. But I can tell you that low-50s and where we have been forever. And especially in the last few years, by quarter, that should not change materially. That we will protect that. And I can tell you, I know we can because mortgage isn't the only thing that's growing around here and it will just be one of the components we'll keep an eye on. So I'm glad you heard me, because I don't want to be dollar-for-dollar and be shortsighted. We've been working for 5 years to grow a substantial amount of momentum and become a revenue company, not an expense company, and I'd hate to slow that down this last stage and we're going to be very protective of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to drill into a couple of business lines. One is the merchant acquiring business that you have, and I know that you've invested globally there. We had some news the other night from the FT that suggested that the European Commission is proposing some changes on interchange in Europe, which I know many people have been thinking about. One of the elements they are supposed to be considering supposedly is separating out payments issuers from processors. And I'm wondering what that does to your merchant acquiring business in Europe, is it something that would be an opportunity for you?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. It's definitely not a concern based on what we've read, like you have. We're entirely an acquirer, not an issuer, and a processor. So the issuers are where that is, the gun sights are pointed in that topic. And as you said, there is an opportunity for us, particularly given our close-loop capability in our own proprietary product, that we believe this could be a net positive for us as a leading acquirer and processor. So we don't see it as a negative. We're trying to understand whether it's a positive, but we're not worried about it.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then separately in auto, could you give us a sense as to what exactly happened in auto? And what kind of reinvestment in the business you're doing now? And then a little bit on opportunity for share gain from here and what would drive that?", "P. W. Parker", "Betsy, this is Bill. Yes, we had a strong auto quarter, both loans and leases. And we anticipate that to be a strong third quarter, too. We obviously can monitor the new car sales. So we get a good sense of what our market share is, and in the second quarter, we definitely grew market share. It's a competitive space, but we've made the right investments to be successful there. We've been in the business a long time and we're very good at it.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Right. And there's been some discussion around how the CFPB has come into the mix here, requiring the dealer rebates be done in a potentially a different way. And I know you've updated The Street on how you're thinking about it, but has your thoughts changed at all since your last update?", "P. W. Parker", "No. When that came out, we took action immediately, and narrowed the amount of dealer reserve discretion. We had no negative consequences to that. I think our dealers all understood it. We worked with them and we've seen increase in volume since then.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So no competitive reaction against what you did?", "P. W. Parker", "A couple of other banks followed us, yes.", "Richard K. Davis", "A couple of banks followed us, but it didn't hurt our volume and we're actually feeling that we've green fenced [ph] a little bit of the risk. The real issue here, Betsy, as you know, is going to be, if the banks as an entity can compete effectively with the captives who are not part of the CFPB's oversight, and that's a long time to be determined. And as it relates to our position against both of those entities, we're growing market share and we like the business, so we're going to continue to find ways to expand, not only in geographies, but also in product types that are start to emerge as rates start to go up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "I just would like to discuss some of the increase in Commercial Real Estate loans this quarter compared to what's happened over the last year. You definitely saw a pickup from the first quarter and we're starting to see just broad growth across from the Fed data. Is there any particular sectors where you're seeing Commercial Real Estate pick up or any particular regions where you're seeing that?", "P. W. Parker", "Yes, I can speak to that. This is Bill. We've seen -- for several quarters now, we've seen multifamily being kind of the lead property class for demand. And for us, we've seen good new construction activity in Seattle, both Bay Area and Southern California, and then Houston. Those have been the primary areas for us. In other areas, we have seen some hotel/motel lodging demand that's picked up a little bit. That's strong pretty much in all the coastal cities. So those are the primary areas that we've seen Commercial Real Estate growth.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then concerning residential real estate, given that the 30-year has moved up so much and you're seeing a decline in application volume for conforming 30-year fixed mortgages, are you seeing any application shift towards 5/1 ARMs or 15-year fixed, given the move-in [ph] rates? Or is that -- you're also seeing a similar decline as you are for 30-year fixed?", "Andrew Cecere", "This is Andy. There's a bit of a shift to more of a shorter duration, as you described, and a little bit perhaps more on the variable rate. I will also tell you that, which we're putting on balance sheet, our Smart Refinance product has always been shorter in terms of the term there, closer to the 15-year. So the 30-year is not impacting that as much, and the decline is coming on the mortgage production in the 30-year, but there is some shift to shorter terms.", "Richard K. Davis", "I'd say here, as it turns out, I was surprised, but I thought there might be a bit of a tsunami effect or a cash-for-clunkers effect where we get a pent-up demand and anybody who still hadn't refi would come into the game now. And it doesn't seemed to have happened. I mean, it seems that people are still moving at kind of a snail's pace. So if they still see a deal that's better than the one they have, they'll come in. But we're not seeing that kind of onetime surprise that I thought we might have. That relates to mortgage. But until short-term interest rates start to move, we won't expect to see a great deal of effect on the commercial and wholesale side, although I do still predict there will be a bit of a rush to the gates when that starts to become a real thing. And we haven't seen that triggered yet and I think that will be an upper for wholesale lending at that moment in time, which could be a few quarters out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.", "Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us an update on the bank M&A environment in terms of what you're seeing. Are you still seeing the big gaps between sellers and buyers at this point, given that we've seen a lot of M&A activity amongst the smaller banks?", "Richard K. Davis", "Dan, we haven't seen any activity. I mean, I could pick it up, I wouldn't. But, I mean, I can make it sound interesting, but we haven't. We've had no approaches of any significance. We're not approaching anyone. Like you, I read about the small banks continuing to cobble together to find some critical mass, which makes total sense to me. Because the cost of compliance and just regulatory costs are easier by a larger base. But really, none. I mean, it couldn't be more dormant. And our interest couldn't be lower either. So I think as to an opportunity, we're not playing that indeed right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that. How about the payments business and the processing business, are you seeing more opportunities there?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, that actually, that feels a little more heated. Because, first of all, we're known to be an acquirer -- an active acquirer. We're known to -- we'll talk to anybody. I've said this before, but a few folks that created the great idea in a garage that's got payments unique that's attached to it, we'll talk to them. And some of the deals we look at are typically privately-held businesses. They're smaller than you would probably ever read about, but these are groups of people that either don't want to go out and raise the second round, the third round of capital and they want to be part of something bigger. In many cases, we can bring them in to be part of the company as well or sometimes they just sell and move on. But I would say, we have a very active list of M&A opportunities. Fewer as a percentage would come to the end, but it's not for a lack of having looked and seeing interest. And people know us, so they're coming at us.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then Andy, maybe a question for you. On your margin guidance, you talked about flattish for Q3. Is that something that's Q3-specific? Or is this more of a longer-term trend where maybe we're seeing we're near the end of the margin pressure for the company?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, Jon. So we talked about the fact that I expected the margin pressure to be worse in the first quarter, 5% in the second quarter and start to dissipate as we got in the second half of the year. So it's not a unique third quarter event. It's just a function of our reinvestment rates coming closer to our rates currently on the books, and currently rolling off. So we talked about that happening. It is happening, and we do expect the relative stability.", "Richard K. Davis", "Let me add one last -- we didn't get a question on it, so I'm going to create my own. Richard, what do you think about the growth of loan volume? We went from 1% linked quarter in quarter 1 to actually 1.25% in quarter 2. We have enough of a view to see that, that will go up in quarter 3. I don't know exactly how far because things -- we still have 10 weeks to go. But we are seeing -- here's how I would characterize it. Our flight-to-quality, which we've talked about for many quarters, many couple of years now, has become the real deal and it's certainly brought us a lot of good market share in the years going into this downturn. It's now becoming into a kind of phase 2 where we, we're invited into a lot of transactions and a lot of customers, at the depths of the recession, when they wanted a strong -- you know our highest ratings held [ph]. And now, they're rolling these over and we're getting invited back in at higher positions. We're invited in, in some cases, to lead transactions. And of course, the other business that comes with it is amazing. So for us to try to articulate why in a basically flat loan growth market we are growing now, and why we still think that can continue and in fact grow. I do think the secret sauce in U.S. Bank's business line is that we've got this flight-to-quality that's now turning into a -- we auditioned, we performed well, and now we're getting the lead part. And that's a really a good thing to see at this point and stage. And then as these commitments, we never talk enough about our commitments have continued to grow faster than our loans outstanding. And as you all, as analysts, know, the minute and if those actually get used, whoever has the line of credit has established themselves as the first among few to be the one to draw on, that's going to be the next round of loan growth, notwithstanding new customers. So we love our positioning there, we're actually fairly opportunistic and we're going to tell you that in an optimistic way to give you a sense that we see sustainability there.", "Judith T. Murphy", "I think that's it, Lorie. Are there any more questions?", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor over to Judy Murphy for any additional or closing remarks.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Great. I want to thank everyone for listening to our call.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon EDT through Wednesday, October 23, at 12:00 midnight EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the third quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2013 or $0.76 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.7% and 1.9%, or 7.6% annualized, on a linked-quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 5.5% over the prior year and 2%, or 8% annualized, over a linked-quarter basis.", "Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 16.3% from the prior quarter, while total nonperforming assets declined, linked quarter, by 2.8%. We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules issued in early July was 8.6% at September 30, while our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.3% and our Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.2%. We returned 77% of our earnings to our shareholders during the third quarter through dividends and the repurchase of over 17 million shares of common stock.", "Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.65%, and return on average common equity was 15.8%.", "Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was equal to the prior quarter at 3.43%. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%, slightly higher than the previous quarter. As we have stated in the past, our goal is to maintain an efficiency ratio in the low 50s by continuing to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends and while continuing to invest in and grow our business.", "Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.9 billion, a 5.6% decrease from the prior year and a 1.2% decrease from the second quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue, as well as decreases in net interest income and other income, which included a onetime gain in 2012. The linked-quarter variance in revenue also reflected the pullback in mortgage banking activity.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.7% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter, accelerating from the 1.2% linked quarter we experienced in the second quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.5% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 10.9% year-over-year and 2.2% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average loans growing by 5.1% year-over-year and 1.6% linked quarter.", "Residential real estate loans continued to show strong growth of 19.9% year-over-year and 4.8% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and linked quarter, while average home equity loans and lines continued, however, to decline as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $47.9 billion in the third quarter, equal to the prior quarter and higher than the $45.1 billion originated in the third quarter of last year.", "Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a faster pace than loans, increasing year-over-year by 9.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization, however, edged down slightly again this quarter to approximately 24%. Given early industry indicators, our linked-quarter average loan growth of 1.9% signifies that we are continuing to gain market share. Our expectation is that linked-quarter average loan growth in the fourth quarter will once again be at the high end of our previously stated range of 1% to 1.5%.", "Total average deposits increased by over $13 billion or 5.5% over the same quarter of last year and by $5 billion on a linked-quarter basis, with growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter decreased by $64 million or 16.3% from the second quarter of 2013, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $41 million or 2.1%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the third quarter declined to 0.57% from 0.70% in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we released $30 million of reserves, equal to the second quarter and $20 million less than in the third quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our third quarter results.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our third quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS is $0.76, was 2.7% higher than the third quarter of 2012 and equal to the prior quarter.", "The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $6 million or 0.4% decline in net income year-over-year was the result of a decline in net revenue, offset by a decrease in expense and a lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined year-over-year by $69 million or 2.5%, the result of a 2% increase in average earning assets, offset by a 16 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The $6.1 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and investment securities. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $5.4 billion reduction in average other earning assets primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the second quarter and a $3.5 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity this quarter versus the same quarter of last year.", "Net interest margin of 3.43% was 16 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to lower rates in investment securities and loans, partially offset by lower rates in deposits and a reduction in higher-cost, long-term debt. Noninterest income declined by $219 million or 9.1% year-over-year primarily due to mortgage banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing-related revenue and a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of the hedge. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year was a reduction in other income, which largely reflected the 2012 gain from the sale of a credit card portfolio. Lower commercial products revenue and a reduction in corporate payments revenue, the result of lower government-related transaction, also contributed to the decline. As a reminder, corporate payments represents approximately 25% of our total payments revenue, and approximately 40% of the corporate payments revenue is government-related, while about 55% of the government revenue is related to defense spending. Defense spending was down about 19% year-over-year, an improvement over the second quarter's rate of decline, while the remaining portion of the government spend was essentially flat to last year.", "A number of key categories helped to offset these unfavorable variances, including retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees and investment product fees. Noninterest expense declined year-over-year by $44 million or 1.7%. The majority of this favorable variance was the result of a decrease in professional service expense primarily due to the reduction in third-party foreclosure settlement-related costs. In addition, compensation and marketing expenses declined year-over-year. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher benefits expense, primarily pension-related, and higher costs associated with our tax-advantaged investments.", "Net income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $16 million or 1.1% as a result of a 1.2% decrease in revenue and a slight increase in expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher as average earning assets increased by $3.1 billion and net interest margin came in, as expected, stable to the second quarter at 3.43%. The increase in average earning assets was the result of a growth in loans and securities, partially offset by a reduction in average loans held for sale.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $99 million or 4.3%. Again, this unfavorable variance primarily reflected the decline in mortgage banking revenue, as well as other income, which was lower, linked quarter, as a result of reduced equity investment income, retail lease revenue and a small merchant processing gain recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in deposit service charges and seasonally higher corporate payments revenue.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense was essentially flat, up by just 0.3% largely due to other expense, which included higher costs related to tax-advantaged investments.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules of the Basel III standardized approach released in July, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.6%, equal to the ratio at June 30. At 8.6%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.", "In the third quarter, we returned 30% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and 40% -- 47% through the repurchase of over 17 million shares of stock for a total return of 77%. Of note, our tangible book value per share rose to $13.82 at September 30, representing an 8.4% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.5% increase over the prior quarter.", "Finally, Slide 11 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and a reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The rep and warranties repurchase reserve was $176 million at September 30, while the outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balances at September 30 was $114 million. I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. And turning to Slide 12. In September, we hosted our 2013 Investor Day in New York City. The theme of this year's conference was Extending the Advantage, which followed our 2010 Investor Day theme of Positioned to Win. During the presentations, our senior management team spent time reviewing what we accomplished since 2010, which included our added distribution and sale; our expanded products, services and capabilities; and our gains in market share, as well as how we positioned the company to capitalize on future growth opportunities. In other words, how we are extending the sustainable, competitive advantage that our company has created through carefully investing in our diversified business model by maintaining prudent risk management, by focusing on operating integrity and compliance, by sustaining strong capital and liquidity and by providing superior returns for our shareholders. U.S. Bank's performance metrics for the third quarter will, once again, be among the best in the industry. We will continue to build our company to perform in the future as we have in the past and remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question goes with the theme of Extending the Advantage. As I'm sure you're aware, larger banks or banks just larger than you have to comply with these new supplementary leverage ratio rules. And particularly, as it relates to the 100% capital that they have to hold against unfunded lending commitments, do you think that could be an opportunity for a bank with your scale and size if the SLR does pass as proposed?", "Andrew Cecere", "Erika, this is Andy. While we're not bound by that supplementary ratio, our ratio, in fact, would be above the 6% that we currently have. So it is -- given the simple structure of our balance sheet and the fact that most of our deposits -- or most of our funding is deposit-oriented, it is not a major factor for us. And so to that extent, it could be an advantage.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just a question on your Basel III disclosure. Could you give us what your Basel III Tier 1 common would be under the advanced approach?", "Andrew Cecere", "It's interesting. We have a situation where our standardized approach is a lower ratio than our advanced approach. Said another way, standardized is our binding constraint because the advantage that we get from our simple, high-quality credit portfolio is more than the negative we get from increasing of our capital due to operational risk. So our capital ratio actually would be higher under the advanced approach. Therefore, our return would be actually a little bit better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Richard, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your expectations for keeping the loan growth rate about the same pace and help us think about the constitution of it. It seemed like this quarter, you had resi mortgage pick up the slack a little bit. And so I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of people's appetite out there but also your appetite for retaining certain types of loan production.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, thanks, Ken. Mortgage had a strong quarter, and it's actually across the board. We were very pleased especially in some of the auto and consumer areas that have, in the last couple of quarters, not had this kind of lift. So I like the way it came about this quarter, which gives me confidence to say that we'll still be in that 1% to 1.5% range and probably in the high end of that, unless something occurs that we all know about in Washington that precludes a lot of things. In that case, I'll tell you we've got some opportunities for continued growth because of the following. In the last couple of years, U.S. Bank continues to be invited into more syndicated deals and in a higher position, by far, than we used to be in, in some cases, at the lead position. And that's a big turnaround from what we might used to have expected a few years ago. And likewise, as you know, one of the biggest sources of lending right now in line of benefits are refinancing and customers restriking their balance sheet. And so when they come up to that renewal point and we get invited into deals we weren't before or get invited to upsize into deals we've been in, that's a big driver for us. And that continues to happen at higher levels and expected to continue to happen even more so in the next couple of quarters. I might add that we're a flight to quality bank, so even when there's any kind of question in the economy about what might be otherwise negative, we tend to get the benefits that accrue to that on the lending side, as well as on the deposit gathering side, where you might expect people to come for that safety. The other thing, Ken, is that besides that, we're adding a lot of new customers. We've been talking about it for years. We really are, honest to God, adding new customers. And I've always struggled to explain that market share, after a while, it does, I think, continue to be real when it's consistently repeatable, and it's happening for us. And I think the number of new customers are at more substantial levels than they might used to have been because we get invited in as the lead bank or at a substantial position. So I think everything we have is repeatable and sustainable. That's why I'm quite confident. The market itself is not growing naturally, so I think it has to be market share. And finally, we're doing it on price. If we need to be competitive, our cost of funding is advantaged over every single other bank we compete with. We're not afraid to use a little bit of that, but I'll also tell you we will not go into structure. We will not take risk on underwriting, and we're not going to be in harm's way in some of those areas that I think the OCC, particularly, is going to be watching closely.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And my second question, Andy, you had been talking about getting to this point of margin stability, and we certainly saw that pickup in the investment securities yield. So I'm just wondering how you see the different parts in securities and then loans which are still trending down on a yields basis. How much -- how are you reinvesting, I guess, on the securities book? And then also, how close are we to the bottom of the loan yield side?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So Ken, we're investing about half and half floaters and fixed on the security side. We're keeping the duration short, understanding that rates will go up. And we continue to maintain an asset sensitivity on our balance sheet. With regard to the loan side, I think we are seeing loan spread stabilize. There are certain pockets, particularly in the middle market and maybe on the smaller end, that we have some aggressive players that caused a little bit of a compression on spread. But as Richard mentioned, we have a funding advantage, so we could always compete on price. My expectation for the fourth quarter margin is relative stability again. However, I do want to note one item. With the government issues that we're facing, we are seeing an influx of deposits and quite a strong influx. And that -- while it doesn't impact net interest income, it does cause our net interest margin to go down a bit. So that could impact it by 1 basis point or 2. But absent that, I would see relative stability.", "Richard K. Davis", "[indiscernible] a flight to quality bank.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.", "Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "This is kind of more of a forward-looking thing. On the corporate payments business and the government shutdown, could you comment on how that's impacted fourth quarter so far? And if that -- if those revenues are significantly lower, will they be made up once the government shutdown ends?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I'll just go on quickly. As we try to characterize this particular earnings call, I think people might have thought we have a bigger position as the government affects our corporate payments. And I think you heard us walk through -- Andy walked through the percentage of the percentage of the percentage. By the way, that's only 20% of the total company's revenue. So it's really about a 1-ish kind of a percent impact to our total revenue, but it is an impact. And I'll tell you, it started out looking like sequester and a pull out of a war situation, and that's been the last, probably, 6 to 8 quarters. Right now, it looks like the continuation of the sequester and what continues to be now a government shutdown. Once and if those things get behind us, it will start to pick back up but not to the original levels until which time we get into a stronger purchasing pattern by some of the government agencies and well beyond whatever the sequester will end up to be. So I think this quarter will continue to be stressed for all the reasons we've been talking about, limited in Washington, and a little bit worse than they've been in the last few quarters. But once and when that gets past, then we expect this thing to start to pull back up, and we'll see a sustainable recovery as the government agencies start to spend, in particular, the Department of Defense gets it budget back and knows what its rules are going to be in the case going forward. Andy, do you want to...", "Andrew Cecere", "I think that's right, Richard.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Judy Murphy.", "Judith T. Murphy", "Thank you for listening to our call. Richard, do you have any...", "Richard K. Davis", "I just want to tell you guys that we are quite pleased with the follow-up we had from the Investor Day a couple of weeks ago. We do our very best to telegraph to you all exactly what is going on, and I think the results you read this morning were exactly what we suggested. We have a really good play at this company. We see the balance sheet continuing to grow. We have good margin protection. We've got good compliance and operating integrity. And as you worry about surprises, I think in this case, sustainable, predictable, repeatable is working pretty well. And we're going to continue to deliver on those consistent methods that we have in the past. We're always available for questions, but we appreciate the following of our company.", "Judith T.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Banc\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.8% and 2% linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits to 6% over the prior year and 1.9% linked quarter. Credit quality remains strong.", "Total net charge-offs decreased by 11% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, declined compared to both the prior year quarter and on a linked quarter basis. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for Basel III standardized approach as a fully implemented was 8.9% at June 30.", "We repurchased 15 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, which along with our dividends, resulted in a 75% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter. Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.6% and return on average common equity was 15.1%.", "Moving to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.27%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.1%. Excluding the impact of two notable items in the second quarter, our efficiency ratio was 51.3%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest-in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide five; the Company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.2 billion, a 4.9% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s Visa sale, total net revenue increased 0.5% from the prior year. The increase is mainly due to the higher net interest income as well as increases in a majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $15 billion or 6.8% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, our run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.3% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 12.4% year-over-year and 5.9% over the prior quarter.", "Total average commercial real-estate also increased over the prior quarters but the average loans growing by 6.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter.", "Residential real-estate loans grew 10.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 5.9% year-over-year and were flat on a linked quarter basis. Within the other retail loan categories, auto loans and leases were higher, both year-over-year and linked quarter, while average home equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category, however, has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.", "Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.7% and 3.1% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization increased slightly and was approximately 24% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $15 billion or 6% over the same quarter of last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 1.9% with growth in low cost savings deposits, particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.", "Turning to Slide seven, and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.58% in the second quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 8.1% from the second quarter of 2013. During the second quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, $10 million less than the first quarter of 2014 and $5 million less than in the second quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2014.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was $0.02 higher than the second quarter of 2013 and $0.05 higher than the previous quarter.", "The key drivers of the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings are summarized on Slide nine. Second quarter results included two previously disclosed notable items. The Company reached the $200 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigation into the endorsement of mortgage loans under the FHA\u2019s insurance program. Also on the quarter and prior to the settlement, the Company sold 3 million shares of Class B common stock of Visa resulting in a pretax gain of $214 million. Combined, these notable items had no impact to diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter.", "Excluding these notable items, the Company achieved positive operating leverage, both on the year-over-year and the linked quarter basis. The $11 million or 0.7% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue and a lower provision for credit losses.", "Non-interest income was up 2.7% year-over-year as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. And $24 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year.", "The net interest margin of 3.27% was 16 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower average rates and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt.", "Non-interest income increased to $168 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in other income due to the Visa sale. Including the Visa sale, increases in the majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset the decline in mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, and investment product fees.", "Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $196 million or 7.7% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat as lower employee benefits expense driven by lower pension cost was offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities.", "Net income, on a linked quarter basis, was $98 million or 7% higher mainly due to an increase in total net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased due to higher average earning assets and an additional day in the quarter, partially offset by lower loan rates. The net interest margin of 3.27% was 8 basis points lower than the first quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities and lower rates on new loans, mainly due to higher growth in wholesale as compared to retail loans.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $336 million or 15.9%. This favorable variance was primarily due to the Visa sale, seasonally higher payments revenue and growth in all other fee categories. Higher mortgage banking revenue was principally due to a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $209 million or 8.2% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat. Lower employee benefits expense was offset by higher professional services and marketing and business development expense.", "Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk weighted assets; a general standardized approach and a more risk sensitive advanced approaches. As of April 1, 2014, the Company exited its parallel run qualification period, resulting in its capital adequacy now being evaluated against which every Basel III methodology is most restrictive.", "The most restrictive methodology for our Company is the currently the standardized approach. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if only implemented at June 30th was 8.9%. At 8.9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.26 at June 30th, representing a 13.2% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter.", "Turning to slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result in the second quarter, we returned 75% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 31% of the return to shareholders and the 50 million of stock we repurchased in second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I\u2019ll turn your attention to slide 12. Again in the second quarter, we focused on extending our advantage, which is our thinking for 2014. Our advantage is real and it extents every one of our businesses. Our prudent risk management, our efficient operating platform and our industry leading profitability allow us to operate from this position of strength.", "The Chicago area Charter One Bank Franchise acquisition that we completed in late June is just one example of that strength. As we move through the second half of 2014, we\u2019ll continue to look to extend our advantage. Our 67,000 talented and engaged employees remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our community and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to be answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. My first question is the outlook on commercial loan growth for the rest of the year. I think, obviously, your gains on an organic basis continued to be quite impressive and the commentary from the large banks have reported before you, has been quite positive for the year. And I was wondering, Richard, if you could add your commentary in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of CapEx for the next six months?", "Richard Davis ", "I\u2019d be happy to, Erika. Thank you. First of all, you are right. We\u2019ve had some remarkably consistent and industry-leading growth in average loans. And with the commercial kind of the wholesale banking being up 5.9% linked quarter that would be one of our best quarters we have seen in long-time. I\u2019ll first tell you that we are seeing and particularly in the middle market where we\u2019re really want to see kind of the core growth in the country as we see middle market businesses starting to expand in a more organic basis. Credit structures are firming up at the expensive pricing. I typically tell you we don\u2019t lose on pricing and we don\u2019t because we have a cost advantage but we do see a pricing compression in both in the middle market and the leverage space. But particularly I see that as a good sign of some forms of green shoots in growth. In the larger and investment grade credit structures and pricing remain much more stable. But they are also more driven than they might be organic driven.", "Loan demands for second quarter were particularly high, and in the second quarter we expect it to moderate slightly but still be at a substantially higher growth rate. In other words that 5.9% will probably moderate to something more between 3% to 5% as we look into the next quarter. Now, our loan growth is strong across the country. There is no regional definition. Retail food and ag continue to be strong and we see some weaknesses coming in oil, gas, energy and utility. So, it\u2019s probably where you had expected to be and are a reflection of loan growth and our forecast I think is in line with what you see and read about in the current economy.", "Finally, we\u2019re seeing new credit opportunities being driven by refinancing, but also seeing, as I said earlier, organic growth. What\u2019s interesting is people are starting to increase inventory, we think to build for a better economy and a better outlook in quarters three and four. I\u2019d long believe that as the Fed starts to get closer to whether it\u2019s a reality of increased rates and leads to believe that they are eminent and that starts to increase economic activity at the wholesale side as people prepare for a better economy. We also expect increased M&A activity continue. And finally we see companies looking to banks to create alternative avenues of funding as they want to prove to the rating agencies that they have a diversified source of funding. So I think banks might be back in favor again for reasons that make sense but especially as rates continue to be low people don\u2019t want to miss that one they will be closest.", "So, in total, I will answer even more than you asked, we were at the 2% linked quarter loan growth. We offer you guys kind of a range of 1 to 1.5 and we move around that as the quarter seasons. We are going to bring it back down to that 1.5 as a starting point as the quarter three begin and we\u2019ll start to iterate that as we get further into the quarter. But I think the 2% might be a high quarter for us this year but we\u2019re still expecting to be substantially impressive and somewhere between 1.5 range as we get further along into quarter three.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Thank you for that. And again I wanted to ask about another area of strength, the year-over-year gains and card balances certainly outperformed even on a core basis still larger competitors. And I am wondering if you can give us sort of a sense of how that correlates with sales volume versus actual balance growth and how much is this taking wallet share away from the larger competitors?", "Andy Cecere", "Erika, this is Andy. I would say it\u2019s the combination of all those things, as market share grow as well as core customer grow. So same-store activities, same-store sales on both the merchant and card side was up about 4.5%, a little strong in Europe than in North America but in North America right around 4%. And if you look at our card fees, both on the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, it\u2019s reflective of the increase in same-store and sales in the customer spend. And then if you look at balances, balances were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, part of that is seasonality, but you see that growth year-over-year, the level of spend continues to increase, the level of utilization, so to speak, is flat to down a little bit.", "Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America", "Got it, and just one last question for you Andy. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you are with regards to potential or LCR compliance with the proposals and also how much further pressure we should expect on the margin as we think about maybe potentially building the securities book further out for each Q only.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure, Erika. So, in terms, first of all in LCR, we are very close to that number. As you know, we ended this quarter at $90 billion in securities. We will plan to grow it to $95 billion in the third quarter, so $5 billion is more similar to what we saw in the second quarter. And once we get to the end of the third quarter, I\u2019ll let you know, but we\u2019re going to be very, very close as our expectations, the final rule will come out here in the next few months and that will guide us to what our final number is. But we\u2019re very close.", "In terms of margin, our margin was down 8 basis points in quarter, this second quarter. And there are three components; the first is their securities bill, I just spoke to, which costs us about 3 basis points; the second was the reduction in CAA checking account advance fees, which runs through around these and we\u2019ve talked about that, that cost us about 2 basis points; and then finally the loan mix, most of the growth that occurred this quarter was in the wholesale category. In fact, wholesale overall was up about 4% and retail was relatively flat. Wholesale is a little lower yield and that cost us about 3 basis points. So that is the 8 basis points in quarter two.", "As we look into quarter three, I would expect the same securities in past, about 3 basis points. I would expect a similar loan mix impact of 2 to 3 basis points. And CAA in quarter three will cause a reduction of about 5 basis points in margin, because our $39 million will go to effectively zero. So you had all that up, it\u2019s 10 to 11 basis points. But importantly, net interest income will still grow in quarter three versus quarter two.", "Richard Davis", "And this is Richard. And importantly, after that CAA, those 39 million going to zero we\u2019re done, so that impact is over. And as Andy said, at this call 90 days to the day we\u2019ll hopefully have both the rules and know where our final liquidity build is and we can either call it done or call it near done and give you final guidance. But for that, all that leaves is the mix and we\u2019re all hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to do well on commercial and that the consumer will start to bid its own place in growth and in that case the margins will firm up. So, we\u2019ll telegraph you all that once those two activities at CAA and liquidity build are over, we think the margin flattens out and is very small movement along with the big reason of mix.", "Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America", "Thank you for such complete answers. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura", "Thanks, good morning. As we look ahead to the period where the Fed I guess excess reserve decreases the Fed [earnings] liquidity from the system. Could you talk a little bit about, presumably in that kind of environment, the strong deposit growth that you\u2019ve been enjoying decreases and perhaps maybe just you could comment, give us color on the packing order for your funding preferences as we look forward to a stronger long growth environment? And then perhaps also comment on whether you see banks having to, some banks having to raise more expensive funding to remain LCR complaint?", "Andy Cecere", "So, Bill, I would say, our focus has been on the core deposit category, you\u2019re seeing good growth in that category across DDA, as well as interest bearing deposits and then it\u2019s across both the retail as well as the wholesale and corporate trust side of the equation. We have a great funding source in our corporate trust business, which represents about 15% of our deposit base, including our DDA balances. So we have a strong core deposit and strong opportunity for continued growth. And that would be our principle preference in terms of growth as we look at increased rates.", "So secondarily we have ample access to the wholesale markets in terms of debt issuance. And as you know, we have the lowest spreads out there in terms of our opportunity there, so that would be secondary delta deposit growth. And finally, we have a entity called the Money Center, which is short-term balance sheet growth in terms of deposits for wholesale customers, which just offers us another opportunity in wholesale growth. So, those are sort of order of opportunity. I will also tell you that we\u2019re positively bias to increasing rates as you see from our Q and our disclosures, 1.75% or so in terms of 200 basis point parallel shift, and in addition we have about a $100 million in waivers that will come through in fee income to the extent rates go up 75 or 100 basis points.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Andy. I had one, last one for Richard. Richard can you offer some perspective on, you gave some very helpful color in your commentary. But perhaps anything that you\u2019re seeing now that gives you greater confidence in the sustainability of the recovery given some of the stakes that what you see to-date?", "Richard Davis", "Hello Bill. This is more of the Richard Davis the world to see, and it\u2019s consistent. But I\u2019ve always thought that and this recession as we finally come out of it, that it\u2019s going to be the businesses that link first, in other words it\u2019s not consumed further than like it has in many times past because the wealth of that still isn\u2019t present given the housing values and some of the skittish nature of consumers heading down through this recession. So I am seeing more and more the consumerism will be incentivized by price lowering and by new activities and new product innovation by the wholesale sights.", "And we\u2019re seeing that, that\u2019s why I kind of don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t like the mix version but I like wholesale growing. It makes sense to me it is growing faster and first in this recession recovery than the consumer. That also aligns with what I think we would all agree that under giant [yelling] we\u2019re seeing more and more while she will talk about how careful she wants to be about increasing rates, we\u2019re taking away some of the time specificity that used to be there, we\u2019re not linking into unemployment rates, we\u2019re not linking it to points and time. But we\u2019re linking it to a sense of how much longer can rates be lower and what kind of levers would it give to Fed and start moving rates up.", "I think there was announcement have been in our customers view that is coming to an end and that does encourage and incentivize people to take action and make some decisions that they have been sitting on for many, many years. Those are both I think sustainable kind of actions that will provide us with kind of next generation of slow but steady growth back into the consumers and we\u2019re looking for. So businesses lead out based on a belief that things are coming to an end on low rates, consumers follow then we\u2019re back into maybe a different kind of a recovery but one that we\u2019re all I think we all come greatly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Bryan Batory - Jefferies", "My first question is on expenses. So ex the DOJ charge they were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So just wondering what the outlook is for cost in the back half of the year and if there is an expectation that you\u2019ll continue to drive positive operating leverage?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes we do expect positive operating leverage. If you back out the two notable items this quarter as Richard mentioned in his comments, we did have positive operating leverage both on a linked quarter as well as year-over-year basis. We would expect to have that for the full year and we would expect to have our efficiency ratio continue to be in low 50, just like what you saw this quarter.", "Bryan Batory - Jefferies", "Okay, great. And then next on the discontinuation of the deposit advance product, I think previously you guys had stated that there is not a ton of offsets either with new lending products or fee based products that you can offer. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts there, are there anything you\u2019re looking at today that could offset some of that revenue give-up in the net interest income?", "Richard Davis", "Bryan, I would say, I don\u2019t see it, not in this category we\u2019re going to be looking more to mobile banking and some of the new innovative deposit products to offset that category. But to the extent that we would have to live within some of the new rules that have been created for that kind of a product, it would almost be a breakeven product. And we may still while come out with something, because we want to continue to be good stores of helping people, first time customers and help people that have certainly less means than the average. But at the same time it\u2019s not going to be a money maker. So, I wouldn\u2019t consider it a replacement for any kind of a fee category. I will say that U.S. Bancorp is working on and we\u2019ll probably have a product that will be sufficient to meet a different set of customer needs that we were meeting before. But I think we\u2019ll start turning our attention more to things like mobile banking and mobile payments and some of our payment categories through place where we\u2019ll be kind of forever loss and income benefit from that original checking account advance. So, we\u2019ll seek, it will take a longer to replace than it would have been just a straight up product but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.", "Bryan Batory - Jefferies", "Okay. And the tax rate jumped a bit. Was there anything unusual there? And is the outlook still for 28% going forward?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes nothing unusual 28% to 29% for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Just a follow-up on the expense question, Richard or Andy, where are we in terms of the expense environment for U.S. Banc? I know that periodically you have the plan B, which is a more strict approach, based on the revenue environment. But just out of curiosity what is the message internally on expenses?", "Richard Davis", "Look, we are on plan B right now. There is plan C and D but I prefer on plan B. Our employees have been really they trust us and I appreciate that a lot. In other words, we\u2019ve said in the outlook, new plan that we expected last November when we built 2014 was revenue up X and expenses up slightly less than X. And as you all know, I think quarter one was the last quarter we\u2019re not going to see that made up. And so we\u2019ve asked everybody to reduce their expense growth, still to grow but lower level as we expect revenue to grow but at a lower level. We\u2019re in the middle of that now and what that just means is we\u2019re not taking any risk, discretionary expenses and then asked, we\u2019re asking people to watch their nickels and dimes and to keep a close eye on FTE. That\u2019s not sustainable but we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to need to be, but we\u2019ll continue to employ until the economy starts to show a little more robust and sustainability.", "Having said that, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, the key elements of expense growth are pretty much already in place with the Company; A, our CapEx, which is always the big number. We\u2019ve viewed the last few years to really catch-up from the many years before that. And we said our peak years behind us but we have the amortized cost that will continue further through next few. But we said our peak and that starts to move down over the coming years. We don\u2019t see any kind of a retrace back to a high level. We\u2019ve got the compensation in the FTE but for these acquisitions and new partners we bring on, we\u2019ve got a really nice steady state. Our compensation is at parity with our peers. Our performance plans pay people for performance. We\u2019ve been paying above target for the last few years because performed at that level. So, there is not a big issue there.", "And then finally on just general operating cost, we have one operating system. We\u2019ve raised that one operating system and we bring in the company, we bring a set of same singular view of operating integrity. So, we don\u2019t have multiple accounting firms, accounting systems and multiple technology systems that we have to integrate. So on one hand, I told you what you all tell me which is you guys don\u2019t have much upside in reducing your expenses because you\u2019re already efficient. And I\u2019ll say that's true and you\u2019re all welcome. We worked hard at that and we\u2019ve protected. And I think by staying in low 50s as we\u2019ve committed, it\u2019s a good indicator to use that we will let revenue be the driver to expenses. But there is nothing substantial that we\u2019re holding back on or which we had the opportunity to spend money on, it\u2019s pretty much as the runway.", "The last big dog in this hunt is whether or not compliance costs are fully burdened. And I\u2019m not going to be dummying up to say I think that we\u2019re done, but I believe the best in everything I\u2019m looking at we\u2019ve come to a place where our operating expenses aligns with compliance audit and operating integrity is pretty much where it needs to be for a while, separate some surprise and now we\u2019d like to put in place the last couple of quarters. So I don\u2019t see a big jump.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. And maybe question for Bill Parker just on credit, I know it\u2019s really kind of a non-issue at this point but I remember\u2026", "Bill Parker", "You want me to talk about credit. I am here.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Well, that\u2019s part of this is that, I remember when you broke through a 100 basis points of charge-offs and that was -- that seem like a big thing and you talked about maybe been a 90 to 100 basis point charge-off bank. Now it seems like we\u2019re bouncing around 60. Is this the trough bill or is this feel like normal where it\u2019s kind of bounce around or whether the puts and takes in terms of a loss outlook?", "Bill Parker", "Well, in terms of the environment we\u2019re in, which is a stable economy, modestly improving economy, yes our outlook for our losses are fairly stable. The one area we still have some room for improvement and based on the decline and delinquencies that we saw this quarter would be in residential mortgage. So, there is still room for improvement there. But for this type of environment that, that 90 to 100 that you mentioned we\u2019d refine that every quarter, right now it\u2019s 96. But that's a through the cycle measure, it looks of good times and the bad times. So right now where we\u2019re at is a comfortable spot for this type of environment.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And Bill anything making you nervous or anything where you\u2019re holding the line and saying that we\u2019re not going to do that?", "Bill Parker", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job for some of those. But in general, we have not materially changed any of our underwriting standards. The only thing we did coming out of the downturn was do some controlled expansion on our indirect auto portfolio, that's gone well. We\u2019ve had strong originations in that space, but it\u2019s all very high credit quality.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Bill Parker", "Thanks Jon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Werner with Morningstar.", "Dan Werner - Morningstar", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess relative to with credit quality kind of expanding on that, with commercial loan growing and kind of driving the loan growth here and stable credit quality you\u2019re still releasing reserves here. Should we expect that to continue or reverse going forward as loans continue to grow here?", "Bill Parker", "Well, some day, yes. And I can\u2019t tell you the exact infection point. But our reserve release this quarter was $25 million, so very modest less than or about a penny of share. So whether we release a little or start adding a little depending upon the strength of loan and commitment growth, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not that relevant to the earnings potential going forward. But we watch that, we still have little bit of credit improvement to go and so we watch that balance that with our loan and commitment growth.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, Dan, it will be a super easily telegraph very soft turning the corner that if when that happens in the inflection. So, you won\u2019t be surprised by one quarter over the next because it\u2019s a very slow process. And eventually I\u2019d love to be adding to loan losses because the loan growth is so robust and because we should prepare for years forward. So, that to me at the end of the day won\u2019t be a bad outcome, but we\u2019re not there yet.", "Dan Werner - Morningstar", "Okay. And then second question on mortgage revenue, I had in my notes that to expect like between $225 million and $250 million in revenue, is that still consistent or relatively the range that we\u2019re going to see for the rest of the year?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, I think that's in the range. So, if you look into the third quarter versus the second quarter, this is Andy. We would expect mortgage application volume to increase slightly, typical seasonal increases, but the servicing revenue will down a bit. So I would expect it to be flat to down a bit from this quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "If you could just touch on the fee momentum, it looks like you had pretty broad momentum in fee category this quarter. You\u2019ve obviously just touched on the mortgage outlook. But can you just give a sense of which line items or which categories, ex-seasonality in 2Q, you feel like there is good underlying momentum that could carry through in the back half of \u201814?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. This is Andy again. So across our payments businesses, we saw growth in all four categories. I would say most of that government pressure that we had seen in corporate card is behind us and that government actually grew this quarter, as well as corporate. So corporate fees are good, merchant processing fees continue to grow, card fees continue to grow. Our trust and investment management is doing very well both on the wealth management side, as well as the corporate trust side. Commercial product fees, which is reflection of corporate and wholesale activity continues to grow, investment management is growing. So we\u2019re actually seeing growth across many categories of our fees. And including deposit service charge, which is more seasonal and based on days, but really I wouldn\u2019t say there are any particular weaknesses and strong growth across all. And I thank all of them are quite leveraged to an economic recovery. So, to the extent the growth accelerates, so I think we\u2019ll see even accelerated the growth.", "Richard Davis", "And I would add to that, Keith, with interest rates and FX volatility solo that\u2019s the area where that line continues to be under some pressure. But as Andy said, it\u2019s very positively extorted into the economy. So the backlog is good and corporate bond fees are on track. So, we\u2019re seeing some of those coming back to some level that make sense as the economy starts to warm up a bit. But that would be there lag rates as we go through the list of key businesses that we watch.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Thank you. Maybe one for Bill, can you give an update on the sneak review, was any of that in this quarter, I am assuming it\u2019s going to be in the third quarter for you guys, but just any thoughts on the process this year versus past, et cetera.", "Bill Parker", "Yes, I am glad you asked that actually, because usually we do get the results in August, but this year we got them early. So we have processed everything, it\u2019s in our results. Any changes for us were completely immaterial. We had excellent results. We have not seen sort of OCCs that are the regulators industry publication, which give some insights into where they saw stress on really just speaking for our portfolio. But we\u2019re in and done with it and no material impact.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay, thanks. And then last one, seems like GAAP assets were up about 10% year-over-year, the Basel III risk weighted assets were up around 7%, is this just a mix thing meaning more securities, highly rated securities or is there any kind of optimization going on that you guys are focused on?", "Richard David", "It\u2019s exactly what we said. It\u2019s the securities growth at a lower risk weighted asset.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous", "So on the loan growth, I mean clearly you guys are doing very well. I guess, one of the things I\u2019d scratch my head is when I benchmark you to the large domestic banks and the HA or what\u2019s come out so far in the quarter, clearly the 6.7% year-over-year growth ex-charter one is best-in-class. But then when I benchmark you to the kind of head line numbers for the system, it\u2019s about a line. And it seems like that this can act a clearly there is the small bank trend, which you\u2019ve talked about in the past. And I was hoping you could update us on where you see that level of competition? But then B, there is this kind of new trend of foreign banks really growing quite rapidly at least in the total system data. And I was wondering if you could also offer any thoughts you have there? Is that something that is material and you\u2019re seeing in your markets or is that more happening in the capital markets and leverage lending and not really affecting you?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, sure. This is Richard. So, first of all, I guess, I think there are four categories. I think of that you said the kind of domestic banks, I think that the regional banks like us, I think of community banks, and I think of the foreign banks. And our intelligence, neither the community banks nor the foreign banks, was taking any market share or creating any impairment to our growth. So, I can\u2019t really look at all the data that you\u2019re looking at. On the HA we typically are about half to twice better than those averages as we track it ourselves. So it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. Community banks are -- they\u2019re not as diversified, so they will go down the path on one or two loan product type and we\u2019ll fight a good fight in certain smaller markets.", "At the end of the day when you\u2019re looking for a customer with a need for more than just one loan or one type of loan, we typically win the day on that. And the foreign banks maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re more centrally located in the middle of country and even to the West Coast, but they are simply not creating a burden to us that we\u2019ve noticed at this point and they have in the past, so both of those categories have found us in the times before. I think I\u2019ll take it backdoor to the longstanding rationale that we\u2019ve used to take it outside of it, I wonder what they are doing to, that make sense category and that is our funding advantage is just substantial, I mean they\u2019re real.", "They\u2019re very real and they are very big. And you compare to any of those other three groups from the larger money center banks, to the community banks, to the foreign banks, we view them every time. So thus for this management team getting greedy or sloppy and letting too much of that benefit go away altogether, we\u2019re letting it build itself out. I mean the higher pricing benefits to the highest quality customer, which is why we can have high quality, have growth and have that on a lower risk side and use some of that advantage. So hopefully that makes sense as to why we\u2019re doing. There is no magic here and there is no sustainably risk of this going away unless we were to harm our own ratings. So we\u2019re not planning to do that either. So, hopefully Brian that gives you a little more color.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous", "That does. Thank you. All my other questions have been asked. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "I am express a little bit of concern about the behavior of consumer deposits as rates rise and wondered if you\u2019ve given much thought to the issues if you guys are testing, if you see the need for any new or different products this time around or if you expect things to be pretty sticky?", "Andy Cecere", "Nancy, this is Andy. I do think we\u2019re going to see a decline in deposits overall more than what we had seen historically when rates start to move up and we\u2019ve actually modeled that in our rate sensitivity when we give you our numbers. The best example I think is our DDA levels have gone from about $50 billion to almost $74 billion and I do expect, because there is low opportunity cost of that DDA today as rates move up, we\u2019re going to see some decline there. So, we are modeling it that way. We are preparing for it that way. And we also have a number of consumer products that we\u2019re testing in different markets in terms of a little higher rate to continue to grow core deposits.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, and I\u2019ll add to that Nancy. I said home deposit start to fall because that would be a great indicator that people are using their cash. As you know then they\u2019ll use our -- the line they have been paying for and then they will give a new line. That brings me to utilization a little bit. We are seeing utilization continue to be slowly but surely getting better, slowly is the operative. We are not seeing a huge turn but actually this last quarter was the first increase in our wholesale utilization since 2008, smaller than it might be that\u2019s a pretty big deal and that\u2019s along with the potential of deposits starting to come out. Those would be actually good signs I think of consumers and businesses using their money and then some of our money to kind of fund their growth.", "But I will say we also have this advantage that we want to remind people of on the core deposit side with our corporate trust business, which has a fair amount of contractual difference and distinction 15% or so of our non-interest bearing comes from that safer category. And no matter what the stress test that we provide will result in, it allows us with a little bit more of a foundation core deposits that at the end again with this corporate trust we don\u2019t talk enough about but provides the distinction and the uniqueness to our portfolio.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Thanks for pointing that out. Richard, your thoughts about the payments businesses right now, are you seeing any opportunities, are you more or less excited as you see better economic activity to add to the payments portfolio?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I am really loving it I mean we have it. One of the things I often say to you Nancy directly and the others is, if you like us now you are going to love us all when things get better. But one of the things that we haven\u2019t talk much about is the R&D that we have been spending on payment, mobile payments, not thinking so much as payment which is a space we should be leading in. And there are so many derivatives of what possibly happen and next that people wanting to pay for things and track things and move things. And just about every single prototype we can think of, testing all kinds of different programs and I look forward to the chance to showcase some of those outcomes. It\u2019s our style not to talk about the things we are filing because I want to try them first and while I telegraph that to others and if they don\u2019t work then you will never know and if they do we will brag about it endlessly.", "But I think payments it\u2019s going to be that next step and I think of my response to the question that Bill or Brian asked, I think it\u2019s going to be the replacement fee opportunity for banks as we get to the more core checking cost and start getting paid for helping people see, track and move their money more naturally and more quickly in this environment. So I like payment for that reason and I like to diversify. Andy, told you government is turning the corner at least stop shrinking, corporate is getting strong as some of these other green shoots we\u2019ve seen in C&I and the consumer, based on credit volume year-over-year, was up 9%, debit was 5% and prepaid, which is our favorite new space which we have created and graded up 22%.

I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Sean O'Connor", "Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.

Davis", "Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results, with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.", "U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Excluding the impact from the Charter One acquisition we completed in late June, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% on a linked quarter basis. In addition, we experienced strong loan -- strong growth in average deposits, and credit quality remains strong.", "Total net charge-offs decreased by 3.7% on a linked quarter basis. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. It generates significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach has been fully implemented. It was 9% at September 30th. We repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the third quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 78% return of earnings to our shareholders in the third quarter.", "Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.51%, and return on average common equity was 14.5%. Moving over to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.16%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s, going forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income, as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $15 billion or 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, which is a runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.7% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter.", "Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 13.6% year-over-year and 3.1% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loans growing by 6.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 5.8% year-over-year and 0.3% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 4.9% year-over-year and were up 2.1% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.6% year-over-year and 1.6% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.", "Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat again in the third quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.4% over the same quarter of last year and 3.3% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remains strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in low-cost savings deposits is particularly strong on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.", "Turning to Slide 7 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 3.7% on a linked-quarter basis and rose modestly on a year-over-year basis due to an unusually high recovery in third quarter of 2013. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.55% in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 6.2% from the third quarter of 2013 and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis.", "During the third quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, equal to the reserve released in the prior quarter and $5 million less than in the third quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our third quarter results.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you see a view of our third quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods.", "Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of 2013 and equal to the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9.", "The $3 million or 0.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue. The company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.", "Net interest income was up 1.3% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. The $31.4 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans, as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $1.4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year.", "The net interest margin of 3.16% was 27 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates and new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to previously communicated wind down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product.", "Noninterest income increased $65 million or 3% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury management fees, commercial products revenue and investment product fees. Noninterest income increased year-over-year by $49 million or 1.9%, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities.", "Net income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $24 million or 1.6%, mainly due to the increase of noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The second quarter of 2014 included 2 previously disclosed notable items impacting non -- other noninterest income and other noninterest expense, that together had no impact to diluted earnings per common share.", "On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 0.1% due to an increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. Net interest margin of 3.16% was, as expected, 11 basis points lower than the second quarter. Principally, due to the growth of lower rate investment securities and lower loan fees due to the Checking Account Advance product wind down. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $202 million or 8.3%, primarily due to the second quarter Visa stock sale, lower mortgage banking revenue and lower commercial products revenue, partially offset by higher deposit service charges, corporate payments products' revenue and trust and investment management revenue.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $139 million or 5% due to the second quarter FHA DOJ settlement in Other expense, partially offset by Charter One merger integration costs and higher mortgage servicing-related costs.", "Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirement effective for the company followed Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next 4 years, to full implementation by January 1, 2018. In addition, beginning with the second quarter of 2014, the advanced approaches portion of Basel III became effective for the company. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated, using in the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30, was 9%. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.66 at September 30, representing a 13.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.6% increase over the prior quarter.", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide 11.", "We remain focused on extending our advantage, which is our theme for 2014. Our consistently solid financial performance is a result of our adhering closely to the core fundamentals of controlling expenses, of managing capital prudently, and selectively investing in initiatives that generates steady, long-term growth, and expanding existing customer relationships. That was certainly the case in third quarter, as our disciplined approach produced positive operating leverage.", "As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain diligently focused on executing our plan, even with the ongoing economic headwinds, with an emphasis on providing our customers with the trusted products and services to help them build more secure financial futures, backed by the financial strength of U.S. Bank.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is Jessica Ribner in for Paul Miller. We just have one question. It's just taking into account the recent changes announced by the FHFA in terms of the 3% down payment and some reps and warrants clarity, does that change the way that you think about originating down the credit spectrum in the mortgage space? Or how do you guys view that?", "Richard K. Davis", "It really doesn't. This is Richard. It's a good sound bite, but I think the test comes in whether or not there's a private market for investors to pick up these loans with lower or no down payment, and I'm not sure there will be. So we're going to continue to stick with the FHFA, Freddie and Fannie deals that we originate, that we sell off. We'll continue to originate loans that we hold on the balance sheet for our more well-heeled customers. And we'll continue to watch the progress in this space, because we like very much to feel more comfortable making loans with, I'd say, either a lower FICO or with less down payment. But unless we're convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there's not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times, or that there won't be a market for this, we're simply going to stay on the sidelines in the concerns of both compliance risks and other uncertainties, and we'll just continue to do what we're doing now, which I think is sufficient for the near term.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And what do you -- just a follow-up to that. What do you think would -- what do you think that they would have to say or come out with to make you more comfortable in that space? Because you were talking about a reach back or something like that.", "Richard K. Davis", "Right, right. No, that's a great question, Jessica, and I'm not sure I have the answer to that because I'd have to see it, believe it, and then test it. And so it's going to take a while for me to have a belief that this litigation risk isn't as great as compliance risk, which used to be both less important than credit risk. So when you think about all the risks we have, credit risk, we can manage. We've done that through the whole cycle, and we did it well before. In terms of litigation risk, that's kind of the new uncertainty. And with the statute, I think, of time coming up on us, there may be a softening of some of those look back, reach back. But in where I started, there's a private market out there that's got to say they want to buy these loans without the guarantees and they've got to be willing to take those loans on with those lesser quality customers under the risk that perhaps they won't repay. And that's going to be a market that's going to be tested over time, with the number of players that will have a chance to come in. And once we see that appetite, that will probably be the first evidence we'll be looking for.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just wondering about the outlook for the net interest margin next quarter. Andy, could you give us some other puts and takes for the margin and what kind of outlook you have for net interest margin and net interest income growth?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, John. So if you think about the third quarter versus second, we were down 11 basis points, and that was 3 things. One -- the first is 5 basis points for CAA, and that's done. So that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. The second was about 3 basis points for the securities build, and that will continue on in the fourth quarter. We ended this quarter at about $96.5 billion. We'll end the fourth quarter just over $100 billion. So we'll have additional migration down, because of that 3 to 4 basis points. The third factor was the loan mix. Most of our growth was in wholesale, as opposed to retail, and that was 2 to 3 basis points of pressure. That will continue likely into the fourth quarter also. So all in, down 5 to 7 for the fourth quarter, but I still expect net interest income to grow. And then finally, that pressure on securities build will diminish, will go away beginning in 2015.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. You'll be done, you think, by the first quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "We'll -- our expectation is that we'll end this year at or above 100% on the LCR ratio. So our net securities growth will be more consistent with the overall balance sheet growth, as opposed to building additional to meet the LCR ratio.", "Richard K. Davis", "So John, NIM compression. All that remains for '15 is loan mix and interest rates, in general. But we've really gotten rid of the other variables that have been moving all through this year, taking the number down.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And Richard, could you give us some color on your feelings about loan growth from here, both just kind of the absolute level of growth you're looking for and then the mix factors?", "Richard K. Davis", "I'm feeling pretty good, actually. So let me just -- I should say this to all of you. First, I'm glad to see that you're even on the call. I thought being last, we might not have anybody come to our party. We always announce our earnings...", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Reporting with 10 other banks this time?", "Richard K. Davis", "Well, I'll tell you what. Who cares about what we have the say now, right? We have always announced earnings on the Wednesday after our Board meeting, and the Board meeting has always been the third Tuesday. For the first time in my years as CEO, my 8 years as a CEO, the -- that created [ph] the fourth Wednesday. And so that's why we're still late in the cycle, I'm talking to all of you a week later. We've amended that with the Board, and we're going to go back to announcing on the third Wednesday. So this will be the last time we have this trailer keeping you from writing your final reports. And so I just want to make that clear. By the same token, though, I have this great visibility and clarity I've never had before and what the other banks have been saying. And so, I'm going to say, we're generally positive about loan growth, and I'm saying that for the following reasons. As Andy indicated, we had the 1.4% linked quarter growth. If you take out the Capital One acquisition, it's 1.1%, and that's right in the range of what we telegraphed. And we're going to telegraph that again for quarter 4. We think we're in that same place, as we are still moving into the early stages of the fourth quarter. We're seeing it across the board, too, John. So, I mean, we're seeing in Wholesale Banking. We're seeing people continue to support capital expenditures, particularly in large ticket leasing and in corporate banking. We're seeing the pipeline across all energy -- industries stronger as the year ages, which is pretty positive. We're also seeing the leverage portion of the market remains pretty fast-growing, but we don't participate much in that and there's a regulatory oversight that's more heavy at this point in time, and so it doesn't affect us near as much. And then a strong market, bond market is still strong. So that does take some of the loan volume away. But overall, we don't see anything less than we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Commercial real estate, still pretty strong. If you look at the West, East Coast and you take kind of the smile down to Texas and you move around, we see it's pretty active across most property-buying areas. We're seeing some investors getting into the central part of the country, Minneapolis, Denver and Phoenix, places like that. Property types are looking good. Apartments, retail, offices, lodging properties, and we're seeing people get lines of credit and using their lines for property acquisitions. And then we're seeing also nice strength in home equity. For the first time, we're actually putting more on the books than are running off, now that we're in that part of the cycle. Auto loans continue to be a strong point for us, and credit cards are growing nicely and are expected to, as you might expect, in the fourth quarter, seasonally get even stronger. So I mean, 1 to 1.5 and probably right around this 1 to 1.2 that we've been at isn't robust, but it's pretty solid. And what we're seeing is nice consistency, and our pipelines would reflect not only what we're hearing anecdotally, but the real facts that we've got some loan growth still well into our future. Having low interest rates isn't great for income, but it's pretty good for lending, and people continue to see that benefit. And we have that cost of funding advantage we've told you about, allow us to lend to the highest quality customers at a preferred price, and we're going to keep doing it.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And a little bit more led by the commercial, which is the loan mix impact on the NIM.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I think it's very much the same. What you'll seen in the last few quarter will be very much the same, dominated by C&I, but started -- consumers starting to vie for its position now. Quarter 4 will be strong consumer with credit card, but will still be heavily mixed toward C&I, which will still put some pressure on NIM. But as we talked, it starts to wane later into the process.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. One quickie on the noninterest income. The credit and debit card revenues were a little lighter than expected. You mentioned rewards costs in the write-up. Is that kind of the new cost of business in a reward-centric world here? Is it -- any kind of onetime catch-up in there?", "Andrew Cecere", "This is Andy, John. So 2 things. One is just a number of processing days this year -- this quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013 caused a couple of percentage points decline. It was 90 days versus 94. So that's just the nuance with the number of business days. And the second thing was the rewards, which is a little bit elevated, but I would expect it to be at this level or slightly downward in the future quarters. But if you think about it, cards, on a core basis x the processing days, was up closer to 5% to 6%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David George of Baird.", "David A. George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Richard, I wanted to dovetail to John's question. It's more a big picture, but it's a very popular macro topic, and that's rates. Wanted to get not so much your views on rates, but more from the perspective of how you're thinking about running the company, allocating capital, making incremental investment, et cetera. Do you run the company any differently if rates stay here longer than people think? And any kind of industry implications that you think that emanate from that, to the extent that macro backdrop persists.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, David, that's a great question, and we're still evaluating our final view on what the rates will be, because just a couple of weeks ago, it might well have been a different scenario, right, based on what the prevailing view was, that rates will start moving up in the middle of the year, and now, people are thinking later next year. Here's how we've been running it this year. So it was February 15. I remember the exact date. Exactly the center of quarter 1. And remember, it was a very tough winter quarter for every business. And we decided to adjust our plan, all of 45 days into the year, and we placed a hold on FTE in the company. Let me repeat this, as I told you about this last time, too, that it's -- it's a response to your question. By placing hold on FTE, we didn't put in a hiring freeze. So if you have 881 people in your division, you can have 881 people. And in fact, I'm going to encourage you, now more than ever, to make sure that the 881 best people you could possibly have, because there's no limit on the quality of the people in the organization. But you can't go to 895 and you can't get to 906, until we see a revenue environment that's a little bit stronger. And so but for our compliance and compliance-related activities, where we didn't put any kind of a hold, based on what we think is appropriate regulatory focus, we've been doing that with quite good success. You might imagine one of my challenge is to have the employees of this company feel proud that because they're working harder, is why we're doing well, as opposed to make them wonder why we're doing so well and why am I working so hard. And we were trying to get that conversation organized properly, but I wouldn't hesitate to ask the employees to continue to do that onto the next year, if that's what the environment's going to state, because we really do want to give you guys positive operating leverage to our shareholders on an annual basis, I've always said, not in any 1 given quarter. And the way to do that is to decide what your revenue guardrails will be and then to stay within those, based on your expenses. And with the cost of healthcare and the cost of merit increases, what's left is to make sure you've got enough to not overspend, before you have the revenue. So we won't do more of what we did this year, the longer rates stay low or flat next year. By the same token, the minute we believe they're on their way up, we'll start to release some of those levels of limits and start moving forward more quickly. Let me also clarify, before I hear it my own way, that we're not slowing down on our investments, or our capital expenditures, or some of the longer-term necessary things you need to do to be ready for our future. So we're putting all that into that long-term view of what's most important and prioritizing, so we're still spending money. And as you know, our expenses are still growing, just at a level less than our revenue, and that's how we'll continue to do it. But I will agree that the minute rates start moving up and we see evidence, it gets a lot easier to run a company this long into a recession and a downturn.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is, Richard, you have always taken advantage of increasing your market share when your peers are challenged. And based on Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like some of your larger peers may have to contend with higher buffers on common equity Tier 1. I guess I'm wondering, if that does transpire and you have some of your larger peers operating it 11.5, 12, 12.5, does that -- do you think that presents a further opportunity for U.S. Bank, being that you would be under that G-SIB requirement?", "Richard K. Davis", "I'll tell you, Erika, I think it's just a continuation of the benefits we've experienced, because first of all, you know that even if that occurs, it doesn't have to be overnight. And not unlike us, but most things, as we continue to get healthier, are creating capital. So I don't think that's a real burden for them into getting there. And I don't think it's any different than it's been for the last of couple of years, as we've been a SIFI and they've have been G-SIFIs. But I do think at the end of the day, our ability to be more profitable, be more attractive to shareholders and have a simpler, easier company to understand and invest in, I think that continues to become more and more obvious, and that's why we think we're in a particularly good position, where we are, as the first non-G-SIB, and I think there are advantages, many of which are continuing and some which might get a little stronger. But I don't think that very event changed any near-term outcome, and it just continues to remind us how fortunate we are.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just a follow-up question to that. As we think about long-term capital return prospects for the company, which ratio should we think of as your binding constraint, the standardized CET1 or advanced?", "Andrew Cecere", "Standardized, Erika. So our advanced ratio's 200-plus basis points above our advanced, so our standardized will be our binding constraint and our target is 8%.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So a couple of questions. One, a follow on to that. On the funding side, is there an opportunity here, with the rate environment, to maybe reset, reduce some of the longer-term funding cost that you've got?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, Betsy. So when I gave you my expectation for rates into the fourth quarter and stability into next year, it reflects the fact that we have some long-term debt coming due, and that will be refunding or repricing it at a lower rate.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And you could even take advantage to do more than just what's coming due, or no?", "Andrew Cecere", "I think our focus will be on what is maturing, which is planned over the next 12 months.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then separately, in the payment space, obviously, you've got a great position, with effectively a closed loop or pretty close to a closed loop. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about your own digital wallet, as well as broadening out use of tokenization for security-related purposes beyond just payments?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. Well, those are different questions. Digital wallet, I think you know we continue to invest in, virtually, every scheme we can find and each partner that we have, many of which we don't announce. It's not our plan to announce things until onset. But I'll just remind you that we are both a leader in mobile banking, but even more so, in mobile payments, because as you said, we have a closed loop capability. We've got all sides of the equation, and we're leveraging that. I might also say that -- it wouldn't surprise you, but we do a lot with customers. We have certain customer groups that we've put together that help us think through the next best ideas. And we gauge the tenor and interest of some customers, both small and large, into what kind of things they may want. A closed loop, as you know, it has to be a large enough critical mass, that there's enough interest in all parties to see the benefits of staying outside of the, we'll call it, the normal freeway. And we still haven't found that combination yet, and I don't know that we will. But we're going to keep looking for it and do our very best to use that digital environment that's advantage to us with that firing business to check it out. As it relates to tokenization, we're very fond of that because not only are we involved in it, but particularly through the clearing house, we're working on a tokenization project for all the 24 largest volume banks in the country. Clearing house, as you know, the half owner of the ACH system, the other half being the Federal Reserve. And so we're working with them on tokenization. And answering a question you didn't ask, tokenization really will solve a number of these issues, which in the interim, look like they're being solved by the chip card or the EMV solution. Those are really just a different alternative to a magnetic stripe. And at the end of the day, this tokenization is going to give us all the protections we're seeking. If you think of the Apple Pay, that's tokenization plus biometrics, which allows for a different kind of protection, and there'll be all kinds of combinations. But look, banks are going to seek whatever it can, we can, to have lower fraud losses, because as you know, most of these hacking circumstances, whether we issue the cards now or later, if there's any losses, the banks take those losses, and there's substantial amounts of money that have been in our run rates for years. And to the extent that we can find a way to make the customer safer, not make them feel burdened by having to become safer, it reduces our fraud on the other side and it creates a safer environment. Tokenization is going to provide a great solve to that, and then cybersecurity also gets an advantage as to higher levels of authentication. So I'll just say, to answer your question, we're at the leading-edge of all those topics, either because of our position in the association or because of our capability being a full-on payments provider, and we're testing all kinds of different scenarios and yet, I have nothing grand enough to announce to you here because we haven't found the holy grail yet on closed loop and we're continuing to watch for it.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. But also on tokenization, just to be clear, you could see the opportunity to use that technology not only in payments, but also in your own internal peer-to-peer or customer access to funds and funds transfer?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. And it's probably not tokenization as much as there could be a number of versions of closed loop, more protected interchanges between, let's say, large banks that could do things much more quickly. That's a different answer, as we're talking about a faster payments network and moving away from the 24-hour cycle. And we're announcing, I think, very soon, that we're all going to be working on faster payment cycles. The precursor to that, though, could be bank-to-bank or large entities-to-large entities doing intra-day transfers on a trusted basis, like you would with a friend, and accelerating what would otherwise be the natural and final evolution of the entire payment system from a 24-hour cycle to a real time. That's probably a couple of years away, but following the path of some other places around the globe and following the favor of customers, we're all working on that, and I think that's something that you'll be hearing a lot more about in the next couple of quarters.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, that makes a lot of sense, especially given the Fed white paper that asks for 10 years, which seems way too long. So then last question, just slightly separate topic, but the progress on the near-prime push in auto. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about that and how that's impacting pretax margin?", "Richard K. Davis", "I'm going to have Bill answer that question.", "P. W. Parker", "It's been successful. It's enabled us to provide a broader spectrum of yes answers in the dealership office. So -- and we've expanded our -- in our presence in the used car market as well. And it's positive on the net -- overall net interest margin on our indirect dealer book. So it's doing well, and it's performing as we expected.", "Richard K. Davis", "In broader context, if we recall, so just being a prime lender to an auto dealer, now that we're doing used auto and some near-prime and the prime, we get a higher shot at getting their floor planning and getting the rest of their business, because now we're in all the categories they want, not just selectively picking prime. So there is another advantage. And I also should say we've been a leasing bank for 61 years, which is back when leasing started. So we've got a long tenure there that, I think, in a less competitive environment for auto leasing, we're going to continue to expand that. And as rates go up, trust me, that's one of the first things you'll see, is people flipping from loans to leases for payment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on the expenses, Andy. I heard your comments about that kind of in the other, there seemed to be kind of a plus or minus, some offsetting. So is this the kind of the right base for expenses going forward? And to Richard's comment about staying in the low-50s efficiency ratio, what does that imply for the ability to deliver operating leverages? Is it really just about getting rates up at some point from here?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right, Ken. So in the third quarter, we had a couple of items that are not going to repeat. We had about just under $20 million of conversion-related expenses, principally related to our RBS acquisition, or Charter One acquisition in Chicago. Those will not repeat into the fourth quarter. The third quarter also continues to build our tax amortization for our CDC company, and that will continue to increase in the fourth quarter. That's just seasonal. And in the fourth quarter, typically, it's about $75 million or $80 million higher than the third quarter. So you'll see that, and that, again, comes down in the first quarter. All in though, I do expect positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and I do expect our efficiency ratio will continue to be in the low-50s.", "Richard K. Davis", "You know what else, Ken, we're not there yet, but I think the -- we're probably at the highest level of total compliance and audit-related cost we're going to have over this cycle. I don't see them coming down right away, so I'm not saying that. But they aren't sustainably this high for the long term. So there will be another advantage and it happen probably sometime next year, where just the run rate and the expenses start to come down a bit, based on some of the focus we've all had and certain categories that we'll settle. And so it's not immediate. But I think it would be improper to believe that our current expense base, related to all that, this very quarter or the ones you've seen in the last couple, are the normal high rate, because they're not going to be that high.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Understood. Okay, great. And just a second question on just the mortgage business. This quarter you had a huge jump in origination volume, and it looks like the apps are pretty flat and it looks like the MSR hedge came down, as you had forecasted for us a quarter ago. So can you just walk us through the drivers from here on the revenue side in the mortgage business?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So in the -- as you mentioned, in the second quarter, we had a gain on servicing that did not repeat in the third quarter. If you stripped that out, we're relatively flat. And, actually, application volume was also relatively flat. Fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower. I would expect that to occur this year, and that will result in revenue being a little lower. I would call somewhere between 5% and 15%, principally, due to seasonality.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I had a question on your funding advantage. It hasn't arguably been as much of an advantage as it could be, given the strong deposit growth that we've been seeing across the industry. But I wondered if you thought that my change, particularly if QE is indeed over after this month and deposit growth starts to slow, not necessarily turn negative, just slow. So I guess a 2-part question. First, do you think deposit growth will slow, with the end of QE? And then secondly, would your funding advantage become more valuable in that kind of environment, assuming that loan growth continues?", "Andrew Cecere", "Right. So Bill, we do assume that at end of QE or when rates start to rise, we do assume an outflow of deposits. That's part of our rate sensitivity analysis, and I do think the funding advantage will become more explicit and clear when that occurs. It's there now because we still have some debt on the books and I think that advantage shows itself, but it will show itself more as more debt replaces deposits as rates move up. And importantly, about 15% of our deposits are corporate trust-related, which are less sensitive to rates moving up, so it's more a function of the operating model of the Corporate Trust business. So that helps us retain a core level of, particularly, DDA deposits that will be helpful as rates move up.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Great. But I was hoping maybe to follow up on that, Andy. If maybe you could separate for us the rise in rates, which there are some concerns that, that's being pushed farther out in the end of QE, which many believe is still going to happen this month. So if we have that scenario, where maybe we just set the higher rates aside for a second and just look at the impact of QE coming to an end, would that alone be enough to slow industry deposit growth and bring the funding advantage to be more -- play more of an important role?", "Andrew Cecere", "I think what will slow the deposit growth will be a growth in the economy and as business to start to invest more in growth and expansion and such, I think the first place they'll go is their own funds, which are currently in our balance sheet, and I think that will be the principal change. And then secondly, as rates start to move up, the opportunity cost to having money in DDA goes up, and I think you'll start to see a shift out of DDA. But when the economy starts to grow, the first place, before we see loan growth, we'll see deposit declines.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Got it. And I wanted to also follow-up on some of your comments about auto. Regulatory intervention has been in focus in auto finance, and I was hoping maybe you could just share any thoughts on the potential for the CFPB to bring nonbank auto finance companies under its oversight and what that could mean for you and the rest of the banking industry, and I guess, particularly to the extent that there are some nonbank lenders who either get pushed out or see the cost of compliance rise.", "Richard K. Davis", "Bill, this is Richard. I think until we see any evidence of the CFPB ring-fencing any activities with the non-banks, we're just going to presume it will stay the way it is. As you can see, it didn't stop us as a banking industry to stay in the business. We're dealing with a little higher level of risk, as it relates to the fair lending rules and things that have been said. But I think we've all gotten better at it and know what the risks are. We still are the best, I think, providers of lending to the auto businesses because of our cost of funding and because we are more traditional banks. I've heard the same thing you've heard, and I appreciate the fact that they're going to get to some of the non-banks. And I do think that if they were, that will be net positive, just because the operating paradigms will be the same for all of us. But it won't change in the near term. It wouldn't change anything we're doing at all. And I don't think, until we see evidence of it for some period of time, like a year or more, many of us are going to adjust any of our thinking, based on that. So it will take a while for them to decide which part of the space they want to get into, what it means to oversee them, what adjustments they may make. And we'll take, I think, such a substantial amount of time, that I wouldn't expect any adjustment for at least a year because it takes that long for something like that to cultivate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a few follow-ups. Bill, can you just touch a little bit on auto charge-offs and where -- what's normal for your portfolio? There's a little bit of an uptick. I'm sure it's explainable, but just maybe give us an idea of what's going on there.", "P. W. Parker", "Well, part of that is related to the expansion that we talked about earlier, going into the near-prime space, so some of that's coming to season. And then seasonally, there's usually higher losses in the wintertime and in the summer months. So that's all relatively normal and just most of our book is still -- even though we did expand the low-end, most of the book is still very prime, high prime portfolios. So the level of losses you see this quarter, it'll be pretty stable from there.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. Andy or Richard, just on the risk and compliance spending, I think that's good news that we're maybe at the peak. But can you give us an idea of the magnitude, maybe year-over-year, in terms of spending and FTEs that you have devoted to risk and compliance?", "Andrew Cecere", "Think about the third quarter versus a year ago, I would say we have somewhere between $30 million and $40 million of additional expense and the run rate related risk and compliance.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, all right. But you're thinking that, that is near the peak at this point?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. But I also said it stays there for a while. So in the midterm, it goes down. There's a new permanent level. You didn't ask Andy for 3 to 5 years ago, but it would be probably 3x what it was a couple of years ago. And so we're getting to that place now, and we'll just reassign some of the party. Because compliance, as you know, isn't just a unit or division. It's across every part of the business line. So even myself, team and the front lines, all need to have a more of a compliance view or call it the first line of defense, so every employee has to be thinking more appropriately about doing things perfectly the first time, and therefore, there's an extra cost in each incremental FTE. So it's not just a group we bring in, but it's the way of doing business. And we've adding that to everybody's job over the last couple of years. Plus, we've been having outside third parties, and we've added a bulked up staff in certain places to deal with regulatory issues to align with the new higher bar of heightened standards. But once we get that settled, I can see some of that going back down a bit as we get more efficient and, as you know, we're pretty efficient, once we know what the rules are.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one more on capital return. Richard, your, sometimes, quotes get taken out of context, but you're on the record of saying that you think 2015 could take off. I'm wondering if you feel like the capital return and the current range is appropriate for next year. Do you feel like you can potentially return more? Do you feel like you need to retain some more for some maybe greater expected balance sheet growth in 2015? Just walk us through that.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, Jon, that's a hard question, right? But I'll tell you, to the extent that we can operate and have now for at least 5 years in this is very low interest rate, slow economy, I think we have proven our ability to withstand a more challenging environment. But we're looking forward to the moment when I think when rates move up, it's less a proxy for the fact that we're poised to do better when rates move up. It means that the economy is doing better, and we get way more benefit out of that. And so for me, it's approximately when the economy starts to turn up. We certainly think we can protect our capital positions, that's for sure, because we know how to manage in an environment like this. But the sooner rates move up, and again, it's a proxy for the economy doing better, the sooner we'll be able to telegraph that we'll be increasing our capital distributions. Until we see that, I'm going to stay in path and just indicate there's a positive bias that as soon as we see economy improve, we're certainly safe on what we have, but we're going to be careful on telegraphing when we can move up until we can see a more sustained revenue environment, which allows us, therefore, to predict a higher level of capital return.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just maybe, Andy, a question for you related to expenses next year. Questions have come up on a couple of earlier calls about pension expense. I think you guided, this year, that pension expense will be down about -- will be down a bit from the prior year. And I'm just curious -- I realize we're not at year-end when you set the pension rate and the -- or the discount rate and the pension expense, but how are you thinking about pension expenses affecting your overall expenses in 2015?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, Matt. So if you think about '13 and '14, because of the increase in the discount rate, we actually had a lower pension rate expense of about $130 million on an annual basis. If I were going to reset the rate today, I'd lose that $100 million or so, because rates are back to where they were a year ago. But as you said, we won't know that until the end of the year.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just a question. Richard, I think you mentioned home equity loans were growing. That's a relatively new trend. Could you give us a little more color on where that demand is coming from? Are there any geographies that are growing faster in that product specifically than you've seen in the past? And I'm just curious about any color you can provide on competition from either larger regional banks or maybe some of the smaller local banks, who are looking to get into that space as well.", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes. So now, let's go back to the beginning. U.S. Bancorp balance sheet doesn't have an oversized home equity portfolio. Never have. And if you look back to just the mortgage business, one of the things we didn't have going into the recession was an overly active sub-prime or near-prime mortgage business either. So we're not feeding off of a lot of runoff. We don't have a lot of deals that are coming due at their 5 or 7-year mark, that might have been originated in the earlier days. So we actually have a pretty core steady book. So for us, it's really simply a matter of the paydowns now are being outpaced by the new originations. And again, you look at the size of our portfolio, it's pretty average. And that's okay because the quality is very high. The application levels are particularly high right now and we are very aggressive in our marketing campaign with an intro rate pricing feature, and that's across the entire 25 states, and that's serving us quite well. I think when I was talking about our pricing advantages, everyone on the call rightfully jumps to Wholesale Banking and thinks about the advantages we have on cost of funds, based on our highest debt ratings, and that transcends into better rates and competitive issues on adjustable rate. But we can do it, too, on things like consumer products, as long as we match-fund it properly. And so we have a very strong new account pipeline going now, and the activation rate is even more impressive. So I'll give you an example. Our 6-month activation rate a year ago was 61%. So we get a line of credit on in 61%, within 6 months later was being used. That's now up to 77%. And so that means that we're finding better customers who really want it and need it and are using it, and increased that with the rate -- fixed rate lock option, which is another feature we've included in our advertising. And we are spending money to talk about it, in both social media and in traditional marketing that, that will be one of our leading products. If you lived in our market, like John does, you'd see the commercials and you'll hear the commercials and you see some of the social media. So we're putting a lot of energy, because we really want that to turn permanently. And we think that, that's one of the best core quality types of loans that you can have. And it's across the whole state, the whole country for us, particularly most notably in the western part, where the balances on markets are growing faster. So home appreciation is related, which totally makes a lot of sense. And I'd say our outlook for quarter 4 is to continue to see some growth in both the originations and the balance sheet. So that's a pretty positive story, off of kind of a slow starting point, but with some permanents around it now, which up until recently, might've been just 1 or 2 months and then a fall backwards, and I think we're on a sustainable growth -- pattern to growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mustascio of KBW.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Andy, I want to -- can you talk a little bit about the merchant acquiring business, the underlying trends? What I'm trying to get at, when I look at acquiring revenue per transaction, that's down about 5% year-over-year, and the acquiring spread is also down about 6% year-over-year. A bigger, a longer trend of deteriorating of those 2 metrics, can you kind of give me some color of what's going on in that business from a kind of a margin and spread perspective?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes. So the DIA rate this quarter was about 40 basis points, and it is down a little bit from a year ago. Two reasons it's down. Number one is that a little bit of the margin pressure, as you talked about. I think that's beginning to stabilize. But we did see the last 12 months have some pressure on pricing. The second factor is the mix of businesses that we acquire for. So to the extent that where large retailers or airlines in particular, that there's a little thinner spread there. But I would say the decline related to margin pressure is beginning to stabilize. The rest of it will be depending upon the mix of spend in the next 12 months.", "Operator", "Final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "I had a few follow-up questions. First, what do you estimate to be your deposit data?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, mike, this is Andy. It ranges from 5% to 90%, depending upon the deposit product. So it's not just one number. We're very detailed by product, by line.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "And on an average?", "Andrew Cecere", "On average, it depends upon the deposit mix we have at any point in time. But if we think about a few years ago where it was, let's say, 20 to 30, it's above that now because of the higher level of DDA and other activities we have. So it's higher than it was in our modeling.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. Richard, you talked about the capital advantage and that gives you a pricing advantage, with higher-quality borrowers. And you said, \"Well, it's not really anything new. It's a continuation.\" But can you somehow quantify that? I mean, you do have required regulatory capital that's significantly below your much larger peers. And I'm just trying to figure out, to what degree does that give you a pricing advantage, which in turn, allows you to gain market share?", "Andrew Cecere", "So Mike, if you think about it, we're assuming our SIFI buffer's about 50 basis points. We don't know that. That's our assumption. That's when we get to our 8%. So if you're a G-SIB that has a 250 buffer, so let's call it 200 basis points more, and you go through the math, we would have about a 30 to 35 basis points advantage to achieve the same return or less than that and get a higher return. So it is not insignificant. It's a pretty significant advantage.", "Richard K. Davis", "And Mike, additionally, which we talked about, when we go in to market, if we have to issue any kind of a debt, we have an advantage to every other bank. And whatever that time period is and however much that raise was, we have that much delta to offer up. And as I said earlier, it could be the wholesale. It could even be the consumer businesses, and there's a net positive. But here's the trick, you only use it on the highest in quality customers, because otherwise, you're starting to dip down into things with loan losses and compliance costs and things you may not really understand. So for us, I'd expect you'll hear on other calls that the pricing competitiveness is still high and pretty peaked. You haven't heard that here because we're either a part of the problem or we choose to use our funding advantage to be more competitive on price, not on underwriting. And for the most part, most of the pricing seems to be pretty stable in the competitive environment as we see it, so we're not feeling disadvantaged by it either.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "So you'd go to the table and you're competing to get a large, high-quality corporate client, and you say, \"We'll price this loan 30 basis points less. Give us your business. Or 25 basis points less.\" Is that the conversation?", "Andrew Cecere", "I would say that's the conversation, more for the middle market. In a large client, it's more of a national funding market. And in that example, I think what the outcome is that we have a high return for the same price.", "Richard K. Davis", "That's right.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Isn't that somewhat similar, though, to other regional banks that also have a capital advantage versus the largest peers?", "Andrew Cecere", "Capital, yes. Debt rating, no.", "Richard K. Davis", "It's the 2fer.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "And then the last question. Richard, to follow up before, you said 2015 can take off. It's right around the corner. I think there are some quotes and data looks great, and we're all thinking, okay, if Richard Davis is right, this economy is set to take off, and then you look at the 10-year bond, which is saying the opposite. So who's right? Richard Davis or the 10-year bond?", "Richard K. Davis", "Wow. I've never met the 10-year bond. I'm going to go with me. But I'll tell you what. I do think, and I've said this before, too, I think the stock market is a head fake, if people using that as a measure of the quality or the wealth of -- the intention of consumers to start spending and acting. In fact, in some respects, the stronger the stock market, it's because there's nowhere else to put it. So I'm not changing my view that in '15, things turn around quickly and start to take off, because when they do take off, I think it's pretty likely they will be fast. And again, the pipelines that I'm talking about, the customer intentions I'm talking about, that's what we're waiting for: the final decision when rates start to move, which will create this, I think, tsunami effect of people acting quickly. I'm going to stick to what I said before, and I think it's next year. And when it does, it happens fast. I don't have any evidence that says otherwise, and I'm not responding to the vagaries of 2 weeks of either 10-year interest rates or stock market variances. I'm just going to stick with it.", "Operator", "That was our final question. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Sean O'Connor", "Well, thank you for listening to our call, and please call me this afternoon if you have any further questions.

I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Sean O'Connor", "Thank you, Paula, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, Bill Parker and Kathy Rogers are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web-site at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Sean. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2014 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported record net income of $5.9 billion for the full year of 2014 or $3.08 per diluted common share. We achieved industry leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.54%, a return on average common equity of 14.7% and an efficiency ratio of 53.2%. Total average loans grew by 6.3% and average deposits grew a strong 6.5% year-over-year.", "Credit quality continued to improve with an 8.9% decline in net charge offs and 11.2% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented of 9%. In total, we returned $4 billion or 72% of our 2014 earnings to the shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.", "Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 or $0.79 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked-quarter. In addition, we continued to experience strong loan growth, strong growth in average deposits.", "Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 8.3% from the prior quarter while total non-performing assets declined 6% on a linked-quarter basis. We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented was 9% at December 31. We repurchased 11 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 66% return of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter.", "Slide 5 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.5% and return on average common equity was 14.4%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.14%, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.3%, lower than the prior year. Excluding the impact of notable items in the fourth quarter, our efficiency ratio was 53.8%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 6, the Company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 5.7% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter's gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen, total net revenue increased 3.2% from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $14 billion or 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.5% year-over-year. Overall and excluding covered loans, which is a run-up portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.1% year-over-year and 1.2% linked-quarter.", "Again this quarter the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 15.5% year-over-year and 2.9% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate loans also grew increasing 4.2% year-over-year and 0.3% linked-quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 2.2% year-over-year and were relatively flat on a linked-quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 3.6% year-over-year and were up 1.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew by 3.6% year-over-year and 0.8% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.", "We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $53 billion in the fourth quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 13.3% and 3% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the fourth quarter.", "Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.2% over the same quarter of last year and 1.6% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 8.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.50% in the fourth quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 6% on a linked-quarter basis and 11.2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The loss sharing agreement for the commercial and commercial real estate loans acquired from the FDIC, which comprised the majority of the nonperforming covered assets, expired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.", "During the fourth quarter, we released $20 million of reserves, $5 million less than the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015.", "Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.79 was 3.9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the Company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 10.", "Fourth quarter results reflected notable items that in combined increased diluted earnings per common share by $0.01. The notable items included $124 million gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen Investments and $88 million of additional expense comprised of $35 million of charitable contributions and $53 million related to recent developments in certain legal matters.", "The $32 million or 2.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income, fee-based revenue and the impact of notable items. The Company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income was up 2.4% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by lower net interest margin including lower loan fees.", "The $35 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 26 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates of new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to the previously communicated wind-down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product.", "Noninterest income increased $214 million or 9.9% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses and higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management fees and investment product fees.", "Noninterest expense increased year-over-year by $122 million or 4.5%, primarily due to the accruals for legal matters, charitable contributions and an increase in compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income was higher on a linked-quarter basis by $17 million or 1.2%, mainly due to the higher net interest income, the impact of the notable items and a decrease in the provision for credit losses.", "On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 1.9%, mainly due to an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by lower loan and investment security rates. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 2 basis points lower than the third quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities, partially offset by unusually high interest recoveries. These unusually high interest recoveries added approximately 2 basis points to the fourth quarter net interest margin.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $128 million or 5.7%. This favorable variance was primarily due to higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and seasonally lower corporate payments revenue.", "On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $119 million or 7.3% due to seasonally higher cost related to investments and tax advantage projects, higher professional services and the notable items including the charitable contributions and legal accruals.", "Turning to Slide 11, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.0%. At 9.0%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.96 at December 31, representing a 10.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.9% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 20% for the fourth quarter. Also, we are complying with fully implemented U.S. liquidity coverage ratio based on our interpretation of the final rolls.", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis", "Thank you, Andy. I'm very proud of our 2014 results. We reported record net income, maintained our industry-leading performance measures and returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders. These results are directly tied to the hard work and dedication of our employees. In fact last week I had the privilege of leading our 9th Annual All Employee Meeting. There was a pleasure to once again make this annual connection with our employees and to thank them for their contributions and for our success.", "I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Andy and Kathy. Yesterday we announced that Andy has been promoted to the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer where he will be responsible for our core lines of business. Andy has demonstrated tremendous leadership as CFO and we are confident in his ability to manage our businesses effectively and execute our customer-focused growth strategy.", "Kathy Rogers, currently EVP responsible for Business Line Planning & Reporting including the stress test process, will replace Andy as Vice Chairman and CFO. Kathy has been with U.S. Bank for 28 years and has served in a variety of leadership roles within the finance organization. Many of you have already met Kathy and I know she looks forward to meeting the rest of you very soon.", "So as we head into 2015, we remain focused on extending our exceptional track record or financial performance for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, Kathy and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Just on the topic of the promotion, I think we're all big Andy supporters, we appreciate the new role for him, but can you maybe share what drove the change and is there anything you are trying to signal or anything that changes with the way the Company is going to be run, and anything change in your role, Richard?", "Richard K. Davis", "My role doesn't change but it is a chance for Andy to demonstrate the same acumen he's had in the financial role by running the revenue business lines, and as we move through this transition I think as the economy starts to get better, I'm quite excited to have him keenly focused on what leverage we can create as the economy picks up. I'll continue to be running the whole Company but focus especially on the support teams and the compliance and the operating integrity that's gotten this Company to this point so far. And it is fairly transparent, it's a chance to give Andy an opportunity to prove that he can run virtually all parts of the Company in the eventual opportunity for him to run it someday.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Good, thank you. And then just a question on 2015 in terms of some of your targets, historically you've had this 4% to 6% loan growth target and I think it kind of changes from quarter to quarter your level of optimism, but are you feeling optimistic and do you feel is that the right range, 4% to 6%, and what does it take to get to the higher end of that?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, Jon, actually I'm optimistic. So we've been sitting in that 1% to 1.5% linked-quarter for a while and this quarter you see we were at the lower end of that, but for the year you look back and we are just short of 6% year-over-year loan growth, and we're just projecting a higher number for 2015, slightly higher, in the high 6, low 7. So if we are accurate, and we usually are, then we see that as a small but steady continued improvement in loan growth.", "Let me take you back to 10 years ago, for those who remember though, we are not going to be dissuaded by people who want to compare us to those who are growing loans faster in a given quarter because we never have been impacted by that, but I could remember 10 years ago being questioned on a call like this for why our loan growth isn't as fast as someone else's, and we're just not managing to that point. We're managing to high-quality loan portfolio. I think our quality of charge-offs and nonperforming assets will prove that.", "And so, tempting as it might be to tell you guys we're going to move to 1.5% to 2% linked quarter or 8% to 10% year-over-year, the economy doesn't warrant that yet and we're going to continue to take market share on the pricing benefits and the quality benefits we've been using for the last five to seven years, and as the economy slowly improves so will our loan growth but not remarkably, and therefore in a few years you'll be satisfied that we have remarkably high credit quality and a continued stability on what we promised through the entire cycle. So, I think we're optimistic for all the right reasons but at a small incremental level from perhaps 1% higher year-over-year than we did in '13.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "When we met back in November, we talked a little bit about outlook for investing in the business and some of the things you were asking the business unit heads to do, and I guess I'm just wondering if the game plan to grow the business with kind of current headcount is still in place, basically wondering if you're thinking about expanding at this stage to capture more market share or to do the same, to grow the market share with the same\u2026?", "Richard K. Davis", "Got it. I'll repeat it in a different way. What we said was 2014 was the year that we'll continue to keep an eye on any discretionary expenses that would otherwise not be as important given the fact that expenses were going to be challenged and the fact that the economy was slow. 2015, I think like a lot of our peers, we've adopted the Fed's interest-rate scenario which starts to move up in the middle of the year. If that happens, that's awesome. But if it doesn't, we're not entirely related. It's not going to make or break this Company on whether interest rates move up. We're going to control a lot of other things.", "So the first half of '15, given Fed's interest-rate scenario, it will a lot like all of '14 where we'll continue to invest where we have to, we'll watch the discretionary investments and keep them perhaps, defer them a bit until we can see a stronger economy, we'll add the compliance, operating risk areas, audit areas where we think we continue to need to make sure we're at the right level of support, and then when interest rates hit, we're ready to pop and move on to some of these more discretionary investments.", "What's really good about it though is we'll continue to grow market share, we'll continue to do well even though there's really no underlying reason for it but the fact that the employees are just better. They work harder, they find more opportunities in each relationship, our employee engagement is at record levels which I think informs employees that are engaged are intensely [indiscernible] where they can do more with whatever assets they are given and they'll continue to do it if they believe the Company's future is strong and that they are part of it.", "So I'm quite comfortable that in the next six months we can keep doing what we've been doing. If rates move up then we are all glad and we're going to move right on to start adding back, but if they don't this Company still controls a lot of levers and we're not completely relying on whether rates move up and we'll just manage it one month at a time like we do every year and look forward to talking to you when things are better.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, so if rates don't go up, there is still the hold the line to the line on headcount expenses?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, except for the areas where it's either necessary or the opportunity is too great to pass. There are plenty of things where you can get an ROI in the same calendar year with an investment. I'm taking all those I can. But some of those ROIs are three-year paybacks, four-year paybacks, they're great ideas but they're not necessarily the best investment at a time when you're trying to be prudent against an otherwise difficult backdrop. So we'll hold those off for a while longer. We have so far and it hasn't hurt us permanently and I don't think it will for another six months, even 12 if we had to.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, so you can flex if the rate environment changes from the said outlook is the takeaway?", "Richard K. Davis", "You got it.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then just the follow-up is on the auto leasing business, we had some information over the last couple of weeks that [indiscernible] was going in house. I'm wondering how that impacts you.", "Richard K. Davis", "Not much. I mean the headlines are sometimes just that. For us the leasing business is part of our very big indirect auto lending and this is leasing, and for us it's probably 10%, maybe 15% of our leasing business, which is a small fraction of our total lending business. So it's not material in every sense of the word literally and figuratively and we do leasing with virtually every other party as well. So this wasn't a core fundamental pillar of our success in auto leasing. So we're not worried that we can't replace it pretty shortly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Richard, I was wondering your kind of high-level thoughts on how you are viewing the revenue to expense relationship unfolding in 2015 given what you laid out for Betsy in terms of your rate outlook, how do you see revenues and expenses kind of in your base case this year and what are the key wildcards?", "Richard K. Davis", "So, John, if you look back on 2014, we grew revenue just a little bit over 1%. This is kind of normalizing for all the noise we had, and expenses were up just a little more than 1%, slightly negative operating leverage. So shame on us, we're disappointed, but it's the way it rolled out.", "If interest rates move up in the middle of the year consistent with the Fed's recommendation, we will see revenue in the 3% to 4% kind of range and expenses more in the 2% to 3% kind of range. If they don't, then we're going to have to struggle to get really close to positive operating leverage just like we did for '14, and to dwell on Betsy's question, we know exactly how to do that without killing the future, but it will be a lot less enjoyable. We'll have to continue to get it through until we see interest rates giving us the benefit of higher revenue.", "I just want to say, we are positive, we're extra positive of interest rates growing but based on our trust and payments business particularly, more than most banks, when interest rates move up, for us it's because the proxy of the economy getting better that then triggers all kinds of benefits on our income statement, a lot more than just the spread in the margin.", "So we kind of see the way we're positioned, we're kind of attuned for interest rates increasing because it's the fundamental reason that the increase is going to benefit some of our fee businesses. But we're going to be positive, we're shooting for positive operating leverage at higher levels of both operating revenue and operating expenses, but to follow Betsy's question and time together, if something less positive occurs we're able to adjust to it and we've got a team that knows how to manage that, they've proven it and we're not going to disappoint you guys.", "John McDonald", "Great. And just a nuance on the rates up scenario and your base case, if the Fed does act in the second half of the year, but we still see long rates low because of global issues, how does that impact the outlook for revenue growth and is that an incremental challenge, and Andy, how do you manage through the balance sheet with long rate so low and does that create pressure on your base case scenario if the 10-year stays low like this?", "Andrew Cecere", "The short answer, John, is no. The long rate is less impactful to us. We're most impactful at the very short end and if you think about the middle then two to three years is where we have a lot of impact. We don't have a lot of assets in our book that are at the 10 year and beyond mark, so that's less impactful. Again the short end is the most impactful to us, both in net interest income as well as fee income because of the way we're using our money funds.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then just a quick follow up, Andy, what's your outlook for the net interest margin in the first quarter?", "Andrew Cecere", "Sure, John. So if you think about this quarter, third quarter we were 3.16%, this quarter we were 3.14% and frankly it was a little bit better than we expected and what we told you it was going to be. And the reason for that, part of the reason for that is we have usually high interest recoveries this quarter, and I talked about that in my prepared remarks, and that helped margin by about 2 basis points. I would expect that to dissipate going into the first quarter.", "So you think about our core being at 3.12%, I would expect us to be down a few basis points in the first quarter from that 3.12% for the same reasons we've talked about, which is the loan mix, principally wholesale versus retail, and then the last tail of our securities build. So we sort of had first average part of it in the fourth quarter, we'll pick up the rest of it in the first quarter. And we are done. We ended the quarter at $100 billion, we're over the 100% LCR ratio. So we're done with it but we'll still have a little bit of a lingering impact, so down a few from 3.12% in the first quarter.", "John McDonald", "Okay, something like 3% to 5% or 2% to 4%, just something in that range?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes.", "John McDonald", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Carache of Nomura Securities.", "Bill Carache", "So given your loan growth expectations and the NIM commentary that you just provided, can you talk about your ability to grow NII under the different rate environments that you've been discussing?", "Andrew Cecere", "We will grow NII on a year-over-year basis, both the combination of what Richard talked about and what I talked about on rates. So our expectation is net interest income will grow. Now in the first quarter, if you think about it on a linked quarter basis, the first quarter has two fewer days and that costs us just under $40 million. So absent that, we'll be slightly, relatively stable but the first quarter is a little down because of days.", "Bill Carache", "Okay, thank you. I had another question on your payments business. On the issuing side, you guys reported a solid acceleration in payment volume growth this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between pressure on purchase volume growth from lower gas prices on one hand and increased spending power that the consumer enjoys on the other, does the acceleration that you saw this quarter suggest that the latter dominates the former or is it too early to tell and the acceleration is a function of something else, maybe some color around that?", "Richard K. Davis", "I think the answer is, yes, lots of questions, but latter does it from the former. So here's the deal. We've got this really great opportunity with our corporate payments, not just our retail issuing, to see that and government, we can see pretty much where everything is moving around and we can see directly and very quickly the movement in the, let's say first on the corporate side where corporate T&E is still outpacing, and we're still growing that even with the softness of the fuel prices, so we're still seeing T&E grow which is a pretty good sign that businesses are transferring some of that into other expenses.", "Consumers are the same. So anything related to energy or gas prices has been coming down but the ticket prices and the number of visits people have made to restaurants, hotels and some of those discretionary things that they would spend money on had absolutely gone up. So, Bill, we've seen at least in 90 days almost a perfect correlation from people still spending the money they're saving on gas through their debit, credit or prepaid cards but they are spending on things that I'm sure that a lot of retailers and the restaurateurs are happy about. So we see that evidence both at the consumer and at the corporate level.", "Bill Carache", "That's really helpful. On the acquiring side, you guys also had nice growth but interestingly that reflected a little bit of deceleration, which is kind of an interesting contrast to the acceleration that we were just talking about on the issuing side. Can you talk about maybe what's driving that?", "Andrew Cecere", "On the merchant acquiring side, part of that is seasonality. So our fourth quarter is typically lower than our third quarter and that goes to mix of business a little bit. If you think about the issuing side, we have a lot of retail. On the acquiring side, we have less retail, more airlines and the like. And you think about when people buy tickets and so forth, this is less so in the fourth quarter. So it's more seasonal, still we're showing good growth year-over-year, same-store sales is just under 5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. I'm showing he disconnected. Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "Another question on the margin. Beyond the first quarter, want to get your thoughts on the margin progression. Is it fair to assume 2 to 3 bps of quarterly compression mainly on competitive pressures on loan yield, just want to get your thoughts there?", "Andrew Cecere", "So I would describe it as 2 to 3 basis points given flat rates more because of loan mix than competitive pressure, although pressure is a little bit of it, but it's more the mix. Most of our growth is coming on the wholesale side of the equation and the wholesale has about half the yield of retail. So that's what's driving that 2 to 3 basis points more than anything, and again that assumes the rates flat to current levels. Once and if and when rates start to move, we'll start to see a positive rise there.", "John Pancari", "Okay, alright. And then separately on the expense items, just on comp expense and the increase in fourth quarter, was that all performance related, just want to get an idea of what the driver was?", "Andrew Cecere", "In the fourth quarter we have normal activities going on in increases related to risk and compliance positions for the most part, [indiscernible] headcount and [indiscernible] increases. We had some increases in compensation expense related to incentives. But if you peel those two things out, it was relatively stable.", "Richard K. Davis", "And John, it was a full effect of our RPS acquisition in Chicago that had a full quarterly effect in quarter four as well, but there was nothing unusual and it doesn't bode for any significant change in quarter one.", "John Pancari", "Okay, alright. And then lastly just want to ask on credit. You released additional reserves this quarter and wanted to just get your thoughts on where the reserve to loan ratio could bottom out, I mean you're still at a healthy level here, they're around 167 basis points or so.", "Richard K. Davis", "Bill?", "P.W. Parker", "Yes, it's 177 on allowance to loans, all-in allowance. I mean it's really a function of our mix. That's why ours look a little bit higher than some of our peers, so we have a higher percentage of credit cards. So obviously we're comfortable with where it's at. You see we have very, very modest reserve release. I think when that inflects, really gets to the point of what kind of loan and commitment growth we see during the coming year. There is a little bit more room for opportunity in some of the residential and home-equity products but at this point it's going to be more a function of loan and commitment growth going forward.", "Andrew Cecere", "I mean the stability, [indiscernible].", "P.W. Parker", "Yes, the stability of our credit portfolio right now is the strongest I've ever seen. It's just extremely all the loaners are performing well.", "Richard K. Davis", "And there surely will be an inflection point for all the banking, right, where eventually you have to reserve for loans that you're making and [the future may go bad but] [ph] we're not looking at that inflection point in the near term for our Company, we're simply not, and we haven't been driving much income off of reserve releases, so we don't have much to gather again from that, but eventually we'll end up reserving for as opposed to releasing but we are not there, now we're not there for a little while.", "John Pancari", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "I just wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on fee income growth. I think for the prior year the security gains were about 4% of the noninterest income. So as we think ahead to next year, is the realization of those gains going to be something that continues as kind of a bridge to a better rate environment or were those really just opportunistic and we should really think about growth off of a baseline number of something like 8.8 billion?", "Andrew Cecere", "The latter. So I think the notable items, the gains that we talked about, the Visa gain in the second quarter, the gain from Nuveen here in the fourth quarter are one-time items that are not likely to repeat, so [exempt] [ph] from that base that is excluding that think about loan growth in there.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Okay. So I think absent those things, the growth rate was about 1% in terms of fee income and it looks like the consensus for next year has about implied 5% growth off of that core number. Is that an achievable level given kind of some of the acceleration that we've talked about or is that maybe a stretch?", "Andrew Cecere", "I think a key factor in '14 was the headwind that we faced in the first half of the year related to the mortgage and if you looked at the mortgage numbers they were down 13%, 14% year-over-year which caused a tremendous headwind in quarters one, two and a little bit in three and you're seeing quarter four we're actually flat for the first time in a long time in mortgage. So I think the removal of that headwind will help us get to the numbers that are higher than we achieved this year.", "Richard K. Davis", "That's a big deal. We should have had the applause because that is a long anticipated moment where we're starting to grow mortgage again on a year-over-year basis. That is a big number, Eric, so if you do the math, you'll see that it's more than enough to accomplish that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital.", "Richard Bove", "I got to ask as I think 30,000 feet high for a second, when I look at your bank, I can see absolutely nothing wrong. In my view it's about as perfect as a company can get in this industry. And yet when I take a look at Slide 9, I see that on a year-over-year basis the net interest income to common is up 0.6%, I see that the EPS is up 2.7%, and when I take a look at the price of your stock it's up 2.6% last year in a market that's up 11%, and what I'm wondering is, if a bank which is as close to perfection as this one is, can't get its earnings to move up at a faster rate and can't get its stock price to do anything but move up at a rate one quarter that of the market, what will it take to get this thing moving in a direction where the stock is going to equal or outperform the market?", "Richard K. Davis", "This is Richard. Thanks for that observation. I think U.S. Bank moves best when everything is moving one way or another. So the bank was 10 years ago a fairly considerate bank with a sense of all defense, right, we were an efficiency company, no one ever thought about us making revenue, which is save the next dollar, we can merge and acquire companies and squeeze more out of that than anyone else, and that was well-regarded and well-recognized.", "Then the downturn hits, and that was our first chance to prove, like I said earlier in an answer to John's question, that while we may not look like we are growing as much in the go-go times, we also chose not to take risks and those showed up later when the economy turned and we ended up getting stronger. I know you know this, you've written about this, we became a flight to quality, a place of safety and we played on that.", "So now here we are in kind of a flat, slow, slow recovery that's almost flat, so we can't prove anything remarkable except to just say we're not going to disappoint, we're not going to surprise, we're not going to get complicated, we're just going to get it out and do a little bit better than everyone else on all the basic tenants.", "The next opportunity for us to perform is when the rates pick up because the markets picked up and to show that the Bank is repositioned now to be as strong as it ever was when it was on defense and be better than anyone else on offense. So I'm going to hold your question in the rears until we get the chance to show you that when the recovery starts and because of our high credit quality, our amazing pricing benefits that we have based on our debt ratings, that we are going to be able to show you we can be even better.", "And then I think the multiple comes back, we even spread further from where we are because we're always sitting at this high multiple that people need us to be, remarkable every quarter to prove and protect, but we are looking forward greatly at the time when the world gets better and we can show you just how positioned we are for that, and there's a lot we did in that period of time, in the last five to seven years, to position this Company as innovative, payments focused, trust leader and global.", "So I'll look forward to that and I'll ask you to ask me the question again when things start to turn, but I think it makes sense that we hold our own position of strength, kind of the yellow flag is out on the racetrack but when the green flag comes out we'll take off first.", "Richard Bove", "Again, I have no questions with [indiscernible], I think the way you run the Bank is superb. My issue I guess is, and we heard it again last night in the State of the Union message, will the government prevent the industry from reaching a level where it can show meaningful profit increases or will it come up with a new liquidity capital ratio supplement to leverage ratios, loss absorbing capital ratios and special [indiscernible] for taking high levels of risk? In other words, as you improve your Company, will the government stay one step ahead of you and prevent you from showing the type of improvement that you're getting in the operation of the Company?", "Richard K. Davis", "I'll tell you I can't answer that because I don't know the answer, but I will say that we're in a closed set of competitors, right, at least as banks go, and we certainly wouldn't trade places with anybody else based on our current position, our size, the fact that we're a domestic city not a global city, the fact that we don't do leverage lending, we don't have high-risk portfolios, and all I'm saying there is, customers, businesses, they're all going to need banks and unless there's a huge alternative I haven't found out there, they're going to need what they need.", "[It worries me not] [ph] what the government does to impair our profitability, we will be there first amongst few I think at the highest returns and the highest quality to be there to receive those needs from the customers and almost despite \u2013 because I mean look, I mean, Dick, we lost $1.5 billion in the last four years over four or five specific government decisions on how to [indiscernible] income and we still had a record year.", "So we can do this. It's a lot harder, it's a lot less satisfying and it's a lot less predictable, but I think we've figured out how to do this and what we do is control what you can, be very nimble and ready to adjust to the next opportunity, and I for one can't imagine a scenario that would be any more difficult than what we have now, so I'm looking forward to getting a little bit easier with a little more clarity. But I agree, it's complicated and I can't answer directly to your question because it's what I contemplate at 30,000 feet every day.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Bryan Batory", "This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team. Apologies for the mix-up earlier. I was wondering if you could provide a little color just on the starting point for noninterest expenses in the first quarter '15, just particularly thinking about the reset in other expenses, and then also the potential pension expense increase just given where your long-term rates ended 2014?", "Andrew Cecere", "This is Andy. If you think about the fourth quarter, there are two unusual items in total. The first is the total of the notables which is $88 million. The second is our higher CDC or the tax advantage amortization which happens every fourth quarter. That was about $60 million. So if you take out that $150 million or so, I would expect us to be relatively flat to that in the first quarter. Secondly with regards to pension expense, year-over-year we'll see about $100 million increase in pension, of $25 million a quarter, and that is reflected in the numbers I gave you in the first part.", "Bryan Batory", "Okay, great. And then could you provide some color on your outlook for mortgage banking revenues as we head into '15 just given the recent decline in interest rates?", "Andrew Cecere", "Good question, and it's changing every day as rates move a lot. We had a very good week last week. But right now I will tell you that our expectation is relatively stable total revenue fourth quarter into first quarter. So we have some pluses and minuses and that could change as rates move around in the next few weeks and we'll update you if it does, but right now relatively stable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "In terms of your outlook for loan growth, so you're expecting an acceleration you said from 6% closer to 7% range and also your growth in commitments was up 3%, so that's good. On the other hand, you mentioned that the unused lines of your commitments are still bouncing along the bottom I guess unchanged. So once again we're at another quarter where you're expecting better growth yet the 10 year yield is significantly lower. So who's going to win, Richard Davis or the 10 year bond?", "Richard K. Davis", "[Indiscernible] 10 year yield, Mike, [indiscernible] I've been buying them and everything. I mean actually you're playing into one of our thoughts. I haven't included the improvement in utilization at all in our expectation if loan growth goes up. That is an absolute stable starting point. And the way we look at it, wholesale commitments, a lot of banks look at the total retail, we look at wholesale, and that number is at highest point in the mid-30s and today it's sitting at 24%. It's been stuck there for about 18 months. And so to me that is unbelievable upside.", "As long as we keep adding commitments more than loans, that means that more people have an open to buy with us and that they have an intent to use it, because they're paying for it and so are we by the way, but if they use it, any part of it, even a slightest movement from 24% to 28% or 30%, that's going to be on top of the kind of loan growth we're anticipating. So we're not counting on that to give you the answer, and I do think that while customers look at the 10-year, as Andy said most of them look more at the two to three and that movement is going to be what's going to trigger the decision on whether they want to grab something before it gets too late and whether they'll be glad they prepared themselves with the line of credit that's got an open to buy. That has a lot to do.", "I think there will be a tsunami effect when there is a period where people are sure that rates are moving up, I think they'll start grabbing the lines they have, they'll start using what they have and they'll be incentivized, be a catalyst for this economy, but until then we're not counting on that as part of our expectations to provide loan growth, we're just doing with our better debt ratings, our better pricing power and our really remarkable employees who've learnt how to tell our story better.", "Mike Mayo", "So just more generally, put your economist hat on, Richard, so the 10-year seeing this much slower growth yet your guidance is for some acceleration in your loan growth. How should we reconcile those two thoughts?", "Richard K. Davis", "On one hand and on the other hand, [indiscernible] harness. Mike, I don't think those are directly correlated right now, and I say that because the Fed and the Fed equivalent across the globe, they've done some behaviors that are certainly not [indiscernible] and they are not things that we all learned in school. To the extent that they are being motivated by I think non-financial, more political activities and more financial data that might be backwards looking not forward-looking, I'm not going to be able to correlate those two for you, and I don't think our customers are sitting there thinking that way either.", "So the 10-year stays low, sure mortgage will look great and then we go back to this again, but it doesn't inform our customers that the majority of this Bank until we get to two to three and until that starts to bend up, we're going to stay right where we are and if the 10-year informs us, fine, if it doesn't, it's probably going to be a bit of an inflection on the curve, but I'm not managing to the 10, I'm in management of the two or three, and I'm just not that smart.", "Mike Mayo", "And then lastly, you're implying market share gains. You said before that U.S. Bancorp has a 30 to 35 basis point pricing advantage when pricing commercial loans against some of the largest banks. Now that the SISI premium might go even higher for some of the larger banks, could that pricing advantage improve and how are you positioning your Company to potentially benefit?", "Richard K. Davis", "The answer is, yes, because you know the math, you knew the answer when you asked it, and where we're positioned is we have a philosophy that we will give back some portion of that advantage when we're competing against one of the banks that has a different pricing scheme and we'll only do it with the high quality customer. I suppose, because the philosophy is in place, if that spread were to widen, then we give ourselves more room to be more competitive, but it doesn't interest a new philosophy, it's just more of a larger scale for us to use and to give our lending offer the opportunity to price more effectively. So it's a net positive, I'm not counting on it, but if it happens we'll take it gladly and we'll be even more successful.", "Mike Mayo", "How much higher could that go with 30 to 35 basis points today, could it go up another 5, 10, 20, 30?", "Andrew Cecere", "The capital differential is about equivalent. So if you think about your 35 on the side from the perspective of our debt rating, it's an equivalent level on the side about the capital differential from the highest levels.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.", "Jessica Ribner", "This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. On the mortgage side, what are you guys seeing in terms of the purchase market? As most of your volume coming off the refi side, do you see any recovery there?", "Andrew Cecere", "The third quarter was 70-30 new, and because the rate is coming down a bit, it's closer to 60-40, 62-38. So it's coming down a little bit more high on the refinancing side and we are also starting the year strong that way because of the low rate environment. So I would expect it to be somewhere between that 60% and 70% new.", "Jessica Ribner", "Okay, great. And just in general, what's your institutional view on housing and the recovery, do you think that we have room to go or where do you see mortgage banking?", "Richard K. Davis", "We do, but more than just mortgage, first mortgage, right. So we're already seeing it now on our home equity, we're growing nicely in home equity. Thanks for asking, Richard. Yes, we're actually growing almost three times the market with our home equity right now and we're doing that because we're seeing a lot of people invest in property improvement kind of monies into their homes and not doing debt consolidation, entirely they're doing it for their properties, and these are in some of the states where they are the hardest hit, where the pricings have come, [indiscernible] come back nicely.", "So mortgage in general has got a really nice I think outlook because people without houses now feel that they are no longer under water and they're willing to invest in them, people without houses that are now above water are willing to use it as collateral for something else, I think small business, and housing prices slowly but surely are recovering.", "I think there is a social question we ought to ask ourselves is how many 18 year olds who five years ago their mother or father lost their job or their house are going to want a house in the American Dream category three years from now when they're 25. Don't know that answer but I know that the housing stock is not at all overbuilt for the number of people who either need to get back out of their parents' basements or get an upgrade in the house that they live in and we think it's a good business for us, we're staying in it, we want to be in the top five from here to forever and we're investing accordingly to make sure that we're great at originating loans and servicing them as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush", "Congratulations, Andy, well deserved. Richard, there was a debate sort of brewing out in the wake of fourth quarter earnings which I think have not been particularly wonderful particularly for the largest banks about whether the industry can continue to cut costs without 'going from cutting fat to cutting muscle', and I'd like to get your view on that, and secondly just from the perspective of your Company, I think you go through this exercise every month of where you are in terms of expenses, how do you make sure that you're not cutting muscle? I'd just like to get what you guys do and what you see for the industry generally.", "Richard K. Davis", "A great question, as usual. Here are a couple of thoughts. I do think \u2013 let's talk about the efficiency ratio, it's what everybody looks at, it's a fraction, right, it's a quotient. So one of the reasons I think we can do well is because our revenue grows. I mean there is a very basic fact, like you all know, that if you grow revenues faster than expenses, your efficiency ratio comes down. That's a fact.", "Banks are usually two parts revenue to one part expense. So it's important if I were to spend $100 million, my team has got to get $200 million in revenue just to keep it to 50% efficiency ratio. So those are some of the foundational points. So number one, if you grow revenue, you can impact your efficiency ratio and still grow expenses because it's not like it's [Pioneer] [ph] where you can't grow expenses, and we've been able to do that but not at the levels we want.", "I do think the argument at the largest bank level is partly due to revenue. I think banks could do better with their revenue but to the extent that that gets slightly impaired by certain actions, they've got to watch their expenses. And honestly I don't know why are banks in the 60% efficiency. It doesn't make sense to me because if you watch every dollar, there's plenty of money that is not necessarily shareholder friendly that's been spent and you can put a discipline in place where the employees own it first before you're telling them what to do.", "So in other words we've never brought in an outside party to look at our Company and tell us how to run it or tell us how to cut expenses, where you impose on employees some oversight if they didn't do themselves, because number one, it's intrusive, number two it's really unnerving because if I have to cut 10 people out of a room of a 100, the rest 90 don't know if they're safe or they're in the next group to fall.", "So I think that is another reason for us to be thoughtful, is that banks need to watch their expenses very, very carefully, and I'm now going to answer out the other side of my mouth that in the last five years it didn't caused banks to be amazingly disciplined in knowing where their money is being spent. I haven't got an answer for why as I thought there would be a ton of banks in the low 50s with this at this point in time. I actually don't know why there isn't.", "As it relates to U.S. Bank, we do meet every single month, every capital expenditure at U.S. Bank, get ready for this, over $100,000 has to come through a committee and that's a capital expenditure that includes particularly properties, leases or any kind of technology improvement. That's a very low number. We look at about a dozen items every month and the whole team is the managing committee. And so if somebody in commercial real estate needs a special new program that's going to cost them $100 million, I got to look at the rest of 13 people and say, are you willing to add $200 million in revenue over the next three years to offset this, and guess what, when the vote is taken by the group, sometimes it's no. But we all know that we've got to be able to return our investments in a fairly short time.", "So in closing, if we could do an ROI in everything in less than one year, it gets approved here every minute. If it takes two years, it gets contemplated given the circumstances. If it's finally more than three years, we're very, very careful and thoughtful about it. So I know that we are not improving every single thing that lead to revenue improving three to four years from now, I know we're not. I also know we're improving everything that has the highest value in the next couple of years and the minute the world gets better, I've got a list from most important to least important that will go right back into the coffers, we will improve them immediately and the shelf is full of the next best ideas so that we don't linger and lose any time to get back to spending money.", "So I didn't answer your question very well but it's the discipline, knowing what you're doing, put in the hands of the employees where they control their fate, give them a forecast to show them what the decision is going to mean so they can make that decision on their own or collectively as leaders and they'll always make the right one and then they don't feel like they're being told how to run the place and they feel like you respect them for the qualities of their leadership, that we do. So that's my long answer to your question.", "Nancy Bush", "So I guess I interpret that as you're saying, yes, there is still lots of fat in the banking industry that can be cut?", "Richard K. Davis", "Yes, I am saying that. Why didn't I just say that? Why do I talk so much, Nancy, what's wrong with me? Yes, that's what I meant.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Secondly if I'm reading the news correctly, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a case about swipe fees. Am I reading that correctly?", "Richard K. Davis", "That's right.", "Nancy Bush", "And does that mean that this issue will now go away or do you think that the retailers are going to come back with some other new slant on this?", "Richard K. Davis", "I think in terms of a lifecycle, it goes away for all of us on this phone. It could go back, come back in a few years and has another 10 to 15 year lifecycle, but in this half-generation, I think by all accounts, exclamation point, this one is dead.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Sean O'Connor", "Thank you for listening to our call this morning and please contact me this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Standard Time through Wednesday, April 22 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Standard Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Sean O'Connor", "Thank you, Kalia, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Sean, and good morning everyone. It's great to be here and to talk about U.S. Bancorp. I want to begin our review with the results of the summary of the quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.", "U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015 or $0.76 per diluted common share, a 4.1% year-over-year. Total average loans grew 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked-quarter excluding the impact of the reclassification of certain municipal loans to securities at the end of the fourth quarter.", "In addition, we continue to experience strong loan growth and total average deposits. Strong growth in total average deposits of 8.1% over the prior year, and 1.1% linked-quarter. The strongest first quarter deposit growth we've seen in several years.", "Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 18.2% from the prior year and declined 9.4% from the prior quarter. Total nonperforming assets declined compared to both the prior year by quarter and on a linked-quarter basis.", "We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common tier one capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented was 9.2% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common stocks during the first quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 70% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter.", "Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.44% and return on average common equity was 14.1%.", "Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.08%. Kathy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.3% equal to the prior quarter. We expect this ratio to decline and remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.", "Turning to Slide 5, the Company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.9% increase from the prior year. The increase was due to the higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses partially offset by lower loan fees due to the previously discussed wind-down of Checking Account Advance.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $12 billion or 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked-quarter excluding the impact of reclassification of certain municipal loans to securities at the end of the fourth quarter. Average total loans grew by 0.6% linked-quarter on a reported basis.", "Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 15.1% year-over-year and 2.4% over the prior quarter.", "Residential real estate loans were relatively flat year-over-year and declined modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 2.4% year-over-year and were seasonally lower on a linked-quarter basis.", "Total other retail loans grew 3.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.", "We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $38 billion in the first quarter.", "Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 11.7% and 1.9% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the first quarter.", "Total average deposits increased almost $21 billion or 8.1% over the same quarter of last year and 1.1% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 9.4% on a linked-quarter basis and 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.46% in the first quarter.", "Nonperforming assets decreased by 6.2% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.2% from the first quarter of last year.", "During the first quarter, we released $15 million of reserves, $5 million less than the fourth quarter of 2014 and $20 million less than the first quarter of 2014.", "Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2015. While we expect the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the second quarter mainly due to lower expected recoveries.", "Kathy will now give you a few more details of our first quarter results.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thanks Richard. I\u2019ll turn you to Slide 8. This gives you a view of our first quarter 2015 results versus comparable time periods.", "Our diluted EPS of $0.76 was 4.1% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 3.8% lower than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the Company's first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9.", "The $34 million or 2.4% increase in income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income, and fee-based revenue and a decline in the provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.", "Net interest income was up 1.7% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a lower net interest margin including lower loan fees. Approximately $50 million of the reduction in loan fees was due to the previously discussed wind-down of our Checking Account Advance, our short-term small-dollar deposit advanced product.", "The $34.6 million increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Also at the end of the first quarter approximately $3 billion of student loans were transferred from the loan portfolio to loans held for sale.", "The net interest margin of 3.08% was 27 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2014. This is primarily due to the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates as well as lower reinvestment rates on investment security. Lower loan fees and lower rates on new loans and the change in loan portfolio mix which is partially offset by lower funding cost.", "Noninterest income increased $46 million or 2.2% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses. We saw growth in retail payments, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management fees, investment product fees, mortgage banking and other income which was driven by higher equity investment gains.", "Merchant processing revenue were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis was negatively impacted by foreign currency rate changes. Excluding this impact, merchant processing fees grew approximately 5.5% on a year-over-year basis.", "Noninterest expense income increased year-over-year by $121 million or 4.8%. The increase is primarily the result of higher compensation and benefits expense and higher other expense. The increase in compensation expense is primarily the result of the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, higher staffing for risk and compliance activities and the variable costs related to higher mortgage production volumes increased benefits expenses due to higher pension costs of about $25 million for the quarter. Other expense is higher primarily due to mortgage servicing related activities.", "On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $57 million or 3.8% mainly due to lower net interest income and seasonally lower fee based revenue partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.", "Net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.08% was 6 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. The 6 basis points decline includes approximately 2 basis points related to the unusually high interest recoveries in the fourth quarter which as you recall we discussed at the earnings call in January.", "Higher interest recoveries continued in the first quarter benefiting net interest income by approximately 1 basis point. The remaining decline in net interest income was principally due to growth in lower rate investment securities and lower reinvestment rates, lower rates on new loans and a change in the loan portfolio mix, along with the impact of higher cash balances at the Federal Reserve as a result of continued deposit growth, which as Richard mentioned was exceptionally strong in the first quarter.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $216 million or 9.1%. This variance is principally due to seasonally lower fee revenue in the fourth quarter 2014 gain. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $139 million or 5.0%. The decrease is due to seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantage projects, the impact of the notable fourth quarter 2014 charitable contribution and legal accruals and lower marketing and business development expenses.", "Professional services also declined due to seasonally lower expend in many of our businesses. Partially offsetting these reductions were higher compensation and benefits expense due to increased pension costs, seasonally higher payroll taxes and increases in variable compensation related to higher mortgage volumes.", "Turning now to slide 10, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at March 31 was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $16.50 at March 31, representing a 10.1% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 3.4% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the first quarter.", "In March we received the results of the 2015 comprehensive capital assessment and review or the CCAR including the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently we announced our new five quarter buyback authorization totaling approximately $3 billion effective April 1, and our intension to recommend to our board of directors the 4.1% increase in our common stock dividend beginning with the second quarter dividend payable in July.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks Kathy. Turning to slide 12, you'll see the cover of our 2014 Annual report and you've seen the power of potential. At U.S. Bank we stand at the intersection of people and potential each and every day and we're privileged to serve as the caveats for all of our customers whether consumer, small business, wholesale or institutional to assist them by providing the financial tools and resources they need to achieve their full potential.", "This positions us well for growth as our customers seek a strong banking partner to help them as they pursue their goals. Next week we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. I look forward to telling our shareholders of how proud I am of what we've accomplished and of the 67,000 remarkable and engaged employees that have contributed to our success.", "We remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Thanks, good morning guys, good morning Kathy. Richard, maybe start with this -- just your view on the state of the economy. You talked a little bit about your position for growth when the economy gains momentum. Curious, are you still as optimistic as you've been in previous quarters? Do you feel like the economy is gaining momentum? And then maybe update us on your loan growth outlook?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I will, thanks Jon. I remain very optimistic for the economy and for the great citizens of America, a little less optimistic for the bankers until the interest rates start to move up. So if you think about it, consumer confidence continues to move up and particularly small business. Even corporate confidence continues to move up, but part of that confidence is found in their ability to operate more effectively during their day with more money in the bank, more of a reserve and their lines that they've got a back stop of equity in their homes and the belief that right now they don\u2019t need to be indebted.", "So for bankers that might not be as positive as for consumers and for businesses, but it does reveal itself as people husband in cash and feel but better about their situation they did a few years ago. As rates start to move up, I'm still convinced of two things. One will be that when there is a real sense that's about to happen there will be a tsunami effect, particularly on the corporate and wholesale side that people want to lock down low rates before they finally get stuck having missed that opportunity.", "And I think consumers will move from those who have here to who have been saving looking for some money, now they'll start making some real money in their savings accounts and their endowments and their long term trust and I do expect people to start using their lines of credit again feeling the strength of an economy and a higher wage that will come with it.", "So I'm super optimistic about how things are moving. They are slow but steady, but they'll continue to move forward. But I do think until rates move up it continues to impinge the ability for banks to be particularly as financially successful as they will be when things get better.", "As it relates to loan growth we were at 0.8% this year if you adjust for a little bit of noise and that's outside of our normal range of 1 to 1.5% on a linked quarter basis which is about 5% to 6% annualized number. We're looking to get back into that 1 to 1.5% in quarter two as we look into this 15 days into the second quarter. I'm also hopeful that as the year ages we'll see those increases a little higher to the ranges we were used to at the 1.5% to 2%.", "So I'm starting to stick with our hope that we can get in the 6% range for loan growth on a year-over-year basis by year's end. But for now the 0.8% for me is a little disappointing because I really want to stay in that 1 to 1.5% range, but for you as an investor make it certain that we're not going to stretch on any kind of credit quality in order to accomplish those numbers until which time it is more natural and the customers that we serve have the need for their loans. So, I'm quite optimistic and yet a little bit hesitant until rates start to move.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Okay, good. That's helpful. And then just maybe a quick one for Bill. I know it's a small number, but the incremental provision in energy, can you maybe just give us an update of what you did and what your expectations are and maybe size the exposure for us?", "P.W. Parker", "Sure, so the energy loans are about 1.2 times of our total loans and the part of that portfolio that is most directly impacted by the lower oil prices is the E&P portfolio. It is roughly two thirds of that. We have now run through that entire book with the new pricings back reflecting the much lower forecast obviously on oil. And we have adjusted the ratings accordingly on that book and we did take an incremental reserve at the end of the year we've adjusted that now that we accomplished this on a loan by loan basis.", "It all adds up to something that's really not that material in terms of our $4 plus billion loan reserve, but it's all baked in now and we've done all the analysis and we update that pricing back at least two times a year. So if we need to do it again we will.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Good that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley", "Q - Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning. How are you doing? A couple of questions. One is just on investing in your people in an environment where rates are low and the loan growth is solid, but not accelerating too much. I am just asking the question with regard to how you are considering allocating resources to drive top-line growth. And is there opportunity to pull back maybe on some of the non-client facing related areas to be able to put more feet on the Street?", "Richard Davis", "On personnel I wish, but no. We're not going to be able to slow down our incremental adds for first, second and third line of defense as we call it, but some plans in audit, that's just a new world and even if thought we had everything right I'd still keep that one there double triple check that we are still doing things well.", "So, that has been the only place we've increased our FTE since I told you I think many times last year that in the middle of February of 2014. So that's now 14 months ago, we asked the employees but for those in the compliance areas to stay at their FTE level for all intents and purposes and to manage at a higher expected performance per person.", "So that's not hiring freeze because there is a lot of turnover and when people do have 964 FTE in your group you can still have 964, but it does encourage you to manage the bottom performers out more swiftly and to increase the quality of the 964 people that work for you and that's where we are Betsy.", "I'm not going to do a reduction in force. We've hung on here for eight years and done quite well. Our engagement I believe to be at the highest level it has ever been and I believe that the employees are deeply engaged. They'll perform remarkably well for customers and shareholders will get their benefits. So I don\u2019t want to mess with that formula, but I am asking everyone here to work harder, I'm working harder and we are asking everyone to appreciate the fact that protecting all of our current positions by performance is really the way to manage through these difficult times.", "So that as the backdrop you'll see that our operating leverage was as you know negative for quarter one, both on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. And as we put the plan together, we as I said always seek positive operating leverage. And our plan for 2015 is for the year to be slightly positive.", "I will say however, that hinged the original expectation that interest rates will start moving up at midyear and based on our stress test and the prevailing views of economists a couple of months ago, if that doesn't happen in June then it is going to put some stress on our ability to be positively operating leverage. I will tell you this though, in almost any circumstance quarter one at 54.3% operating leverage will be our highest quarter or in this case our least attractive quarter of the four and I think you'll see that as the quarters age, we'll get smarter and better at managing our expenses as revenue starts to move up.", "But it's anything else I'll just close by saying I'm on a lag basis, I've got to see revenue move up sustainably and consistently for long enough before we start to increase any expenses. In the meantime we will delivery with the same people working as hard as they do to deliver a little bit more each time and will manage the quality of our FTEs at the highest level at this point where I think we're selling attractive employer and we can get some really good people from different places to accompany those who are here.", "Betsy Graseck", "And so if there is a push out in the rate hike you counter that with employee?", "Richard Davis", "Yes I do and again being very clear that could put a pressure on our full year positive operating leverage, it could make it slightly negative and slightly positive because we were counting on that. But it is not enough of a difference and it doesn\u2019t change. I don\u2019t think you always trust in the way we manage the company to cause me to want to start laying people off for doing something more draconian because it is not an if, it is a win for different interest rates and when that happens I will be very glad we have the quality of people we have ready to jump on whatever opportunities come along.", "Betsy Graseck", "Sure okay, and then just separately you did have a change in the management of the Payments business recently.", "Richard Davis", "We did.", "Betsy Graseck", "I just want to understand if there is any change in direction of the organization that we can expect?", "Richard Davis", "So let me turn that over to the Chief Operating Officer. Andy is going to give you an update there.", "Andy Cecere", "Good morning Betsy. No, there is no change in our strategy. We have a good place in terms of market share and capabilities and our platform and merchants, expansion outside of the U.S., all those things are going well and we continue in that focus. Our card issuing is doing also very well, we're growing in regard to the activity our branch activity is also increasing. And finally our corporate card is doing well.", "So I don\u2019t see any change in direction. Corporate card was impacted this quarter by a lower fuel price, which impacts our fleet business and that was one of the big anchors this quarter in terms of our year-over-year growth.", "The other phenomenon that we did see this quarter was corporate spend and payables is down, which again probably reflects to what Richard spoke to, which is just a general careful attitude in terms of large companies and payables for corporate spend was perhaps 1% up where in a normal period it would be up 5% to 6%.", "Richard Davis", "I will just add too. Pam Joseph is staying all the way through June 30, so she and Shailesh Kotwal will have, almost four months of overlap, which we are going to take every day of because Pam\u2019s done a remarkable job. Shailesh was attracted to us in a number of ways, and not least to which is his international experience.", "And we\u2019ll continue to follow as Pam started this march across the pond to increase the exposure we have in the European markets and eventually looking at other places in the world for our merchant acquiring.", "But he is going to be a perfect transition and the two of them have already established I think a great report to carry on with second quarter. And we\u2019ll make sure you all get a chance to meet him in future meetings because I think you\u2019ll want to hear him directly and get a chance to understand his thoughts.", "Betsy Graseck", "Appreciate that. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "Just want to ask a little bit more around loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on trends in the first quarter, particularly around Commercial Real Estate, as I know it was particularly weak in the quarter, and what may have impacted that.", "And then secondarily, how do you get back to that 1% to 1.5% range that you indicated for next quarter? Is it just the snapback in something that was abnormally weak this quarter? Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks John. I'll start and then Andy add some color. First of all, one of the way is out of the point into 1% to 1.5% is getting out of quarter one. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done already in April it\u2019s part of that we\u2019re seasonally affected company particularly such a heavy Midwest influence, which include some of the weather.", "So that helps a lot, that's part of it. Commercial real estate was actually pretty strong for us so I\u2019m not sure what numbers you are looking at, but I\u2019ll give you the trend in commercial real estate is very consistent we call this mild but it\u2019s East and the West Coast and Texas.", "And that\u2019s where most of the activity for growth is coming for at least our customers. The development activity per se is in the bigger cities West Coast, Seattle, San Francisco, LA Orange County and you got Miami, Boston, New York.", "So in the places you would expect and a couple of years ago on this call John, I indicated that we had done a study of total on housing availability once and when people moved out of their parents basements and when the housing stock of foreclosures came back into the normal course.", "And there were couple of markets that we actually stayed away from for a while, I think that they might be over built. We're not seeing that right now it seems that things are settling the cognizant floor to recover people have been more thoughtful about building in the right places.", "So I\u2019m not that concerned about that I was a couple of years ago. And then finally construction lending is highest for apartment, office space, and some lodging properties, which continue to find their way into popup all across the country as people start traveling again.", "So for me I think commercial real estate continue to be a strong point for us. Our quality is remarkably high, because we only deal with the very large national customers for the most part and we\u2019re going to stick to that approach as it served us well.", "And then I\u2019ll just close by saying our loan growth continues to be really strong in commercial and wholesale, which you\u2019ve seen before the 15.1% year-over-year growth. Our commitments are even higher so that bodes well for one and when people start using those commitment.", "That will start to have a nice increase and anytime that happens that\u2019s going to be too far, because we\u2019ll start talking future quarters about loan growth being remarkably higher than anything in the last few years and part of all just be line usage.", "So those of us who are collecting customers which lines that they\u2019re not using are still doing a good job of developing a future core outstanding once and when people draw and then. So Andy why don\u2019t you bring some color around [indiscernible].", "Andy Cecere", "So to your point commercial wholesale real estate was very strong, commercial corporate up 15%, real estate up 6% year-over-year. The area that is not growing is rapidly is our real estate residential real estate, which is relatively flat.", "And what\u2019s going to drive that growth is going to be our home equity increases. We do see increases in pipeline line of credit, home equity line of credit and in residential real estate.", "And I think as you go throughout the year, we\u2019ll see an increase in that category, which will help the overall loan growth numbers.", "John Pancari", "Okay, I guess I was looking at the Commercial Real Estate GAAP line item on the consolidated balance sheet going from 42.8 to 42.4. That was primarily what I was calling out in terms of it appeared to pull back a little bit.", "Kathy Rogers", "That might be - John that might be as are you looking at the end of period versus the average growth?", "John Pancari", "Yes.", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. And I think that at any given day you might have a little bit of fluctuations in what pay downs and new loans coming on. So we really focus on average loan growth.", "John Pancari", "Okay.", "Richard Davis", "So let's get up for John, John got the longest pause we've ever have. We are never stopped our bank, so John congratulations and it\u2019s been something for that.", "John Pancari", "I figured I would let it sit just to see.", "Richard Davis", "It\u2019s like forever transcript so read you may reply.", "John Pancari", "Right, adds a little suspense to the call, you know. Okay, and then lastly, just back to energy. I know it's a small piece of your book, but just want to clarify something. Did you quantify the size of the reserve or size of the provision that you took? And then what is the size of your energy reserve as of today as a percentage of loans?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. We haven\u2019t disclosed that. I mean as I said, I mean the total loan book is about $3.3 billion and about 60% of that is the E&P portfolio, which is the area most directly impacted.", "Andy Cecere", "Exploration and production.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, exploration and production. So all re-rated, it\u2019s - the impact is in the numbers, but no we have not disclosed the actual dollar amount.", "Andy Cecere", "It's not material John but certainly sufficient for the regulators.", "John Pancari", "Got it, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill.", "Scott Siefers", "Just had a question on the margin and just sort of future directions there. I think all the big pressure seems pretty much behind you with concession of the deposit advance product and then you are pretty much all set with liquidity build for LCR. So at this point I imagine it's just normal spread compression, maybe to the tune of 3 or 4 basis points a quarter. Is that a fair way to think about margin erosion as we stay in this kind of sustained low rate environment?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes, Scott, I\u2019ll take that. Here is what I would say, as we look out into quarter two I think you are absolutely right that we\u2019ll continue to see margin erosion related to the mix of our growth. So we're more heavily weighted right now on wholesale versus retail so I\u2019d expect that to come down 2 to 3 basis points.", "We also, as we think about our investment portfolio, while we\u2019re done with the build, we still have run off in that portfolio of about $2 billion a month, which is now coming on at lower rate. So the reinvestment aspect of that is also worth a couple basis points and then as we talked about earlier our deposits are really strong.", "And while that is positive from a net interest income standpoint, I do think that that potentially has the possibility of having a negative impact on our margin as we look out into the next quarter of a basis point or so.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay. So maybe somewhere in mid sort of mid-single digits per quarter kind of compression range?", "Andy Cecere", "That's about right. We\u2019re seeing something a little new, because we didn\u2019t expect as rates keep staying flat as long as they have we actually do out this reinvestment risk I mean stuff we put out anyone in the last seven years some of that much left in seven year tenures coming due and it\u2019s coming in lower than it was before.", "So when rates move about just so many things start to get better and things that we're about to be tough stop being tough and never mind when rates move up we have this wonderful benefit from some of the trust businesses that we have always been paying out to what\u2019s to our negative waivers.", "So it\u2019s just so many things we\u2019ll start to improve, but I would say there\u2019s another basis point or two of added risk with rate staying a little longer on this reinvestment that we haven\u2019t talked about in addition to the mix. So Scott, it\u2019s but it\u2019s exactly we telegraph before.", "Scott Siefers", "Yes, okay. All right. That sounds good. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Najarian", "Good morning. My question is probably top of mind for most investors in that it seems like some of the assumptions even from three months ago on rates for most banks on normalizing interest rates have been pushed out. And we are sort of at the level of provision and charge-offs where even if you stay pristine you can have volatility in any one quarter.", "I guess the question here, Richard, is: what is your view in terms of the timing of when normalized rates could converge relative to normalized credit, knowing that it's the normalized credit that is likely under your control or that you have a better viewpoint on?", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, again and I agree that will being you said. Investors do want to know, we all do and I\u2019ll say, we use to prevailing view of the general economic forecast, which I think we all agreed particularly a few months ago we're starting in June one of four interest rate increases June, July, September, December and I think we\u2019re now getting a telegraph to this could start later its more like September and less frequent may be two times instead of four.", "What's most important is that starts off, I can tell that\u2019s really more important than the, the number of times that it occurs and I think that starting point as I referenced few minutes ago will be little bit of a tsunami effect of people spending and taking uses of credit and taking credit lines and walking down interest rates, for so for me there will be a little bit of blip, they feel number of cash per clients is may be the same store I think in the wholesale side.", "I will say they\u2019ve also telegraphed, the way it works for bankers that people were use their deposits first to invest in their life, then they use the line of credit, they have established whether they have anything else turning around it call it a house or call it a wholesale line of credit then they\u2019ll extend more credit, so it does have to go through those steps like like Maslow's hierarchy.", "So banks have to have deposits -- should see deposits flow and deposits go down and lot of you have been asking as about our stress testing and volatility of deposits out running out.", "Second then lines of credit will go up and the new lines from loans will be formed. So even when it starts Erika, it will take a little bit of time but once it starts we can see a better predictability around it because we haven\u2019t be able to show you guys what we used to do, seven, eight years ago when rates moved, we haven\u2019t pretty high correlation of behaviors would occur and what kind of margins impacts it would be.", "So for me, I think we\u2019re going to say that as the economy gets stronger, what kind of that interlude work stronger for everybody else but banks don\u2019t have particularly have this an important need in the minds of consumers and businesses as it starts to get very strong in rates move up because its stronger, we\u2019ll start getting a lot of benefits on the income statement and the balance sheet will start to move from deposits over the loan and that will start to get a much more predictability, which I think it\u2019s a probably a year away.", "But I\u2019m of the mind, we\u2019ve even out all stores I still think rates were move sometime in \u201915 and net effected sales were have a pretty stunning impact and then - steady rate put the what happens on the back side, that will be positive under any circumstances and was just move from one side of the balance sheet to be other all giving us net inertest income which is what you all want.", "Erika Najarian", "And what about on the credit side? Given the underwriting standards have remained quite tight and the economy on both corporate and consumer remains healthy, are we -- is it a longer path to normalized charge-offs even though the provisions could be volatile from here?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, it\u2019s a very long path, like multi year path, if you think about were 46 basis points and we\u2019ve declared all of you from a bottom up basis that over the cycle, we thought we would be had about 95 basis points, so we\u2019re now actually under half of that and over the cycle as, you never actually had you just pass through at on your way to either the next recession, the next recovery but I will tell you, its many, may years until we get to that number because it takes that long to get the loans on the books, takes that long to have them stress unless there is a money \u2013 event.", "And then it takes a long time for our results to be used in order to accommodate that so, you will see interest rates move, up probably three to five years before you will see the kind of credit quality that would be impacted by what would be some maintain either for underwriting decisions or aggressive, underwriting decisions either when we\u2019re not going to make but I think you will see the credit quality would be better than average for many years and will be the least thing what we talking about in the next couple.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And just one last question. You continue to do well in the CCAR process. Are you confident that at least for the banks that are not considered SIFIs by the Fed that the CCAR process from here will be steady state? I'm sure there is going to be the transition to advance, but less stringent or less change for non-SIFIs in the US?", "Richard Davis", "So do you mean, do I think that the non-SIFI\u2019s will get relief from where they are or that they won\u2019t be brought under these structure?", "Erika Najarian", "Not necessarily relief, but more so less incremental negative change in the tests looking forward.", "Richard Davis", "I mean we do believe that there will be a distinction, I don\u2019t know where the lines going to be SIFI, non-SIFI, it doesn't matter to us, because we are SIFI, we think we are we, finally not to be do SIFI but will be a SIFI.", "And so according to that, I think that will be plenty of the regional banks and smaller banks that will not be brought into that same kind of a routine which is where we planned for all the way and not something we\u2019re going to see as a disadvantage.", "On the other hand, I do think we can play our advantages to not being a do SIFI as it relates to normally the oversight the additional capital requirements and some of the expectations that have been placed on them.", "So we're going to call this sweet spot and based on our own preparation, we have been working on, the SIFI and the CCAR process, it's well ensconced here , there is no reason to not want to keep it up and frankly I feel better now I know the we passed all the SIFI test and if I would ever require another bank, I would be more attractive to them if they gone to the same rigger because it improves half of my due diligence.", "So I'm actually supporter of it and knowing that we are in it anyway, we're going to make the best of it.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Hey, everybody. Good morning. One big picture question, just following up on that normalization effect. Given that -- and the structural changes to the balance sheet given LCR and some of these intersecting points between that path to growth and rates, do you still see a path that long-term 1.6-1.9 ROA is achievable? And is there anything that has happened over the last couple of years that would prevent the company from getting back to that point as you look further ahead?", "Richard Davis", "I'm quite bullish that is not a problem, we will get there because the income will be so much higher. The ROE well for ever be lower for all banks based on the requirements that have been placed in this new world for higher capital and that's the e part of the equation.", "But the ROE is really a function, just how much money we can make and the quality which we do and that is no one is really taken that from us as long as consumers and business needs banks and use us and I have ever reason things that 1.6 to 1.9 ranges quite still reasonable and I think for our ROE, the 16 to 19 lower not there yet will also find its way through our normal standards and I think also think it will be at the high end of the peer group.", "So we\u2019re sticking with those numbers, they are not evidential the day but I think at a year or more two you will see them again very quickly.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, got you. And then on a short-term question, just on mortgage banking, can you talk a little bit about the drivers of the really strong gain on sale margins and whether they are sustainable? And then also, if you have it, just the mix purchase refi in both the volume and the apps?", "Kathy Rogers", "This is Kathy, well I will go ahead and start with the - just the mix of the volume. So, as, in quarter four, we were kind of in that purchases versus refi kind of 70 percent purchase, 30 percent refi. We did as rate started coming down, we did see a shift of that into the first quarter probably in that more closure to that 55, 44 so we did see a little bit of a pick up and the refis, we look out, we still see volumes increasing, we would expect to see seasonal impacts related to second quarter people , should go out or probably will be out buying and we would think, that we would start to see a little bit of shift back to purchase versus refi markets.", "And I think if we think about the rates, as you know kind of our margins have been up on a linked quarter basis about 10 basis points year-over-year about 28 basis points and I would think that has we look to quarter two, we would expect to see that trend be slightly increasing margins.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning, Richard. Question on the CCAR. You've been a leader in payout and cap returns for the last couple years. That said, the magnitude of your requested increase in dividends and buybacks this year was a little less than the Street was expecting and relative to peer increases. Did you look at the results and kind of feel like, wow, I left some money on the table or we were conservative here, particularly on the dividend payout? Maybe just some thoughts on what you were thinking as you went through the request and kind of how you felt when you looked afterwards?", "Richard Davis", "Yeah, that\u2019s a really fair question. I had no regrets after I read everybody\u2019s but I did studied hard as you would expect we would, let me put this way and just in my just be\u2013 philosophy but until interest rates start to move again and we have a higher sense of control over the final outcomes that we provide you guys.", "It didn\u2019t seem reasonable to me and had nothing to do with the fact that we should increase our dividend above that 30%, 31% level, until which time we had more control.", "So you\u2019ll never hear on this call that we\u2019re going to wave our ability to create outcomes because something else is changing our future like interest rates. We has to manage to it but it does take away our ability to be certain that we have control over the bottom line and this whole discussion today about when interest rates move, its torture for us but at the same time, I haven\u2019t stretch so hard that I have to worry that something doesn\u2019t go like we hope to, - that the company is now over expending or that I miss my opportunity to work with the fact to exceed that 30%.", "Another way to say it is, I\u2019m prepared to as effect from more than 30% on dividends, what I feel that we got to control over the profit we put together in October and like in the old days, it\u2019s highly deliverable in the next year solely based on our execution not on somebody\u2019s else decision on when the rights move.", "So, that\u2019s where you are seeing as a company that is conservative to control its own destiny and not wanted to send signals and tell that we can confirm it. I would not have asked for more than 30%, 31% and in terms of buy backs that will probably be the other place you\u2019ll see us extending ourselves a little further because we do have control over that, we can shut them up if we need to.", "And so at the end of the day you probably will see our buybacks go up a little more than our dividend request double and I think as soon as we get that confident that we have the control of the entire company like we want you\u2019re going to see us to be a little more aggressive.", "But for now, I\u2019m satisfied with where we are and actually quite pleased with how this has moved out nice and slow and predictable, repeatable. I think our shareholders at least can count on a steady state return and that\u2019s what I promise them.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks. That's very clear and fair. On that point about the controllable/non-controllable, you mentioned that you've got the plan for a modest positive operating leverage, but it could get tough if you don't get the midyear rate hike. What is the debate that you have there? It sounds like you don't want to cut too much and cut into muscle. Do you have some kind of break the glass program to use? This is going to be longer than we thought? Is there room on deposit funding costs or other expenses even though you are already pretty lean where you can pull and try to get this balance right?", "Richard Davis", "That is the dilemma, right, broken glass. And so we've never invited a third party to come and tell us how to watch our expenses. We have never created a special campaign and named it tell people that they are going to lose their job and stop with that.", "We are not going to do that and I am not. Maybe it is the effect of being in this for eight years but what I like to do is have gone through this whole recession and not have had to do that because I just can\u2019t describe to you the impact of execution when the employees trust the company and trust that they are going to be safe.", "It\u2019s just its remarkable. So I rather have 67,000 people here who feel really good about their job and the company that has their back through the tough times that has 69,500 we're at any time 2,500 wonder if they are going to lose their job and the other 67,000 wonder if they are the next.", "So, I can\u2019t explain that very well as a CEO, its almost, we will have somebody to try to write a book on it but that\u2019s really important to me and this team into this board. If you told me interest rates are going to be flat for the next three years, I believe that to be the case, we do have the broken glass scenario.", "It would be reduction in force. It would be a very aggressive but thoughtful, precise reduction in people and in expenses and things that honestly you would know would impair the near term and long term but you would have to do it to get to the other side.", "I\u2019m hardly convinced after this eight years of recession that we're going to get interest rates to move again. I do believe it\u2019s worth hanging on. So, I will give you my Richard Davis dorky way of thinking about it.", "Remember in high school, the bar hang, the bar hang was a test we have to take for the President's Fitness Award. The bar hang was 90 seconds on the bar and if you remembered it all, the last 10 seconds were a torture. But they were equal to the exact same value as the first ten second which were nothing.", "And I feel like we are here at the last 10 seconds and this company is going to hang on longer than anybody and it is torture but I want to do it for the right reasons because in two years and four years and six years, you guys are all going to be asking how we are doing in a positive environment with a great economy and I want to harken back to times like this and say, we gave up a 10 year to a near term profit in order to be able to say to you here in the future that we are amazing company doing as well in great times as we did in the tough time.", "So that is the discussion around the table and I am holding up for your advice not to do any reduction in force so that we can have a great future while watching every penny which you know we have done for years that we do have expected extended this point in time. It\u2019s tough.", "John McDonald", "All right, well, keep hanging and thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Well thank you. Good one. I should have violins in the back too - ", "John McDonald", "Better than pull ups.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. How much did the low tax rate help this quarter?", "Kathy Rogers", "Mike, that helped us this quarter by about a penny.", "Mike Mayo", "Okay, so I guess versus consensus you would have been a penny short or maybe there are some offsets to that. But if you were a penny short, then what are some of the risks that you are not taking that might have held back your earnings? Richard, you just mentioned the bar hang and 67,000 people who will be more productive over the next 5 to 10 years because they don't have to worry about a strategy of the day. But in addition to that, what else are you doing that might hold back earnings now for the benefit of the future?", "Richard Davis", "To tell people, people because I\u2019ve got all the other expenses quite well aligned, our compliance cost are still at the high point but they\u2019re not getting higher because we manage that and we\u2019re moving through the momentary stages of some of these creation of the compliance groups, the order functions and even the first-line defense in the lines of business.", "There is no expenses that we\u2019re not watching and haven\u2019t and there is really no other activity but FTE paying people fairly and compensating them well. ", "So Mike that\u2019s and following John\u2019s question they are perfect back to back, it would be simply around sitting on the table and say we cut people and we simply don\u2019t want to do that.", "So that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing is asking them to work harder, your decision is whether or not we\u2019ve got enough of a good culture here that our people will work harder, they will sustain it and they will do better than others and that\u2019s good enough and otherwise you can challenge the fact that I either should be taking a reduction of \u2013 or that should be adding a bunch of people and taking hits from you guys for having really negative operating leverage and I\u2019m not doing that either, it is kind of right down the middle.", "But we\u2019re not withholding on anything else that would cause us to be unable to deliver on everything we said we would in tough and especially in good times.", "Mike Mayo", "I guess I am stuck on that last 10 seconds of the 90-second bar hang. And sometimes, especially as you get older, I am finding this out, it makes sense just to let go, so --.", "Richard Davis", "This is funny because last night I told my wife, what I was going to say if this came up at some \u2013 talking to this stupid bar hang, what you will think and she smiled and she turned around and she said and just a record tell them you actually hung on for two minutes.", "So the fact is this company can hang on past the 90 seconds, we can. We are not all actually ready to roll. But it\u2019s tough always I was trying to say not that we are about to follow, it just gets really tough and as long as you know that it\u2019s the gut that carries you through the stuff and the best companies and our business are going to be the ones who have the will and the ability and the trust to get through it.", "I\u2019m just convinced it again the book on the right but it\u2019s that degree spirit of a company acting like a person that believes anything is possible and delivering it with the certain level of pride. But I\u2018ve got nothing more to show you forward.", "Mike Mayo", "Last follow-up on this Richard Davis versus the 10 year bond?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. I thought that. I stop a minute, it\u2019s down 25 basis points since we last talked, it has fallen below two but go ahead ask your question?", "Mike Mayo", "Well no, just the quarterly update. Seems like you're feeling better about the economy, but we are still waiting for it. Is -- what -- how -- do you feel better than last quarter about the economy, or are we just all still waiting here?", "Richard Davis", "John\u2019s question is very beginning exactly I feel better about the economy, I did 90 days ago, I can see that it\u2019s not better for banking in the near term. It is that simple and when rates move up, I am going to love the economy and I\u2019m going to love the Fed, I am going to love our future.", "But right now I think the economy is really that strong, record stock market performance, Europe is coming back, we have got customers \u2013 cash all over the place, they have got money in their pocket because fuel prices are down and they don\u2019t need bankers much as they are going to need us.", "So we just want to keep them all, it is happy customers and we will be there when they are ready but right now we are probably on the low end of their need to get through the day priorities and for that it\u2019s not correlated, a great strong economy and improving economy is not necessary good for banks until rates start to kick in.", "Mike Mayo", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.", "Paul Miller", "Hey, can you talk a little bit about -- because you've got some of the best, I think, mobile apps out there and how -- and everybody is seeing mobile banking really pick up especially with the new accounts. How do you see the mobile banking, online banking in your branch system work together?", "Richard Davis ", "I will go first and have Andy jump in, you know I were really good in mobile banking is because we\u2019re great in mobile payments and I take into out much that matters and I actually wouldn\u2019t know if I had a bank that didn\u2019t have this large payments, I would just, I would know what I don\u2019t know.", "We have a thing called the grove, grove down in Atlanta where we have our payments group it is hundreds of people is that they are going to do nothing but work on merchants and consumer paradigms and modules on how to change the way they move money around.", "And it\u2019s a ton of customer who is up for lot of money we spend and by the way I haven\u2019t taken that out all of our forecast but because we have merchants who work with us to create better mobile apps, the net transfers backwards to mobile banking because mobile banking is just kind of a mini app to people moving money intrabank and between them and merchants and the merchants are really the smart ones that had a good stuff and sold and stuff moved about.", "So that is one of the reasons we\u2019re so good at it and because we have people in house that are focused on something even greater than that.", "And I\u2019m kind of excited to showcase that particularly high at our next investor meeting little over a year from now. So that is one of the reasons we do well, it relates to the branch staying there or the benefactors of that and Andy you might carry on.", "Andy Cecere", "In addition to why Richard said, I would mention that the other key aspect of this is making sure the branch is working together with the mobile payments and mobile banking side of the equation.", "So they\u2019re working as one, so the seamless delivery of transactions and products and the ability to buy or sell looking at it from the perspective of a customer and if they start something on mobile, want to finish it the branch or vice versa that we\u2019re all in sync in terms of the process from a customer\u2019s perspective.", "And Paul I appreciate bring it up because most of you guys live on East Coast and bank on East Coast and you actually don\u2019t get to experience us so there is not a branch down the street that I can send you to or you don\u2019t just walk, buy and see whatever our current collateral is but if you all want to come online and take a look at it, it\u2019s really, really good stuff and it would be our pleasure to have you experience us through a more mobile approach than just perhaps the old brick and mortar.", "Paul Miller", "Well, I know we've seen when somebody comes up with a really cool mobile app, it's copied very quickly. But one of the things that you have that I have not seen anybody else have is the automatic bill pay app. Is that just because you work with the merchants so close you are able to develop it? Do you think other people will be able to develop that same product?", "Andy Cecere", "I think it gets back to what Richard talked about which is our R&D and looking at different aspects of what we can do on a mobile app and what we can do in a branch and what people can do at home and then doing in ATM and trying to make everything as convenient as possible and as a cross channel as possible as we can.", "Paul Miller", "Okay guys. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Good morning. Thank you. Richard, I had a follow-up on your comments about rate increases and positive operating leverage. To the extent that the frequency and magnitude of rate increases came in lower than what the market currently expects, do you have a sense for how much of an increase you would need to see to achieve operating leverage? Maybe if you could just give us a sense of whether you have kind of run through the math and what that breakpoint is?", "Richard Davis", "Yes I\u2019m pretty transparent, we expect it to increase starting in June, June, July, September, December 25 each, if that doesn\u2019t happen you can back into our math and do a pretty quick calc and that flows down and moves pay to September and only one in December which is now the prevailing view that will put pressure on our positive operating leverage.", "I have no idea what the next nine months of this year going to be, they will be very, very tough will be very close to flat or even slightly negative and that would be where I get back around the table like John and Mike talked and sit down the group and say does that enough of the reason for us to carry favor with the investment community to try to be positive from one year which you may or may not remember in order to do something draconian or do I take my lumpsum, have you guys little disappointed but understand why we had a slight negative operating leverage to live to fight next year when things will be highly positive.", "I will probably go to the latter but I will promise you - conversation and every time there is an adjustment we will see the impacts and decide whether or not it\u2019s worthy of taking a near term or longer term view.", "Bill Carcache", "Understood. That's very clear. Thank you. If we look at your loan growth -- on a separate topic -- on a year-over-year basis to take out seasonality, the growth in residential mortgage in particular has been decelerating for about nine quarters and turned negative this quarter. And I think we are kind of -- by looking at it year-over-year, we would strip out seasonality. So I'm not sure like some of the comments about weather and stuff would really play a role. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little more specifically about your outlook there and address how you are thinking about that deceleration and what gives you confidence going forward in the resumption of growth in that area in particular.", "Andy Cecere", "Bill this is Andy, the principal reason for that decline is our smart refinance product that is a branch originated high quality refinance product that has been shrinking because refinance volumes were coming down throughout the year as rates were not moving down as rapidly.", "The pipeline for that right now is little stronger because of what we saw in the first quarter, so I think you will start to see a little bit of an uptick certainly done a downtick in that category in the future quarter and then the other wildcard in the overall category is home equity loans as I mentioned in the retail category which we\u2019re seeing strong growth and strong pipelines.", "Bill Carcache", "Excellent thanks very much and I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning. Sorry I came into the call late. Another of your competitors' call ran way over, but --. ", "Andy Cecere", "No matter what you say I am going to say we already answered it.", "Nancy Bush", "No you are not going to get away with that.", "Andy Cecere", "All right, I will try.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes, one of your competitors just did a material purchase of CRE loans from GE Capital and it looks like GE Capital is going to be the gift that keeps on giving. So I am wondering if you have any appetite for that or if you are looking in other places for portfolios of loans?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes and yes. More than I have in the past because if I can\u2019t deploy it in normal course, then I have got deposits, I honestly love and tell that but don\u2019t know what to do as the answer is yes to both.", "GE is way too early to know until they get out some RFPs and take a look at what pieces particularly leasing would be of interest to us as we look at our big equipment financing business that we have here in the company and there are other portfolios that we would be interested in defending that could be credit card portfolios, it could be high quality auto portfolios but it\u2019s got to be something that we do already.", "It has got to be underwritten qualities that we would do ourselves and if we do something of any size, we are going to spend more time and due-diligence will be a nightmare for whoever it is because we want to due diligence likely underwrite it ourselves and if we can\u2019t get that level of comfort. I will pass all day long because I really don\u2019t need to introduce anybody else\u2019s problems into our otherwise high credit quality but my appetite is definitely higher based on the lack of alternatives on how to deploy both the deposit growth we have and capital that we are starting out to build.", "Nancy Bush", "And given the portfolios that you may be seeing right now, is the pricing attractive? We're still scratching our heads over that.", "Andy Cecere", "That\u2019s a good question in fact as we put our student loan portfolio out for sale, they are attractive to us because there is a market out to the people who want to pay a premium it seems for something that we have less value for.", "So I do think that it\u2019s going to be the expensive proposition if you don\u2019t get it the right way and if you don\u2019t due diligence and underwrite it properly for potential risk as we all think the world we have today is a good proxy for how loans will perform.", "So I think, I think it\u2019s going to be rough tough to find something you like at the right value and that\u2019s why we won\u2019t overpay either and that is one of the reasons we are attracted at this moment to put our portfolios, student loans out for sale because there seems to be a fairly robust level of interest and premium out there that will take.", "So it may just come down the fact that will look but we won\u2019t like the pricing will step away anyway.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes, and just a final note on that. It looks like the deal that Wells Fargo did was something of a joint venture with Blackstone. Are you seeing other private equity pools or whatever out there that you might want to do some kind of similar transaction with?", "Andy Cecere", "I don\u2019t know their deal but no we don\u2019t like partners. We are not great good partner. We want to own it, we want to control it, and with third party particularly, third party in every way now in banking has become an intensely added risk.", "It is like more than a two. So anything we do with the third party we have to operate it though we have full control, we have to have information that allows us to have full control and then if you don\u2019t have full control even if you have all the information, it is a whole lot less rewarding when something happens you are not absolutely able to predict. So for us probably not.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Nancy and by the way we have not answered that question.", "Operator", "There are no further questions.", "Richard Davis", "Perfect thanks, operator.", "Sean O'Connor", "Thanks for joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions please contact me this afternoon. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, July 22 at 12 AM midnight, Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Sean O'Connor - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Kalea, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2015 results and answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I will begin with our review with U.S. Bank's results as a summary of the quarter's highlights are available on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2015, or a record $0.80 per diluted common share, a 2.6% increase year-over-year.", "Total average loans grew 4% year-over-year and 0.7% linked quarter, excluding student loans, which were reclassified to held for sale at the end of the first quarter. In addition, we continue to experience strong growth in total average deposits of 8.9% over the prior year and 2.6% linked quarter. Net new DDA account growth was especially strong this quarter, growing 4% annualized.", "Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 15.2% from the prior year and increased modestly from the previous quarter. The increase from the previous quarter is a result of lower recoveries. Total non-performing assets declined compared to both the prior year quarter and on a linked quarter basis.", "We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.2% at June 30. I'm also pleased that we were able to return 76% of our earnings to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of our dividend and the repurchase of 14 million shares of common stock.", "Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics. And they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.46%. Our return on average common equity was 14.3%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.03%. Kathy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.2%, lower than the prior quarter. We expect this ratio to remain in the low-50%s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends driven by the economic environment while continuing to invest in and grow our business.", "Turning to slide five, the company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5 billion, a 2.8% decline from the prior year. Excluding the prior year notable item, total net revenue increased 1.4%. The increase was due to the higher net interest income as well as strong growth in trust and investment management fees, merchant processing services and higher credit and debit card revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. I'm particularly pleased with the improving trends in our payments business, especially our merchant and credit card businesses, which Kathy will discuss in later detail.", "Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $9 billion or 4% year-over-year and 0.7% linked quarter, excluding student loans which were reclassified to held-for-sale at the end of the first quarter.", "Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 11% year-over-year and 2.1% over the prior quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 10.5% and 2% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the second quarter.", "Residential mortgages declined 1.4% year-over-year and 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 1.3% year-over-year and were seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 5.7% year-over-year and 1.7% over the prior quarter excluding student loans. The increase was mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans and continued positive momentum in the home equity loans, which grew 4.1% year-over-year. We expect average linked quarter loan growth to be back in the 1% to 1.5% range in the third quarter.", "Total average deposits increased $23 billion or 8.9% over the same quarter of last year and 2.6% over the previous quarter. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to slide seven and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 15.2% on a year-over-year basis and increased 6.1% from the previous quarter. The linked quarter increase resulted from lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 48 basis points in the second quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 7% on a linked quarter basis and 18.8% from the second quarter of 2014.", "During the second quarter, we released $15 million of reserves, equal to the prior quarter, and $10 million less than the second quarter of 2014. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the level of net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2015.", "Kathy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2015 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.80 was 2.6% higher than the second quarter of 2014 and 5.3% higher than the prior quarter. The second quarter of 2014 included two previously disclosed notable items impacting other non-interest income and other non-interest expense that together had no impact on diluted EPS.", "The $12 million or 0.8% decrease in net income year-over-year was principally due to a reduction in net interest income related to the previously discussed wind-down of our checking account advance product that ended in the second quarter 2014, lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities, and an expected increase in non-interest expense excluding the prior year notable items. Partially offsetting these variances was a decline in the provision for credit losses. On a linked quarter basis, net income was higher by $52 million or 3.6% mainly due to increases in fee-based revenue.", "Turning to slide nine, net interest income increased year-over-year by $26 million or 0.9%. The increase was a result of growth in average earning assets of 9.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin including lower loan fees. Approximately $40 million of the reduction in loan fees was due to the checking account advance product wind-down.", "The net interest margin of 3.03% was 24 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, as well as lower reinvestment rates on investment securities, lower loan fees due to the checking account advance product wind-down, lower rates on new loans and a change in loan portfolio mix, partially offset by lower funding costs.", "Net interest income was higher linked quarter principally due to an additional day in the current quarter relative to the prior quarter with higher average earning assets, offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.03% was 5 basis points lower than the first quarter. The reduction in the net interest margin was principally due to continued change in loan portfolio mix, the impact of higher cash balances as a result of continued deposit growth along with growth in lower rate investment securities and lower investment portfolio reinvestment rates. We expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the third quarter.", "Slide 10 highlights non-interest income, which declined $172 million or 7.0% year-over-year. Excluding the second quarter 2014 notable item, non-interest income increased year-over-year. We saw strong growth in trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services as well as higher credit and debit card revenue.", "As Richard mentioned, we are pleased with the improving growth trends in our merchant and retail card businesses. Merchant processing revenue, while up 2.9%, was negatively impacted by foreign currency rate changes. Excluding this impact, merchant processing fees grew approximately 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. This growth compared to approximately 5% year-over-year in the first quarter.", "Retail credit and debit card fees grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis compared to 0.8% year-over-year in the first quarter. Credit and debit card volumes grew 7% in the second quarter. Retail credit and debit card fees continued to be negatively impacted on a year-over-year basis by the cost of rewards that were increasing in 2014. As we previously mentioned, we would expect this negative impact to dissipate in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a $47 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities, which more than offset higher origination and sales revenue earned from the 34% increase in application volume.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $118 million or 5.5% principally due to seasonally higher fee revenue, and credit and debit card revenue, merchant processing services, and deposit service charges in addition to higher trust and investment management fees.", "Moving to slide 11, non-interest expense decreased year-over-year by $71 million or 2.6%. Excluding the second quarter 2014 notable item, non-interest income increased 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities and increased employee benefit expense mainly due to higher pension costs.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income (sic) [non-interest expense] increased by $17 million or 0.6%. The increase is primarily due to increases in professional services due to mortgage servicing and compliance related matters, marketing and business development due to the timing of various marketing programs and compensation expense, principally reflecting the impact of merit increases. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee benefits expense, primarily resulting from the seasonally lower payroll taxes, and a decrease in other expenses mostly due to insurance-related recoveries.", "Prudent expense management remains a priority for our company. For example, our decision to hold FTE flat except for compliance needs in place since the beginning of 2014 remains in place today. We also continue to manage other discretionary expenses where appropriate, while continuing to make investments in businesses and products that will yield a high level of return. This philosophy is and has been a strength in how we manage our company and this focus will continue going forward.", "Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $16.79 at June 30, representing a 10% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 20% for the second quarter.", "Turning to slide 13. In June, the board of directors declared a 4.1% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result, in the second quarter, we returned 76% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 32% of the return to shareholders, and the 14 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Kathy. I'm very proud of our second quarter results. We delivered solid financial performance in a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. We continued to achieve industry-leading performance measures. Because of the overall strength and consistency of our results, we returned 76% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in the second quarter.", "As we move to the second half of 2015, I'm confident we will continue to deliver solid financial results. We'll continue to take the appropriate and effective actions including tighter expense management to ensure that we are meeting our value creation objectives for our customers and for our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jon.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Jon.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just a question on your last comment, Richard, you used the term tighter on expense management. Does that mean you're a little less optimistic on the revenue outlook or is it just basically a similar approach? Has anything changed?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yeah, I'm actually more optimistic on the revenue for the second half because things have turned the corner and I think you'll see, with NIM flattening out, with loan growth now, as I'm committing to well, at the 1% or higher because I can see already see that for quarter three, and the knowledge that our mortgages business is \u2013 the balance sheet is growing again, I think we are feeling quite good about revenue. What I'm still waiting for is the interest rate impact that would occur if the Fed increases rates.", "So if they don't, we're going to continue to put \u2013 keep in place this FTE hold we've had now for, as Kathy said, a year-and-a-half. That's worth, by the way, thousands of FTE that we haven't added and therefore we haven't had to talk about reducing either. And then all the discretionary things that we continue to do to keep ourselves at the efficiency level you come to expect. So revenues actually got a nice trajectory in the second half. Expenses will come down as we watch our nickels and dimes, but I will tell you the cost of compliance has erased a lot of the benefits I would otherwise hope to have gotten a year-and-a-half ago when we started this as we've continued to add the compliance personnel, audit personnel, and not just in those areas but in the front line where we have that same compliance responsibility that's gone up substantially.", "But expenses we'll continue to watch, Jon, like I promised. And I've always said that if we have to be more draconian, we will, but the FTE hold and watching our vacancies and things has served us pretty well so far.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Good. And then I guess one of the items you singled out in growth was the corporate business, and that seems to have been driving the growth. Talk to us a little bit about what's going on there; is this large corporate driving it? Or is it broader based?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's way broader based. So in fact, much as I like the 2.1% linked quarter in C&I, that's one of our lowest quarters in the last six quarters and I'm actually kind of satisfied with that because we're now getting competing growth from the retail consumer side, which is what we've been long waiting for and that's why, one of our reasons we can say that the margin will start to flatten out because the mix will start to be balanced.", "So commercial business, the bond markets are driving balance reductions, because people are driving to the bond market, and so to still get 2.1% linked quarter means we're doing real business for real customers that have other needs that aren't just M&A related. We also see that more opportunity for us in the fee business given our involvement in that M&A market on the capital market side, which we didn't have, as you know, a few years ago. So that's a kind of twofer for us; if we can't get it in loan growth, we'll get it in fees.", "Syndication loan market is really strong. If you notice, we were in the top four on the investment grade league table this quarter. It's our first time we've broken into the top four, so we're seeing that as a business for us that's starting to pay dividends that we invested in a few years ago. So C&I is strong.", "Commercial real estate, that's not as strong. That's more flat for us; it was last quarter and it's going to be just slightly up in quarter three. We're okay with that because I've told you before, we see that as a market that can get overheated in the micro-market, so we're very careful in particular in where we do business. The coasts are doing the best based on the growth that's present and I think where some of the job growth, say, Atlanta, Denver, is driving new interest in office space and things like that.", "Construction is primarily apartments and office, not so much retail yet, but we are seeing a lot of that construction on the smaller end being done by cash, which is fine because we've been long saying that the first step towards a bank's balance sheet improvement is cash moving out of here to be used for growth, then lines of credit being used for growth, then new lines and loans being brought onto the balance sheet; and we're still in that first phase from what I can see.", "And then finally, Jon, bringing a little more color on loans altogether, the consumer side is doing quite nicely. Our auto loans are up 10% over the first quarter, and that's on a backdrop of a very strong auto market, as you have seen now, the projections continue to be very strong. And then our home equity, as I mentioned in my comments, are also strong. That's up 4.1%. And interestingly enough, these accounts are now coming at larger line sizes; people are using their home equity for home improvement and home repairs, some debt consolidation, but mostly improving the property. And they're using the balances now more than they did even a year ago. So we're starting to see some nick uptick. And you know we don't have that home equity bubble at the bank here that a lot of companies do, so we're not trying to offset that runoff.", "And then maybe lastly, because we brought it up last quarter, we did see some improvement in our balance sheet on the mortgage side. As you'll recall, on the jumbo mortgages, we agreed to become a little more market competitive on price. And in the last month of the second quarter, we saw the balance sheet starting to grow again and we hope that that will pursue itself into quarter three. It has a lot to do with what rates do, but our purchase to refi right now is 70/30 in the mortgage business. And if we can continue to get back to where that mortgage balance sheet is growing, at least slightly, that helps our total loan growth get back into that 1% to 1.5% range.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Good. Then you're saying you already have some visibility for a bit better growth in Q3? Okay.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We do. And a lot of that is \u2013 or I wouldn't be so strong in predicating that for you.", "Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good Morning, guys. Let's see, Richard or Kathy, I was hoping you could add a little to your response on the expense side in Jon's question there a second ago. Richard, are you suggesting that we're kind of at a high watermark for expense? I believe you said expenses would come down. I guess I'm just curious without doing something more draconian, where are they going to come down from? And just as we look out in the third quarter, I guess, you have between the \u2013 I think there was a vender reimbursement and then the insurance recovery about a cumulative $35 million or so of headwind, so where does that come out of and what's sort of that near-term outlook on that cost side?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So I'm going to call it more flattish. It's going to be close to what you see now, if anything \u2013 it's not coming down, so let's put it that way. But I don't see any material increases either. What's happening here is the cost of compliance is at its high watermark. As you know, we are a part of that mortgage foreclosure activity that we've extended and that's going to continue to cost us and we will continue to add compliance and audit in virtually every part of the company. So that's in there.", "Things that will come down to offset those headwinds are continued discretionary expense control that we just never talk about here. I mean we don't have a name for it. We don't bring people to tell us how to do it. We've got a real heavy tight rein right now on discretionary expenses, marketing, travel, things that are less necessary. And from FTE being flat for a year and a half and still doing quite well to taking things like vacancies, extending vacancies, moving those up and being very prudent about how we manage the quality of our people.", "So I may have mentioned last time that we're also getting a pretty thorough review of our low performing employees in the company. Since FTE needs to be flat, you have your right to use your FTE but you better have the best you can. So I am encouraging people to improve the bottom performers and trade them out and get the best quality staff we can as this recovery is about to hit us. So we can keep all that in general check. With revenue moving up, that's going to help our efficiency for sure. But I don't want to leave with fact we're going to take expenses down but I think they're at a place that you can watch for and a slightly potential increase over the next couple of quarters only because of the cost of compliance if I can't out run it with vacancies.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. And that's perfect. Thank you. And then maybe if I could switch gears for just a second, could you maybe expand upon the thoughts you had in your prepared remarks just in the payments businesses, just trying to distinguish how much of the better performance this quarter was the typical seasonal boost versus what I kind of interpret it as sort of a more \u2013 kind of more constructive commentary about how those businesses are going just...", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. You heard it right. I'm going to give Kathy the detail, but I want to say, last quarter, the payments businesses weren't that robust. In part, by the way, it was the FX which is hard to describe. It sounds like an excuse, but in other companies, it's a real impact and then it affects us in this one category. But under a line, we saw everything get much stronger and we really like the second half for payments as we get into the second quarter's look back now as it's improved from quarter one. But, Kathy, bring some color to that.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think, as Richard said, we were very pleased with what we saw in our momentum in the payments businesses. If you think about our merchant processing, I'll start there, I think that's one of our better stories right now. In the first quarter, if you take out the impact of FX, we grew about 5%. As we look into second quarter, that number grew to about 7.5%. Same-store sales were kind of in that in the North American market in about that 5.5% range. And I think that \u2013 so we are seeing some additional growth there that we think will continue as we look forward.", "Our credit and debit card fees were also, we saw momentum there. We've been talking about the fact that rewards costs have been a headwind for us and that was absolutely true. In the first quarter, as you recall, we had a year-over-year growth of 0.9%. This year, you will see that growth increasing. So that headwind is diminishing and as we get into the later quarters, I would expect to even see more improvement as that continues to diminish in the second half of the year. So we are very pleased with the momentum there and would expect to see some good signs of this as we look out into future quarters.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. That's perfect. Thank you, guys, for the color.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning. Just on the margin. Wanted to see if you can give us a little bit of color on how you're thinking about the margin in coming quarters. Just given the competition on the loan front, could you still see similar mid-single digit compression over the next several quarters? Is that the best way to think about it?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "John, I'm going to say I think we're starting to see the margin stabilize and I think that's coming from a couple of different reasons. As Richard mentioned earlier, we are starting to see a pickup in our loan growth on the retail side and that's going to help. As you recall, we've been calling out an impact of several basis points on a linked quarter basis related to the mix of our growth. So as retail starts to pick up, that's going to help us. Additionally, what we are seeing is that as loans and securities run off and we're replacing them with new, that spread between what's running off and coming on is starting to get a little closer together, so \u2013 or getting smaller. So that's going to help us as well. So I think, as I look out into the third quarter, I'm going to call that our net interest margin is going to be relatively stable.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Right. I guess, what I should \u2013 the way I should have asked it is how do you define relatively stable? Because I think you had alluded to some emerging stability in the past, but we still saw mid-single digit compression. So...", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Actually \u2013 okay, so, John, we actually never did say we're stable. We were super transparent and always said it would be 3 basis points to 5 basis points or 3 basis points to 6 basis points, and we did mention it by 1 basis point. So stable to us is give or take 1 basis point, maybe 2 basis points, either direction. But right now, we're forecasting this thing to be flat and we could be surprised. But we'll have a chance later in the quarter to update you guys. We tell you exactly what we see as soon as we see it, and we are extremely transparent and clear, so stable means stable.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Good. Good. All right. And then separately in terms of the deposit side, if you could just give us a little bit of color with what you are seeing there. I mean it was exceptionally strong and surpassed our estimates, particularly around some of the interest-bearing stuff?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Hi, John, you're absolutely right. It was higher than we saw in quarter two and I will tell you it's just continued growth across all business lines. I can't call out any particular business that had higher growth than the other. We had \u2013 we just continue to see strong growth in our wholesale, our consumer and our trust businesses.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's a great problem, right? And we're not sending deposits out. We're also not rationalizing the number of branches we have. We're just rationalizing what we do in them. So that's probably keeping a lot of deposits, the core stuff. But we all know, in a few quarters or years, that's going to be the gas in the engine for making loans. And so we're going to be pleased with loan growth, deposit growth, even if we're not sure what we can do with it yet. And we'll continue to see that as a sign of more customers, net DDA was as high as it has been in years. We have a lot of new business coming in from our corporate trust, which you know, is a very important part of, 15% of our core deposit. So, it's a good news thing and as much as we are a little surprised ourselves, we're not going to do anything to send it back (28:12).", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Then, Richard, my last thing I just wanted to ask you about was about your updated thoughts on capital deployment, particularly your view of M&A opportunities here as you're looking at opportunities to put your capital to work?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Sure. We've got this \u2013 we've indicated an interest in the GE Capital, or part of their portfolio and we are in the due diligence with that. So we will keep finding an interest in asset purchases. We're continuing to find payment portfolios that we look at. We like the merchant acquiring space where you've either seen us getting new partners in the domestic, or more even often, you've seen us do it in the international side where we can find a partner and extend into another country and kind of plug-and-play like we do with our payments platform.", "And then corporate trust, we just had our board meeting a couple weeks ago and we highlighted our European trust business, which is also fund servicing and corporate trust, and they are both quite robust. The market continues to be very receiving of a new player in us being there, and we see a lot of growth opportunities. And that can be both organic and M&A, John. So that's where you're going to see us. Not whole bank transactions \u2013 what you've seen in the last few years is what you'll see in the next couple. And I think that as the tail falls off of what I'll call the statute of limitations of inheriting somebody else's problems from the early years of the recession, as that falls off in a couple of years, we'll probably be back into the game of buying whole companies or looking at whole banks. But for now, that just doesn't suit our appetite.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "All right. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Paul.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Good morning, guys. This is actually Thomas on behalf of Paul. Richard, you talked a little bit about how you've been participating more in the jumbo market lately, I guess, in particular on pricing. What's giving you the confidence to take that leap? And obviously that's helped your consumer growth.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let's have Andy respond to that, he's got the mortgage business under his leadership.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Good morning, Thomas. You know it's about our customers. So our customers are choosing to go longer in terms of their mortgage product given the low rate and the fixed rate and the 30-year. So they're financing out of either what they have today or variable floating into longer jumbo. We want to serve our customers' needs so we're putting those in our books. They're not coming out as loss, they're just coming out a little thinner spread than what would be historic, but given our low cost of capital as well as our low funding costs, they're still profitable for us.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Great. And then I guess one more question sort of on the loan growth, loan growth seems like it's picking up for you guys. Does that mean that more of the reinvestment of sort of the excess deposit growth which has been mentioned was very strong last quarter will go towards the loan side rather than securities? Or can we still expect some investment securities growth as well?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think at this point, what you'll see is, as loans start to increase, that will really help offset the deposit increase, so I think you'll see that. There might be some modest investment security just based on the balance sheet positioning and so forth, but it's really going to be used by deposits \u2013 or loans. The deposit growth will be used by loans.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Thomas.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Erika.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Richard, we asked your peers yesterday what they thought about deposit repricing as we hopefully enter a higher interest rate environment. One said that the deposit betas will be much higher because regulation has given us now classifications of good deposits and bad deposits, while your other peers seem to be more optimistic on deposit beta given that we're coming from zero. What's your view in terms of both the pace and magnitude of pass-through, if we do see the Fed raise rates this year?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, my \u2013 I'll probably be right in the middle and that's not like me, I like to take a position. But I'll tell you my answer's just a little different. We \u2013 God, we all want this deposit beta to go up because we want that money to be used in some form of growth in the American economy. I mean it really is at record high levels and it's not sustainable. And it has nothing to do with the banks keeping them or losing them, it has everything to do with consumers and businesses using it. So my hope is that there is a early beta take when rates start to move up not because of rates being higher and the cost changing but because that informs the fact that people are now investing and consumers are consuming, so I'm all for that.", "I do think that marginal beta on companies has a lot to do with what kind of level of relationship they've created with their customers, whereby if people are double banking, triple banking, the core relationship stays with the bank that's established themselves as the core partner. And I also think customers that have established themselves as feeling that they were treated well during this period, especially corporate customers, and felt that the company protected their deposits here, let them stay on the balance sheet if necessary or work them into some money center alternative, I think we'll get credit for the way we handled that over the course of the more challenging times when deposits were less attractive.", "So I'm going to say the beta is going to be \u2013 I hope it's an early, a bit of an early and abrupt start because people are using it, and then I think that the marginal beta starts to determine the quality of banking relationships you have. And I have to remind you because of our corporate trust, we will have at least 15% of our core deposits are in a different category as much as they're contractual, and they don't have the ability to move at the vagaries of rates or even consumerism, so I think we'll have a slightly better beta no matter what, and probably better than you guys have modeled, given that that's a pretty substantial amount of money as we continue to grow corporate trust.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's a great point.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for highlighting that. And just, Kathy, as a follow up to Thomas' question, does that mean that your earning asset growth is going to now match your loan growth? Over the past several quarters, it's outpaced your loan growth. And I guess a follow up question to that is could you give us a sense on where you are towards the LCR standard for January 2016?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, let me start with the LCR first. And I will tell you that, at the end of last year, we had met that ratio. So we were fully compliant with LCR at the end of 2014. I will tell you one other aspect of our earning asset growth in addition to investment securities that's held for sale particularly around our mortgage environment, so I think that as you think about total earning asset growth, I think that it will more closely approximate loans going forward, but you'll have to take into account the held for sale activity as \u2013 depending on what the mortgage market does.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Erika.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bill.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Good morning. I had a follow-up question on cards. I've heard a lot of your comments on payments, particularly a lot of items affecting the fee income line, but I was hoping more \u2013 to focus a little bit more on the spread. And it looks like you've been seeing a pretty consistent reduction in year-over-year credit card loan growth over the last several quarters to most recently 1.3% this past quarter. That's a little bit slower relative to the rest of the industry. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about what \u2013 give a little color around what's driving that and what you anticipate going forward.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let's have Andy give you a brief color on that.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Sure, Bill. On a quarterly basis, it's down principally due to seasonality, so that is not uncommon from quarter one to quarter two to be down; on a year-over-year basis, it's about 2%. Part of the factor that is impacting that is auto sales, and spend is up closer to 5%, 5.5%. People are paying down more of their balances with perhaps some of the excess they're getting from the fuel side of the equation, so we're seeing pay it down rates being higher, revolve rates being lower, even though sales are up.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And so just looking at the average loans on slide 15 that shows the year-over-year growth, so really we can tell from second quarter 2014 till now that growth rate has been downward. So as we look forward from here, would you expect that kind of similar trajectory or would that pick up a little bit?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think, on a linked quarter basis, we would start to think that we're \u2013 we do feel confident we'll be back into that 1% to 1.5% range.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. And then my last question is more on kind of broadly the upcoming interchange rate reductions in Europe, in particular, the capping of debit and credit interchange at 20 basis points and 30 basis points respectively. Can you discuss whether Elavon offers pass-through or bundled pricing to its merchant partners in Europe? Just trying to kind of understand the extent to which you might be able to benefit from the upcoming interchange rate reductions in Europe.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "I think for the most part, that interchange impact will not impact Elavon in Europe, so it will \u2013 our rate of revenue will not be impacted by that change.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Sure.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ken.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Ken.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Hi, guys. First question just on credit, it looks like you had a little lower recovery this quarter, which I would think would be expected at this point, most of the underlying metrics continue to look excellent in terms of delinquencies, NPAs, et cetera. How much room is there do you think just for charge-offs to still decline from here? I know reserve release is pretty much done, but it just looks like the underlying credit still looks quite good.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah. This is Bill. I think the one area is still in the residential space, so there is still continued improvement there. It's already getting low so the dollars aren't going to be huge at this point. But as you pointed out, the rest of the movement comes through recoveries generally on the wholesale side. Those are sporadic, sometimes they're very strong in one quarter. This quarter, they were a little lighter. Further away we get from the downturn, the fewer of those higher recovery levels we'll have. So I'd say, in general, we're at a good spot and I see a little more improvement on residential mortgage.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Got it. Thanks, Bill. And then secondly, just on \u2013 a question on the mortgage business, obviously, we had a pretty good second quarter and you had a big pump in originations. Just maybe just your general thoughts on the state of your \u2013 the housing market, the mortgage business and the outlook for production there?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So as you stated, we had a really good quarter from a year-over-year basis. We grew our app volume about 35%. As we look forward into quarter three, I do think that we'll probably see a decline in our refi balances. So I would expect as we look into quarter three, on a linked quarter basis, our application volumes will be probably down a little bit. I would say from a fee standpoint, we may be \u2013 our fee income might be modestly lower than what it is this quarter, but it's very early in the quarter. It's going to depend a lot on what we see in the rate \u2013 with the rate market and the appetite for purchases. So we'll give you a little bit of \u2013 more heads up on that as we go further into the quarter.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Ken. This is Richard. The applications up 34% in quarter two will show through in quarter three as bookings in some measure so quarter three has a lot to do with paying off quarter two. Quarter three, I think, will be a tale of interesting to watch because we will see what happens as rates start to move or the threat of rates start to move and more on the psychology of the consumer behavior.", "But I thought you'd find this interesting. I was, a couple of weeks ago, in California with our homebuilder business. They were there for our national conference and we had a large gathering. And I asked them, what interest rate level in terms of a mortgage rate would cause them to worry about the impact of future homebuilding? And they all were comfortable that 200 basis points doesn't move anybody's needle on either the affordability or the belief that they could still get into a home that they want. And that's a pretty nice range of safety for a while because I don't think any of us think rates whenever they do move up are going to move 200 basis points real quick.", "So that provides me a little confidence that the purchase market by those who actually build and live off of it is feeling pretty strong and they're not typically worried at this stage of rates moving up if they don't move more than 200 basis points. Refi is just typically what you see in the vagaries of whether people still haven't refi'd yet or whether they have a reason to take advantage of a rate they didn't heretofore. So we will learn more. I think this quarter three will tell a big story and probably a month from now, we'll have a really good sense of what the mortgage business looks like, but it's a little early now.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Understood. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Chris.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hey, Richard. How are you?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Kathy, how are you this morning?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Good.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Richard, I just want to \u2013 just, all of my questions I think have been answered, but I do want to just make sure I do a double-check on your thought process on expenses in third quarter. When you talk about flat, I know we've talked about a lot of this beating a dead horse earlier on the call, but the reported expenses of roughly $2.68 billion, it seems to me there is a couple things that you benefited from in the quarter whether it was insurance recovery or reimbursement from a business partnership. When you say flat, is it flat, are you thinking flattish with the reported number of $2.68 billion or should I gross that up for some of the benefits you had in the quarter? And if it is flat, are you thinking it is flat with the reported number, where do you get the offsets from? Is it lower marketing expenses? Is it lower professional services fees that could get you back to that level?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Chris. I'm really glad for the question because I didn't know it wasn't clear so thank you. It's not taking advantage of the one-time benefits. It's the core.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And so the things that we manage we're going to stick pretty flat to that but you won't get the benefits each quarter unless something comes out of nowhere that we're happy with. So on a reported basis, it will go up slightly. As it does though, it will go up less than it would have if we weren't continuing to put this kibosh on the cost of FTE and the cost of discretionary expenses like marketing and travel and entertainment. So, yeah, it's a good question. It will go up in the second half but it's not material and as much as we're not counting on the other benefits to accrue and if they do, we'll take them and celebrate that.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "The other thing that I'd mention, Richard, is the normal seasonality to our tax amortization \u2013 our tax credit business, which again is reflected in our tax rate all year but goes up through the year just normal seasonality and that's probably $30 million to $40 million (43:04).", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "(43:05) the second half. So as Andy is talking about the CDC and so we have expenses up above the line, but we get all the benefits on the taxes below. And if you look at one line item, that's a great reminder that that will be \u2013 you should isolate that and take a look at it. In prior years, it will be just the same as it's been in prior.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Right. So absent the tax issue, which I fully understand, it's more of a \u2013 it should gross up at least to some degree, second quarter expenses from a run rate perspective because of some of the benefits you had?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly right. (43:33)", "Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you so much, Richard.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Perfect. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Kevin.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Kevin.", "Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on some of the mortgage comments. Are you seeing an increasing amount of demand from consumers or at least incrementally regarding cash out refis or potentially a willingness to increase home equity lines in order to take advantage of higher equity and higher home prices?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Definitely the latter, right? So as I said, home equity is up 4% and it's \u2013 people are doing mostly home improvement. When I was a young banker in California 30 years ago, we used to call it a PIP, a property improvement and we used to give credit back \u2013 half the credit to the equity or the line itself, because we thought they're improving the collateral as they went. We don't do that anymore but that was the old days when people really used their house to live in it and to keep it for a longer-term and not improve it to flip it. And I think we've got psychology where people are going to live in their houses now and own them as an asset to live in with the hope that they will have some increasing value, use it when they can but not to do it in order to flip it.", "Debt consolidation for the first time, Kevin, is starting to show up again in home equity, which I guess, it makes sense later in the cycle as people want to reset one more time, but they are much more prudent than they were before. And because the quality of loans we do, we don't do debt consolidation home equity for people who are desperate. They're simply being more efficient in the way they handle their cash flow. Andy might talk to...", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. And somewhat consistent with what we are seeing in housing prices. The average line that we booked in the second quarter was up 7% versus a year ago, and the average balance of our home equity account is up over 10%.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So they are using it. In terms of cash out purchase, not seeing any evidence of that that's materially different than prior quarters. Those with cash are putting it into the house, those without it are still taking the opportunity to refi most of it and some of it with government programs.", "Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "You see that as a source of growth for you in particular, or the industry in general? Or do you feel like it's going to be something that's going to be lackluster for the next couple of years still?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know about the industry. I mean, were \u2013 I know this is an outlier for a lot of us. Two reasons. One is because we've been working first position second mortgages for a long, long time. It's been a product we've had for some reason hasn't been matched by most folks. And then I think I mentioned in my comments we also don't have that bubble that we're trying to out-run. If you look at our balance sheet, we don't have a history of being a huge home equity lender at a disparate level. So we don't have a lot to have to refi or rebook. So in this case, we're going to get the benefit of net growth from our activities and our product. So I think we'll be an outlier in a positive way.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer", "I mean our origination volume on home equity which is primarily all out of our branches has grown substantially over the last few quarters. I mean, we look back a few years ago, we barely do $1 billion, and this past year, we did \u2013 or this past quarter, we did $2 billion. So...", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's really...", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer", "It has been a nice steady growth for us and the performance has always been good. So...", "Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "Yes. You've definitely been an outlier. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hey. How are you doing? I got on the call a little late. Hopefully, this wasn't asked, I got the tail end of it. So your 22% annualized fee growth for the quarter, what is a more normal rate as we look ahead? I mean, strong fee quarter obviously, but 22% annualized, there is some items there, where would you guide us?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Well, first of all...", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all, the question was already asked, and it was a fantastic answer and I'm sorry, you missed it. But we'll be happy to repeat it for you, Mike. Actually, it wasn't asked, so we're happy to answer it.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Here's what I'd say, Mike. You have to remember, recall, for us, the second quarter is seasonally high because of our payment business and just some deposit service charges. So, I wouldn't think to annualize that quarter. I would look more at it on a year-over-year basis and I would say that we did see \u2013 we saw momentum in our payments businesses. I think that's going to continue. We had strong growth in our trust and investment management fees and I think that we would expect that to continue as well. So I would look at it a little bit more on a year-over-year basis and assume that we'll continue to add some momentum there.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "And as far as acquisitions, where do you guys stand? The sale from GE or maybe bank acquisitions. Has your appetite changed?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It hasn't changed and I did answer that one earlier. GE, we are in due diligence for one part of their portfolio \u2013 who knows? We don't have to have anything here to make it to tomorrow, so we'll just be prudent and take a look at it. We like \u2013 as I said earlier, we like acquisitions of payment companies, we like trust companies, we like overseas a lot because it seems to be an interesting market worth looking further out. Not interested in full bank transactions at this stage and what you have seen in the last few years is what you will see for the next couple.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "And then lastly, my question, Richard Davis versus the 10-year. Maybe, Richard, you're winning the recent round. I'm not sure. But what's the check on you're feeling about the growth of the U.S. economy? Are we stepping out, or is it kind of same as it's been?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think it's same as it has been, which is still slow but steady progress, right? So it's not going backwards. There's no inertia to jump it forward. My long philosophy is the minute it's known that rates are moving up whether they have to move or not, it starts to create a catalyst for people to take the action that they have heretofore been holding off on. And my hope is frankly that the consumer blinks first and starts consuming as they should and that incentivizes businesses to start investing and growing and that kind of cycle starts up again. So I'm still optimistic that we're making progress and everything's going in the right direction and I think I'm hopeful that the Fed sees it the same way and if they do, then rates start to move up. We benefit from the balance sheet being only half of our company's balance sheet, so we'll benefit just as much from the fee businesses as it relates to a stronger economy, so I'm optimistic.", "Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Vivek.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. You had very strong growth in auto loans, just wanted to understand if you could give me how much of that is prime versus non-prime?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "It is all prime, Vivek. We started a little initiative about a year-and-a-half ago to pursue the subprime, but the volume and the opportunity there was not sufficient, so we're no \u2013 we're completely a prime shop.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So if that's the case, how is the yield on that retail loans staying flat quarter-over-quarter, Andy, because prime is seeing a lot more competition from what we're hearing from everybody?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. Leasing is strong, lending is more pressured; and the net of the two is flattish.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And does the leasing also show up in retail leasing? Or does that show up in the auto lending line?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Shows up in the leasing line.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Because that seems to have been down year-over-year and linked quarter.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. And I'm just talking about on an absolute basis, if we think about spreads and profitability, when we book that next lease that's still quite profitable. The next loan, prime auto loans is probably one of the most competitive dynamic \u2013 loan categories on the balance sheet today.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Yeah. Because I can see the auto was up 5% linked quarter, that's a very strong number. Secondly, you'd \u2013 Kathy mentioned about trust and wealth management being up sharply. As I look at it, it's up $23 million year-over-year. Over half of that growth is in corporate trust fees. How much of that has come from that cleanup call stuff that The Wall Street Journal highlighted a few weeks ago?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "The cleanup call is immaterial, Vivek. And it's actually in a different...", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "It's out of...", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "...in a different line. So it's not even that number at all. That is because our corporate trust business is doing well, we continue to be number one market share across all three categories: muni, corporate and structured; doing well both domestically as well as our small footprint in Europe which is growing. So that is just strong business growth and taking share.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Got it. Okay. Glad to hear that that's immaterial. I just sort of wondered why bother to do it then?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, it's part of the structured business and the way we \u2013 and the way the documents are compiled. So it's a normal process. Many banks do it. It's not unusual and it's \u2013 we've been doing it because it is part of the document.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. All right. And lastly, you're obviously expanding on the investment banking side. I noticed that you even did a preferred stock deal where you were a co-lead underwriter. What point are you going to start breaking out IBCs from commercial products?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We \u2013 it hasn't been material enough so we haven't, but given your question, we'll look into that. I mean if that's valuable to you all, given that we're continuing to make progress and our momentum has been really good here, we'll make that a to-do for ourselves.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, we will.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Thanks, Vivek.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jack.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey. Good morning. Richard, in your prepared comments, you mentioned higher mortgage servicing regulatory expenses, it sounded incremental. Is that the correct interpretation, I guess? And then second, would these expenses be, I guess, sort of, one time to, sort of, ratchet up to a new standard? Or given your 70/30 purchase focus, is this sort of \u2013 could it be the new norm around servicing?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Good question. So it's not incremental, it's just longer than I wanted. So in my mind, I wanted this thing to be done and gone and the consent order continues. So kind of the rush to the end, right, to the finish line. So we're going to continue to spend probably between now and the end of the year at the levels you've seen. There's no relief on that at all.", "As it relates to the cost of servicing, though, it's an important decision each bank has to make. The cost of servicing is remarkably higher now than it ever was. And to take you back a couple of quarters, I think I reminded you all that that's one of the things it does is it inspires you to stay at a higher quality of customer. So if I have a customer at a FICO level that there's a risk that we may have some form of a modification before their mortgage is through its life, I'm probably not going to do it anymore because the cost of handling that customer in the modification period and phase is expensive and it's rife with compliance risk and mistakes.", "So I'm just going to go a little higher than that and make sure that all customers we bank, at least going in, are not likely to have any concerns so the servicing cost to the bank are standard operating servicing as customers pay as agreed.", "When you start getting into that lesser quality customer, the cost of servicing goes way up, and we've been feeling that because we've been dealing with all these issues we've had to go back and remedy, but we're not going to do it going forward. So it's at least the rest of this year, Jack, we're going to have those costs and then my hope is that they'll start seeing some relief into the future years as mortgage servicing. We are sticking with it. We love the business. We're going to stay in the top five as a mortgage originator and a mortgage servicer, but for now those costs are just longer than I had hoped and they're at least the rest of this year.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, the student loan, the move, the re-class, does that get you out of student loans or is there more potentially to come as sort of a headwind to the top line growth numbers as you de-emphasize that business?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's all out. So we haven't sold it, it's still out looking \u2013 we're looking at the bids and things, so it's still held for sale because we don't have an answer, but with our intent is to get entirely out of both the government and the private student loan category and take that off of our things to worry about.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "There are no further audio questions.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you, operator.", "Sean O'Connor - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you for listening to our second quarter results.

Thank you for joining our call. I will begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on page three of the presentation.", "U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2015, a record $0.81 per diluted common share, a 3.8% increase year-over-year.", "I was particularly pleased this quarter by the continued momentum in our payments business, specifically our retail card and merchant processing services, the stabilization of our net interest margin and a returnable linked quarter loan growth to our typical range of 1% to 1.5%. During the quarter, we returned our student loan portfolio from held-for-sale to held-for-investment. Subsequent to recognizing a market adjustment on the portfolio, related to disruption in student loan market. Excluding these student loan balances, total average loans grew 1.3% on a linked quarter basis.", "In addition, we continued to experience strong growth in total average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.1%. Credit quality continues to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and total non-performing assets both declined on a year-over-year basis and on a linked quarter basis.", "And finally, our capital position remains solid. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter and were able to return 80% of our earnings to shareholders in the third quarter, through a combination of our dividend and repurchase of 16 million shares of common stock.", "Slide four provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they remain among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.44%, and return on average common equity was 14.1%.", "Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.04% was essentially flat with the previous quarter margin of 3.03% as expected. This reversed a declining trend in linked quarter margin that has occurred over the past several quarters and which is principally driven by a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio.", "Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in a challenging economic environment. During the third quarter, we expanded our prudent FTE management focus and introduced a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. We anticipate our efforts related to these initiatives will begin to reflect positive momentum as we move through quarter four and into 2016.", "While we anticipate our non-interest expense will be higher on a year-over-year basis in quarter four, we expect the increase will be lower than the year-over-year increase reported in the last several quarters as a result of our actions we\u2019re taking to reduce discretionary spending using technology to reduce certain traditional expenses and focusing our spending on more productive activities.", "This is being accomplished through FTE actions as well as programs that will reduce travel cost by effectively using video and teleconferencing, increasing our use of airfare and hotel discounts and eliminating most discretionary travel. We\u2019re also expanding the use of electronic communications internally and with our customers to reduce spending in printing and postage. Additionally, we began to evaluate professional service and contract labor arrangement and we expect to see improved efficiencies as resources are more appropriately allocated.", "We\u2019ll continue to leverage this efficiency effort to drive further opportunities for more prudent and efficient spending as we move through 2016. While prudent expense management remains a priority for our Company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth, which includes investing in businesses and products that will yield a high level of return. This philosophy is and has been a strength on how we manage our Company and this focus will continue going forward.", "Moving onto slide five, I want to highlight some notable impacts to our earnings. The third quarter of 2015 included several previously disclosed unrelated items that combine relatively neutral to earnings. Specifically the Company recognized a gain from the sale of Visa Class B common stock of approximately $135 million. This was partially offset by a $58 million market valuation adjustment to write down the value of our student loan portfolio that was previously held for sale. The quarter also included approximately $60 million of elevated expenses due to the mortgage related compliance and the company-wide talent upgrade.", "Turning to slide six, the Company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5.1 billion, a 1.6% increase from the prior year excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s recent sale and the student loan market adjustments. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee related businesses, including payments.", "Kathy will now give a few more details about our third quarter results.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thanks Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $9 billion or 3.8% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter excluding student loan.", "Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.5%. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitment continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 8.9%; line utilization remained similar to the previous quarter. On a linked quarter basis, consumer loans have begun to grow at a pace stronger than wholesale loans driven by growth in our residential mortgage portfolio and continued strength in our home equity and auto lending businesses. This mix of loan growth is a key factor in the stabilization of our net interest margin.", "Residential mortgages were relatively flat year-over-year and increased 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, reversing a declining trend recognized over the previous quarter. Averaged credit card loans increased 1.1% year-over-year and were up 1.9% on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 5.6% year-over-year and 1.9% over the prior quarter excluding the student loans. The increase was mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans and continued positive momentum in home equity loans which grew 0.8% linked quarter. We would expect loan growth to continue in a 1% to 1.5% range in quarter four.", "Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion to 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.4% over the previous quarter. Growth to non-interest bearing and low-cost interest checking, money market and saving deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the run-off of maturing large dollar time deposit.", "Turning to slide eight and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1.4% on a linked quarter basis and 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 46 basis points in the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 0.6% on a linked quarter basis and 18.5% from the third quarter of 2014.", "During the third quarter, we released $10 million of reserves compared to $25 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million in the second quarter of 2015. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to the expectation of a lower level of recoveries.", "Slide nine gives a view of our third quarter 2015 results versus comparable time period. As mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.81 was 3.8% higher than the third quarter of 2014 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The $18 million or 1.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to higher net interest income and non-interest income offset by higher non-interest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net income was higher by $6 million or 0.4%, mainly due to increases in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense.", "Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $73 million or 2.7%. The increase was a result of growth in average earning assets of 6.6% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 12 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2014. The decline was principally due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rate and lower reinvestment rates on investment securities.", "Net interest income increased $51 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans and an additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 1 basis-point higher than the second quarter. The increase in net interest margin was principally due to growth in earning assets including a shift in loan mix weighted more to consumer loans and continued deposit growth partially offset by an increase in lower rate investment securities along with lower reinvestment portfolio rates. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter.", "Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which increased $84 million or 3.7% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the third quarter 2015 Visa gain of approximately $135 million partially offset by the $58 million student loan market value adjustment. The remaining increase in non-interest income was principally due to higher commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenues, and merchant processing services. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was $36 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in evaluation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activity.", "Momentum in our payments business was reflected in our third quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volume compared to 2.7% growth year-over-year in the second quarter. We would expect that credit card fees in quarter four will continue to grow in line with volume.", "Merchant processing revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year, 8.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. This increase compares to year-over-year growth of 7.6% in quarter two. The growth was driven by higher transaction volume, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirement. We would expect that quarter four year-over-year growth in merchant fees will be modestly lower than the growth recognized in quarter three as equipment sales related to the new chip card technology requirements will begin to slow.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $54 million or 2.4% principally due to higher other income in commercial product revenue as well as seasonally higher corporate payment products revenue and deposit service charges partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We currently expect mortgage fees to be down 5% to 15% on a linked quarter basis in quarter four due to typical seasonality. It is very early in the quarter and we\u2019ll update guidance as the quarter progresses. The other income increase was due to higher equity gains including the Visa gain offset by student loan, market adjustment and lower trading gain.", "Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $161 million or 6.2%. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, higher employee benefits expense mainly due to higher pension costs and higher marketing and business development expense.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $93 million or 3.5%. As expected linked quarter expense increased due to the seasonal lift in tax credit amortization included in other expense, and an increase in expense related to the quarter two partner reimbursements that did not repeat in quarter three which are principally reflected in printing and supplies expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to increases in other expense related to mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs and compensation expense principally reflecting the impact of an additional day in the quarter and increases in variable compensation.", "As we look to quarter four, we do expect an increase in linked non-interest expense as seasonally higher tax credit amortization will be partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the elevated mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs that were included in quarter three expense. The normal seasonal increase in tax credit amortization expense is expected to be in a range of $65 million to $75 million, slightly higher than trends observed in the same period of last year.", "Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders; dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 48%. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30th was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to $17.20 at September 30th, representing the 9.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.4% increase over the prior quarter.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Kathy. I\u2019m very proud of our third quarter results. We reported a record EPS, maintained our industry leading performance measures and reported a 19% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We\u2019re operating from a position of strength as we grow revenue, as we manage expenses, as we seek to exceed customer expectations, and as we create value for our shareholders in the demanding marketplace.", "As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Richard, just a question for you; just take your temperature on loan growth and how are you feeling about the outlook. You\u2019re right down the middle this quarter, just wonder there is anything out there that makes you any more or less optimistic as you look to Q4 and to 2016 in terms of loan grow?", "Richard Davis", "I would say just more of the same which is not pessimistic but it\u2019s not uber optimistic either. I mean we\u2019re seeing a nice transition to consumers getting more steady in their spending patterns. I think we\u2019ll see a nice seasonal lift in credit cards in the fourth quarter. Auto loans as you know remain strong. Our Bank has been benefited by a strong home equity growth of portfolio and not having some other run-offs that other portfolios have had. So, you will continue to see I think all cylinders on consumer growth. And that will be a nice challenge to probably an equal growth we\u2019ll continue to see in C&I and CRE as well as small business.", "So, what you saw this quarter is probably the optimal work here for a while which is a nice 1% to 1.5% linked quarter probably even on both commercial and wholesale which gives us a nice blend for the margin. I would say the competitiveness on the rates are pretty steady and we\u2019re not seeing an undue amount of pressure except in the middle market C&I space, everything else seems to be managing itself pretty well. The one area that we\u2019re not growing right now is CRE. I certainly mentioned this time we talked that it\u2019s an area that we think has some undue risk in it; it\u2019s a pretty overheated market in not just certain locations but tenures and the terms and the recourse non-recourse decisions that some banks are making and we\u2019re not going to participate in that. So don\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t see commercial real estate grow a great deal. We\u2019ll probably hold our own and keep our market share but that\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to keep particularly close eye on.", "And then finally areas of real opportunity, the small business category still looks good especially under the $350,000 level. Real small businesses feeling that they\u2019ve got some real value now or some real cash flow either from their own personal circumstances or from their own business. And we\u2019re starting to see a higher percentage of take up on that, both SPA and traditional small business. And I think our market share continues to reflect the growth in the last couple of quarter. So, a lot more of the same, the catalyst I think is I\u2019ve said before will be the real movement in interest rates. The first mover impact which I think will trigger quite an impact on these C&I and the larger company space for the one and not miss the opportunity to get lock in rates before they start moving up at no matter what speed but until then it\u2019s just kind of more what you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll get it out in the marketplace with prime only quality loans at a pricing advantage that I think we continue to be able to benefit from.", "Jon Arfstrom", "And then just a follow-up on what you just said, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen loan yields relatively flat and earning assets yields relatively flat. How are you feeling about just pricing in the competitive environment?", "Richard Davis", "Andy, why don\u2019t you give him that?", "Andy Cecere", "I think as Richard mentioned, in the large corporate space, I would say pricing is relatively stable; middle market can be aggressive because fewer competitors can make a difference there. And the other area on the retail side of the equation is auto lending, continues to be fairly competitive in terms of pricing. Other than those categories relatively stable.", "Operator", "Thanks. We have John McDonald with Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Just wondering on the expense side, Richard, is there any way to size the potential opportunity from the increased focus on the non-FTE expense?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. You got the question too. Listen, first of all, we\u2019re going to be very careful on not heading where we shouldn\u2019t. And I am not -- we\u2019re still a long-term company, so we\u2019re not going to make big mistakes here and over manage this. But I will tell you that this discretionary addition to our otherwise prudent FTE impacts is going to start showing itself for the first time in quarter four and we\u2019re going to get that a range of $10 million to $15 million benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we\u2019ve not started this effort. 2016, we\u2019re in the middle of the planning process; so it will obviously be more than that but it\u2019s going to be thoughtful.", "And I think you all know that we\u2019re giving you our efforts to get back to positive operating leverage on an annual basis. Then as you look into plan next year, that\u2019s our goal is to make it a positive operating leverage. But at the same token, I don\u2019t want to starve the future and find out that we over manage something and got this company back to really where it was 10 years ago where we were just investing. So, we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it but it\u2019s got real impact but not huge in quarter four. And then we\u2019ll have a better idea to give you since later this quarter as we look to 2016 and see what kind of impacts the cumulative facts of all that can be. But I assure you, we\u2019re going to continue invest in places we need to and where the ROI is good. I don\u2019t see an expense; I\u2019ve seen investment and we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful on that distinction.", "John McDonald", "So, don\u2019t want to box you into a corner to really on next year, but just want to kind of get sense of your conviction level on the ability to deliver the positive operating leverage without rates. Back in September at the conference you kind of said, hey, now I don\u2019t care. Is it something you feel like pretty good about being able to deliver or really going to depend a lot on the environment still?", "Richard Davis", "What I said was I care less, not I don\u2019t care, I do care. The fact is that we\u2019re going to put into our plan an expectation for very, very nominal number and size of rate increases which much less we\u2019ve had in the years past, so nominal that it\u2019s very small that to the extent that that occurs and in case nothing happens, we will struggle to get positive operating leverage. To the extent that anything happens, we\u2019re going to build a plan to give it very close to that, so that we can approximate revenue growth and expense growth to be somewhere near the same where revenue slightly outpaces it. And there is a reasonable amount of increases or sooner than later, then we\u2019ll have much bigger opportunity to provide much more positive operating leverage. But we\u2019re building it to be right at the line so that we can deliver back to what we committed, start growing the Bank that way again and then any benefits we get will be a bonus. But do we need one or two, John, over the next 15 months but we don\u2019t need much more than that; we don\u2019t need them all right now and they don\u2019t need to be big.", "John McDonald", "And then just on the idea of if rates stay low, revenue environment stays challenging, does the idea of bank acquisitions get more attractive for you Richard? And can you just elaborate what you said about kind of statute of limitations and kind of legal risks as a barrier to you are doing deals?", "Richard Davis", "Good memory. I told you that I think the statute in our head kind of ends in \u201817. So I don\u2019t think \u201816 is going to be a year where you\u2019ll see us jumping into big bank deals or big branch deals. But we do love the non-capital, the business of fees and trust. And you saw recent acquisition we made of the Auto Club card portfolio, there are more where that came from John and those are very attractive deals; they are bolt-on; they\u2019re low capital. But for the provision, you need to put in front of them. And the small conversion task is a good way to grow the balance sheet and we\u2019ll continue to see opportunities there. So, I think \u201816 looks like the tail end of the last four, five years and then \u201817 probably becomes the time we\u2019ll start looking at more traditional bank deals.", "And frankly, we don\u2019t really feel we need them right now. Our deposit growth is steady; our customer growth patterns are steady; our relationships are getting deeper and we\u2019ve always said wanted double down where we are; more than grow where we aren\u2019t. And so far that\u2019s working for us. And I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re starved at all by not being able to do that.", "John McDonald", "Are there other things that you need to get to that in terms of before you can do deals in terms of regulatory check list and things like that?", "Richard Davis", "I don\u2019t think we -- we don\u2019t think there is an environment where that\u2019s going to necessarily impair our interest. I think we have to watch for the trailing risk that I mentioned before especially inheriting it from that you didn\u2019t you create yourself and you also want to spend time making sure that everything you have in your houses in good order, but I don\u2019t see anything new on the horizon or any new information that would change our appetite.", "Operator", "We have Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul Miller", "Where are you at on -- I know on acquisitions and what do you see out there; are things loosening up a little bit or some of the improvement -- and what type of size you think you can go after at this point?", "Richard Davis", "Paul, I don\u2019t know that they are any more attractive than they have been in the last few years. I think there are certain boards sitting around boardrooms saying at smaller sizes are we going to make it at this level, can we afford with our scale to be profitable; that might change a little bit. But we\u2019re not seeing an intensely different environment that we\u2019ve seen in the last eight quarters, not more players, not higher quality players, not more desperate players. And our attraction, our interest is low. So maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re saying we\u2019re not interested, we\u2019re not getting a lot of bites. But we\u2019re not denying anything that we think is too good to pass. And I actually don\u2019t think -- I am not attracted to other banks right now. I just for all the reasons you mentioned -- I mentioned to you before, this year positioning in this moment in time. It\u2019s enough to carry your entire balance sheet across the goal line when interest rates are low and deposits don\u2019t have value, but they are going to be valuable one day again and you\u2019re going to be glad you have all of those deposit gather in place. We have 3,186 right now; that\u2019s probably quite enough for us. I am just not -- we\u2019re not seeing an attraction on our part and no one is coming out for us with a different or better story.", "Paul Miller", "Are you seeing any communities or some of the small areas struggling with the low oil prices especially in some of this -- some areas you\u2019re in with the -- couldn\u2019t get it out, the frac, I couldn\u2019t get it out?", "Richard Davis", "There are markets that we have business like Lewiston and Williston and those parts of the Dakotas, which is like the old gold rush; things start slowing down, the town moves downstream. We don\u2019t do much business there anyway; we didn\u2019t set up any locations; we didn\u2019t create infrastructure because we didn\u2019t think it was sustainable. And for the most part becoming mostly a Midwest and West Coast company, we\u2019re outside of the Texas Panhandle and down of the Gulf Coast. And so that\u2019s for a few customers that might have some tension tertiary impacts to energy, we really don\u2019t have anything at our gun sites and none of our communities are struggling in that category either based on the consumer or the small business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Just following up on the fee side, just want to ask you guys to remind us, you\u2019re getting towards better comps on a year-over-year basis in some of these fee areas. Can you kind of walk us through in addition to mortgage in the fourth quarter to be mindful of what are the plus and minus seasonalities and where are you seeing kind of better comps versus still some challenges to face on the fee side?", "Andy Cecere", "Hi Ken, this is Andy. In the fourth quarter, I would expect to see continued strength in our merchant processing a little lower on a linked quarter basis because as Kathy mentioned, we have very strong equipment sales in the third quarter that will continue at a lower level in the fourth quarter. But the year-over-year comps will continue to be very favorable. Card is always positive in the fourth quarter. Corporate Payments is down a little bit because the third quarter is the big quarter for that one. Trust is going to be dependent a little bit upon the markets, so there is the market impact to that, the S&P market impacts fees overall. And then mortgage fees I would expect to be modestly down in the fourth quarter. Typical seasonality in the fourth quarter is down 5% to 15%.", "Ken Usdin", "So, when I think about all of that, is it kind of just naturally just going to be a little bit tougher for fee growth just given those couple of normal fourth quarter seasonalities plus mortgage?", "Andy Cecere", "I think if you take out the couple of unusual items that we had this quarter, the Visa gain and the student loan impact, I would expect moderate growth on a linked quarter basis.", "Ken Usdin", "And then secondly in terms of the ability to kind of hold the margin flattish from here, are we now done with kind of investment portfolio build? I know a lot of it will still be dependent on deposit growth which continues to be pretty good, but what are you doing as far as the rate environment and investment portfolio builds and mix?", "Kathy Rogers", "This is Kathy. So, as you know from an investment portfolio perspective, we are at our LCR coverage ratio. So, any activity that you\u2019ll see in our investment portfolio along with sales will be in line with balance sheet. So I don\u2019t expect a significant amount there. We will continue to see some impact from the reinvestment rate through; however as some of those securities pay down and we reinvest, that will come on at a bit lower spread than what we had before. Although that mitigated a bit for us in third quarter, we\u2019ll take our eyes on fourth quarter in the rate environment. So I think really what causes us to think about stable margin as we go into fourth quarter, this continued mix of our loan portfolio. So, as the consumer loans are -- and we expect them to continue to be a bigger piece of the growth on a linked quarterly basis, that will guide us to stable margins as we look into quarter four.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Richard, I had a high level strategic question for you on Elavon. Clearly, it\u2019s a very high return generating business that contributes nicely to your profitability, but there are number of publicly traded merchant acquirers out there trading in around 25 times or so on forward earnings and that\u2019s arguably not a valuation that Elavon is getting inside of USB. And we\u2019ve gotten some questions from investors who\u2019ve been wondering whether there is an opportunity there for you guys to unlock some value by spinning it off, particularly with what we\u2019ve seen from some other banks who have spun out their acquiring businesses and they\u2019re actually doing quite well today and we\u2019ve got some other IPOs happening now. And just kind of with all of that as a backdrop, can you speak to how you think about that?", "Richard Davis", "First of all Bill, this has actually come up before; I think it\u2019s maybe five or six years ago in the earlier stages of my CEO time. And as it turns out, we just have to go back around and describe not only the merits of having that kind of business in a bank but connected to the bank. So first of all, we\u2019re an acquirer but we\u2019re also an issuer and with that combination comes a remarkable benefit that an acquirer alone doesn\u2019t have. And so we can do the testing, we can do the modeling; we\u2019ve talked about close loops before. Everything we want to pilot or understand about consumer and merchant behavior is we can test both sides of that and there is an amazing amount of value to that that I would strongly want to connect to.", "The second piece is we do a lot of that business for our own customers. So instead of having to outsource an acquiring position to our retailers or our small merchant, we actually provide that service to them directly. I think still some banks provide insurance and they do it directly to their customers; we do the merchant acquiring. And maybe as importantly, we do this for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of smaller banks across the nation. And the smaller bank, if I were a smaller bank and I used to work at one, I would trust the capabilities and the -- I\u2019ll call the regulatory understanding of the environment another bank more than the non-bank.", "So we get a lot of benefits by being a bank doing business for other banks with white label and private label that we call it there merchant servicing. But with it comes an amazing flow of new business and highly retained customers by being a bank to other banks. So all that is probably not unlocked as you said but it\u2019s certainly a part and parcel of the why we think this business is great, why we want to keep growing it. It has international feeling too, so I\u2019ve got a nice natural hedge now with all the business we do in Europe and in Central and South America. There is no reason that can\u2019t continue to grow as long as the economic social impacts are understood. And so the volatility of the foreign exchange, we have no other risk because it\u2019s a 24-hour settlement.", "So, it\u2019s a great business. We love it. The cost of entry for other banks is quite prohibitive. So, I want to stick with it; stay with it; grow with it. But if I were to dis-couple from the bank, it would become more germane to a standalone merchant acquirer that has none of the benefits I just described.", "Bill Carcache", "If I may separately, can you share any thoughts on where the non-operating deposits at some of the larger banks have been deemphasizing or going? And are you guys actively doing anything to either keep those away or perhaps could you potentially see value in them?", "Andy Cecere", "Our deposit base is principally operating. We have been very good about managing the core there. We don\u2019t have some of those non-operating more fluctuating higher volatility deposits. So that has not been an issue for us, so we have not been turning any away. We\u2019ve been working with our customers. And again for the most part ours are operating in core.", "Bill Carcache", "And is the deposit growth that you guys have been seeing just kind of a result or are you guys actively kind of managing that growth? It kind of stands out because your deposit growth still is exceeding your loan growth and we\u2019re actually seeing that at the system level that that\u2019s no longer the case; loan growth has now started to exceed deposit growth. I am just wondering if that was something that you guys were actively trying to drive.", "Kathy Rogers", "No, we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re not actively managing any kind of deposit growth or as Andy said, we\u2019re not looking at getting out of any deposits either on our books. So really what you see in our deposit growth is what -- just the core growth that we\u2019re seeing from our consumer -- our customer base. And I will say that really is across all the categories in our wholesale and our consumer. And keep in mind that we do have that strong base of deposits within our corporate trust area. So, we do see deposit growth really across the Company and it\u2019s really just a reflection of what our customers are doing.", "Richard Davis", "We\u2019re all going to have to get ready for this moment when deposits start to flow out of banks and we should celebrate it. You\u2019re all going to want to measure the beta and who loses the most and what\u2019s the retention factor, we\u2019ll all be prepared for that. But we really do want to see customers use their deposits; they\u2019re back up to a savings level now that hasn\u2019t been seen in 12 years. That\u2019s great for America but now we want them to use that. And all the field pricing for the most part benefits seem to have gone into savings in some form of either paying down debt or saving it in the bank, which great, which is great, but we all do want to see that start to move because as we\u2019ve said before, the first canary in the mind is deposits go down; secondly lines of credit that are already extended but not used get used and then eventually a loans of loan start to happen. That\u2019s how the cycle reverses itself. We\u2019re still not there and honestly I will be the first to cheer when deposits start to flow out because consumerism starts and because the economy is really back up and running.", "Bill Carcache", "Do you see Richard, a scenario where that competition for deposits could potentially intensify perhaps even before the Fed raises rates or is it kind of a function of the Fed having to raise rates first?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, it\u2019s going to be definitely not before, not even at that moment; it will be later when either somebody has decided, they miss guided themselves in this quieter period and got rid of their deposit gathering options and need to go out and price up for it or there will be a bank or two to that wants to get clever and creative and try to get the market movement and do these laddering programs and these guarantees and things that we never did before and wouldn\u2019t recommend in the future. But those kinds of behaviors I think you\u2019ll see but they won\u2019t happen now and they won\u2019t happen even at the point of great increase. They will happen when people start to realize deposit start to matter again and they\u2019ll have to decide to get hungry for an avenue they might have closed off.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "On the margin, got your guidance for fourth quarter for stable; on 2016, just want to see if you can give us a little bit of color there. Do you expect that the margins should hold relatively stable through \u201816 as well or do you think pricing competition can still have a bit of effect on that?", "Kathy Rogers", "John, we\u2019re guiding into the fourth quarter and I would be hesitant to guide out past that. But what I would say is if we continue -- the loan mix of our portfolio growth with consumer growing a little bit higher at higher spreads and we see on the wholesale, I think that coupled with just our reinvestment rate impact on securities is kind of starting to narrow a bit. There is similar or those things continue as we move into 2016, I would think that we would have similar type expectations. But at this point we\u2019re looking quarter-to-quarter and as we said probably stable into quarter four.", "John Pancari", "And then separately, just wanted to get your updated thoughts for -- or the updated strategy around mortgage banking basically through the standpoint of how much you plan to still push production there and then your retention strategy versus originate to sell.", "Andy Cecere", "So, if it\u2019s a qualifying mortgage Freddie or Fannie, we will sell that. It is a better financial decision from our perspective to originate and sell those mortgages. If it is a jumble or non sellable mortgage, we\u2019ll put down on the balance sheet; we\u2019ve been a little bit more aggressive with that particularly with our own customers have talked about that. So, that would be our expectation. We\u2019ve gone from about 21st in terms of size to fifth or sixth and I would expect us to continue to be in that range. Our particular emphasis is to put more branch distribution as a focus in terms of our core growth. And that is something that we continue to drive and are successful and increasing. So, I expect to see us grow aftermarket grabs little bit above the market particularly focused on branch and if it\u2019s sellable, we will sell it.", "John Pancari", "Last question is just around the reserve, edged a little bit lower this quarter by a few bps. Do you think all things equal that should still see that reserve to loan ration edge lower over the next couple of quarters as well?", "Richard Davis", "Bill, do you want to take that?", "Bill Parker", "Sure, I can take that. So, we\u2019re getting to the point where our reserve release has been de minimis really and we have to weigh the balance of continued improving loan quality versus loan growth. So, we\u2019re looking at a point now where we -- we\u2019re probably flattened out to seeing some increases in the wholesale area and the one area where there is still some potential for credit opportunity, reserve opportunities in residential mortgage. But we\u2019re just about at that point where those -- that mix is flattening out and I expect that will eventually have to provide for loan growth.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the equipment sales in merchant processing that you were talking about, how much of that is due to the new EMV adoption by merchants and when does that get done?", "Andy Cecere", "Vivek, this is Andy. So the acceleration, the increase is principally due to that EMV. We always sell equipments in any particular quarter, it\u2019s higher in this quarter and last quarter, I would expect it to continue at least for quarter or two, perhaps not at the levels we saw in the third quarter, but it is principally due to that acceleration because merchants are buying chip enabled terminals.", "Vivek Juneja", "That\u2019s what I thought that it probably accelerated. And the card portfolio you acquired from Auto Club, what was that was in this quarter and how much were the receivables on that Andy?", "Andy Cecere", "It was $525 million right at the end of the quarter. So, no impact in quarter three; you\u2019ll see that impact in quarter four.", "Vivek Juneja", "525 million?", "Richard Davis", "The portfolio looks exactly like our portfolio. I mean from charge-offs to revolve, average spend; it\u2019s right down the fairway and it\u2019s a complete continuation of the kind of service that we provide that quality of customer.", "Vivek Juneja", "Is it like a private label type portfolio Richard or is it just a regular or co-branded or is it going to be more -- given that it says Auto Club; I would think or is this some kind of affinity type?", "Richard Davis", "It\u2019s an Auto Club branded card that is with our support and backing. So it\u2019s on our balance sheet, our processing but Auto Club has the rewards that go along with it.", "Vivek Juneja", "One last thing, consumer banking, if I look at the efficiency ratio that has risen all throughout the last year. Can you talk a little bit about what -- any plans to bring that down or change the direction of that?", "Andy Cecere", "So Vivek, consumer banking is the most impacted business line by the low rate environment in terms of their earnings as we sit today. So, they have a lot of deposits. Those deposits on a relative basis are below the typical spreads and value that we have on a long-term basis. And that impact is what\u2019s driving their efficiency ratio. So as rates start to move, you will see that business line more than any other start to improve in terms of efficiency ratio.", "Richard Davis", "That\u2019s why we could be wrong but at least we\u2019re going to have the luxury of deciding later. But branch closures look very attractive now because they\u2019re not only not very profitable, they\u2019re actually going in the wrong direction as this long interest rate stays low and deposit values are much less than they will be in the future. But there will be a time when rates go back up. I know you and I are old enough to remember and deposits will be the governor on how many loans you can make. And that\u2019s the benefit we\u2019re always going to have on these interlopers who are coming in with these great lending ideas. They don\u2019t have the deposits and we shouldn\u2019t give up the one thing we have which is deposits which will be the key driver.", "So for us, we have been rationalizing our branch system a lot. We don\u2019t look for headlines on it. We\u2019ve been retooling what happens in the branches all the things that you would expect us to do and closing where they\u2019re necessary and opening with they\u2019re necessary. But we\u2019re by and large a believer in the branch network. We think it\u2019s the best core deposits; it\u2019s best quality customers we get from a branch referred loan or credit line. And yet right now, it\u2019d be a bad time to evaluate their value because at this point at the end of a long recession, they\u2019re not very attractive.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Mutascio with KBW.", "Chris Mutascio", "I hate to do this to you. I was on another conference call that was running at the same time. Would you remind me hashing just briefly your opening comments about expenses and the kind of initiatives you\u2019re looking through?", "Richard Davis", "I think I\u2019ll just repeat it for everybody. What we\u2019ve been doing for a year now is watching our FTE assets and be very prudent about where we add them. We\u2019ve recently gone through a rationalization program where our lower performers that were not performing just not the highest level given the importance of an FTE, we\u2019ve now used a company program to do a talent upgrade and effectively use people out of the company. And on top of that, in the last quarter, we added this discretionary expense review which is the other half of the expense categories and started looking at where we don\u2019t need to be spending money at this point in time until rates move. And that\u2019s some we gave some color around. I said that in the quarter four it will be a $10 million to $15 million net benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we hadn\u2019t taken that extra action. For 2016, it will obviously be more than that but we\u2019re not ready to size it because I am also not going to necessarily give you guys a sense that all expenses stop because we\u2019re just reallocating the right things and in some cases we\u2019re going to be investing in places we have been in the past. So too early to rate for \u201816 but definitely net positive and our goal is to get to the positive operating leverage at the minimum annual level starting next year.", "Chris Mutascio", "I appreciate that and I do apologize for having to rehash that. My one follow-up, Kathy specific to fourth quarter, did you say that expenses will be up over third quarter, and if so was that up from the reported number of about 2.77 billion?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes, I would say it\u2019s up from a reported number and that\u2019s principally driven as we said by the fact that our tax credit amortization expense is -- quarter four is our seasonally highest increase related tax credit amortization expense. And we said that that would probably go up in the range of about 65 million to 75 million, similar to what we saw in previous trends. And then you could expect to see that increase being partially offset by some of the elevated costs that we\u2019ve caught out here in quarter three.", "Operator", "And your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush", "Richard, a couple; I can\u2019t remember if it was last quarter or the quarter before, you were sort of the last bank CEO to kind of throw in the towel and say that the economy was getting better, definitively better. Do you want to repeal that now?", "Richard Davis", "No, I don\u2019t remember being that strong. But I would say it\u2019s not getting worse. I know I said that before. Undeniably it\u2019s not getting worse. I mean things aren\u2019t going backwards; people aren\u2019t going in the direction of not investing; people aren\u2019t afraid to buy cars; people aren\u2019t afraid to use their credit line. I think for a more political discussion, there is the haves and have-nots right in the barbell of who is participating who is not as greater than it used to be. But being a prime only lender and being at a pretty high quality on the line of customers, we\u2019re not impacted mostly by that and we\u2019re feeling a small, slow, steady almost monotonous and I\u2019ll call tortuously flow improvement over the course of time.", "I do believe Nancy, I\u2019ve always believed it, I could be totally wrong and happy to be if I am but when the first rate moves, a real move, not a thought of it, not a predilection of it, not a guess of it; I do think that the corporate America starts to move quickly and they\u2019ll start to take advantage first because they have most to gain. And then I think they\u2019ll start to create some incentive -- create consumerism and I think we\u2019re off to the races. I think for the first time business will drive out of the slow recovery than consumers. And I\u2019ll call it recovery because it\u2019s not a recession; it still feels slow and very measured.", "So I\u2019m not writing home about it. Without interest rates moving, you just keep seeing us all doing a little more of what we were doing before, managing to the needs of customers who do have the wherewithal and do have the motives, still want to keep growing and benefiting in their lives but plenty of people aren\u2019t playing yet and the savers are getting killed.", "Nancy Bush", "And a couple quarters before that you had said that you had a long list projects that you wanted to do and that you would start doing them as quickly as the interest rate environment turned but that you were being very cautious on taking on new projects in light of the expense control that was necessary. So, are there any of those projects that are on that list that need to get done, no matter what the interest rate environment is, particularly if this rate environment is going to go on longer than anybody had anticipated?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, there is two answers to that. One is mobile transitions to banking channels. We\u2019re sending money on that. We\u2019ve talked about our growth; our hundreds of people in Atlanta that work on those topics. I haven\u2019t starved that one bit because that is the changing environment wherein we have to be a leader on that; we\u2019re expected and we have to invest. So that\u2019s a good ROI in the long-term; it\u2019s not a near-term ROI.", "The other one Nancy is we\u2019re spending money on compliance. What I\u2019ve learned -- if you\u2019ve heard my speech, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve gone from baggage handlers to pilots, same company. Baggage handlers every once in a while make a mistake and up until now it\u2019s okay, no one loses their lives but pilot from the same company can\u2019t crash a plane. I\u2019d had to move all of our employees from baggage handlers to pilots. So, we\u2019re still in that transition. So, regulators have required that of us as well.", "So I\u2019m spending money on either back office or more often than not technology to replace some of the error ridden places where human interaction creates an outcome that is not acceptable anymore. And that investment\u2019s worth it, not because it\u2019s a better product necessarily but because it\u2019s a better compliance outcome, the safer way to earn when you don\u2019t have the potential of penalties and fines and risks.", "So those are two things that have not been touched. Other things would be the more attractive ways to just increase the capabilities we do in the back office that no one really sees but it\u2019s just more elegant; less involvement where people have to touch customers where customers can self serve. All those things are -- some of those are nice to have; where they are not required, we\u2019re holding back on those. And those would be the things we\u2019ll add back the minute we start seeing revenue growth.", "Operator", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Sean O\u2019Connor for closing remarks.", "Sean O\u2019Connor", "Thank you for listening to our review of third quarter results. And please contact me this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions. Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, everybody.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern through Friday, January 22nd at 12 Midnight, Eastern Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Bob Kleiber of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Bob Kleiber", "Thank you, Maria, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are joining me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our Web site at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I will begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Banc\u2019s 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14%, and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year. Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continue to improve with the 12.1% of decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.", "Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Banc reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio with diluted earnings per share up by $0.1. I am very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage.", "Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high-end of our 1% to 1.5% range. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in average deposits which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continued to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and non-performing assets declined on a year-over-year basis and non-performing assets declined on a linked quarter basis as well. Slide 5 provides you with the five quarter history of our performance metrics and they remain among the best in the industry.", "Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This was primarily driven by a higher loan growth which reduced the amount of cash balances. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I am particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter which reverses a trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.", "While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns. During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Banc is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments\u2019 rewards card program. As part of this arrangement which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our Company.", "Turning to Slide 6, the company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sales of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in the number of our fee based businesses including our payments and trust businesses.", "Kathy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.", "Kathy Rogers", "Thanks Richard. The average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans. As you may recall we moved our student loan portfolio to held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently retuned it to held-for-investment during the third quarter.", "In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter. The strongest linked growth I've seen in 2015. Line utilization however remained relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year. Consumer loans again showed positive momentums lead by credit card and auto loans. Average auto credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter three. Auto loan growth remains strong up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter.", "Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters and rose 2.2% on a linked quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter one. Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in non-interest bearing and low interest checking, money market and saving deposits remained strong on a year-over-year basis, and continue to more than offset the run-off of maturing larger dollar time deposits.", "Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build the support loan growth. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.", "Slide 9 gives a view of our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of the sale of our HSA deposit portfolio partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters. Fourth quarter net income decreased 12 million or 0.8% year-over-year, this is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses, increase in net interest income primarily driven by growth in earnings assets, lower non-interest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments related revenue, trust and investment management fees and the HSA deposit sale gain. On a linked quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth.", "Turning to Slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets of 5.1% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix, as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates. Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.", "Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to the impact of the 2014 Nuveen gain partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit share gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities.", "Momentum in our payment businesses was reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes which were up 6% compared to 5.3% in quarter three. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year, and approximately 6.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the amount recognized in quarter three as expected.", "On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6% principally due to seasonally higher credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter three government related transaction volume. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter one will be seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis.", "Moving to Slide 12, non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension cost were largely offset by lower marketing and business development expenses, principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting a net year-over-year impact of legal accruals. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage related compliance and talent upgrade costs which were elevated in quarter three and declined as expected in quarter four.", "Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and healthcare costs. We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter one compared quarter four, seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition.", "Turning to Slide 13, as Richard mentioned our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%. For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at December 31st was 9.1% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to 17.44 at December 31st representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Kathy. I\u2019m proud of our fourth quarter and full year results. We reported record full year net income and record revenue for the quarter. We remained industry leading performance measures and reported a $0.19 return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We delivered on our promise to work toward positive operating leverage with the efforts that we've made through our efficiency program. And we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses and focus on innovation for the benefit of our customers.", "As we look at 2016 we start the year from a position of strength as we continue to build revenue momentum, thoughtfully manage expenses, work diligently to exceed customer expectations and to create value for our shareholders in a competitive marketplace. We remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Bob Kleiber", "Maria we can go ahead now and open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Richard, maybe a question for you on just winding and your overall move, obviously pretty negatives some of the global macro stuff that we're seeing but at the same time you've held your growth guidance, your typical growth trends you are actually come in a bit ahead of that. So, maybe if you could just step back and give us a bit of the state of the union of winding and how you're feeling about the economy and I guess I'm also curious in terms what you're seeing from the consumer in terms of their all time loan demand there?", "Richard Davis", "First of all, I have predicted that question, I was thinking of it this morning, but a club with American bank, we do primarily business in the domestic United States and we're very much a consumer small business payments kind of a company, so just by what is going on in the backdrop around the world with the China re-evaluation and what's happening in oil and some of those areas which we\u2019re not immune to balances and process, we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers.", "So, we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say slow but steady improvement every quarter and our customers are reflecting that across the board from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions to restructuring the portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses which continue to grow for us double-digits based on their interest and setting themselves up for our better consumer wide recovery and just general people who are using banks for their retail services. So, I am quite optimistic against that negative backdrop and I know we won\u2019t be immune to all of that. But based on our geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history, and based on our appetite for risk I think we\u2019re actually fairly immune from most of those issues at this stage, and yet we trespassed for the worst scenarios that would of course affect us.", "So I would say the across the board from a lending perspective that same range you see in the 1% and 1.5% we\u2019re predicting again for this quarter already off to a really nice start and we\u2019re not seeing any disruption neither from the 25 basis point increase which we knew would be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market of the China re-evaluation. So at this point we\u2019re remaining optimistic and have cautious and careful way.", "Jon Arfstrom", "And then is Bill Parker there?", "Richard Davis", "Bill is here, here you go.", "Bill Parker", "Yes hi John.", "Jon Arfstrom", "Hey Bill. Anything to add in terms of from a credit perspective and the cash you talked about the reserve releases are over and you\u2019ve all been very transparent on that. But anything from a credit perspective that\u2019s making you a bit more nervous so that is a change maybe compared to a quarter or two ago?", "Bill Parker", "Yes Jon first I\u2019d direct you to the dependency slide and you can look through those. And if you look at of the portfolios if you see sort of year-over-year delinquency patterns are either stable or better than last year. So, overall, very strong of course the one exception is energy and some of the metals and mining related credit. We do have that small energy portfolio of 1.2% of our total loans. So I\u2019d just say we have seen some downgrades there and we\u2019ve been building our allocated reserves for that all year long. But we built that at low 30s price of oil. So we feel like we\u2019re good for now but we\u2019ll see where oil settles down, but either way that\u2019s not going to have a material impact on kind of the overall go forward credit performance.", "Jon Arfstrom", "And in terms of the way we see things just the assumptions should be maybe go right pass back up in terms of the provision over charge offs just building for loan growth. Is that how we should approach it?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, exactly, yes.", "Richard Davis", "I would still jump in there Jon it is the old fashioned days where you\u2019re supposed to provide for the next new loan right and I think we\u2019re at that inflection point. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll start moving up very quickly because we\u2019re settling here at that turning point of no provision. But we don\u2019t see anything in the near-term that\u2019s going to harm that and I want to pick up on energy and metals and mining. We do stress test our portfolios routinely and not just for those particular categories but tangent effects it might have on other parts of our customers and portfolios and in certain geographies. And as Bill mentioned we\u2019ve increased the reserve levels for both of those categories and continue to have the room and the expectation if we need to do more we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian", "When we last spoke Richard I think you were fairly optimistic about your prospects for 2016, and I think we talked about the concept of USB being a maximized franchise. As we think about building revenue momentum, slow but steady into 2016, could you give us sort of what the top-three drivers are in terms of what could drive year-over-year of improvement in revenue outside of, of course? And any more increases on the short-end?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, sure I will, actually I asked her more than the question, as I think I also mentioned when you and I have the fire side chat, I might add without the fireplace. You\u2019re talking about what kind of assumptions we would in our plan, and we actually expected to have two rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hope for one in December, we expect a one in June. And that is really the amount of the risk we have placed into our plan this year so when we\u2019re halfway with one of them at least at this point if it's fixed. So that alone does actually help us. So we\u2019re not relying on that to the very point you made.", "The most important thing that happened to us is just a continued improve recovering economy where people feel they can consume, people feel they don\u2019t have to save quite as much and that they\u2019ve got a higher backstop and either in their own statements account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it, that\u2019s going to be huge for us. That\u2019s way more important than any interest rate because as I said earlier, we\u2019re a consumer middle market wholesale bank and those sort of things that matter the most.", "But I want to say the things that we could, our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year one will the continued success we\u2019re having in relationship management with our customers. I think I\u2019ve said this before but we\u2019re developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what they\u2019re likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. And so we\u2019re investing a great deal of our money and time. And in this whole efficiency program you never heard me take anything away from our investment and innovation and entrepreneurship and we\u2019re not because I do believe that\u2019s going to be the next big idea.", "So having a payments business and a bank connected together we have the best of both roles because we can touch virtually any paradigm buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that\u2019s our number one we\u2019re going to lean on the bank and the payments business that\u2019s coming together. Number two the corporate trust business, that\u2019s been remarkably good for us doesn\u2019t get a lot of visibility it\u2019s actually confusing to a lot of people, but we\u2019re not only domestically quite large and capable but when you start looking at who that\u2019s starting to build over across the pound over in Europe with both our front administration and our new class of corporate trust we\u2019re going to expect a lot from those two businesses as well in 2016.", "And finally I'll say the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming we've moved out of the audition stage and we\u2019re now bonafide one of the important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies and you think from an M&A deal to our first pallet lead on the deal to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuing to see momentum there I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank has done we are celebrating Dick Payne\u2019s retirement this quarter and we are also celebrating the addition of two new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets and I expect a lot from the two of them and they've got the capability and energy to pick up where Dick has left us which is a really good starting point. So I would say those three things Erika to answer your question.", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the question on credit oil and gas and metals and mining aside charge off level for the industry have been abnormally low and I guess maybe Bill if you don\u2019t mind jumping in could you remind us what you think given the risk portfolio embedded U.S. Bank right now. What would you think is your normal charge off rate and how long does it take to get there?", "Bill Parker", "So again when we talk about normalized we call that through the cycle rate and that a rate that we've talked about before this between 95 and 100 basis points but you don\u2019t really get there you just go through it when you are going into a recession or you are in a recession. So in times where there is stable employment as running right now the rate you see for us is sort of the what would be a normal rate in this kind of economic environment but that over the cycle rate is something that we calculate every quarter and it remains between 95 and 100 basis points it really has not materially changed for us for many-many years.", "Erika Najarian", "Understood, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Richard I guess I was kind of wondering how should we track the progress of your new emphasis on the non FTE expense control this year where should we look at to kind of see how you are doing from the external metrics and then what kind of confidence level do you have and the ability to deliver a positive operating leverage this year in the environment that you are planning for?", "Richard Davis", "First of all you can measure all of our expenses quarter-to-quarter and I think you know we are as transparent as silathane so we\u2019re going to tell you exactly any moving parts and then you can model what's left but you will see the benefits in this quarter and will you see them in the next this two current year of both the FTE watch hold placement we have had on adding people unless we needed them and the non the more discretionary expenses. I will tell you however and we are also going to tell you about along the way how we are going to spend money on things that we think are quite important I will start bringing more visibility to our innovation budget and the kind of money we are spending to be at the front-end of some of the those new ideas and we\u2019re going to be introducing a very significant branding and reputation campaign in 2016 which impacts some of that savings will go toward because I want to keep investing I just want to put in the more of the right places. So no watch for existing number but watch for the moving parts and I will give you the visibility of that so that you can make that assessment over the course of time.", "John McDonald", "In terms of what you are expecting for kind of revenue expense growth this year Richard and?", "Richard Davis", "Well done, I forgot [Multiple Speakers] yes we are, we, no one quarter is going to be a positive operating leverage in this environment but we are still planning this year our plan say positive operating as if for 2016 I will also remind all of you that quarter one is our weakest quarter so it\u2019s not the one I'm going to be able to showcase and show off as our strongest quarter because this is seasonally lower for us, but it will I think a better first quarter than you have seen than the lot but it is certainly is going to be on its way to a positive operating leverage if we don\u2019t get at least that second of two rate increases that will put a challenge on that ability so I'm not going to make any guarantees but I'm more concerned less about the rate itself and the fact that rates moving up will continue to reflect that the Fed believes the economy is stronger what we care most about is just strong economy, the metrics and the arithmetic of the 25 basis points is far or less important so we will get to watch it as we go and I'll keep you as clearly outlined on how we think that's going.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the loan growth, what got better this quarter it gets you into that 1.7% growth and what are the assumptions underlie the outlook for the 1% to 1.5% range going forward is it more of a consumer pickup driving that and do you assume as the United slows a bit here going forward?", "Andy Cecere", "Hi, John, this is Andy. I would corporate continues with the strong as you saw year-over-year growth about 9% and strong on a linked quarter basis I think what's turned a little bit more positive is the consumer side of the equation our two fronts our mortgage activity on balance sheet that jumbles principally continues to be strong and home equity for the first time in a whiles we\u2019re seeing growth in that category and as we dig into that a little bit further I understand what that's about we are seeing consumers taking home equity and using it for home equity so using it to improve their homes, furnishings and things of that sort so those two categories are strengthening and finally card spend and card balances are also growing so I do think we see continued strength on wholesale with increasing strength on consumer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor", "Kathy, if I could just follow-up on the 1Q expense outlook I think you said stable linked quarter, are there any one time expenses related to that Fidelity Card deal because I think you normally have some seasonality on the way down on expenses on one tier?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes let me talk about that, there's a couple of things that are going on with that, because you're right, we normally would see a first quarter decline in expenses but I'll answer your first question and add some more light, so yes, we would expect to see some onetime expenses related to the Fidelity card deal that will come through in the first quarter and then just the overall operating expenses related to that will increase as we move through the year starting in the first quarter. Additionally, if you think about first quarter expense, we usually have the seasonally lower first quarter of course our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we normally would have seen and that's really due to a mix of where that's recorded so you also saw that our tax rate was a bit higher. So, that benefit that we get on a linked quarter basis for tax credit is going to be lower than what you'd have seen in the past and that coupled with the Fidelity card business shows to be relatively stable.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And then a bigger picture Richard for you, maybe you can comment on your ability and appetite on the acquisition side of things, I think you guys talked about in the third quarter 10-Q, some things around to know your customer and obviously there's some price resetting occurring right now as we speak, so maybe you could update it for the current environment and how you can re-apply your net if at all?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. So the answer I'll give you Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what we want to do more up, so you saw these two fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward, these are picking up portfolios that already have momentum, the picking up portfolios and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So, I hope there'll be more of those. We've talked before about our merchant acquiring business and the -- where we've cobbled that together over the last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with him on a JV kind of a basis with their rent to own sense and there's more of that in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully opportunities in that regard as well.", "And then finally the more classic kind of opportunities, I talk about innovation and there maybe some small businesses of small companies from small garage, deal that we might find where we want to bring the capability in house and not outsource it and if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank in acquisitions and interests, our interests remains exactly what it was, we don\u2019t have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door and yet at the same time it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition until we're through and of half that considerable on which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So, we're well aware that at the point in time we want to buy someone we want to be past that point and our goal is to be there but now it's not inhibiting anything that we would otherwise want to do and I think portfolios and merchant acquirer will be the two places you should watch the most.", "Matt O'Connor", "And what so fast as someone else's gone through a consent order?", "Richard Davis", "You actually don\u2019t know because I am not exactly should roll us into one but I know that there is in our case we've talked with our OCC which is the lead regulator here, and made it clear to them that our goals to satisfy the aspects of the consent order that would otherwise preclude us from being able to buy things and make that our number one area, they've made that clearly well that they understand that's our goal and I don't believe you have to be all out to be all done, you just need to be accomplishing the things that are most concerned to them as it relates to branch related, know your customer thing. So, we're going to approach on that basis. And the OCC has also been on record saying how one of their goals this year is to move more swiftly with the closure of open issues and we're going to hopefully be one of the first to prove that and we'll work through that swiftly and we've been working on it actually for quite some time and have lined everything up now to move out of that as soon as they give us permission as we prove our sustainability. So, it's not impairing us now I mean well, if we're not out of that in a year or two but it's not in the harms-way at this point now.", "Matt O'Connor", "I mean I could just squeeze in one more here, I guess the point I'm getting at is -- you've been more conservative while pre-crisis, during the crisis, post-crisis, and I'm trying to get sense of if the mentality is let\u2019s see if some of our conservatism and capital and deposit base to look for opportunities out there, I mean my guess some sellers maybe interested at a much lower price than before, there's some assets in the capital markets that are being significantly re-priced, you could probably gain a lot of share on energy if you wanted to now, so I'm just trying to get a sense if like is that the mentality or is it just [Multiple Speakers].", "Richard Davis", "We've been together the whole time, so, what you know about us is we kind of set a monster in place which is we will never do anything that doesn't look sustainable and repeatable, and it sounds corny but we've done it long enough it's real. And you think about opportunities that come along if it is a portfolio and it's priced perfectly and it's within the scheme of our risk tolerance absolutely we're all over it. Many of them that will come to us at a slightly disadvantaged risk perspective and if we don't convince ourselves to make it up in volume or to buy it now and change our original mantra we'll take the hit from you guys for not having that acquisition but we will take the benefit years later or months later and we don\u2019t have a problem. So, what I'd say, our conservatism is every bit exactly what it was before and during the downturn and we're not tinted by anything right now that would otherwise cause us to change that thinking and that could disappoint a few people that slow and steady it kind of wins the race, so we\u2019re going to stay in that boat.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill.", "Scott Siefers", "Let\u2019s see first one is sort of a piggy back question did you guys quantify the specific size of both the extra taking and then the legal and compliance accruals? And if not, I mean could you please?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes.", "Richard Davis", "I mean it is our job to do. We have the best to know it out so I could [Multiple Speakers] either away so it is not...", "Kathy Rogers", "So thank you very much.", "Richard Davis", "I am calling you for the money.", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. So the, Scott yes so the gain on the HSA sale is right in that $50 million range and I would suggest you think about half of that were related to the regulatory and legal accruals.", "Scott Siefers", "And then just so I am certain the guidance for fees and expenses in the first quarter is off the reported numbers out, am I right?", "Kathy Rogers", "That\u2019s right.", "Scott Siefers", "So thank you for that and then second question either for you Kathy or Richard just as it relates to margin. Even though you guys characterized as relatively stable it was still up which I consider a good thing. Just curious in your mind what it would take whether it\u2019s how much more rate increases, how many more rate increases I should say, or an increased pace of the increases until sort of the buyers get a little more optimistic, in other words at what point do we more visibly see the margins starting to expand?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. I think there is a couple of things I do think we need a couple of more rate increases to see a material change in our margin. I think that was as important Scott is that we have to we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this pricing pressure on some of the different portfolios. And I think we need to see that start to stabilize a little bit. But certainly as we think about where we are today and if you think about where our margin improved from last quarter. We did have some nice growth in our loan portfolio which allowed us to essentially fund out some cash for that allowed us to go forward. So as if we move forward I think the mix of our business interest rates increasing will certainly help in some of that price pressure easing will certainly be in potential list.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "Just back on that on the margin comment just to clarify that, so basically if you don\u2019t see any incremental rate hikes, if you don\u2019t get that June hike, is it fair to assume that you expect a relatively stable margin through all 2016 or could you see degradation?", "Kathy Rogers", "I think it\u2019s going to come, and I would suggest that it would probably I would say it start with relatively stable. But I think some of the caveats for that would be really around some of the mix of our portfolio and then of our loan growth and then also as you know in our securities portfolio we have about $2 billion run off, so to the extent where those reinvestment rates falls could potentially impact the margin. And then also I would tell you we\u2019re keeping our eyes very close on the long term rates and what\u2019s happening on the long term rates. So I think all of those together would impact it, but with no rate increase I would say we\u2019re probably in a little bit of a steady state here.", "John Pancari", "And then back to the M&A topic, Richard I heard when you said about interest and M&A. If you did not have the consent order in place, what would be your appetite around larger whole bank deals? I know you used to say you had no interest in the holding company transactions, and shying away from large deals. But is that appetite steadily changing given the disruption and the opportunity maybe to capitalize on valuations et cetera?", "Richard Davis", "No, you can all exaggerate on no. But the reason I said I am on record for a quite while John saying that from our own experiences of the statute I am going to call it a statute limitations it\u2019s not legal by any means was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harms away for dealing with any of their potential problems involving their own. And I think it\u2019s all the way back to 2007. When you think of \u201907 that is in your window on when things start to roll off in terms of statute and we\u2019re already seeing things continue to come to and people try to get under the wire. I\u2019ve always said 2017 will be the first time we want to look at where our appetite for bringing on a risk into our company as we simply couldn\u2019t do diligence for and couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that at least elegantly have lined up with our current moment where we can\u2019t do it anyway but we don\u2019t want to anyway, and I wouldn\u2019t be interested. The pricing doesn\u2019t change you can\u2019t get a good enough deals if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. And I could be wrong but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time and I would say that as the moments clear let\u2019s say a year or more from now our ability is there, our appetite will be higher, the moment and time I think will be safer and all those things will line up and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that.", "But the reason we\u2019re most importantly of less interested is we don\u2019t really need it, I mean much of is attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands it's really not necessary for this company and we are in every business line that we\u2019re in that we want, we\u2019re not in anything, we don\u2019t want to be in if we do we sell it like the HSA deposit business. And we don\u2019t covered anything we don\u2019t have, we just want to be better at what we\u2019re doing and do it better deeper wherever we are. That would be attractive to me but it\u2019s not going to be a headline on kind of the deal at least as long as I am around, this never has been, it\u2019s just going to be a steady state kind of an approach. But I would hope that all those stars would line up, so our options are better in a year or two from now.", "John Pancari", "And then if I could just throw in one more on the loan growth side on the residential mortgage front can you just I know you indicated that growth could remain around where it is I think you implied that and so you still have the appetite to continue to add to that portfolio regardless of what the longer end of the curve is doing here?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. We continue to add residential mortgages principally jumbo prime mortgages home equity as I said is the other category that's growing and balance credit cards. Those are areas that can, the slope is upward the area continues to be strong as auto lending and as Kathy mentioned a little bit the challenge on the loan lending as well behind this great, spreads are challenged but given our cost of funds we are still very profitable but not as profitable as they were a year ago.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.", "Paul Miller", "On the mortgage banking side, we know we had the new disclosures in the CFEP trade, but it looks like your mortgage banking was in line with what we expected. Can you talk about how you managed to do the trade? It looks like it wasn't that big of a deal for you guys?", "Richard Davis", "Yes Paul. So we had a significant team of folks who are focused it is growing effort and we were able to automate much of the process we had about 40 major conversion to do that last weekend in fact so it was a little bit of a backlog that occurred because just natural process of the new disclosures new requirements costs more time but it wasn\u2019t usually impactful and as you said our results were pretty much in line with what we expected we might have a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter from that lag but we are principally automated in that and very good shape.", "Paul Miller", "And then on the other side, because you do have a pretty good pulse on the consumers out there, do you see a big pickup in purchases? We had a very strong purchase market, probably the strongest we've had in seven years in 2015. Do you see that continue in 2016?", "Richard Davis", "So the year started as you know all about that so the year started in about 50-50 purchase versus refinance ended the year about two thirds one third and sort of the normal environment is 75-25 and that's what we expect as to go into 2016 about 75% of the volume being new money and 25% refinancings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "On your Fidelity co-brand win, it seems like that's a product that's going to give you exposure to national spend from a fairly affluent customer base. Should we conclude that you guys are seeking to become more of a national player in card? It certainly seems like you're expanding beyond -- well beyond your footprint?", "Andy Cecere", "While we already are a national player in card so this was just adding in that what we\u2019re seeking is always a good portfolio with good customers and this is a great example it is a high quality portfolio it offers us a great opportunity for growth and our customers service levels with this portfolio I think is what's going to make the difference so it's a continuation now we\u2019re doing that will be also the same with the Auto Club portfolio. So as Richard mentioned I think those are focus areas for us have been and will continue to be.", "Richard Davis", "Hey Bill, it's Richard. I don\u2019t know how long you have followed us but many-many years ago one of our biggest moment in time was when we had lost the WorldPerks card from Northwest airlines and it went to American Express were in Delta by Northwest and we came up with the FlexPerks card which I am going to say this now when I retire would be one of the top three things I think we ever did really-really well here and is very national. In fact when I talk to you guys if auto were to go down to $10 to $15 and would shut at the thought but if I had to talk to you about where the tangent risk would be we would be talking about the unemployment issues in those areas affected mostly by oil and the energy and our very own customers you may be surprised have a lot of people in parts that we don\u2019t have branches that have that credit card and like it a lot so it will be our own victim of success here but it's been quite national for five-six years and Andy is right we just want to be more perceived at that and we are not going to hesitate to take national forward growth just like we worked commercial real estate or wholesale banking if we want book for branches to be considered a national player and everything else.", "Bill Carcache", "If I could ask one more on a different topic, there are some banks who many would put into the quality bucket who have significant excess liquidity parked at the Fed. And there are others that use their excess liquidity to restructure the right-hand side of their balance sheets and therefore don't have that liquidity available today. Obviously everyone regards you guys as being in that kind of high-quality camp, but you don't appear to have as much excess liquidity that you're holding at the Fed. Can you remind us of why that is?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. We look at our liquidity as you know we have got 9.1% on our common equity tier one ratio that's about 110 basis points above our target of 8%. And if you think about it we\u2019re holding that excess rate between our target and where we\u2019re actually performing because we haven\u2019t been able to really reinvest or grow our loan balances as much as we would want so if we can get back into that 6% plus the balance sheet growth and so forth I think that you will see our capital to be right in line with kind of our real target.", "Richard Davis", "And it is exactly right Kathy and I would add actually the one of the reasons we don\u2019t access liquidity on the balance sheet is because we were building our securities portfolio to adjust the LCR exactly the right time at the time the deposits were growing faster than loans and we used the excess to build securities so we are very balanced and we sit in that situation today so we are not lying at the Fed in an any material way you are right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "Well, I'll repeat the same question as in the past Richard Davis versus the 10-year. And the 10-year has been winning recently, and here you are talking about faster loan growth, which seems to be that you should be winning over the 10-year as far as what the 10-year is saying about growth. On the other hand, you are seeing what's going on in the market. So my question is, is the economy getting better or worse? What's your conviction level and confidence? And also, as the capital markets, at least in certain areas of the capital markets, liquidity is less plentiful. Is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend even more? Because you said the expansion in loan growth is on the consumer side and on the wholesale side it's the same. But is this an opportunity for you to step in and borrow where some of the nonbanks might be retreating -- I'm sorry, a chance for you to lend more where some of the nonbanks are retreating?", "Richard Davis", "Let's start first on just general lending appetite, as a junior lender years ago there's still a steady state paradigm that you only make along based on abilities, stability and willingness and the willingness is a low part, people are able to take loans, they're more stable than they had been and other than 8 years but they're just not willing so we can't create willing and we're not going to create willing and those are the most willing are the ones that are too eager, and we don't want them so, that's impart why you're going to see our loan growth I think be steady but not robust because we're going to reflect whatever the economy sets, I also do think our market share has grown a lot and you've all the data to prove it. So, we're getting first look from a lot of customers that maybe in a decade before didn\u2019t think of us as much.", "On the capital market side I think you'll also find answers yes we can step in and now be a lender of support for those who have the other alternatives and want to use it in more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business and as I've said earlier we're no longer auditioning, We're well ensconced now one of the top two or three banks in most large companies\u2019 portfolio or the place they would have called for the opportunity and that comes from our debt ratings Mike. I mean if you're a C suite person at a fortune anything or one of the largest private companies, you really do value our ratings and you value the top notch level that we have and that means more to you than sometimes pricing which we also offer. So, I think in many cased we'll get more than our fare share of the capital markets where there's an interest in using that as an alternative to traditional financing and we set ourselves up perfectly to be early call and a chance to deliver and you might add to any of those since you run them.", "Bill Parker", "I think that's right, and I think the point that you made which is the market share point of the equation and I saw that growth perhaps is a little higher than what the average and most of that's coming from taking market share and that's certainly driving the wholesale side of the equation and it comes back to that ratings discussion that you discussed.", "Mike Mayo", "On that last point, as you see private equity firms back away from some energy companies and you see some loan funds that have gotten burnt back away, is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend more to say oil and gas companies? And I'm sorry I got on the call a couple minutes late. Did you indicate what are you reserves against oil and gas loans?", "Richard Davis", "Yes I will jump in first of all, nothing you said changes our appetite for risk, we're not going to change it no matter how attractive things look and you targeted that part earlier. As Bill talked earlier, our energy portfolio is only 1.2% of the company, we've added reserves to at this particular quarter, we're at 5.4% reserves against the energy portfolio for our company which I think will prevail to be a reasonable place at this point in time with oil at $29, $30, I also said we've plenty of room and appetite and willingness to move those new reserves higher up if we need to and we're watching as we stress test, the heck out of those things. But as it relates to taking alternatives, we want to be a capital markets alternative to more traditional lending but having to do with the risk profile that's unique and different than it is today, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is we're not going to do it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "A couple of questions, just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the marketplace, C&I loans, your yields were flat, LIBOR was up through the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about -- we're not seeing any impact of that -- why? And then yields are fairly low at 286 or something like that I believe, so -- or no, 268 actually?", "Andy Cecere", "This is Andy so the corporate spreads are a function of two things, one is where our growth is coming is more from the high quality side of the portfolio so a little bit less on the highly levered things like that that are falling off and some of the leasing portfolio and we're seeing high quality corporate growth which is a little thinner strategy all right. The second is some of the growth that you're seeing is also short term in terms of the tenure which is causing -- it is a little bit of a thinner spread perhaps our linkage to a bond deal that's short term in nature related to an M&A transaction, so it is a little thinner again and what is typically on the books, but again high quality, still profitable but just a little different mix.", "Vivek Juneja", "Secondly, on the NIM side, going back to the comments you and Kathy and the others made, you've got a very healthy amount of noninterest deposits, even though I know it's only 25 basis points. I'm presuming -- are you firstly, are you passing -- have you begun passing anything on at all to any of your customers? And secondly, given that shouldn't we -- what's offsetting the NIM benefit from all of your low cost deposit base?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes. So at this point, we are passing we're seeing some interest rate increases particularly around our wholesale side. We haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of movement right now on the consumer side and I think that\u2019s pretty true across the industry. So that is as we look into quarter one that the fact that those re-pricings are starting but starting a little bit maybe lower than what we would have potentially modelled I think is basically benefiting us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush", "Richard, several quarters ago I asked you about projects that you might be investing in, if you saw better revenue trends. I think you said at that time you had a whole list of projects that you wanted to dive into when things looked a little better. Are we at that point yet? Do you still have that list, or have you started to implement some of these investments?", "Richard Davis", "I remember saying that, and first of all what we didn\u2019t do is with our efficiency program we didn\u2019t stop as I said earlier our innovation and our investment in our technology. So one thing is that I would have put back first was something I never took out. The other one I think I mentioned was wealth management and the ultrahigh net worth and building more locations, physical locations, people to come in visit. We currently have six I\u2019d love to move that to a much higher level. It's going to be a long investment lead so I\u2019ve got to be thoughtful I do it if I could right now. But the investment we did so long and until I see a more robust economy with interest rate increases I would be putting too much ahead of that and put ourselves on harms-way. So those would be the two that I would mention, I meant when I mentioned it to you and one of them we\u2019re still doing the other one we\u2019ve got on the place where they\u2019re ready to roll in to.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes, and could you just give us -- Andy, this might be a question for you -- you mentioned the auto business. What's your outlook for this year? You're coming off such a strong year. Can you just sort of give us some color on that segment?", "Andy Cecere", "I would expect the growth to be similar with what we saw off 2015, more focused on the lending side versus the leasing side and with it principally trying auto on the lending side. So, to stress this situation what might have been 110, 120 basis points is maybe down to 100 or right around that area, a lot of that\u2019s because of the aggressive nature of the manufacturers. But I think on a growth prospect a very -- prospects for \u201916 are going to be very similar to what you saw in \u201915.", "Nancy Bush", "Are you picking up market share there? Is that part of your growth picture?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. We are both with dealers as well as certain manufacturers that we\u2019re trying to partner with in different ways a little bit on the lending side but also on the leasing side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.", "Chris Mutascio", "A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple nitpicky things I guess. Kathy, can you refresh my memory, who did you sell the HSA deposit portfolio to?", "Kathy Rogers", "That was Optum Bank.", "Chris Mutascio", "I am sorry, to who?", "Kathy Rogers", "Optum Bank.", "Chris Mutascio", "And then, and Richard, I appreciate you calling out the gain in HSA and maybe the possible offset in terms of the expenses in the quarter to get more of a run rate. And I hope you don't think I'm beating you up too much, but should I really back out the expenses in the quarter tied to legal and compliance since first quarter your level expense is supposed to be similar to the reported level in fourth quarter?", "Kathy Rogers", "There is going to be a lot of moving parts of this and we\u2019re very early in the quarter. But I think that if you go with the guidance of just relatively stable because I think you will -- that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking of as we look out into the first quarter.", "Richard Davis", "I am going to give you something you don\u2019t know which is why you called. This year we\u2019re going to look back on 2015 and we\u2019re not going to payout 100% of our bonus pool. This is my 10th year as CEO and that\u2019d the first year we didn\u2019t and I am okay with that because we live and die by the sword and our guys are amazingly competent and capable. And when we have great years we pay them out handsomely over 100% of target and when we don\u2019t we don\u2019t. And so what that means to you is the accrual goes back to 100% in first quarter because you expect to make your plan. And so that\u2019s a fairly interesting delta I am not going to slide it for you exactly but that would be something that I would have told you more next quarter but I might as well change that because you are struggling to think it through why we would otherwise want to stay stable that is another fairly meaningful part of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Just one final question on expenses, which has been discussed at great length, but I just want to understand how -- what is actually funding these growth initiatives. Is it strictly the benefit of the top-line growth that's occurring in some measure? Or is it coming from efficiency savings that continue to be gained in other places?", "Richard Davis", "Well, in terms of you are speaking innovation particularly we just have that in the run rate for about seven or eight years it\u2019s just something that would be easy to slowdown and that\u2019s the part of descending that we didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t underestimate enough when you have a acquiring payments business not just in issuing you get to work with the merchant not the commercial customer the merchant the one who sells stuff and then you get to bring your consumers in and we pilot and test all kinds of relationships and partnerships and we learn best practices, consumer preferences, merchant progresses and some of the stuff never makes it to the street because it\u2019s really a bad idea but it looked good. So that we don\u2019t want to slowdown that's been in the run rate for Eric for as many years as I could remember so there is no new increased cost and as I said earlier things like our large brand reputation campaign we are going to launch this year will cost money we haven\u2019t have the run rate so it is going to come impart from the efficiency program some we will give it back to the shareholders some we will keep for ourselves and investment in things people always wanted to do so that's kind of the way to think about it.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Okay. And you've given I think very clear guidance about the first quarter, but has anything that's occurred in terms of portfolio acquisitions or other kinds of dynamics further disrupt what would be the typical quarterly cadence in terms of expense seasonality?", "Richard Davis", "That is all. You are right to ask that in fact I think in this quarter we are going to go back at our next opportunity to show and remind people how steady our fourth quarters are and how -- which quarter is strongest which one is weakest and how the linked quarters move and I am only saying that because it's a really it's so consistent you can set your watch by it and it is a probably a good way to go back and look.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Credit quality for you guys has been good and you continue to expect that it's going to remain very good, but the world is obviously starting to worry about bigger other things. So you guys don't have to worry so much about energy, but Rich, I'm just wondering -- I don't know if Bill's there -- but back in all of your industries and your subgroups, what are you starting to watch for? What, if anything, are you concerned could go the wrong way? We're certainly not seeing it in NPAs, delinquencies, et cetera, across the Company. So can you just tell us your underlying comfort in terms of how things are going and what you will be watchful of?", "Richard Davis", "I will have Bill answer that but I do want to call out what a good question that was because dealing with our Board of Directors we haven\u2019t really focused on credit in many years and I'm putting it right back at the front runner because I want to start watching trends and we are going to watch competitors and we\u2019re going to watch different buckets and tranches and we are going to learn a lot all of us by what's about to happen if we start learning about these small moves now don\u2019t look very big that they can be quite tell-tell of what is going to happen so you ask more questions like that because that's going I think give us a chance to I'll talk about risk profile and likely future losses but Bill why don\u2019t you answer the question and what's your -- more or so a word about after energy and precious metals.", "Bill Parker", "Yes I mean really it is the impacted areas in the country that we would look most closely at so if you think about the Dakota there is not a lot of people or infrastructure out there other than what's in the oil and gas but if you get to a state like Texas and the Houston area where it is a fairly energy dependent economy so you really look at a kind of newly unemployed trend and that's a thing that's going to generate potential delinquencies in the consumer portfolios and then that just has a ripple effect in terms of lower demand for small business both etcetera so we would focus very closely on watching the economies around the kind of the energy belt areas in the United States we do have as Richard said earlier we\u2019re national and for real state national and our own card so we have been watching carefully we have not seen any impact yet even though we would be seeing 50,000 oil workers have lost their jobs in the last year or so but it really has not shown up and I feel bad but those are the kinds of things that we want every day.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, and one follow-up just you guys talk a lot about the strength in the payments businesses and then we still have that offsetting potential benefit from the energy subsidy that's not quite coming through. So in terms of just payments growth and underlying, can you just talk about do you envision the energy subsidy starting to get spent? Or do you think that's just an ongoing drag in certain parts of the businesses and we're not quite seeing it offset to the positive in other?", "Andy Cecere", "This is Andy so I wouldn\u2019t say that the energy subsidy is being spent into a large degree so we are seeing steady growth in our card growth as you saw is very good we had a very good Christmas season the holiday season if you compare our contrasted our master card numbers would show up from Black Friday through Christmas Eve would say of 7.9% growth that was just over 10% growth which is better than it was last year but it's not substantially better so we are good and steady but we are not seeing all the dollars saved on the energy side moving to spend on the consumer side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens.", "Terry McEvoy", "I was wondering if you could just talk about the headwinds to credit and debit card revenue in 2016 just from lower equipment sales that kind of were up in Q3. You mentioned they were down a bit in Q4. And then maybe just as a follow-on, that same question on revenue given lower gas prices and what that does to the fleet vehicle card at Elavon?", "Richard Davis", "Right so actually the spend activity on merchant terminals peak in the third quarter came down about 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter and I would expect it to be fairly level going into 2016. There is still a number of merchants who have been purchasing terminals that we would expect to steady state without occurring but the headwinds so to speak as you described it was about a 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter but I don\u2019t expect there is a lot of further headwind going into 2016.", "Terry McEvoy", "And then just a quick question for Kathy, the tax rates kind of jumped around. Could you give us a little insight into full-year 2016 for the tax rate?", "Kathy Rogers", "Yes, you're right, the tax rate did rise in the fourth quarter and that was principally due to the fact that we had some mix change in our tax credit business so as I look out into 2016 I'd put that rate in the kind of in that 28% to 29% range and as I've said today we're probably right in the middle of that range.", "Operator", "This concludes our Q&A portion for today's call. I will now turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you for listening to this review of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day.", "Bill Parker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.", "This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday, April 27th at 12 midnight.", "I would now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jennifer Ann Thompson - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jen and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin a review of the U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on slide 3 of the presentation.", "U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016, or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards Card program and as part of that arrangement we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion which is reflected in the company's average loan growth for the quarter.", "I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range and the payments business remained strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year over year, adjusted for the retail card acquisition. Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector.", "While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at 1.3% of total loans, the deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in a recognition of additional reserves of $15 million higher than charge-offs during the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that excluding the energy portfolio, credit quality for the company remained strong, which was reflected by our stable charge-off rates. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans were 48 basis points, up one basis point from the prior quarter.", "Additionally, the company saw improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio. Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements particularly in our retail portfolios. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve.", "Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter as expected. The benefit we recognized from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago and up from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low-50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating costs with investments in our franchise.", "We remain focused on our efficiency efforts as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched real-time person-to-person payments on the clearXchange network and we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as \"Mobile Leader\" by Corporate Insight in March, which acknowledges our commitment to being a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology.", "Turning to slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, a $131 million or 2.7% increase from the prior year. The revenue growth we are seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business.", "Kathy will now provide you with more details about the first quarter results.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion, or 5.2%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition.", "In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition. Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion, or 5.4%, year-over-year, and finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued, resulted in a year-over-year increase of $471 million, or 3%.", "On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion, or 3.5%, the strongest linked quarter growth for the previous five quarters, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion, or 2.3%.", "We currently expect linked quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $17 billion, or 6.3%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked quarter basis. The linked quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our Corporate Trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in non-interest bearing deposits and low cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-off in higher cost time deposits.", "Let me now turn to slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter. However, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remained stable. First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million, or 12.9%, compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million, or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up one basis point compared with the fourth quarter. Compared with a year ago, non-performing assets increased 1.4%. On a linked quarter basis, non-performing assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely (7:55-7:57) energy-related credits. Excluding energy-related loans, non-performing assets decreased 4.1% on a linked quarter basis.", "Turning to slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers in energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitments were $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. During the quarter, we recognized $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio, and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with a 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitments, and 17% of our outstanding energy loans, are to investment grade companies. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked quarter net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016.", "Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income decreased by $45 million, or 3.1%, on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015. On a linked quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million, or 6.1%, mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy, and the impact of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the Health Savings Account deposit portfolio.", "Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased by $136 million, or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was offset by the impact of a two basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.06%. The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates, offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.", "Net interest income increased by $17 million, or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable, and linked quarter net interest income to increase modestly.", "Slide 11 highlights non-interest income, which decreased $5 million, or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust and investment management fees. Continued strength in the payment business is reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million, or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter.", "Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million, or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant processing services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth, and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirements. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continue to trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $191 million, or 8.2%, principally due to seasonally lower fee-based revenues along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale.", "As expected, our payment fees and deposit service charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses. Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. We expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 10 to 20% based on seasonally higher application volumes.", "Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, primarily driven by merit increases and higher compliance and acquisition costs were partially offset by lower pension expense and an insurance recovery recognized during the quarter. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense decreased by $60 million, or 2.1%. Seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses along with the insurance recovery were partially offset by seasonally higher benefits expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes costs related to an all-employee grant that was issued in the first quarter.", "We expect linked quarter expenses to increase in quarter two, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly decline, as costs related to our residential mortgage default consent order conclude. Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter.", "Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong and in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward.", "Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented at March 31st was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31st, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter.", "I will now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kathy. I'm very proud of our first quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We continue to operate from a position of strength as we grow our revenue and manage expenses, while strategically investing in our businesses to create value for our shareholders. While not immune to the broader economic and market conditions, including the continued low rate environment and the weakness in the energy sector, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges, to win market share, and continue to deliver consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill, and I would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was on the real-time payments that you launched this past quarter. Richard, we have been talking quite a bit over the past several conference calls around the efforts underway to drive real-time payments. And you promised and delivered on the expectation this year that we would have something big come. Could you give us a sense as to how you expect to utilize this product, how you expect to deliver real-time payments, not only to consumers but also to corporates as we work through what ACH is going to be doing and also what clearXchange is driving for you?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Betsy. Yeah, the clearXchange and the EWS (16:04) partnership which you've read about with some of the large banks has been a important step to get us into a combined effort so that we can all work on something that banks have controlled for years, which is the payments network and the ACH system. So we're making progress. And I think as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position. We haven't given it up and we are not going to sit idly by while nonbanks come in and take over the position.", "So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are \u2013 is just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher value products because they are eager to change and try new things and businesses are more cautious and more careful and think blockchain, moving from ledger to eventually payments and things like that. So we are pleased with what we see.", "The issue I want to bring before you though and our investors is, whether you get paid for this? And there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other bank that came out with one of the real-time payments P2P where we are charging for it and they are not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is, will consumers and eventually businesses pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for today? Will they pay it for a time? (17:22) Amazon member and you will pay for Prime to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we are hoping they will do it here in the payments world.", "We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumers where they expect everything to come without a value price to it. And we are hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope. And then there'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers and the businesses want delivered to them. And frankly, I think we'll surprise them. But it's been so long, this whole paradigm of overnight settlement, closed on weekends and all of that. I think they will be quite pleased to see some of the progress we are making.", "I'd like to ask Andy to give a little more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in real-time payments and helping coordinate our own banks' position on that.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Richard. Betsy, I'd add two facts. One is, the current P2P is principally consumer-to-consumer and it's principally on a mobile device. And what you'll see as we continue through this year is that more and more banks will be added to that network, so would be able to continue real-time exchange with other additional banks.", "Secondly, on the wholesale or business-to-business side of the equation, you will see more of that activity come later this year as we continue to develop other capabilities beyond consumer and, again, I expect that to be later this year.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "On the payment question with NACHA moving to same-day settlement in October for push transactions, does that reduce the risk that you take as an institution and have an impact on the fees you are charging?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it doesn't. It's all part of this larger consortium of getting everybody aligned properly. The ACH is owned in part by the clearing house and in part by the Fed. NACHA is one of the partners that we all deal with. And I am happy to report, we are all working and playing well together so that we don't create confusion or what I will call price disintermediation on what would otherwise be something we want to keep simple for the customer. So add NACHA to the stable of partners that we are working with in getting this, I think, right in the minds of both the consumers and what investors would want us to do.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "And what that does is essentially add an additional window. So it's not really real-time per se, but it's an additional window during the day.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just wondering if there is also a benefit to you from this product in terms of account acquisition and expense management, more real-time pay over the mobile, less check, less cash?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Certainly there is a lower expense from that and I think the principal reason we are doing is though is from a customer experience standpoint. So, customers who have the need to have a real-time exchange for whatever reason would have that capability on their phone and again, we are one of the first to introduce that. So that's what it's about; it's how the customer is interacting with the bank and with other individuals.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I do think there will be an advantage to the banks that go first and there will be a window, like anything else where you can attract other customers who don't know that their bank will ever have it. This will become ubiquitous over time, which, at the end of the day is okay as long as the industry finds the right value proposition and gets paid for it.", "And to go back to your question, to add a little business to business on here, where Andy mentioned on NACHA. Give yourself an example of, you are a state of whatever, and in the middle of the day, you realize you made a mistake on one of your payrolls to your state employees and you need to remedy that before tomorrow morning. There is opportunities now to get in the middle of the payment system and do something midday. But I think that should have a cost to it, because that's a convenience that was otherwise not present for value of services added. So I think we will find some, both competitive benefits and some financial benefits, but it has a lot to do with how the industry performs in the next, probably three to four quarters as we start rolling things out.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning. Can you talk a bit about how far along you are in some of the system spend and related investments you are making, and then weave that into kind of maybe the longer term outlook for expenses? You gave us some visibility on 2Q, but as we think about the back half of the year and just maybe get towards the end of the ramp in that spend, how that plays out.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I will go first. System spend, if you mean technology and operations, that's steady state. If you take a ten-year view \u2013 my ten years at least, the first five were higher than what I will say is the run rate, because we were trying to catch up, and you know that story, and we did that. And now we are back to a steady state. I'd say the next few years, there won't be a significant difference in depreciated costs, capital expenditures. They are higher than they used to be, because we need to stay at that level. But we've also never cheated the innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down. So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we are in. And it's (22:19) rely on just the fact that we are going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation. Think of all the minimum wage issues that are out there and issues like that. So that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now and it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficiency we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation costs on the other. But I don't think we will add it as a save in the future.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, and I would add, our area of focus is in three principal areas. Number one is customer relationship management. So, better information about our customers, both across the retail as well as the wholesale platform. Second is customer capability. So, increasing what a customer can do, not only within a branch, but on their mobile device, as well as on the Internet. And finally, data; data overall. Just using data better in the company for the benefit of the bank as well as the customer.", "Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I guess as we roll out beyond 2Q, just I mean, how meaningful is getting the peak and compliance costs behind you? And what I'm getting at is, obviously, you are extremely efficient, industry-leading, but we are in such a low revenue growth environment, 3% expense growth just makes it tough to consistently grow earnings. So trying to get a sense of, how much more you can do on the expense and efficiency side, from already it's a turning point (23:39).", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I got it. Let's go back and do a quick fact set (23:42). We are two parts revenue, one part expenses, is our recipe; that's good. So when revenue does move, it's got a two-fer on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it won't be Armageddon, but it would be something we hope to get.", "In response to that, expenses, the compliance costs are something that we don't like, because they are related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So if there's a consent order, it means you have been deficit in some way. One of the ways to fix that is to bring in both third parties and to bulk up your staffing. And then you come back down to a more normalized level.", "I will say, our compliance costs and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last five years. We did that review for our board just yesterday. And I would have said probably two-thirds of that would have been present anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like, just an order peaks you out and you never come back down. But there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order, this quarter wraps up and its completion, and then we move into now the AML/BSA consent order that we are moving through, that's where I think we are peaking out. This is the overlap quarter.", "But coming down, Matt, we are talking tens of millions of dollars; we are not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTE, not thousands of FTE. It's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more germane to that is, as long as we can grow our loans at I think the kind of level we have been, high quality loans \u2013 I can say that twice; high quality loans, because that's an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margin stays flat. And with that two-to-one on expenses, we can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage, and we are still shooting for it for 2016, and we can still make money.", "The challenge I have is whether I want to dispense any of those efficiency saves back into the bank, or whether I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line, and we are doing both. And so, you will hear in Kathy's comments that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation and brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter. And we're going to stick with it, and we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we've saved on our efficiency program.", "And while I'm not going to give you a final number, two years ago in February \u2013 so was that \u2013 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things that were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all other watchful eye on other expenses, and that has saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars in our annual run rate, most of which we are putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is, but some of which we're putting back into the company. But as to your original question, we can grow both, and we are thoughtful about it, but we expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs that have to be accomplished, and we will. Anything else certainly isn't going to be technology.", "Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Matt.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, in terms of your guidance on the provision, Kathy, I noted that you think that that's going to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. But if I do a little bit of simple math, it looks like, outside of the energy portfolio, you released reserves last quarter, whereas you clearly added reserves in the energy portfolio. First of all, is that correct? And second of all, if we are correct on that, how do you think about the energy portfolio reserving going forward? Is this something where you are just going to sort of cover losses and maintain reserves where they are, or possibly add to reserves going forward?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Hi, Matt. This is Bill Parker. I'll take that. You're correct.", "Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, Bill.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "We did have continued improvement, particularly in our residential mortgage portfolio, so that did, in part, offset some of the increase to the energy reserves. You can see, we did build the energy reserves to 9.1% of our outstanding loans. We had a pretty conservative price stack that we used during the quarter. So we feel like we have got, embedded in those reserves, what we will need for the future quarters. So, that's where we get that stable outlook.", "Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, that's helpful, Bill, thanks very much. And then, if I can, just on the expenses, a little ticky-tack question. Have you disclosed the amount of the proceeds from the insurance recovery? Because we would, I think, deem that as sort of a one-off or non-core, but just curious if you provided that?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Yeah, Matt, what I would say, we didn't disclose it. It's really not material to the numbers.", "Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just, finally from me, we noted a higher money market savings rate this quarter versus the fourth quarter. Can you provide some color on what was going on there?", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think a lot of where you see in the money market account are going to be some of our deposits with some of our corporate customers. So as our short-term rates started to increase, we did see a little bit of pricing increase on the commercial side or the wholesale side. I will say that from a consumer side of the house, we have really seen no changes in our overall deposit pricing.", "Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jon.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jon.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning, everyone. A question on your loan growth guidance. High end of the range, you obviously did pretty well this quarter. And with the flat margin, it actually suggests maybe a little better revenue environment. But can you just give us an idea of the drivers that are putting you at the high end of that range? And then maybe, Bill, if you could comment on what you expect on energy draws. Do you expect energy loan balances to kind of up, down, sideways? Thanks.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jon, first of all, we telegraphed to you guys 1.5% for quarter two, which, read between the lines, we have moved up the bottom, right? So we already know what quarter two is starting to look like, and it's feeling pretty robust. And it's very much the same things have you seen. Commercial is still strong and growing at that same clip, particularly M&A transactions or balance restructurings by corporate customers. We have got nice growth in home equity. I know that's a very rare thing, but we continue to grow our home equity portfolio I think against the comps to the other banks. Auto continues to grow. Credit card continues to grow. So we are on all cylinders on loans. Mortgages particularly are growing nicely as they \u2013 they didn't a year ago. So we are feeling good across the board. And I would say, what you have seen in the last four quarters is \u2013 would be a lot of what you see in the next quarter or two. So we are telegraphing strong.", "We also said that net interest income will be up slightly or modestly because we do expect a stable margin, increasing balance sheet. That gives you a slight positive. Margin is too early to know and we have to watch and see all the moving parts, so 'stable' just means it's close to where it is now, but we don't know yet at this point which direction or flat it will be. But we do think net interest income will be strong enough based on the loan growth to at least accomplish a positive linked quarter. As \u2013 energy, I'll turn it over to Bill.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah, and so on the energy portfolio, we did have a small number of borrowers that did draw during the first quarter. So our loan balances there were up couple hundred million. You can see that our commitments declined. We expected the commitments to continue to decline as we go through the borrowing base re-determinations. Wouldn't surprise me if there were another handful of borrowers that did draw during the quarter, but I can say we've also had a lot of success in \u2013 with other borrowers in restructuring the loans and \u2013 where they have been able to provide additional collateral.", "So overall, little up \u2013 probably a little more on the loans and then the commitments will continue to come down.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And we have also done the re-determination.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yes, we are about 40% of the way through the borrowing base Spring re-determination so \u2013 and so far that's going pretty well and allows us to feel comfortable about the stable outlook.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. And (32:16) 40% doesn't hurt. One more thing, Jon, I should have added. I didn't talk about commercial real estate. That's flat for us. It's been flat for us. We are different there too. A lot of the banks are growing that a lot. I said in the prior calls that we want to be very watchful on commercial real estate and we are being \u2013 we could be wrong. We could be missing some of the market growth. There's some pockets of good strength and we are in them. We've got our customers who are certainly going to grow the balance sheet, but not by a lot because we are protecting what we have and probably being more careful and not getting into some of the areas and things we don't really understand at this point in time. So add that to your thinking. While loans will still grow, commercial estate would be flattish, protecting the good customers we have.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Good. That's very helpful. And then Bill, to clarify, you don't expect another \u2013 if oil stays here, you don't expect another big step-up in energy reserves. Is that the right way to interpret what you said in the last question?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Correct. Yes.", "Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the help.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yeah, guys, thank you very much. On the energy side, are you seeing any of the areas where those energy credits are going bad; you seeing any deterioration in any of your CRE products or loans?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah, we look at a couple of our markets that are energy dependent, the ones that we're most focused on are Denver and Houston. Denver, there's been little to no impact. It's not that energy dependent anymore. Houston of course is. We do have commercial real estate down there. We also do home building in the state of Texas. So we are watching that carefully. We have seen stress in the office market. That's obviously slowed in Houston. We do have four properties that we are watching, but it's not a material amount. We underwrite to our sponsors, our client base, as opposed to the area that they are in. So we feel that we have good secondary support on all the credits that we have in Houston.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Paul, we look at secondary and tertiary impacts on particularly those markets, the Gulf Coast and things where we have auto loans, we might have credit cards and things and we see absolutely no impact at all at this early stage of the game. So no one who lives or works down there that has our cars our cards are showing any stress.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then a follow-up question just on the mortgage side. Are you seeing any big pickup in the purchase market? Are we seeing some indications that the purchase market finally is starting to get some life? On any of your applications for the second quarter, are you seeing any pickup in that?", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, the mortgage application on the purchase side was up about 12%. And as you know, the refinancings are down, so that's what's causing the overall decline. And I would expect to continue to increase in the second quarter, principally due to the seasonality in that 10% to 20% range.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thank you very much.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Good morning. On the C&I loan yield, looks like it was up 11 basis points in the quarter. I just want to get a little bit of color on the drivers of that. I know the Fed hike is certainly part of it. And then, if it's sustainable at that level and what your outlook would be.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, thanks, John. I am going to say, it's really all driven by the Fed hike \u2013 the increase in the short term. As you know, where we see the increase in \u2013 due to loan rates is going to be in our wholesale portfolio and we get all of that typically in the first \u2013 first 90-day is a little bit more front-loaded. I would not \u2013 unless we see another increase in short-term rates, I would not see that list continuing into second quarter.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We might also just add, we have benefited by deposits not going up quite as much as we thought they would.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Got it. And then on the payments side of the business, wanted to get just your updated thoughts on how we should think about the growth rates in those businesses. Particularly the merchant processing business, up about 4% year-over-year. What's a good growth rate we can assume for that one? And then the same thing around the credit and debit card businesses. Just want to get an idea of what you think in terms of a growth possibility for the year. Thanks.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "So, merchant \u2013 let me start \u2013 this is Andy. Let me start with Merchant. Merchant was up, as you said about 4%; adjusted for FX, about 6.5% and that is \u2013 the principal driver of that growth is going to be same store sales. And same store sales was down a little bit in North America versus Europe for sure maybe about 2% versus 2.5% or so over the last few quarters. So the consumer was a little bit more cautious in the first quarter, spend was a little bit down, but I would expect to continue to have, even at that level's growth in the range \u2013 adjusted again for FX in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis per merchant. On the card side of equation that was a little higher because of the purchase of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we are talking at about 6%, 6.5%. And I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same store sales and then what's happening so to speak with what customers are doing. We are seeing modest growth there, but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category.", "And then finally, you didn't ask but I will just give you the corporate payment side of the equation. Two big moving pieces there. The first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7% on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to defense spending going down. Now, on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit, almost the exact same amount, 5.7%. And interesting, we are seeing there, while companies continue to be very conservative as it relates to T&E spend, payable spend is actually starting to increase, which is a positive sign.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "All right, Andy. Thank you. That's helpful. And one last thing on energy, what was the percentage borrowing base reduction so far that you have seen in the Spring re-determinations that have been completed?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "The values came down about 20% to 25% and that translates into commitment reductions in our E&P portfolio of about 10% to 15%", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, the 40% re-determination's been accomplished. 75% of the companies had a reduction, 25% did not. So they are not all being reduced, but that takes you down to the numbers that Bill gave you.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Got it. Thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hey. This goes in the category of 'no good deed goes unpunished'. Your efficiency ratio remains really good at 54.6%, but it's just not clear how it gets better from where it is. And I would point out, as you know, it's the worst it's been in the last five quarters. You guided higher for expenses in the second quarter. And when I look at the 54.6%, five years ago, it was 51%. So it has drifted up and I hear you, tech, compliance, regulation. So how do you move that lower? And that's my segue into, why not pursue acquisitions, and what is your appetite and when would you be able to pursue those acquisitions?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, thanks Debbie Downer for that. You are right; 54% is higher than we have been in a long time. I know you know this, but I'll say it again; we don't set a target; it's a result, because we keep watching our revenue and our expenses and always try to grow revenue over expenses when possible. The 300 basis points in the last few years is not only \u2013 not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been, given the fact that with a 0% interest rate increase up until last quarter and with a very slow, steady, almost not recovering economy, we obviously have been taking market share of high quality customers and been able to offset some of that margin compression.", "So I'm actually pretty pleased with it, but I do think \u2013 we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we are telegraphing to you all that this will be our high-water mark for the year. It also was the high-water mark last year. I think it is always the high-water mark as quarter one is by far our weakest quarter. It will come down on that basis. But Mike, when \u2013 two things have to happen, and I don't know which is more valuable. One is that the economy just need to get stronger and we got to be doing old-fashioned lending for people who want to grow and acquire organic kind of things that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That will be huge.", "The second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They are also both quite important, right? Because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry, but make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up \u2013 the moment \u2013 the short end came up, the long end came down. And that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on lack of rate movement. So, nothing has gone in our industry's favor in the last five years to improve an efficiency ratio. So we are holding on for dear life with this effort, that we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high-water mark for us. And we are \u2013 we're not loving it, but we are also \u2013 by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you guys, give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself, two years from now, why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So, I like the way you asked the question; there is a possibility for it to get better.", "In terms of M&A, we are always interested, particularly in the payments and trust business. You are reminded that, with the AML consent order, we are disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions, and again, it's okay right now, because we haven't found one we wish we could have had, and there's nothing we have lost that we would have otherwise sought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so we can get back to the permissions, which I think will be starting next year. And I have said this many times before, where kind of the statute of any oldest limitations should be away and gone from any acquisition, such that when you buy somebody, you know what you are buying and you don't buy old problems that you couldn't have possibly detected in due diligence. So we are still hungry for that. It is not going to make or break this company, because we are not going to change who we are or the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for very good opportunities, the fidelity of the (42:40) portfolio, the Auto Club portfolio, you will see more of those, and hopefully more merchant portfolios, particularly overseas.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "As a follow-up, on looking at whole bank deals, so you can't even look. I mean, could you \u2013 when do you think you'd be able to look at whole bank deals, and what sort of merger criteria do you have in terms of IRR or accretion, dilution? I know you haven't done a big bank deal in a while, but it seems like you are a more efficient bank, makes sense to buy a less efficient bank. That's the way the industry is supposed to evolve.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's the old fashioned way of doing it. And not just for expenses, but for revenue, right? I would say, first of all, we have \u2013 there's a firm prohibition on buying a holding company while you have an AML consent order. You saw us buy branches before and you've seen us take on portfolios, those are the rules that are a little less clear, and we haven't found anything to test it. So, again, we are not being thwarted at the gate here. But what you would want to do is, once we get through the consent order, we will be back into the market and looking at those opportunities. But I got to tell you, the reason I haven't signed anything we like is because this company isn't thirsting for any unfinished business. There is not a market we're in that we don't want to be in, and there is not a market we are dying to get in that we are not. I would actually rather double down where we are.", "And the fact of the matter is, I'm still very concerned, for all kinds of reasons, that to pick up any full company, even if I could, I probably wouldn't right now, because I still think there's a lingering impact of attorneys generals and SECs and all kinds of other actions that are still yet to be levied on some of the smaller banks as we move down through that cycle, and I don't want to be holding one of them when we get there. But I'd tell you, as soon as the AML thing gets cleared and our regulators are quite clear that we want to clear whatever parts of that particular order would allow us back into bank transactions, we are making that job one, so that we have all the alternatives available to us as soon as possible.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "And do you think you can clear that by the end of this year?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know when that's going to clear, because they take a long time. That's why I bifurcated and said we are seeking permissions to get the part of it that would allow us back into the M&A, full M&A business, to be accomplished first, and as long as the regulators will allow that, then we can bifurcate the full exit (44:51) by getting to the pieces that matter the most. And that's what we are working on, and as you would expect, the regulators haven't given us a timetable, and I wouldn't be dumb enough to guess at this stage, but that's what we are working on.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jack.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, good morning. Richard, you guys have been a leader in the payment space for a long time, and obviously very focused on competing against the non-banks. I'm curious what your thoughts are personally and then broadly, U.S. Bank's strategy, around the peer-to-peer side. Obviously, a lot of investor tension in that space. There's some structural differences for sure. We have seen some banks partner, we have seen some banks buy loans. Give us your thoughts on how that evolves, and how you see U.S. Bank fitting in.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Jack, this is Andy. Hey. You are absolutely right. It's a topic of a lot of focus for our company. What I would say is, we are very comfortable with our underwriting process and use of our balance sheet. I think where some of the \u2013 Vintac (45:55) and other companies have done a good job is the customer interaction, customer convenience and access. And so, if there's a partnership, that's where we would focus, is on that end of the equation, not the underwriting end. And we are actually looking at different opportunities there in experimentation, in terms of improving the customer experience, which I think they have done a pretty good job on. But we are very comfortable with our underwriting. It's proven through cycles, and we're going to stick with that.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great. Thank you.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jack.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Dick.", "Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. I would like to explore for a second your relationship with the Minneapolis Fed. I mean, I'm guessing that you are a member, and that you probably provide about 50% of the revenue of that Federal Reserve Bank. And that Bank has published formulas, I guess, which would suggest that you are too big to fail, and that your bank should be broken up. And I'm wondering, number one, what your interaction is with that bank. Number two, did you have any say in the selection of the President of that bank? And most importantly, number three, does it become an embarrassment for the Minneapolis Fed if you acquire anything or if you grow, forcing them to make some sort of statement against U.S. Bancorp in order to maintain the purity of their message, which could cause some problem for you guys? I mean, if you wouldn't mind just exploring the idea with us.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would be happy to. Thanks for the question. First of all, our relationship is quite good. We are, by far, their most important client, and we're, I think, more than half the entire Ninth District. As you all probably know, but I will remind you that the hiring of the President is left to a layman board, particularly, local leaders who have parameters, of course. But they do bring in people that have \u2013 in some cases, they are not economists, and Neel Kashkari certainly fits that bill. But he comes in with a zeal and a need to want to open the question again on too-big-to-fail. I have met with him. I knew him in the TARP program. As you recall, we were the last big bank to take TARP. I didn't want to. We were the first bank to pay it back. I'm glad we did. I had long conversations with him over that period of time. And as soon as he showed up, Dick, here in the first of the year, Andy and I went to meet with him to introduce ourselves in his new role, and we had a very good conversation. And I believe \u2013 and I can say that the Fed here and we have a working relationship that couldn't be better than it is anywhere else.", "So that as a backdrop, I don't think he's coming in with his gunsights on U.S. Bank. In fact, I'm sure he's not. We have not \u2013 he's not invited any banks to his symposiums yet. He hasn't indicated yet when that will be, but I know we will have that opportunity. You might guess, I have private conversations with him routinely and with his team, so I'm not feeling left out of being able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. But at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word. But he's \u2013 while he has a bent towards investigating too big to fail, he is going to collect a lot of good data, and I think he's going to be balanced in his final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendation to the Fed by year's end, on what he thinks could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital, he's focused on size. But I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including Bernanke, who is coming May 16, at his second symposium.", "So I'm not feeling that he's set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gunsights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him, nor I think affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has a lot of jurisdiction over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress test and the horizontal incentive compensation (49:35) rules and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the locals. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local, is important to me, and I want to make sure that we are all operating in transparency.", "So, at this point, I appreciate his approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly sharing my thoughts when I have the opportunity. It would be inappropriate, I think, for me to take a public position and argue the merits of going out and collecting more feedback, and there probably are some \u2013 number of pundits that do believe that banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we have accomplished an amazing level of success there, and I think a bank our size is exactly the kind of size that most people can get their arms around. I can get my arms around this one, and I'm going to continue to proffer that this is the perfect sized bank. Kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not short on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him. Just simply not in a public forum.", "Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. Can you hear me?", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, go ahead.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes, you can. A couple of questions. First, a simple one. What's the percentage of criticized loans for energy? You gave commitments. Can you give loans also, please?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah, I do have that with me. So, when I \u2013 you ask your other question and I'll get back to it, okay?", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Second question is on the credit card charge volume. As I look at \u2013 you had obviously very good increase in volumes from the Fidelity acquisition, but when you look at fees, the growth was much lesser (51:20). So, clearly, a sharp drop in pricing. Can you talk a little bit about how you came up with a pricing on the Fidelity deal? Because it seems like your average fee rate is down pretty sharply year-over-year when you look at that.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "The Fidelity portfolio, Vivek, is a higher quality portfolio. It is a lower charge-off rate portfolio. A higher spend portfolio, and a little lower rate portfolio, as you said. But it's very profitable overall, and we are very comfortable with the pricing that's there. The only thing I'd say on pricing is, the impact has also been impacted by gasoline prices as they come down, and you will see a little bit of a reduction there. But the Fidelity portfolio is actually a very good portfolio for the bank, overall. Higher quality, a little bit restructure than what we had in the quarter.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Andy.", "Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer", "Sure.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And, Bill, do you have a number?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah. 52%.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Can you talk a little bit about that? That's pretty high, given that you have been a pretty cautious lender, and you'd been small in that portfolio. Can you talk about why you are at one of the highest levels?", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "I can, because core to how we rate those loans is our price deck. And our price deck, we feel is \u2013 we like it. It's conservative. That's the way we like to do things. So our price deck right now is at $30 throughout 2016, and it slowly goes up over the next five years to $44. So, I think if you look at any of the futures markets, you will see that that's a fairly conservative outlay. And that is how we risk weight our loans.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay. Thank you.", "P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer", "Yeah.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mahmood Reza with Omega Advisors.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Mahmood.", "Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.", "Hey there. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one going back to the student loan portfolio, which I think, last year we went held for sale in Q1 and then back to held for investment in Q3. There were sort of a few transactions and it seems like that market has thawed in the first quarter. And I would be curious to get your view if you think it's sort of thawed enough to get you interested in testing the waters again. And as a follow-up, does sort of the move from held for sale to available for sale and back to held for sale last year in the span of three quarters limit your ability to sell the portfolio again this year? Thank you.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Thank you, Mahmood. We said last year when we moved that portfolio back into our held for investment that we were going to stick with that. We are not really looking at any opportunities to move on that again. So I would expect, going forward, that you'll just continue to see that in our loan portfolio.", "Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Marty.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Hey. I wanted to ask about the seasonality. If you take out mortgage, which you gave us some good insight into what you thought was going to happen there. But you have strong seasonality from first \u2013 second quarters in a lot of the processing businesses. Typically, that's in the 6% to 7% uptick. Just wanted to see if \u2013 is that kind of the same progression you are looking for this year.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Perfect. And then...", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, sorry...", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "...that comes through loud and clear. That then is, if you look at the efficiencies improving, even with the uptick and some expenses, you really will set, after you have kind of had to work through a couple of years of relatively flat earnings, this will be a nice step-up, which you typically get seasonally. So, I just would expect to see that, and was wondering if that's kind of in line if you bring it all together.", "Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I will say that. So if we \u2013 I will go back to the efficiency questions that have been asked. I do think that's exactly right. So we are going to have an increase in our fee \u2013 or on our revenues from a seasonality standpoint. But I think as importantly as our loan growth continues to pick up at the higher end of the range, that's going to add additional revenue and the fact that our margin has stabilized is really \u2013 is helping us from an overall standpoint of being comfortable thinking about the efficiency ratio, declining a little bit as we move into the second quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Marty.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions.", "Richard K.

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Terry Dolan Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core revenue growth.", "As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. There were no notable items to report in the third quarter. So for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks at our results.", "Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%.", "Turning to slide 5, the Company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and Payment Services. The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and a flatter yield curve.", "This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite our lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98%, in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter.", "Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industrywide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue.", "Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter, in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses including tax credit amortization costs related to our community development business.", "And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results.", "Terry Dolan", "Thanks, Richard. I'll start on slide 6 which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held-for-investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. ", "Consumer loan growth was broad-based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. On a linked quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%; residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%; home equity loans were up 0.5%; and other retail loans were up 2.7%.", "Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the runoff in higher-cost time deposits.", "Turning to slide 7, credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, but decreased by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continued to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter, in line with loan growth.", "Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.", "Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances, and lower rates on securities purchases partially offset by higher rates on new loans.", "Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter.", "Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue.", "Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industrywide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios. Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9% which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities.", "Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter.", "Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year, primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production.", "Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. We continue our investment in our brand which is reflected in slightly higher marketing costs from a year ago.", "On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1%, due to the impact of one additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1%, in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Marketing and business development costs decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs.", "As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we recorded in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization costs which we expect will increase on a linked quarter basis approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate.", "The linked quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semiannual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year, compared with quarters 1 and 3.", "Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong; and in the third quarter we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.", "Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III Standardized Approach as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter.", "I will now turn it back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Terry. I'm very proud of our record third quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the quarter.", "Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However, we remain confident that we can continue to grow revenue even as we prudently manage expenses and strategically invest in our businesses to create value for both our customers and for our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, Bill and I would be happy to answer any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Ricky Dodds", "This is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. I've got a quick question on C&I loan growth. It's a little weaker than we expected and I was wondering if you could provide us any color on what's driving the slowdown at USB?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. I'll go first, Ricky and I'll turn it over to Andy. As we\u2019ve said, I think, at our Investor Day five weeks ago, we think quarter 3 represents a pause in C&I lending, meaning that it was strong in quarter 2 and we expect it to recover in quarter 4, in part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3 where we had some of the Brexit activities moved things up into quarter 2 and perhaps some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4, but we see that returning nonetheless.", "You'll see that we had a particularly across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher paydowns, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity.", "The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side, remained strong and in fact got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little color around commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that.", "Andy Cecere", "So another factor was a little lower utilization rate. We were down maybe 75 basis points from 26 to 25.25 this quarter, and this is reflective of some of the things Richard talked about. Again I think the very strong debt capital markets issuance that we saw in the second quarter and early in the third quarter impacted Bank outstandings, as we talked about.", "And finally M&A activity which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those factors all come into play and that's why we think it was more of a pause and that will come back a little bit as we [indiscernible].", "Richard Davis", "I just might add, it's already October, what is it, 19th? And so we're deep into the fourth quarter, and we have a pretty good idea how the annuities look, so we can see growth certainly over quarter 3. It's how strong it gets in the next couple of weeks; we'll be able to reflect at the next conference.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "I wanted to ask about expenses and efficiency, Richard. Where are you on the ongoing effort to kind of improve productivity and expenses but also keep investing? Is it a goal to try to self-fund your expenses and investments with savings elsewhere? Or is it more about an efficiency ratio mindset?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, so you know, John, we don't measure efficiency ratio. It becomes the result of the fraction of revenues-to-expenses. So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue which is our number-one goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continued to bear down on expenses.", "So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under the circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day which is that we think there will be a couple of nominal rate increases in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. To give you a sense of it, without the rates, a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for us is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further and I think would probably cut into some of the muscle of the Company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation.", "So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I always find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54%s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and we watch every nickel and dime and we have efficiency programs all over the Company. One of the ways we've kept it low is that we continue to get better every day. We take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our Company and for our people and therefore better service, but it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever.", "Some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts; we don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to. But we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it continue to be in the mid-50%s and for a while. At that point, we'll measure against a future that I think won't be starved for investment. At the same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do that very thing and give you a better return.", "John McDonald", "Just on the topic of rates, I was hoping to ask Terry if he could flesh out a little bit of the outlook on the NIM that you gave for next quarter. What are some of the puts and takes, the good guys and bad guys affecting the NIM outlook for next quarter? And if you could include there, what's your guess as to the effect that one Fed rate hike would have on your NIM in the quarter afterwards? Thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. Incorporated into our guidance, we're assuming that the rate hike does occur in the December time frame; and that in and of itself would have a positive impact with respect to margin, probably maybe by a basis point or so. But one of the things that we anticipate, John, is that the cash balances that we saw an increase in, in the third quarter, we think are tied to money market reform. And that is going to have an impact in terms of net interest margin at least probably through the fourth quarter.", "We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people get more comfortable with money market reform, but when we guide that the net interest margin is going to be down a couple of basis points, the cash balances are going to have an impact on that.", "John McDonald", "And Terry, just to clarify, the one basis point NIM help, is that for the quarter that -- if it happened in December you would get that help this quarter? And would there be a carrythrough to the next quarter that's a little bigger than that?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes.", "Richard Davis", "Yes and yes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "Back to the loan growth topic, thanks for the color that you've given in terms of near term trends; and I hear you in terms of some of the inconsistencies around borrower demand amid the uncertainty right now. How does that play into your expectation for how you're looking at 2017? I know you don't yet have guidance and there for loan growth. But I want to get an idea if you continue to expect improvement coming out of fourth quarter through 2017 and generally expect a higher level of loan growth. Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "The answer is yes. We've been in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time. Every quarter is different and yet we've found a way to pretty much stay there and I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- or when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial; but this is a really well bifurcated model we have here. We like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories; but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than 2016 based on nothing more than the fact that the world gets better a little bit, slowly but surely and because we're taking market share.", "I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters, because I know it's a hollow category when all banks are doing well and everybody talks about it, but you know, we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in one year, the kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for next year, because we believe that market share momentum not only continues but it gets stronger. ", "When anybody in our environment -- think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress -- we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year it's across-the-board. We expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity and it's not with smoke and mirrors.", "We do it the old-fashioned way with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. That's something that is really quite a difference from most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across-the-board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4 will continue to be in that range. I think next year will be in that range and maybe slightly positive bias to that.", "John Pancari", "Then separately, I guess this would be a question for you as well, would be around the regulatory side. Since we've been talking about the regulatory expenses that you've been putting in the work, can you give us a related update on the BSA/AML progress and if there's any way to help us with expectations of when that could be resolved? Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Yes, sure, John. We're deep in the middle of it, so I not only don't have a projection of when we'll leave, if I had it I wouldn't tell you because of the regulators. I haven't made any agreements. So that will take a while; it will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight on when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I had hoped to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML Consent Order came in, it's virtually replaced those same costs.", "So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into the run rate of the Company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like Consent Orders and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is it's a proxy for the expectations of zero tolerance for errors and we've aligned that proxy with everything we do. It takes a little bit of time to adjust to it. It takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance.", "But once and when you've done that and you've put it into your run rate, both in costs and the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I would like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole Company to improve our compliance capability and therefore fend off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year we'll be able to give you a better line of sight; but at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it, doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to overperform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an exit timetable.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "I had a question on the fee side of things. Terry, you mentioned that mortgage would be down in the fourth; and you talked about into the quarter how it would have a nice leap. I'm just wondering. It looked like the gain on sale margin was quite high. I'm calculating 150. Can you walk us through the mix of refi versus purchase and what you're expecting in general for mortgage to do in the fourth quarter?", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. If you end up looking at the third quarter versus, for example, the second quarter, just to address your question related to the mix of refinancings, in the second quarter the mix was about 65% to 70% on the purchase side; and the rest of it was refinance, so let's say 35%. It was closer to 45% during the third quarter and we would expect that that refinancing mix will probably decline closer to 40% in the fourth quarter.", "So it is coming down based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again primarily sourced -- probably a higher mix through our retail banking system.", "So when you end up looking at the gain on sale in that margin, we're seeing in the third quarter a better margin than what we had experienced in the past. So the growth that we saw in the third quarter is a mix of higher production as well as higher margin. So you're right on.", "Ken Usdin", "Can you help us triangulate that to what kind of delta? You helped us understand the 20% to 30% up in the third; does that roll back off in the fourth or is it somewhere in the middle?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, I would say that it's probably somewhere in the middle, again, simply because of where the production is going to come from. When you have higher levels of production you're able to get better margins and pricing with respect to the product and therefore better margins as a result. But when we end up looking at the fourth quarter, we do expect the margin on production to be starting to taper a little bit, as well as production levels.", "Ken Usdin", "A second follow-up, just, Richard, you've made the point about the kind of set-your-clock-to-it seasonality. I was just wondering on the rest of fees generally, do you see just the same type of growth patterns happening as far as the ones that grow and the ones that typically don't? And just your general sense of the ex-mortgage, just fee businesses, any improvements underneath the surface there?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I'll let Andy answer that, but I want to tell you, Ken, we're a seasonally strong fourth/third quarter Company on revenue, also higher expenses in third and fourth quarter because of the CDC. But that's one of the reasons this can look like a consistent predictable outcome, but it's slightly different each time.", "Quarter 4 we like a lot for fees and I'll have Andy give you some color around that.", "Andy Cecere", "Right. The quarter 3 is the strongest quarter for corporate payments and then it tapers off a little bit. If you look at merchant and credit card issuing, I would expect a continued level of growth that you saw this quarter, the same-store sales in that 2%-plus, total revenue in that 3% to 5% like you saw this quarter. So I would see that same expectation, other than corporate payments which does tend to go down in the fourth quarter because third quarter is the strongest given the government activity. Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing.", "We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our primary funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion given money market reform; but our government bonds went up almost $9 billion. So how that settles out will also be impacted with fees here in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian", "Just a follow-up question on John's line of questioning, if I look at the 6% year-over-year increase in expenses in both 2Q and 3Q, Richard, could you help us break it down in terms of how much of that could be attributed to higher compliance costs and risk management costs and how much of that could be attributed to costs to invest for innovation?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. The breakdown is it's both. Let's start with just year-over-year running the Company this size. Your merit increases alone, say they are 3%, 3%-plus and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear we're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, five years ago this Company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx; this year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion and our run rate is probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million.", "That's good because it's appropriately -- because we're now more of a technology Company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be making those kinds of investments which of course will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation costs and the overall just running the Company better and spending money on things that we didn't used to spend money on. Like quality assurance which isn't related to the compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly.", "The compensation is entire; it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all categories. And sometimes we have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see over the long course of time.", "I'd like it to come down to over a course of time more like a 3% to 5%, because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably a third of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right we'll get the benefits of that. ", "Erika Najarian", "And just a follow-up question, in terms of Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like given that your binding constraint will be the capital conservation buffer. That shouldn't make any difference in terms of how you think about capital planning at your size or the need to scale up to your asset base in order to deal with a higher capital requirement. Am I thinking about that correctly?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, so let me take a stab at it and then Andy can add to it. When you end up looking at Tarullo's comments and then the impact to U.S. Bank, we don't really see that it's going to have a significant impact to either our capital distribution plan or the requirements that we have with respect to the minimum requirement. That is because of the fact when you end up looking at the capital depletion that occurs during the stress-testing process that capital depletion for U.S. Bank, given our risk profile, is lower than the 2.5% buffer that is already incorporated into it.", "So we think that our minimum requirement from a regulatory perspective is going to continue to be at that 7%. We don't see that technology changing a lot.", "Impact to peers? Probably the smaller peers, simply because of the fact that they don't have to deal with some of the qualitative aspects I think will be net positive to them. But we don't see a big change to it. So Andy?", "Andy Cecere", "And because of that, Terry, our current binding constraint is the standardized ratio under the base case and it will continue to be up.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "You talked a little bit about the shift that was coming in because of the money market change. But deposit growth just continues to outpace loan growth. 10% over the last year for you all is just incredible at this part of the cycle. So why is this? The deposits keep flooding back into the bank balance sheets. Where is the primary source of all that coming from, because it's across-the-board for most banks?", "Andy Cecere", "Marty, I think one of the principal reasons and both Terry and myself referenced it -- is money market reform. We saw ourselves about a $6 billion decline, some of it going to governments. But the industry saw about $0.5 trillion move out of prime obligation or prime funds. Some of that's moved into bank balance sheets and I think some of that will move back once the investment policies and so forth are adjusted to allow for floating NAV. But that is one of the key factors. I think the other factor is some of the movement between and among banks. Again, given ratings and some of the stresses that are occurring, we're getting a lot of deposits that are flowing to us from some of the non-U.S. banks and that has also been helpful.", "Marty Mosby", "The other thing, when you look at the mortgage servicing, this was an interesting quarter for mortgage because you had the production go up with refis, but you also had rates trickle up at the back end of the quarter. So your valuation on servicing was actually positive as well. That happens occasionally but not typical.", "When you look at the about $25 million that you had positive in valuation, but you also had prepayments that were coming through, so your actual cash flow increased the other adjustments of servicing value, how do you look at the net of those two things going forward in the impact to the mortgage banking fees in fourth quarter and then into next year?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, Marty, I think when we end up, at least with respect to fourth quarter -- because it's a little hard to look beyond that -- but when we end up looking at looking at the fourth quarter relative to the MSR hedge, we would expect that to taper a little bit as well. That would be another reason why we would expect the mortgage banking revenue to decline somewhat during the quarter.", "Marty Mosby", "But the other changes would also taper down, so that big negative you had there would be less negative as you moved into the next quarter as well.", "Andy Cecere", "That's fair.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo", "First, a follow-up from Investor Day, I wasn't sure about your appetite for bank acquisitions after that day. In other words, once you get the regulatory side resolved, are you willing to look a little bit more or not?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, sure. You can go back to, gosh, any of the 40 earnings calls I've had where we would remind you that we will more gladly double down in the 25 retail markets in states that we're in than to go into a new market where we would have lower pricing power and lower brand value. So think the Chicago deal a couple years ago, where we doubled down in Chicago. Think the New Mexico transaction; we moved in as number-three bank overnight. Those kind of opportunities will continue to be attractive to us.", "The idea of moving into a new market that we don't currently have a position in would have to be remarkably attractive and it would have to be at a pretty high market position to get our attention. So the good news is, despite the fact that we haven't got the ability to do that right now, there's nothing out there that we wish we could have had and the timing is working out pretty well. But when that opportunity is back, you can well count on us looking in-market for sizable deals that are worth disrupting the momentum of the Company -- but in markets where we're already present.", "Mike Mayo", "Then a separate question. Your last comment at Investor Day, maybe I can call it the Richard Davis soliloquy.", "Richard Davis", "Well, I don't know. Now what? Me and the 10-year bond? What is it now?", "Mike Mayo", "Well, you go, look, banking has this remarkably noble opportunity to change the world; there's no other business I can think of. We don't feed people or fly people or give them medication; we get behind their possibilities. And it goes on a little bit more. And just the disconnect between that statement talking about the noble opportunity of banking and the tarnish the banking industry has now, due to some issues around cross-selling and--", "Richard Davis", "Sure.", "Mike Mayo", "I'm just looking for some additional perspective from you. What are you doing to ensure this doesn't happen at U.S. Bancorp? And, more generally, when you do make a mistake and you say there's a guarantee, what do you do to fulfill that guarantee?", "Richard Davis", "I just want to start out by saying, we've looked at this whole topic as industry and individual bank. Many years ago at a financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation and rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that the American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry sadly doesn't speak yet as one voice and even to date still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand and eventually the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it.", "So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank; it's not an industry. So we'll figure out a way to tell that story better. In our Company, it's where you start that matters the most in terms of sales culture. And it's not even sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is part of that; the way you incentivize people is part of that; the way you handle your customers.", "So answering your last question first, the guarantee is to always stand behind what you promise, overperform if you've made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. In fact, as of this morning baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots, if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things.", "You know me, Mike. I've been with you as long as anybody on this call and we've never even use the word cross-sell. I don't even know what the cross-sell is at this Bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between two and four because nobody wants -- any part of their lifecycle needs more than probably two or four services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their lifecycle change needs and if we're their trusted partner they'll ask us for it. What that means is people buy our products; we don't sell them.", "As long as we have something they want and it's for services rendered and fees benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear, though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere, as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So, yes, it's tough on the industry. But it still always go back to people love their banker, they like their bank, because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're sadly years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, we've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back.", "And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative economic environment. One of the reasons banks were possible 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times are good banks are doing more positive things. People are healthier. The economy is moving more quickly. People want us and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we can just say yes more often; we're more popular and we're more effective.", "When times are tough, actually we move on to defense and we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either, because it's low-scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really does matter. So I do think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do and very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans and that is an amazing way to grow an economy. ", "So I'm going to still be in the camp of it will get there one day, but one bank at a time. We can control it on that basis and we're doing our best here to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about mortgage banking. In particular, you're mentioning the increase in refi activity. I would assume that the refi activity would tend to be more retail originations versus correspondent. So you probably had a positive mix shift this quarter. Was that a dramatic impact on the number and the gain on sale margin? And going forward, do you expect that mix shift to change as well?", "Andy Cecere", "It was a little bit more retail. And just generally speaking, the gain on sale margins on refinancings are higher than purchases, so that was also a factor. As Terry mentioned, we would expect the refinancing component to go down in the fourth quarter as well as the overall volume. If you look at just the last few years, historically in a normal environment fourth quarter activity is down 10% to 15% because it's just fourth quarter; and new purchases particularly are down.", "So I would expect that same trend. And we will update you at further conferences during the quarter to give you an update what we're seeing, because it's also very dependent upon rates, particularly at that level of the yield curve which is quite an impact to activity for the fourth quarter.", "Kevin Barker", "We're also seeing in the servicing market the market for MSRs softening and so the yields on those assets are going up. Are you seeing an opportunity to get better margins in the correspondent market and that support your overall gain on sale margin? And are you potentially participating in the purchase of MSRs?", "Andy Cecere", "We're not going to participate in the purchase of MSRs. We're in the correspondent market. It depends on the geography and the type of loan. I would say some of it is very competitive in terms of pricing and some of it a little less competitive. So it depends on the mix.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran", "Maybe on the auto business, I realize it's not a huge part of your loan book; between the loans and leases maybe 9% or so of the book. But it's been a source of growth. You outlined a couple years ago some ambitions for market share improvement which you seem to have achieved. I wonder if you could just talk about further appetite for growth both in loans and leases.", "And then in terms of the credit quality, you had the comment in the release about lower residual gains. The appendix does show delinquencies rising, albeit from pristine levels. Is the performance you're seeing in line with what you had penciled out when you wanted to grow this book? Or is there a deterioration happening? Or how should we think about that?", "Andy Cecere", "Brian, this is Andy, I'll answer those questions. First of all, the volume continues to be strong. It's a function of our dealer partnerships and the technology investments that we've made in the business. It's a good mix of lease as well as purchase. I would expect us to continue to have partnerships expand and continue to see strong growth. I'd also mention that we do not do any subprime activity in this business and we in fact have very conservative credit standards both in terms of term as well as the credit quality underneath it.", "So it is a high-quality portfolio and I'm very comfortable with the credit. One phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace is residual values are coming down a bit. That's a function of dealer incentives going up which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new. That means that the gain on sale is still positive, but might have been somewhere in the $1000 range, it's closer to $600 or $700. You'll see that phenomenon occur through our fee income category. Again I want to highlight it's still positive; it's just less positive.", "Brian Foran", "Maybe one follow-up, and just to get the spirit of the question right, it's not to pin down basis points and the efficiency ratio, but just to make sure it's the right base. For 2016, it sounds like efficiency will be a little higher; the ratio will be a little higher in 4Q. And then I'm assuming we're using the adjusted 2Q number. So as we think about slightly positive operating leverage with a couple rate hikes or maybe flat without, is the base 55%? Basically 55%?", "Richard Davis", "Okay, so you are trying to get the basis points. Look, this year it's going to look back, it's going to be in the mid-54%s. If we can deliver positive operating leverage -- and I said slightly -- then it stays in the mid-54%s. If we're unable to do that, it floats into 55%. Doesn't go above the mid-50%s and it doesn't go down to 51%. Until the world starts to give us a more robust both interest rate trajectory, mostly a steeper yield curve and/or just a stronger economy -- pick any of the three and pick all of the three -- things start to take off.", "So I'm going to say it as just much -- and expense is much of what you see this year, it's much of what you'll see next year. It's not going to move a lot one way or the other for better or for worse. But I will tell you it's the revenue that we're going to try to hope we can pull down even further into in 2017 and keep growing this thing like we do every year. We had record EPS this year. It's not just because we had a decent buyback but because we have good underlying loan quality and good underwriting and really decent revenue. So we're going to keep delivering that, Brian. And I would just expect it to be fairly consistent with what you see this year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.", "Jason Harbes", "It's actually Jason Harbes on Matt's team. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe I'll just ask a question on the card business. You've seen really nice momentum there this year. It looks like a lot of that is on the back of a Fidelity portfolio acquisition late last year.", "One thing that caught my eye was the net charge-off ratio was unusually low both sequentially and year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of the higher quality of that Fidelity book? Because I'm looking at the reported level compared to your normalized through-the-cycle target of 4.65% and it's quite a bit below. So just any comments around how your credit card business is going would be much appreciated.", "Andy Cecere", "This is Andy again. Yes, that is the key difference; the Fidelity portfolio is slightly higher quality. Our card portfolio is very high quality, but the downturn that you see in that charge-off level of delinquencies is a function of the higher-quality Fidelity portfolio.", "Jason Harbes", "Maybe just a bigger-picture question on the expense outlook for next year, this year it looks like you're going to come in a bit above the 3% to 5% target. A lot of that seems like it's related to some of the remediation activities that you are undertaking. But as we think about 2017, would it be realistic to think you might actually come in more towards the low end, as those costs or issues are resolved?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, Jason, one of the things that we've talked about when you think about the compliance programs -- and it ties into some of the things that Richard talked about with respect to AML and BSA -- we'll continue to work on that probably through next year. Last quarter we said that the compliance costs were peaking in the second quarter, but we also said that we really don't see them declining significantly, at least not through 2017.", "In other words, I would think about it more as it's kind of plateauing and it's going to stay at that level at least for some period of time until we get through some of these compliance issues. So if you're thinking about the 2017 time frame, that's the way that I would think about it.", "Operator", "Your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, Richard. How are you?", "Richard Davis", "I'm good. I was wondering where you were.", "Nancy Bush", "Still here in Georgia.", "Richard Davis", "Well, you were on the Morgan Stanley call; I know you love them more.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes. Yes, you could have brought up the -- you opened the door with mentioning election and Brexit and some other things. But I'm just more curious about your view of the regulatory scene right now. It seems everybody is focusing on Tarullo's latest speech or what a Fed governor is saying and we're losing sight of the forest for the trees. So can you just give me your impression of the overall regulatory scene? And do you expect it to change markedly one way or the other depending on the outcome of the election?", "Richard Davis", "First of all, I think -- and I said this at our Investor Day. I think if we're a nine-inning game, we're probably in the eighth inning. We know most of the conditions. We know the condition on the field. We know the umpires. We know the fan attitude. We know the weather. We know the ball speed. There's not a lot here new. And there will be some adjustments to the election, but as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables; and think the FDIC and the OCC to name two.", "So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules and what we're dealing with now is nuances, why certain speeches make so much attention, because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they changed anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. ", "The other one is a lot more of the same and probably, whether we like it or not, is something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing and that makes sense to me and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight.", "In fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven for the most part to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people. Because they now know that we're stronger; they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can prove that over the course of the next couple years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationship with regulators both local and national that we know and trust. And for us it's part of doing business and I think it's a normal course of running the bank. We don't fret about it and we don't try to predict anything.", "Nancy Bush", "Well, on this issue of culture, how do you see that coming to the fore? Is that going to become a special -- does that get built into the DFAST? How do you see that happening?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, that's a good question. That's too early to know. I do know and I believe it's known, that the OCC is conducting a horizontal review, first and foremost starting immediately on unauthorized new accounts. They are doing that horizontally. I don't know how far it's going but it's the first of -- look at more things like incentive practices and then will be, I think, eventually culture. We're thinking of it as culture and we always have from the very beginning. But I think, Nancy, that will find its way probably through more likely the OCC under the doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks. And then the Fed for the Fed banks will find their own way to approach it.", "I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern and practice for the CAMEL ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight. So for me I think it's just another nuance and we keep getting different things. It's a spotlight on a stage, right? Everything is on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight is on. It's just going to move across and now find something in the form of culture.", "I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do. I think we're going to have to prove what we do. And I think we're going to have to show sustainability to good practices and that does require us to do a lot more record-keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance. I would say it's actually a pretty good thing, because most banks do it very, very well.", "And I think we're going to find out that that's an area of strength that we can showcase, that banks haven't been able to really put their finger on until now. Unfortunately, it takes a blemish to bring out the issues, but I think you'll be -- the American people will be quite pleased with what they find.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. One other regulatory issue, the fact that the EU seems to be backing away from Basel, do you think that will change anything? Does that make any difference? Do we not go to Basel IV? What do you think the impact of that is?", "Richard Davis", "I don't predict that one as well, because I do think this one does matter a lot in who's in a position. I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what volatile means to the United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position I don't think it goes away and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best, strongest, position first and foremost -- but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general level of oversight.", "If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight; and we're all getting there at different speeds.", "So I think it's probably still the best proxy and I don't think it changes greatly. I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going to be adopted or things are going to be changed is just that, it's a small nuance. I think we're all going to stay within the confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice and then America being probably the loudest.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you for listening to this review of our third quarter results.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern standard time through Wednesday January 25th, at 12 midnight Eastern standard Time.", "I will now turn the call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at USBank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you, Jen. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. While the economy was challenging, and often unfavorable in 2016, it was a good year for U.S. Bank.", "As you can see on slide 3 of the presentation, we reported record net income of $5.9 billion and record earnings per diluted share of $3.24 for the full year. Our 2016 return on common equity was 13.4% and our efficiency ratio was an industry leading 54.9%.", "We reported strong loan growth and strong deposit growth and we returned 79% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. I'm also pleased with our fourth quarter results which are highlighted on slide four.", "In the fourth quarter reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Healthy balance sheet growth supported 2.1% sequential growth in net interest income and strength in fee businesses such as payments and trust drove 3.9% noninterest income growth, compared with the year earlier. Credit quality remained stable in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to slide 5, our profitability metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. In the fourth quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.1% and our efficiency ratio was 55.3%.", "Terry will now provide more details about our fourth quarter results. Following Terry's remarks, Andy, whom we announced yesterday will assume the CEO role at the April shareholder meeting this year, while provide some insights about our opportunities for growth in the current environment. Terry?", "Terry Dolan", "Thank you, Richard. I'll start with the balance sheet review and then discuss our fourth quarter earnings trends. Turning to slide 6, you can see our loan and deposit growth trends, average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 6.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 or 5.6% excluding a credit card portfolio acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.", "In this years fourth quarter, the linked quarter growth and our increase in average loans was led by a rebound in growth in average total commercial loans of 1.6% and strong growth in several consumer categories. As expected and in line with industry trends, residential mortgage loan growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting both seasonal factors and a slowdown in refinancing activity driven by higher rates.", "Also commercial real estate mortgages were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of '16, as customers paid down mortgages and evaluate the potential of policy changes and the outlook for rising rates.", "Total average deposits increased 11.8% compared with the fourth of 2015 and were up 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. The sequential growth was highlighted by a 3.5% linked quarter increase in non-interest-bearing deposits.", "Turning to slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable for the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, up one basis point compared with the third quarter and flat with a year ago.", "A seasonal increase in our credit cards net charge-off ratio offset declines in commercial and commercial real estate net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets decreased by 3.7% compared with the third quarter. Improvement was driven by commercial loans, residential mortgages and other real estate.", "And while NPAs increased 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2015, NPAs as a percentage of loans, plus other real estate rose just one basis point to 59 basis points. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter to support loan growth.", "I'll move to earnings results. Slide 8 provides highlights of fourth quarter results versus comparable periods. Fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion was down 1.6% compared to the third quarter. The fourth quarter is seasonally lower from a fee revenue perspective each year and this year was no different.", "On slide 9, you can see that total revenue increased by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter and grew 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth, funded by strong deposit growth and strength across our fee businesses.", "Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by 2.1% compared with the linked quarter and was up 4.6% compared with the prior year. Linked quarter growth reflected 2.1% on average earning asset growth and a stable net interest margin. The benefit of higher rates to loan yields was offset by higher average cash balances and lower yields on security purchases and reinvestment rates on existing securities.", "Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income which declined by 0.6% versus the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and a 24% decrease in mortgage banking revenue.", "The mortgage banking revenue decline was in line with our December guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income increased by 3.9% driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue.", "I'll highlight a couple of items within noninterest income, merchant processing revenue grew 5.6% on a year-over-year basis, adjusting for the impact of currency rate changes Trust and investment management fees increased 9.5% year-over-year, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, along with account growth, an increase in assets under management and improved market conditions. Given the recent increase in the short term rates the impact of fee waivers in 2017 will be minimal.", "Turning to slide 12, noninterest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter, in line with our expectation. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest expense increased 6.9%. The primary drivers for the increase on both a quarterly and year-over-year basis were higher compensation expense, professional services expenses and other noninterest expense.", "Compensation expense reflects hiring for business growth and compliance programs, including addressing the AML Consent Order and DOL implementation. We believe the trajectory of cost for these programs is stabilizing.", "As a reminder, professional fees and other expense are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter other noninterest expense was driven by higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects which abates somewhat in the first quarter of 2017.", "I'll finish with a look at our capital position. Turning to slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.1% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%.", "Our tangible book value per share was $18.70 at December 31st, up 7.2% from a year ago. In the fourth quarter we returned 81% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Terry. I'd like to provide some insights into our thoughts on how we are positioned for growth in the current environment. For the full year 2016, average loans increased by 6.9% and we think are the full year 2017, a 6% to 8% growth rate is very achievable. We expect the pace of growth is likely to be more weighted towards the later part of the year as customers become more comfortable with the economic future post-inauguration.", "In the first quarter, we expected loan growth to be similar to the linked quarter growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, as customers consider the implications of potential policy decisions and tax decisions of the new administration.", "We also expect relatively flat growth in residential and commercial mortgage loans as seasonally slower growth and credit card balances. Coming out of the first quarter, we are optimistic that an improving economy will spur more consumer activity, which will help both our payments businesses and our consumer lending businesses and improved economic backdrop should also result in increased business spending on development and capital investments, and we are well positioned to capture our fair share of that lending and fee activity.", "Given the improving interest rate environment, including the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin or the NIM will expand modestly in the first quarter. We look for mortgage revenue to decrease 10% to 15% in first quarter, in line with an expectation for lower refinancing activity, reflecting both seasonal trends and the impact of higher market rates.", "We expect expenses to decline slightly on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally lower professional fees and a decline in tax credit amortization expense, resulting in a relatively stable efficiency ratio.", "Finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable.", "I'll now turn the call back to Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Andy. And I'm proud of our record fourth quarter and our full year 2016 results. We've maintained our industry-leading performance measures and reported a 17.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter, and an 18% return for the full year.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, and Bill Parker and I would now be happy to answer any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Good morning. Good morning, Richard and Andy. Congratulations to both of you on yesterday's announcement. I was just wondering\u2026", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "John McDonald", "Just wondering, Richard, if you have any additional color to share on what drove the timing of the decision to do the transition now. Obviously it has been well-planned but just what drove the exact timing? And then also what exactly will be entailed in the role of Executive Chairman for you going forward?", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, John. I know you all be disappointed, you can't kick me around anymore, that\u2019s the number one goal. First of all, this was very well telegraphed and I want to thank you for setting it up that way.", "You know, I hit my 10 year anniversary as the CEO of the bank last month and many years before that I conferred with the board and our senior leaders and told them that I had a couple of thoughts that attended to that notion, that at 10 years I think it's the right time for a transition. I think that's for any company of any type and it seem that we are about three years away.", "Second point, John was that our success was sitting right here. Andy, was clearly becoming the perfect person to lead the company based on his talents and his skills. I had worked with him seven years as a partner at that point and I want to make sure that as a board, and as a CEO we telegraphed him, first of all, that he was a candidate and it was up to them to make that final decision and that the candidacy wouldn\u2019t come eight years from now you know, when I am 65 and hi is 62, and it seemed appropriate that we lockdown that succession as soon as we could and that we started that process privately back then.", "And then equally important to me, but it's just a personal thing for me, I want to do something else in my life that\u2019s entirely different. I call it a calling, if you will, I don't exactly know how to explain it. And I know it's a little odd to have a 58-year-old healthy CEO leaving and to go nowhere.", "But that's really what it is because I'm not leaving this company, I'm handing it over to a great management team, and a great leader and I'm looking forward to being successfully part of it the future as an advocate and a exclusive partner in this part of the banking environment. So I'm really going off to do something uniquely different and I'll see what comes about in the next few months.", "As you know I'll be the CEO for another 90 days until April 18th and I'll be full in on that job until which time our shareholder meeting in Nashville will hand over the reins. I'll then step up to be the Executive Chair. And what that means, John is really what I am now. So I think of it this way, I had three titles two years ago, I gave Andy one of them last year, I'm giving him another one in April and I am keeping the last one because I am selfish.", "I am going to chairman for a while until the transition is ensconced and complete in both the Board and the Street, you guys are comfortable that we've made that transition and its my hope that there is a lot of continuity and sustainability of what we did and yet I also hope Andy feels the permissions to do what he needs to do and make adjustments into the future.", "So as a Executive Chair we're not telegraphing that we're separating the titles of Chairman, CEO permanently or just doing it because we would do that in any succession. We think that's one of the best practices.", "And then in the future whenever I move away and the Board has a decision either merge the two titles again or not and that\u2019s the decision we don't have to know or telegraphed now because we don't have that decision afoot.", "So hopefully that\u2019s clear and I'll be working with the lead director as a partner and that's what happens when you have an executive chair and a lead director, we'll work together with Andy to guide the board and to give him guidance to manage the company.", "John McDonald", "Okay, great, that is super helpful. Thank you, Richard. And just a follow-up then on expenses. When you think about the year, it seemed like 2016 for U.S. Bank was a year of kind of digesting maybe an above average expense drag. You mentioned a few things like DOL, consent order, it seemed like there were some compliance costs, maybe some stepped up investments.", "Just wondering as you look at the operating leverage dynamics for 2017, does it get better from both ends with higher rates helping revenues and maybe easier comps on expenses? Could you flesh that out a little bit?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, I will and then I'll give to Andy to color. The answers is yes, you are right, I work from both ends. Look, I'm more disappointed than anybody that we hit that 55% efficiency ever. It\u2019s a reality, its something that we needed to do.", "A big part of that is the AML Consent Order and you know I think most banks are probably dealing with some form public or private of the consent on the issue for AML and so a remarkably expensive process. I mean, remarkably, and we underestimated that, but we're able to handle it as we go forward.", "As Terry said that\u2019s stabilizing now only to mean that it's peaked, but also mean, we don't know when it starts to come back down, but it will definitely come back down because it's got and end point, its a consent order. I will say that that's a fair amount of the number that's moved us from what might have been 53 or 54 to the 55 and we'll see that come down.", "DOL is also a time vested event that will come and go by middle of this year and we said before we're investing heavily into it. We've got a great partner. We believe we've got the right solution and no matter what happens in Washington, we would do this anyways. So it's not bound by any kind of regulation or changes that might occur.", "So those are two big enough issues that have taken our efficiency ratio, our expenses up a little higher than we like, but we think that they sustain and they start moving down. And then you know as well as anybody, the fact that the interest rates are starting to move and that the curve is steepened, while that\u2019s the other benefit. And so on both ends let's call this and probably this quarter which should be pretty flat on efficiency, probably the high water mark and then we'll get back to places you expect us to be.", "The other thing that\u2019s sitting underneath those numbers is this remarkable cost of innovation and technology and we can talk about it until you guys stop listening, but it will only show itself in the future when you'll see which companies really made those investments and we're ready to jump to a new kind of real-time payments, mobile environment and those that didn't, we are one that is.", "And so are capital expenditures are right now and again this year, probably twice what they were many years ago, and probably half again what they need to be in the future years, but we're spending that kind of money to get this thing ready for this environment, its going to change pretty quickly.", "That is also a time bound issue where that CapEx starts to come down, probably this will be another peak year and then we'll start moving down. So everything moves back to getting into the low 50s without a lot of work, but with time passing. Andy, do you want to\u2026", "Andy Cecere", "And I'd Richard. So as you said we expect two rate increases in '17 mid year and in December, given that and the expectation for the stronger economy, plus the brand and innovation investments we made. We expect accelerated revenue growth in 2017 and positive operating leverage.", "John McDonald", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "Richard Davis", "Morning, John.", "John Pancari", "Morning. I just want to get a little bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of loan demand and borrower appetite post the election. And where are you seeing strengthening? Is it in certain markets like in some of the borrower appetite in the Midwest given some of the manufacturing implications or is it some of your other markets? Thanks.", "Andy Cecere", "John, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Bill for a little bit more detail. So first I will tell you that there's more optimism and positive commentary for a lot of our business customers. But we haven't seen a significant change in utilization or actually take down of credit yet. So while the talk is there, the actual action is not yet shown itself.", "We do see a steady growth in middle market, small business, and a higher corporate loan growth, and auto is strong as is the mortgage activity. But again, because re-financings are down we will expect that to diminish.", "But again, the key point I would make is, we're not seeing huge changes. In fact, it's relatively flat in terms of the overall utilization rate and then there are couple of areas that we're choosing not to be as active in, and I am going to let Bill comment on that.", "P.W. Parker", "Yes, what is Andy is referring there is commercial real estate, we do see some of those markets as being sort of late stage credit cycle. If you look back, we had fairly robust growth in our construction, real estate construction book and that's slowing now, its even slowing with you know our client base, they are being more cautious. Multifamily is an area that if you look at the forecast, there are forecast, its pretty broad-based of potential rent declines in a lot of the major cities.", "So we're been more cautious there and then on commercial mortgages soft of the term portion we've been fairly flat to down in that area and there is very aggressive competition for long-terms, fixed rate, limited covenants, to no covenants, non-recourse and that\u2019s just not a market that we play in. So that's one area where we're just to going to see lower growth based on what the business we do.", "Richard Davis", "You know, John, this is Richard. We've been here before 10 years ago when we started to see the bifurcation of loan growth by different appetites, by different banks and it always sounds a bit like a hollow victory to say, we're just not to be as aggressive, we're not going to fight on terms, we're not going to fight on tenor, we're not going to do certain kinds of kinds of loans and it might sound a little bit of an excuse, but it's really part of the strategy and it\u2019s the thing we're going to stick with, we're not changing that approach.", "I'll give you an example, commercial real estate $43 billion portfolio, $17 billion of it is in small communities, because remember we're really kind of a community bank at heart and there's a lot of smaller banks that are doing some things that you guys aren\u2019t even writing about because you don't follow the small banks, but we're in the middle of that and we're not going to play.", "And while it be easier to give you guys some loan growth in certain areas, it won't be on terms or tenor or stretching or underwriting on any category. It will be on price because we've got that cost advantage, we're going to use that advantage where can. But when you do price you do it only for AAA kind of customers and then you have the higher quality customers who by the way in this last quarter also had access to the capital markets more than other customers and you'll see our capital markets, these are much higher than they were expected, while loan growth might have been on the low end of our range, its probably a good outcome because it reflects quality of our customers.", "So we're going to stick to that and that\u2019s kind of thing you won't see change. And while we might take a little heat because I know loan growth is a good proxy for a healthy bank, its got to be at the right quality, the right terms and we're just going to stick to our guns.", "John Pancari", "Okay, that is helpful. And then on that competitive point, I just want to get an update from you on a comment you made at a conference this past quarter around how much of the tax benefit could ultimately accrete to the bottom line.", "I think you had indicated that about 50% to 60% of any benefit that you do see from corporate tax reform could accrete to EPS. Is that still your thinking? Do you have any update there and any additional color you can get us on how do you come up with that general [ph] range? Thanks.", "Terry Dolan", "Sure, John. And this is Terry. So I mean, obviously there are still a lot that has to happen with respect tax policy both in terms of the amount of the rate and you know what ends up continuing to be deductible and all sorts of things.", "But when you think about the tax credit business, the tax credits will still be worth a hundred percent all the rest of that stuff. But you know the area that we would you know see an impact, I think is really related to the tax benefit that you get on the investment that you make in those assets. So basically the tax benefit on the shield.", "But to keep it simple, if we saw a tax \u2013 a corporate tax rate decline of 10%, we would expect our effective tax rate to benefit or go down by about half of that or about 60% of that. So think about five percentage points to 6 percentage points in that range, that's essentially what we would expect to see the change in our effective tax rate and its because of the various dynamics associated with how tax credits work.", "John Pancari", "Okay, so that is not any -- that doesn't factor in anything competitively like the expectation that some of this benefit could get competed away?", "Terry Dolan", "No, I know what you are talking about and we don\u2019t see that, that\u2019s not - I'm not predicting that that\u2019s going to be given back by the banking industry as a form of competition. This is just a singular event that could happen.", "By the way, I am going to a tax benefits unless you guys know something I don't, it\u2019s really has to go with the budget process. So this is probably more a late '17, '18 issue, much as we all want to be immediate. And I think that's one of the reasons customers were also a customer of others are holding back on some final decision. So we see what and when things happen in taxes is one of them.", "But we're quite efficient now, we're proud of where we are, so I don\u2019t want to be punished for having been more tax efficient than others, but it also means is a little less benefit if the most aggressive tax benefits accrue, we've get a little bit less of it, but its still a benefit of its starting point.", "John Pancari", "Got it. All right. Thanks again, and Richard and Andy congrats.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, John.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Elizabeth Graseck, Morgan Stanley.", "Richard Davis", "Morning.", "Elizabeth Graseck", "Hi. Hi, good morning. Thanks so much. Couple of questions. Just one as a follow-up on the compete away question that has been coming up on a bunch of calls. The corporates that you work with, the larger they get the more I think they are aware of how much wallet share and what the value is that they are providing to you.", "So I guess the question is why do you think that it won't get competed away given that it tends to be a pretty dynamic process in those discussions?", "Richard Davis", "I'll go first and then Andy can jump on. They do know their wallet share. By the same token part of it is by design because they've learned over the years they want to be double or triple down with one partner, right. So first of all, they have \u2013 and need to have more than one partner in and above just from competition and rate.", "Second thing is, if you look at the way the industry is handling the rate increases that relates to the liability side of the balance sheet, right, we're a little smarter this time and we're not giving it all the way immediately and we're not \u2013 we're not colluding either because we never talk. But we're also being very careful and thoughtful about protecting what needs to be a wider range between the cost of liability and the cost of asset and if that behavior continues, I think the same action comes with taxes where we'll find it, we do it in pricing and yet the world still reasonable and aligned.", "And I think with taxes its going to be the same thing, we're all going to want to do our very best to protect what benefits our companies and help our customers do well, but company is one we're like to bank that and find it another forms, particularly in credit quality and in cost of funds.", "So I am saying others won't try it, but we also never really been competing on that level. If somebody wants to compete on price, bring it on because we can beat him every day for the highest quality customers.", "Andy Cecere", "And to that point Richard, you know we already have the advantage of best rated bank which gives us a plenty of an advantage, which will already advantage in terms of getting new business and or achieving higher return. So that's the other component to it.", "Elizabeth Graseck", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe I could also ask a separate question on the NIM outlook. I think, Andy, you mentioned expand modestly in -- was it 1Q '17 or 2017? But just wanted to tie that in with the commentary on this deck where you talked about how the reinvestment rate on securities was lower.", "Just wondering if that\u2019s the angle with which a higher reinvestment rate on securities is going to drive that expand modestly. Maybe you could help me understand if that is the case and how much expand means when you say expand modestly?", "Andy Cecere", "So Betsy I'll start then hand it over to Terry. On the expand modestly it was a comment specific to the first quarter, it related to both the increase in LIBOR and the short term end of the curve as well, as long-term end of the curve and its principally around loan pricing and deposit pricing.", "The investment security portfolio, sort of stabilization occurs little about mid-year and then that would be beneficial towards the end of the year. And Terry anything you'd add to that?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. When we talk about reinvestment rates as Andy said, when we get to the end of the first quarter, into the second quarter, you know, we start to see that inflection point, so that will help the margin. And you know we - as Andy said earlier, you know we plan for a rate hike, December of last year, June and then December.", "And so you know we think about the margin first quarter it will expand modestly and then it will probably accelerate a bit from there.", "Elizabeth Graseck", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then last question -- on the impact of the stronger dollar on your merchant processing business and elsewhere if it is material, but I think it is mostly there.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, it is mostly there. So our stated revenue growth Betsy was 2.8% year-over-year and excluding the FX impact it was about 5.6%. So everyone 1% or whatever the currency is about a $1 million a year.", "Elizabeth Graseck", "Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Betsy.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Siefers", "Morning, guys. First, Richard and Andy, congratulations to both of you, well-deserved\u2026", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Scott Siefers", "I guess first question on the expenses, I appreciate the commentary for the full year on operating leverage and expenses. Just hoping you guys might be able to put sort of a finer point on the slight drop in costs you expect in the first quarter.", "I guess as I look back over the last few years the magnitude of drop into 1Q, it used to be much more significant I would say but it has gotten lesser as we have gotten more recent. Just curious if you can maybe give us a sense for order of magnitude of what you would expect that drop to be.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. So this is Terry. So when we end up looking at the first quarter you know, we would expect that drop to be about in the percentage point kind of range. But you know, the drivers behind that is that professional services fees are always seasonally high in the fourth quarter and included in that are compliance costs related at DOL and other things, which will start to abate in the second, third quarter. So some of those compliance cost, specifically related to DOLs start to go away.", "And then of course the tax credit amortization that we have in the fourth-quarter is always seasonally high in the fourth quarter and it comes back down to normal and remember last quarter we gave some guidance around how much that might go up, I think it was about $60 million and that will all go away, but you know - probably about 60% of that will abate in the first quarter. So those are the biggest drivers in terms of why we see expenses going down.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears to the fee side. Terry, can you give a sense for what the dollar level of the equity investment income was in the fourth quarter? And I guess just to the extent possible, I know that is a volatile line, but your sense for what a typical level might be going forward?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, in terms of equity investments, when we think about fourth quarter, you know, its probably I am going to say $20 million to $30 million higher than what we had seen in the third quarter, fourth quarter is probably more of what I would say normalized sort of level.", "So when you think about equity investments on a go forward basis its probably going to be comparable to the fourth quarter when we think about the first quarter.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay. All right. That\u2019s good color. Thank you guys very much.", "Terry Dolan", "Thanks so much Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, Marty.", "Marty Mosby", "Hey. Congratulations on the shift and the evolution of the management team there.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "Marty Mosby", "And Richard, what I wanted to ask you was as you take on the role solely of Chairman of the Board and working with your lead director, will you still take on most of those responsibilities? Because that is a large share of what you do when you have CEO and Chairman is you have a lot of activities just working with the Board, making sure that that process is going. So that relieves a lot of burden from what Andy would have to do initially as he takes his new responsibilities.", "Richard Davis", "Marty, you nailed it, that\u2019s exactly why the transition is we think best practice because it affords me chance to work with the board and make sure that Andy is got the time and energy to work with the management team and to work on the issues.", "I will not be in the day-to-day management of the company because that's also a best practices to stay out of running the company, but to help him with the board side of it. And I'll be an ambassador of company, I'll do whatever he needs me to do, I can go places for him if he needs me to.", "I am not going to go on TV a lot, I am not going to talk about as the ex-U.S. Bank CEO, I am not going to do that because the voice has to be his and the current management team. But you got it right and when the transition is satisfactorily complete and the board and I and Andy feel that we made successful transition then will move it to the next step and they can decide where the chairman position lies, but it will give Andy the time to get focused on all the right things to run the whole company.", "Marty Mosby", "And then Andy and Terry, when you are -- one of the things in the release that has been consistent across all of the bank so far, which is to me the biggest surprise, is that deposit growth is continuing not just to be relatively strong but in your case was actually picking up as we have kind of gone into rates starting to move up a little bit. And we would think some re-risking would be deploying some of this liquidity back into the system.", "I'm just trying to figure out where all that deposit growth is coming from, because, like you said, your deposit betas are going to be tied to what is happening on your deposits. And right now it is continuing to grow which gives you a lot of flexibility on pricing.", "Andy Cecere", "So Mary, I'll start and Terry will add on. So I am going to say three areas of focus, why we're growing deposits. First of all in the wholesale side and as continuation of us taking market share and along with that market share is new customers who have deposits.", "Secondly is our corporate trust business. Corporate trust is a great business. It's very high return, great fee business, but importantly it also generates a tremendous level of deposit activity and we're growing that business both domestically, as well as in Europe and that's very helpful.", "And thirdly is the retail core basis. As we continue to take market share and this is one of the things we talked about being very prudent around branches. While its true that we consolidated 40 or 50 branches in the last couple years. We've done that very thoughtfully in a manner that says we don't want to lose face. We want to optimize the footprint. But we don't want to lose customers or deposits and I think the deposit growth you're seeing is because of that manner of closure or consolidation which is very thoughtful. Terry, what else would you add?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, I would add maybe just two different things. One is that you know as corporates kind of waiting to see what happens from a policy perspective as they have cash and they are waiting to figure out how to deploy that, they are probably parking it a little bit.", "And then as we talked about in the third quarter [with money market reform, there was a fairly strong inflow of deposits in the third quarter, I am not sure all that has abated yet, as people kind of figure out what they are going to do from a money market standpoint in terms of government funds or whatever. So those are the other two things I would just add.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "Terry Dolan", "Thanks, Marty.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Marty.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Matt.", "Ricky Dodds", "Hi, guys, it is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team.", "Richard Davis", "Hey, Ricky.", "Ricky Dodds", "Just a quick question on - the goal is positive operating leverage. And if we don't see those two hikes that you guys have kind of built into your forecast is the goal of positive operating leverage still achievable?", "Andy Cecere", "It\u2019s more challenging. This is Andy. It\u2019s more challenging and we've always had great balance around making sure we're investing for the future and recognizing our short-term objectives. And we believe firmly we can get there with the two rate increases that I mentioned it will be more difficult, we'll have to continue to measure that balance of short term versus long-term, but it would more difficult.", "Richard Davis", "And Ricky, they are not equal because if we get the June one, another December, we're there. We get the December and not the June much harder. So - and I know there is a lot of work out [ph] that have a June, September, December, we're just using June, December projections right now.", "Ricky Dodds", "Got it. And then maybe an unrelated follow up on deposit betas. Obviously not a huge impact with the first hike. But as you think about more hikes what's your thinking there both on the commercial and consumer side?", "Richard Davis", "Yes, so I mean, and that\u2019s good way looking at in terms of commercial and consumer. So you in terms of the December rate hike and kind of what we're seeing right now its very similar to what we experienced a year ago in terms of the deposit beta. So kind of in the middle teens to upper teens is kind of in that ballpark.", "When we model it out, especially on a longer-term basis and so as we see rate hikes and if would see a June rate hike or December rate hike or maybe even the September rate hike, that will start to normalize. We typically model it in the 40% to 50% range in terms of deposit betas and then also from a modeling perspective, you know we assume that there is going to be some deposit disintermediation that would take place during that time because of economic growth.", "So that \u2013 that probably that kind of gives you some perspective and the price it will be more sensitive with respect to the wholesale deposits, our corporate trust deposits and it will on the retail side.", "Ricky Dodds", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Ricky. Operator?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, good morning, guys, and also congratulations to both of you. Can we talk a little bit about fees, understanding that the NII side looks to have a pretty good path to growth based on your loan and NIM comments?", "Can you talk us through what you think would be the lead driving forces on the fee side especially given that it looks like mortgage might be a more difficult comparison looking ahead?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, I'll start. This is Andy. The fees as you said, three component side highlight, number one is mortgage down 10% to 15%, number two payments. So our payments revenue this quarter on a year-over-year basis, up 4%, but actually about 5.5% excluding FX 5.3%, and we actually saw good growth in all three categories, the merchant acquiring, the card issuing, as well as corporate.", "So we would expect to see that to continue to grow, particularly as we see increased spend, both from a personal standpoint, as well as from a business standpoint. So that\u2019s a second category.", "And then final category I mentioned is our trust and investment fees, that is going to be partially leverage to a growing economy and continuing together investment activity in our private client, as well as our retail base overall. So those three categories, I think those two categories offset that mortgage category that we'll see growth in fees.", "Richard Davis", "This is Richard, Ken. Why don't you also give a little color, because that will also come up later, that from the payment side we don't chase volume for revenue and just like we don't chase loans for quality.", "Andy Cecere", "Right. I should mention, so and Elavon is the best example of that. So I mentioned that our core growth stated is about 2.8% and excluding FX it\u2019s about 5.6%. But what you see on volumes is actually decline in volumes and that\u2019s because we intentionally exited some very low margin large customers who were not profitable, and we did that intentionally, you'll see that impacting volumes, but you did not seeing impacting revenues and I think that is a great example we're trying to do this in a smart way.", "Ken Usdin", "And that was actually going to be my follow-up. So it looked like the credit and debit card comped a little bit harder year-over-year, whereas corporate and merchant, to your last point, started to look better.", "Are we near the point where you think that we can get all three of the individual lines of payments moving the right way on a revenue growth perspective? And if not what is still holding that back?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. And let me add, so Elavon as I mentioned strong growth on the revenue, same store sales up just under 4% driven by airline and fuel and that drove that 5.6 ex-FX revenue growth. Corporate card is two stories, number one is on the business side of the equation. We continue to see strong middle market, virtual pay, commercial freight payment growth and that\u2019s positive.", "But that was offset somewhat by government spending down a bit, sometimes that happens in the fourth quarter, we saw that occur this time. I think that will come back or flatten now, but that's what drove some of the lower growth activities you saw on corporate.", "And then finally on the card side, of the issuing side, our growth in fees was about 7.5% less than that excluding Fidelity, but it was also impacted by one last processing day in the fourth quarter which impacted growth about 1% or 1.5%. So those three things are what's driving it overall and as I said, I think all these categories we would expect to grow in 2017.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks a lot, guys. And best of luck. Congrats.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Ken.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Richard Davis", "Morning.", "Erika Najarian", "Good morning. Congratulations, Richard and Andy.", "Richard Davis", "Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Thank you.", "Erika Najarian", "Richard, we will sure miss you, but we are looking forward to having Andy at the top. So my first question, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the trajectory of regulatory-related costs are stabilizing. And you mentioned how expensive the AML consent order was and DOL compliance.", "I am wondering if you know, the stabilization seems like the natural trajectory of regulatory-related cost. But if we get some regulatory relief from the new administration is there an opportunity for reg costs to actually go down for U.S. Bank?", "Richard Davis", "The answer is yes. I wouldn\u2019t be this year and I'll say I'm going to be prognosticator here. But based on what I understand, the administration that's going to take office in a few days. The number one issues are health care reform, taxes and infrastructure and somewhere in the top five might be financial services, but it\u2019s not the top three, a lot of financial services issues I think will be dealt with in the early part of the year but with some implications later.", "So that\u2019s why I said earlier on DOL for instance, as we never made a bet on whether something would happen that would cause us to need to slow down because we want to be ready. We would do it anyway.", "So I think Erika the best thinking is that the understanding of what implications and lower regulation might happen will be known probably in the second half of the year and benefited in sometime in '18, but I'll also tell you but for things like an unusual consent order or an event like DOL transition, I think this bank has peaked on those costs.", "Our compliance costs in the entire company are now in terms of FTE, they are over 7000 people of our 70,000 and that\u2019s up more than twice what it was a few years ago. That\u2019s a little high because of these issues I just mentioned, but it's not going to go back to where it was, it\u2019s going to stay much higher because that\u2019s the cost of running a high-quality bank.", "We don't have issues other, but the AML issuance which has causes that kind of extra expense and so it\u2019s expecting that nothing else comes along. We will see that come down and whatever regulatory reform relief we do see. But most of it, I've got to say its going to be on the margin because most of the stuff is burdened in, its under run rate, it turns out a lot of its good operating policy and good compliance review tactics for double and triple checking and we're not going to give up a lot of that.", "So at least for this bank it\u2019s got a positive leaning toward improvement, its late in the year, if not next year and it\u2019s not going to be significant, but it will be part of it.", "Erika Najarian", "Great. My second question is for Andy. I mean it is pretty clear in terms of the 60% to 80% capital return that you target every year. I am wondering, given the stock is trading close to 3 times tangible book if you think about future CCARs, whether you will maybe prioritize the dividend heavier as you think about dividend growth going forward and maybe normalizing to pre-crisis payout ratios. And also how you are thinking about acquisitions, especially depository acquisitions, in terms of your capital strategy going forward?", "Andy Cecere", "So Erika, as you know our capital strategy is 30 to 40 and dividends, 30 to 40 on buybacks. We're at the high end on buybacks and at the low end on dividends right now I would think about as moving more to our balance perspective on that as we move forward and as we continue to look at the future years in CCAR.", "With regard to acquisitions, with the consent order in place right now we're precluded from traditional depository acquisitions. But we are doing things like you saw in the last year with Fidelity and IAG card portfolio acquisitions, we can do merchant acquiring to acquisitions and on trusted payments businesses. So that does not preclude us and that\u2019s actually area of focus.", "So I think that will be our focus in the short-term, once we're out of the consent order we may look at traditional depository, but that's not on focus right now.", "Erika Najarian", "Great. Thank you.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Mike. Mike, are you there?", "Operator", "And you maybe on mute on your end Mike.", "Mike Mayo", "Okay. Richard, the first question is why are you stepping down? I guess I am - I mean I am a little confused. I mean you are running a bank with best-in-class performance measures. You have been there 10 years, you are 58, I guess almost 59 and you had many other banks - have sometimes run banks with worst-in-class performance measures, have been there over a decade and they are a lot older.", "So what's going on? And also what does it mean when it says you will help move the Bank to new areas of business?", "Richard Davis", "So Mike, I don't if heard at the opening of the call, because I answer that question for John McDonald. That basically the reasons are, I said in place three years ago that at the 10 year mark, assuming nothing else that changed, that would be appropriate for a change in leadership because I just feel that way. It\u2019s my personal opinion.", "I indicated that Andy is the perfect candidate, he is sitting right here next to me, lets give him the signal, lets give him the time table and lets keep them. And thirdly, I do have another calling in life to do something entirely different, which I don't know what it is because I never felt permitted to look until the amount was passed and today will be my first day look into the future, along with my wife, but a very strong view that we want one more thing in life to accomplish and its going to be entirely outside the banking industry.", "So that\u2019s the reason and the rumors of my bad health or early demise are greatly exaggerated, I feel quite good today. And so that\u2019s timing for that and I don't know why some people stay longer. I don't know what the issues are in other companies. But mine was not the time it, mine was not to set this moment in time based on how the company is doing.", "It was three years ago to set a timetable that if at the 10 year [ph] market seems right and it now does, we've got everything lined up and the perfect guy to do it. And so that's exactly what it was and the board of course has all those decisions, I can't make any decision I want to on my own without their complete endorsement and they are very careful due diligence, which they did all of and they are quite excited about this transition as well.", "Mike Mayo", "And then as far as Andy, is this business as usual? Are you going to have some tweaks or strategic changes? Or what degree of change might you implement especially with Richard still as Chairman?", "Richard Davis", "Hanging around.", "Andy Cecere", "So like Richard and I've been together - Richard. I've been together for 10 years and the strategies and the decisions that we have made and the position the bank is a combination of all of us, the management committee and the two of us. So I don't expect major changes. We are continuing to focus on one bank from the perspective of the customer, the technology and innovation will continue to be an area of focus as it has been as things move digitally.", "And you know I would maintain that we are the best bank right now and I'm certain that we have one of the best management teams out there. So I couldn\u2019t be more honored and pleased to take this on.", "Mike Mayo", "All right, well, thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Saul.", "Saul Martinez", "Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning and congratulations on the roles. I wanted to ask you about the longer term guidance you had - you outlined at your Investor Day. And I think you guys have addressed it I guess in a directional fashion thus far, but sort of a broader question.", "You guys gave pretty expensive guidance on revenues, expenses, through the cycle provisions, business line growth. And obviously the backdrop has changed, we are kind of at an inflection in terms of - potential inflection in terms of the economic backdrop, regulatory backdrop and whatnot.", "But how are you guys thinking about the longer term guidance that you outlined today versus mid-September when you had your Investor Day? And where are you feeling more comfortable; where are you feeling less comfortable? If you could just kind of give us a directional sense of that.", "Richard Davis", "So Saul, as you know that guidance was based on a three-year view and that was a three year view of what we would call sort of a more normal rate and economic environment. I think as we sit today we're probably more comfortable about getting there in the three year window that we talked about, certainly from a rate perspective, and what we predicted as far as occurring, the economy seems to be at least steadier and slightly improving.", "And so I would say we continue to feel good about those projections and our expectations are still to get there in that three year window.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess more of a specific follow-up. I think last quarter you talked about utilization rates on commercial lines being around 25%, 26%. Any change there? Are you seeing any of the optimism from companies starting to filter through in terms of borrowing the pipeline for credit and whatnot?", "Richard Davis", "Saul, while the talk and optimism and discussion is more positive, the utilization rates are flat, still a 25% as they have been for the past few quarters.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Saul.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Richard Davis", "Morning, Kevin.", "Kevin Barker", "Good morning. Congratulations on the new roles for both of you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks.", "Kevin Barker", "I just wanted to follow up regarding some of your comments around the tax rates moving down to 5% to 6% effective tax rate. And obviously your reinvestment of some of those tax credits. Obviously it is very early in this discussion, we still have a ways to go before we figure it all out.", "Were there any specific line items around possibly low income housing tax credits or BOLI that you expect to go away? And at what level do you expect to have to reinvest those assets?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. So let me add, take a stab and I think your question was really around tax policy and tax credit sort of investments and then where we might see either changes in the nature or type of investment.", "So you know, we invest in really kind of four different areas. Affordable housing is a very significant part of it, new market or economic developments sort of tax credits is a second, a little bit of historical tax credit, but then also renewable energy.", "You know, when we end up talking to people that are kind of plugged into the tax credit kind of market, we don't see a lot of change coming with respect to affordable housing because of all the policy implications associated with that, or any economic development because when you think about what the administration is trying to do, they are trying to stimulate economic development.", "So we don\u2019t see a lot of change to that, probably where that change is going to occur will be with respect to renewable energy type of credits and you know to be quite frank the law had already incorporated a phase out of those over the next four or five years anyway.", "So we didn\u2019t really anticipate a lot of impact to us with respect to where we were going to invest and you know what the implications associated were going to be.", "Kevin Barker", "So when you say the 5% to 6% decline in the effective tax rate on a 10% decline in the actual rate with some reinvestment tax credit, depending on how that all plays out.", "If you were to see a 10% decline in effective tax rate would you believe that the decline in earnings would be close to 30% or 40% or do you expect - 30% to 40% of the 10% or something closer to 10% or 20% of the 10%?", "Richard Davis", "I mean, its in fact, I have implemented it isn\u2019t a decline in earnings, its actually an improvement in earnings because of the fact that we're paying less in tax expense as opposed to more. So in my example, our effective tax rate would go from 20%, 29%, down from there and that actually would be a positive from a probability standpoint.", "Kevin Barker", "Yes, what I mean is so with the tax credits, and what I am saying is if you had a 10% decline would it be a 5% to 6% improvement in earnings or would it be more of a 7% to 8% improvement in earnings?", "Richard Davis", "It would be - again, this is all the simple math, and et cetera, in terms of how I'm portraying it right now. But it would be a 5% improvement in our effective tax rate. So you'd have to kind of do the math from there, but its not a 5% improvement in earnings or anything like that. It's a 5% reduction in our effective tax rate.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay.", "Richard Davis", "Using the 10% example.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Kevin. Operator?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Vivek.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, Richard. Hi, Andy. Congratulations again. Let me add that. A couple of quick questions. Just one just for Terry, just want to confirm that when you said percentage drop in expenses in the first quarter that I heard it correct, that you are referring to 1% drop in expenses, Terry?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, we would expect on a linked quarter basis, it would decline about the 1% range.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Okay. Then the other line item that you said, I can't remember whether it was you, Andy. You said equity investment gains should run at the fourth-quarter level. What is the level of equity investment gains and also what is the amount of equity investments? And is that increasing because you have increased investments? Can you talk a little -- can you give us some color on this three items there?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. You know, other income represents a whole variety of different things that includes trading income and includes end of term and retail product revenue. It includes equity investments. It\u2019s just a whole variety of different things and they kind of move in sometimes in different directions.", "So it's really hard to kind of narrow it down to \u2013 and specifically equity investments and I wouldn\u2019t want to kind of take you down that path or mislead with respect to that. I guess my point is that you know, when I end up looking at other income and the impact of equity investments within other income, I think its going to be fairly stable relative to fourth quarter, that what I would tell you.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. And have you - what is the dollar amount of investment that you will have made in equity investments and has that increased recently?", "Andy Cecere", "It hasn\u2019t increased and it\u2019s not something we've kind of specifically disclosed in the past.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. One last quick one, AML. Are you - can you just give us an update on timing of when you expect to get out of that one?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Vivek, this Richard. We don't have timing on that. We're an OCC bank. so they are really our binding constraint. We are making great progress, we are moving forward. This is a bifurcated view I think on any consent order, one as you get to where you need to be, then you need to prove you can stay there for a while. Then they need to audit to confirm the sustainability.", "So you know we're in between stages one and two right now, so it depends on how long that will take. Back to Erika's question I do think that as regulatory reform starts to maybe lighten a bit, I think those kinds of issues move more swiftly and we might hope that there will be a faster conclusion from beginning to end on anything, any bank has been called out to improve because I think part of the issue is we're just in these issues for a very long time and maybe unnecessarily extended periods when the performance has actually been accomplished. The remedy is been done and it sustained and it just needs to long to prove it.", "So I think we've talked about this year being that year to get all those steps done, if I had to make a guess we're probably late this year or early into next year, but that's on my own guess and we're not [indiscernible] we're not you know another bank that has this issue, we're a U.S. Bank and we're dealing with our own issues and we're moving swiftly with our the regulator to OCC to prove to them that we've got the message, we've got the sustainability, and we're ready to move forward. But it's not imminent, but let's hope that it\u2019s not too much into the future either.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, thanks, Richard.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Thanks, Vivek.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.", "Richard Davis", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Winter", "Morning. You guys have had nice growth in the other earning assets, the excess liquidity with all the deposit growth. Any thought with the move up in rates to reinvest in securities? Or is it you want to hold onto it just thinking that deposits will outflow given the outlook for better loan growth?", "Richard Davis", "Yes. It\u2019s really couple of different things. We do expect it to really kind of abate again then we'll see deposit outflows occurring, which is why, especially in the fourth quarter we tend to hold the cash balances, we see a run-up in deposits with respect to - for our corporate trust business and then that ends up getting deployed in terms of structures, et cetera.", "If the economy moves up - starts to improve and businesses start to make those business investments that we expect, you know, we do \u2013 and we would see some disintermediation [ph] deposits at that particular point in time because where they we would start to see outflow there.", "Peter Winter", "Got it. And just a quick - just another question, housekeeping. You mentioned with the recent increase in rates that the fee waivers on money market accounts will be minimal in '17. Just what was that impact in '16?", "Andy Cecere", "So two years ago I had at its peak - this is Andy. The money market waivers were just about $100 million and we received back so to speak about 75% or 80% of it in 2016. So that's why Terry says there is limited amount remaining in 2017.", "Terry Dolan", "Right. And the vast majority of that we'll probably see in the first quarter and [indiscernible]", "Peter Winter", "Yes. Got it, okay. Thanks.", "Richard Davis", "Thanks, Peter.", "Operator", "Your final question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Richard Davis", "Morning.", "Terry Dolan", "Morning.", "Gerard Cassidy", "A question for you, on your loan to deposit ratio, average loans to average deposits is about 82%, what is the optimal level that you guys like to keep that ratio at?", "Terry Dolan", "We don\u2019t strive for an optimal ratio Gerard. We \u2013 it\u2019s a function of loan growth and demand and deposit growth and demand. So it's just an outcome, and if we have more than that some of it goes investment securities or cash, as referenced by Terry, if we have less than that we have plenty of funding opportunities of been a very highly rated banks. So we're not striving to a specific ratio, it\u2019s just an outcome.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay, thank you. Richard, you mentioned earlier in the call that you're sensing that the banks are smarter in terms of the deposit pricing. How much of an influence do you think that the industry's low loan to deposit ratio may have on that if at all?", "Richard Davis", "I don't know the answer to that, Gerard, but I know that the temptation already is been present if it was there. So the first couple of movies a year ago and now a month ago I think that based on the hunger for banks to do well that probably would have been as heightened and as an opportunity as possible. So I'm just of the mind that that temptation is past and people are very thoughtful and smart as we move up, obviously as rates get further and deeper beyond 25 basis point things will start to pick up.", "But the arbitrage between deposit and loan rates will start to get lighter which is good for banks and that's why people are betting that banks will do better in part. And I think we've just gotten smart, people are more thoughtful their balance sheet makes more sense to them and there is other lever to pull, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be one of them, it could be wrong.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then just a final question. Again, Richard, you touched on some of the regulatory aspects of what's going on in the industry and of course it is not the top priority of the incoming administration, as you have identified.", "We hear a lot about relief fees for the banks under $250 billion in assets from a regulatory standpoint. The so-called global SIFIs are not going to see as much relief. Can you point where you guys are positioned, obviously above $250 billion but less than a global SIFI, what would be ideal relief for banks your size?", "Richard Davis", "You know that's a great question because don\u2019t hate me for this answer, but we don't think there be a lot of changes even if we were given really. We're a very large company and systemally important has a lot to do with whether you would break the world of you fell apart.", "In our case we're very important wherever we are and I think most of the practices that we have been performing, particularly stress testing and recognizing where the risks are, those are better practices and we're really good at it and we would keep a lot of those Gerard.", "So a lot of those would not go away, some of the relief would be in the consumer enforcement area. have long asked, I have pleaded with Rich Cordray to consider making the CFPB an endorsement agency, not an enforcement agency and I'm not being clever here.", "The idea that if they put out the basic tenets where the top-rated banks to be customer protective, plus pies customer supportive, financial literacy, do the right thing and they told us what those rules where, we would kill ourselves to be at that top-level. Everyday we do all we could to be positively vexed towards to getting better every day. And instead, there is undue sense that the enforcement side of the spirit comes from trying to catch up and do something wrong and not instead work to get better but try to find a mistake, many cases that were human error and in many cases that were even there when they were done. So that would be my favorite, that would be beneficial to all of us.", "We're 404 year - $450 million, we're not G-SIFI, but we're a SIFI and we're okay with that and we will come with it all the responsibilities would be that attend to being very, very thoughtful and your compliance above approaching your customer care and doing everything the right way as best you can and if you don't get it right as soon as you figure it out.", "So not a lot would change for us and you know we've actually not enjoying with some of the smaller regional banks and try to [indiscernible] because we just don't think it would change the way we run our bank.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great, appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Richard Davis", "Yes. Hey, before we close, since I might get to the last question, I just had a couple thoughts on the bank and the environment. We do believe that the rate environment, steeper yield curve that it was 90 days ago likelihood of interest rates, we think those are those are bankable. We think banks deserve that long overdue and it\u2019s going to get better. That's part of our modeling and we think that that's important.", "Economy being better is actually trumps all of that, a really good economy, reflection of what our customers feel and when that economy kicks and we hope it does that'll be more important than anything. But were disappointed as you might be to hear it, we are like canaries at mind, we can see balance sheets, we can see customer behavior, optimism is high, but actions are not present yet. So we're going to wait and see on that on. And then tax reform might at a big one that benefits us and our customers, as I said earlier, based on my understanding of the budget process it\u2019s probably going to be a late year issue.", "So I think bank should bank, you should bank on banks doing well by the interest rate environment. I think you should expect the economy and taxes to be to the best benefits that will improve bigger than right. But I think those come later in the year and we're balancing the bank to manage through slight beneficial quarter and two and a much more beneficial probably quarter three or four.", "And this is my last call, 41 of them. So I just want to tell you guys how much I appreciate as a class of investors and analysts you had been fair and thoughtful and balanced and you treated this company very well and I appreciate that very much.", "We've also in kind been and transparent. We've been very complete and thorough in our forecasting and think we've been as candid as we know how to be because we trust the relationship that we have you as part based on transparency and clarity.", "So I want to thank you for that relationship. I want to encourage you to keep that relationship with us. Terry and Andy will be a remarkable team, and despite the fact that I want things to change for the betterment this company, I think you'll be appreciative that they'll be thoughtful and measured and very well telegraphed.", "So to end an sport note because that\u2019s how I try to think of my life, this is rather like a great relay race and we're on the backside of track and Andy and I are running together now because he's about to pick up the baton, he is got the perfect cadence, I've got the perfect speed. Our hands come together, the baton hands off and we're off to another race and that exactly how you see it. So with that operator or Jen I think you can close the call.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, July 26 at 12 o'clock midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by discussing a few highlights from our second quarter earnings results. Terry will then go into some details and also provide you with forward-looking guidance, and after that, we'll take your questions.", "I'll start with Slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted share. You will see on the slide that our balance sheet is strong and growing, sequential loan growth came in at the high end of our guidance range at 0.9%. As expected, C&I loan growth picked up after a sluggish start to the year and gained momentum towards the end of the second quarter. Based on current trends we expect that by the third quarter total loan growth will be back to the 1% to 1.5% range we think that is more normalized.", "Credit quality remains excellent and we feel good about the risk profile of the loan portfolio. The net charge-off ratio was stable in the second quarter and our non-performing asset ratio improved on both, the linked quarter and year-over-year basis.", "Shifting to capital management; our book value per share ended the quarter at $25.55 which was up 4.8% from a year ago. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9.3% at 6.30 [ph], the level which is sufficient to support growth effectively managed through periods of economic stress and returned capital to our shareholders. In June, the Federal Reserve Bank notified us that they did not object to our capital plans submitted during the CCAR process. We subsequently announced the dividend increase of 7.1% and a new share repurchase program for the year.", "Now let me touch on our key performance ratios. We turn to Slide 4, our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.2%. We're proud of our industry cleaning profitability metrics that we're always striving to improve. Although consistently best-in-class, our efficiency ratio has been at the higher end of its historical range in the past few quarters, primarily reflecting increased personnel and technology cost related to the regulatory compliance programs. However, we are nearing the end of the build out of these programs and believe the growth rates of these costs will begin to moderate. We expect compliance costs to grow at a pace more in-line with the company's core expense space in late 2017 and into 2018.", "When we look out through the remainder of the year we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We further expect that the year-over-year non-interest expense growth will be in-line with our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. We believe that our strong balance sheet, diversified revenue mix and our focus on expense management combined with participation in some significant expense headwinds provides momentum for the second half for this year and into 2018.", "Let me stop there and turn it over to Terry.", "Terry Dolan", "Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends. In the second quarter average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago. Commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter increasing 2% sequentially. Line utilization has not increased materially, however, deal activity has strengthened and we continue to gain market share.", "As Andy mentioned, large corporate lending, there are momentum in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, throughout the quarter we continue to see strong growth in middle market lending across many geographies. Commercial real estate lending reflects our prudent approach to certain CRE segments such as multi-family and retail given current market conditions. We did have opportunities for growth in construction lending. However, remain cautious in commercial mortgage markets where the competitive environment has created unfavorable conditions from a risk and return standpoint.", "In addition customers continue to refinance commercial mortgages in the capital markets given the rising rate environment and opportunity to extend maturities. We had particularly strong growth in retail leases as far as up 11% linked quarter where both a prime lender and a less or in the auto segment and our well established market position, full product offering and a strong dealer relationships that provided strong growth in both lending and leasing. We have made significant investments in this business over the past few years which is coming to fruition in the form of increased market penetration with both dealers and manufacturers. We expect growth will remain healthy for the next few quarters as we continue to penetrate market.", "I want to emphasize that leasing growth is not coming at the expense of increased risk. If you look at Slide 6, credit metrics remain very stable in our retail leasing portfolio. We have not changed our underwriting in this business and are not enhancing residual values. I would also highlight that in the second quarter the weighted average cycle score on originations for auto leases was 782.", "Turning to Slide 7, total average deposits increased 0.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 7.7% on the year-over-year basis. Following the June interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit is in the mid 20% range. As future rate hikes occur we would expect the beta will gradually trend towards 50% level.", "On Slide 8 you will see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 49 basis points in the second quarter and non-performing assets declined by 9.8% on the linked quarter basis.", "I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income of $1.5 billion was up 1.8% compared with the first quarter but was down 1.4% versus the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2016 including two notable items; a $180 million Visa Europe gain in non-interest income and a $150 million non-interest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable contribution.", "Excluding these items net income increased slightly year-over-year. I will exclude the impact of these notable items when I discuss revenue and expense comparison versus the second quarter of 2016.", "Turning to Slide 10, revenue totaled a record $5.5 billion, up 3.1% on a linked quarter basis and 4.2% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago.", "Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3 billion in the second quarter, up 2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the second quarter the net interest margin increased one basis point to 3.04% in-line with our guidance. The increase was primarily driven by rising interest rates partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and higher cash balances which increased to meet certain regulatory expectations related to liquidity. We do not expect average cash balances to increase meaningfully from current levels.", "Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income which increased 3.9% versus the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher revenue, particularly in the payment services business. On the year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased 2% excluding notable items. Credit and debit card revenue increased 7.8% from a year ago on higher sales volumes. Merchant acquiring revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes.", "In the second quarter we exited two merchant acquiring joint ventures which did not have a material impact on the second quarter results but will mute revenue growth comparisons for the next few quarters. Divestitures were in part -- due in part to changing priorities of the joint venture partners that were impacting future growth and profitability portfolios for us. Mortgage revenue grew about 2.4% on a linked quarter basis but declined 10.9% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations.", "Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense increased 2.7% compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expenses. On a year-over-year basis non-interest expense increased 6.4% excluding notable items, were also driven by higher compensation and other non-interest expense. Compensation expense grew mainly due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as seasonal merit increases in higher variable compensation related to production. Other expenses increased primarily due to be impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.", "Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.3%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.", "I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the third quarter. Given recent trends, we expect linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range. Average earning asset growth will track with loan growth. We expect the linked quarter net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to the first quarter of 2017 which is within a range of four to five basis points.", "Let me take a minute to talk about merchant acquiring revenue. Last quarter we indicated that during the third quarter merchant acquiring revenue was expected to return to a more normal growth trajectory of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. The adverse impact on sales volumes from exiting certain large volume customers is beginning to dissipate with reported sales volumes increasing 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. Given the anticipated revenue impact from exiting the joint ventures, we expect year-over-year merchant acquiring revenue will be essentially flat in the third quarter. Growth will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter and then heading into 2018.", "As Andy discussed, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, a level we target as more normalized on a long-term basis. Finally, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to approximate 29% in the third quarter.", "Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks, Terry. Our financial performance gained momentum in the second quarter and we expect to continue to improve profitability and returns as we look in the second half of this year and head into 2018. From a macro perspective, corporate balance sheets are strong, consumer confidence is increasing and the evolving economic and regulatory backdrop has to promise to be conducive to growth. I just spent time in Washington last week and was very encouraged by the open and productive dialogue that has taken place; nonetheless, progress has been slower than any had hoped.", "While we have not yet seen evidence of a resurgence in the CapEx cycle, consumers are spending and businesses are active, and we continue to ensure across our geographic markets and business lines. We have a solid and growing revenue base and we believe we have reached an inflection point in expense growth. Importantly, the profit improvement that we expect will drive improving returns will not be achieved as the expense but at the cost of credit quality nor will be achieved at the cost of delaying prudent business investment which will be increasingly focused on technology and innovation.", "Finally, I want to thank our dedicated employees who work hard every day to be our customers and communities trusted financial partner. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks, good morning. Just following up on the expense, rate of change; it's good to hear that it's anticipated that quickly. So I just wonder if you can help us just to understand -- when you're talking about both, 3Q and 4Q getting back down into that three to five; what things are getting better and what things are you still having any inflation underneath the surface?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, so let me take that question. I think there is three broad things. From a compensation standpoint we expect that that will begin to moderate and continue to moderate third, fourth and into 2018 and that will be driven by the fact that we're getting close to the end of building out those risk and compliance programs, so that is kind of number one. Then cost related to risk and compliance such as like consulting activities; that are really have been helping us support some of those programs, has been moderating, it will continue to moderate as we go into the next few quarters and also into 2018. So those would be the biggest things and then a year ago FDIC implemented a surcharge and so we're starting to lap that and the year-over-year effect associated with the FDIC insurance will start to moderate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And I'll keep my follow-up to expenses; and can you just help us understand the tax advantage investments and what does that mean for sequential growth as we go third, into fourth as well; it seems like you also had a bunch of that more in the other line this quarter. So can you just help us understand what that means for sequential growth as well? Thanks.", "Terry Dolan", "We don't necessarily talk about that specifically but we do typically see the tax credit amortization expense start to move up in the third and then the fourth quarter. I think last year from third to fourth as an example it was up about $40 million to $50 million kind of a net ballpark. So that should give you kind of some sort of a range with respect to how that's going to change.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks guys, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "John Pancari", "Good morning. Just around the deposit balance sheet again for the ended period, just want to get a little bit color on what drove that -- the end of period coming in above the average and some of the volatility there and how we should look at the deposit flows going forward?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, so on a linked quarter basis if you're going to look at just averages, we saw growth in deposits, both in our consumer business and then also in our corporate trust business. We end up looking at the ending cash balances, keep in mind that one of the things we were doing as we were building cash balances in order to meet some of those liquidity requirements; and in order to be able to do that one of the things that we did is a little bit of a pricing change related to some sort of deposits in order to bring some dollars in near the end of the quarter, and so that's why you see that. Kind of on a go forward basis when you think about cash balances, we don't expect the average balances to change much from current levels.", "Andy Cecere", "That's right, Terry. And I'd add in any particular day that cash balance can be up or down, there is a lot about that particularly within the corporate trust business with flows that are there, so one day I think there is a designated trend during my [indiscernible].", "John Pancari", "Okay, so the average should remain where it is, so therefore the EOP is probably going to head back towards the level where it was?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, it's an average balances.", "John Pancari", "Yes, got it, okay. And then on the margin, in terms of your expectation, could you remind me again, you had mentioned four to five basis points?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. You know, our guidance for the -- going into the third quarter we expected to spend -- expand four to five basis points from here. And one of the things, just -- when we end up looking at the one basis point movement in the second quarter, we had guided that it would be lower. One of the big reasons for that is really building the higher cash balance as that cost has got two basis points during that quarter and the flatter yield curve cost us a little bit but when we look at third quarter we feel pretty comfortable with that range of four to five basis points.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then jumping off from that point into fourth quarter, how much beyond that would you think barring incremental hikes then into '18 can be a good color? Thanks.", "Terry Dolan", "When we look into the fourth quarter, at least right now, we would expect that the margin increase may not be at the four to five but it's still going to be kind of in that range of three to four, some and above.", "Andy Cecere", "And we try this thing with the 90 days because so much can change with the yield curve in particular, so we'll continue to give guidance as we go to the next 90 days.", "John Pancari", "Yes, got it. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Terry.", "Operator", "The next question is from Betsy Graseck.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning. I just had a couple of questions, little more on the strategic side. I just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the consolidation that's going on with merchant acquiring over in Europe and how that plays into your business over there, any thoughts on incremental investments that you would be looking to make as a result?", "Andy Cecere", "Right. So as you know Betsy, we're five or six both in North America, as well as Europe, we have a great platform, our dynamic currency conversion capabilities, our international payment platform; so I think we're well positioned in both places. Merchant acquiring is an area that we will continue to look for incremental acquisitions, I would call it more open bolt-on or add-on as opposed to major deals. We don't need to really expand or start in Europe because we already have a very strong presence, so -- but it is in an area of focused rest and one that continues to grow along, we continue to invest in.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then on the corporate trust side, could you give us some more updated comments there?", "Andy Cecere", "So corporate trust is having a good year, we continue to be leading market share across all three categories, muni, corporate, as well structured; we have again a good platform and good technology which I think is key to that business and we've been very consistent in terms of our commitment to that. So our opportunity is to continue to expand in the U.S. but also we have a foothold in Europe and our opportunity to expand there I think is comparable to where it was in the U.S. about 20 years ago.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then just lastly, you talked a bit about deposit betas and how they've been projecting; I just wanted to get a sense from you on how close to run rate you are on the corporate side of your business?", "Terry Dolan", "I think when you end up looking at deposit bidders overall, they talked a little bit about that. I do think that one of the things you're seeing on the wholesale side is that the deposit prices gain a little bit more competitive; and so we do see that picking up both in the June hike and as rate hikes continued in the future. And you know, I think that is going to continue to move up and as part of what we are so when we think about the positive bid as overall moving up closer to that 50 basis points, we're going to see more pressure on the wholesale side and on the corporate trust side.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. But it feels like we are two-thirds the way through or a third of the way through.", "Terry Dolan", "With respect to this rate hike?", "Betsy Graseck", "Yes.", "Terry Dolan", "I think we're probably further along on the wholesale side of the equation getting normalized betas and we have more space to go on the retail side which the beta there has been very low and we'll continue to go up as the next rate increases come forward.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. No, it was interesting just -- I asked the question because obviously we had a rate hike but yet you did a great job on non-sparing deposits growth in the quarter, and so it kind of suggested to me that maybe you were done on the corporate deposit beta side.", "Terry Dolan", "No, I don't know if we're done. I think that's all that we can really driven based upon what we see from a competitive standpoint but I don't think based upon the fact that we have cash balances where we're at, we don't necessarily see a need to drive deposits in. We're -- I would agree with you, I don't think there is a lot of upward pressure with respect to it. Deposit beta is both -- whether it's retail or wholesale etcetera, it's really tracking pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, maybe just a little bit higher.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Alright, thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question is from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. My first question is on loan growth, it sounds like the aggregate stuff is pretty much tracking as you would have thought that through the course that you're already indeed will accelerate back in your targeted range in the back half. So that's all good but it is kind of running a little contrary to the weakness we still see in the HA [ph]. Just curious if you can spend another moment or so just talking about exactly where it ends up coming from how much of it is market share versus [indiscernible]?", "Andy Cecere", "So I'll start and then I'll ask Bill to add on. You know the areas of growth continue to be in few -- middle market is doing exceptionally well, that's in excess of 2% on a linked quarter basis and we continue to see that accelerating or being about that level in future quarters, that's doing well. As Terry and I both mentioned, we saw some growth in the second half of the second quarter in the large corporate wholesale part of the category. And then a lot of leasing as Terry mentioned, very high quality but given the great platform relationships we had that shows some growth. So those are areas that I would say are our principal areas of focus.", "Bill Parker", "Yes, that pretty much hit on the consumer, we expect it to remain fairly strong through the latter half of the year, so we continue to see good demand in auto loans and leases; and again, that's very prime portfolio for us, we've always done it that way and we've stayed consistent in that area. We also using some demand on home equity, that's a tough market but we haven't seen the big increases, we do still have strong originations there. Andy talked about the commercial side; I will stay on the commercial real estate side although we do see some roll-off of our -- what we call our mortgage portfolio or standing loan portfolio, I guess it's very aggressive terms and by the life companies in the VS market. We are still an active construction lender, so we've seen growth there and we also -- our client base is a lot of reaps [ph] and much of that actually shows up in the C&I line and we're seeing good growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year there. So there is a lot of space where we're continuing to see good demand.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate the color. And then just separately on -- just the idea of positive operating leverage; it looks like both the quarters in the back half of the year, we should get was just good. Just curious about your updated thoughts on positive frame leverage for the full year and sort of when you would expect to see that? I think you've previously been hoping to generate positive operating leverage for the full year '17; I guess just my rough cut on the updated guidance -- just now, it will still be a little bit of a challenge but just would be curious to hear your thoughts.", "Andy Cecere", "Scott, we'll get in third quarter and fourth quarter and we'll be very close if not on for the full year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up to Scott's question; as we look on longer term in terms of the progression of your efficiency ratio, if we presume this with either forward curve today; could we see U.S. Bancorp exit 2018 with an efficiency ratio in the low 50s?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, it's a short answer to that question. We would expect to have positive operating leverage and closer to our long-term growth projections as move into '18 and that is what we talked about at Investor Day and that expense ratio in the 3% to 5% and revenue growth above that. Now that's assuming sort of a normal yield curve, economic growth is abnormally lower or anything like that but we would expect to continue to have that into '18.", "Erika Najarian", "That was very clear, thank you. The follow-up on some of the deposit question, some of your peers have noted that if the SAD [ph] does reduce its balance sheet or begin reducing its balance sheet by September, they believe that the outflows will be most vulnerable in wholesale deposits and I'm wondering what your color is on that -- your take is on that and whether or not that could potentially accelerate beta's even further for U.S. bank?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, so let me take that. And so -- you know, the Fed is still kind of in the process defining what the level of balance sheet reduction and the pace of that overtime; and our expectation is that first of all, they're going to be very transparent as they go through that process and the pace is going to be very gradual, most likely several years. So we do believe that as -- kind of excess liquidity comes out of the market, we would expect there to be more competition for deposits and that is going to end up impacting pricing; I do believe that just because of the nature of the deposits on the wholesale side you're going to see more competitive and -- more of a competitive environment associated with that. Whether I'd be surprised if it's going to significantly impact 2017, and I do believe that just because it's going to be very gradual, it's going to also be very manageable and the market is going to respond accordingly.", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you. And just one last follow-up question; I know you always get asked on this call about an update for with the consent order and I'm wondering if I could ask a more technical question; is the consent order for OCC applicable to the holding company? And I'm just wondering whether or not there is a way to isolate the consent order to sort of unshackle it more strategically?", "Andy Cecere", "OCC obviously regulates our national banks, so that's where it is. But our national bank is essentially the holding company, I mean I think it's over 99% of the entire banks; so all the operations occur within that national bank. So what the OCC -- it really applies across the board.", "Terry Dolan", "Erika, we continue to expect to have our people in process who are in place, their technology will be completed by the end of the third, into the fourth quarter and then it gets to the sustainability and part of the equation and that goes into early '18.", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is Matt Connor [ph] with Deutsche Bank.", "Ricky Dodds", "This is actually Ricky from Matt's team. I'm wondering if I could just do a bigger picture question first. I wonder if you can touch on some of items on the growth front that you mentioned in the past, maybe it's in payments or in wealth penetration; maybe frame out what those could mean to revenue as we think about both, the rest of this year and into 2018 and beyond?", "Andy Cecere", "So I think our -- let me just sort of go across the business lines, yes, for high level; our wholesale continues to be an opportunity to expand our dominance in terms of being the bank of choice for large corporate customers. We have a number of capabilities we've built over the years and we continue to take market share in different categories, particularly in the commercial group as we move up the league tables. On the wealth management side, I do think the extension of corporate trust, as well as the wealth management piece of the pie, particularly were focused on the emerging [ph], that represents a great opportunity. Payments across all three categories, merchant acquiring, card issuing, as well as corporate payment systems; I think we have the technology and leaders to continue to grow that. I think particularly in regard to Elvan [ph], I think the opportunity is both here, as well as in Europe.", "And then finally retail, we're doing very well in terms of small business as well as retail core customer growth. And so I think across all of our business lines as we've said many times before, I think we're in a strong position, and we're not really seeking to have major adjustments and just taking advantage of the opportunities we have in front of us.", "Ricky Dodds", "Okay, great. And the maybe separately, it seems like energy and maybe oil prices are starting to come back in the conversation a bit more; some analysts are calling for sun $40 oil prices by 2018. I'm just wondering if you can remind us again what your exposure in that space and does it seem like there is any real signs of deterioration in your portfolio? I'm wondering if you could talk again maybe about the quality.", "Andy Cecere", "Sure. Yes, I mean our book has been relatively modest in size, we do finance the energy sector but we're below 2% of our commitment level and less than 1% of our loans within that sector. When the original price decline took place we obviously did see some impact. This quarter NPAs were down in part because of some of the resolution of those original non-performing loans but we've been bringing our reserve levels down but it's not -- it's just not a material impact to our overall performance but we think the -- were at -- going to a $40 price tag, we think that's a comfortable place to be, so we expect to continue to see improvement in that portfolio.", "Ricky Dodds", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, couple of questions, and maybe this one goes to Bill. Credit card net charge-offs up 58 basis points year-over-year, turning a little higher than your peers; can you talk a little bit about what's going on there?", "Bill Parker", "Yes, sure. I mean I think that I'll start within -- the forward look is lower than that, right, it will come back down, it will be below 4%; so it's not a trajectory thing. I think what we see is that we have continued to grow that portfolio both with acquisitions and internally through our branches, it's been solid growth; so there is a seasoning impact and if you've probably seen that across the industry but we have -- we do have a seasoning impact there but our outlook is very solid, we haven't -- we've seen our underwriting to begin that growth.", "Andy Cecere", "And it's a crime portfolio across the board, there is no sub-prime activity there and we're not -- that's not something we're worried about.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, alright. Second topic, mortgage banking, you talked about that on last quarter's call. Terry, Andy in terms of -- your applications are pretty sharply, seems like gain on sale margins were down; can you give some color as to what's going on and what you expect to see on that?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes, so maybe just to talk about the second quarter first, mortgage applications on a year-over-year basis we're down about 16% for us and that's pretty much in line with what the market was experience and that's driven in large part by the right refinancing. Second quarter mortgage applications, we did see a nice movement up on a linked quarter basis; we end up looking into the third quarter, we would expect mortgage applications to continue to move higher, that is kind of seasonal effect and we also have a nice mix of retail and on the purchase mortgage side, so that seasonal impact will continue to see in the third quarter. Gain out of sale margins in the second quarter did come down, I think you saw that kind of in the industry, our expectation or outlook is that they will be relatively stable going into the third quarter.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Brian Klock", "Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up maybe a little finer tooth on the expense guidance. On the year-over-year basis, I mean would you think that anyway if we look at the 3% to 5% range, do you think that sequentially we're looking at expenses; especially I think Terry if you mentioned the impact of the amortization of -- well income housing tax credits, so should we be up most single digits on a sequential basis, third versus second?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. I mean usually there is a little bit of a seasonal effect that comes into play with respect to the third quarter but I think that's a reasonable assumption when you think about the third quarter.", "Brian Klock", "Okay. And I now you talked about earlier the deposits and you know the expectation around just the seasonal, there is a season of run-off that comes back in the second half of the year; so cash balances on average you think will be unchanged. So with the recent issuances of some longer term debt are you planning to add anything else to the investment securities portfolio? Are you planning to keep the securities portfolio relatively flat?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. We end up increasing the securities portfolio really kind of in-line with the overall balance sheet growth; so if you think about what average loan growth is going to look like -- our average earning assets really kind of tracks in a very similar manner, so we would be adding to the investment portfolio in order to be able to do that but that's kind of one way to think about.", "Brian Klock", "Alright, thanks for your time.", "Operator", "The next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.", "Saul Martinez", "Good morning, everybody, couple of questions. Just sort of closing the loop a little bit on the net interest margin in NII guide; the NIM guidance four to five basis points average loan growth, 1%, 1.5%; I guess this should -- you know, triangulating that into NII growth of getting the numbers of around -- I guess 3% to 4% sequential growth is -- it's a little bit higher than I thought but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something in terms of triangulating NIM into NII growth?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. I know that you can do the math based on what we ended up laying out but I think that's a reasonable assumption.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it. Okay, perfect. Now I guess a little bit of a bigger picture question on [indiscernible] merchant acquiring business, sort of a follow-up to an earlier question; especially in light of some of the consolidation you're seeing in Europe. But we have heard and feel free to disagree with this but we have heard that from some that it feels like you're subscale in the acquiring business in both, the U.S. and Europe, and obviously you've exited some low MDR relationships, you've exited some JVs, but can you talk a little bit more about the business strategically in terms of where you see the opportunities and how you capitalize on those opportunities? Where do you see [indiscernible] getting into the entire payment space in the merchant acquiring space and how do you differentiate yourself and drive better growth on an ongoing basis?", "Andy Cecere", "So I think first on your scale question, I think we have sufficient scale to be very competitive. I think we've had that for a number of years. We're focused on the few areas, number one is verticals, I think as you think about the merchant processing business, it's migrating from a natural transaction business to an information business and being very focused on verticals and providing that information, it's usually important and we have a number of verticals; the travel industry, hotels, small realty retailers that I think we're very good at, healthcare is another one; so our focus is in that information and in terms of innovation and technology providing beyond the financial transaction, and as well as the expansion of our sales force, both domestically, as well as Europe. And then finally, the e-commerce side of the equation is another area of focus for us in terms of investment and growth.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it. And how do you feel like your e-commerce capabilities are now versus where you want them to be?", "Andy Cecere", "I think they are fine, I want them to be better.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay, alright, fair enough. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "Good morning. I just had a quick question on tax rate; you mentioned it was going to 29%, I'm right there on the third quarter, so it's been quite volatile over the last few quarters. Are you still sticking with the 27% to 28%, give or take range for this year and maybe longer term?", "Terry Dolan", "I think that when we end up looking at the tax rate on a tax equivalent basis on a long-term basis, you know just because of growth it's going to -- because of the marginal effect it's going to drift upwards, so when I end up looking at certainly the next few quarters and going into 2018, the 29% is certainly more reasonable.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then in regards to growth, obviously commercial mortgage -- C&I has been the main driver of growth as we've seen in the last few years, it slowed recently here. When you look out the next one or two years do you feel like the consumer and retail lending will start to take the lead or do you feel like commercial lend -- C&I lending will continue to be strong over the next couple of years?", "Terry Dolan", "I think wholesale will continue growing as it is and I think we'll start to see a turnaround in retail; so we've had strong growth, we've seen another portfolio that we talked about, a little bit less in terms of the home equity in traditional retail loan areas but I think we'll start to accelerate in future periods and I think that's how we get to the more normalized long-term growth rates.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, I just had a follow-up question. It's around the CCAR process and the ask and -- you know, really the question is around the dividend. I thought you had a nice increase in the dividend but yet you have one of the lowest volatility earning streams of the group and it feels like there might be some room to boost up the dividend component of the capital return. Just wondering how you're thinking through that.", "Andy Cecere", "Betsy, that's a fair question. So I think first of all, we're starting from one of the lower capital ratios; you're right that we have the lowest volatility and the lowest downturn in the stress environment, in fact, we still make money as you say but we're starting from a point that's not far away from what we think is our optimal capital structure, the 8.5% versus the just over 9% we are today, that's number one. Number two is, we're always wanting to make sure that we do -- that we are successful in the outcome of the CCAR process and then finally balancing between the buyback side of the equation and the dividend. What we've done is, what I would call continue -- very predictable continually steady growth and we would expect to continue that in the future. We might balance a little bit more but we will balance a little bit more towards increasing the dividend probably more than a buyback in future periods.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning, thank you. Can you guys give us some additional color -- you touched on in your opening remarks about the commercial real estate markets, you're seeing possibly some weakness in the multi-family space; can you share with us is there any geographical areas that you see as more concerning for you at this time?", "Andy Cecere", "Well, I mean there are certainly some of the cities that have very strong multi-family growth and if you look at some of the rent forecast and there is plenty of companies to do this. They will see there are markets, some of the coastal markets of Boston, DC; where the forecasts are for either no or slightly decline in rent growth; and that doesn't mean we won't do projects there, we follow our client base and if they like the project, we like the project, we both will do something but some of the markets have seen a lot of multi-family, Minneapolis is another one where you got to be cautious about it.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. The second question was and I think you may have touched upon this and I apologize if you did; can you kind of give us your view of -- obviously, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that they're going to start unwinding their balance sheet and it will go into full speed operation in 2018. How are you guys looking at that and the impact it may have on deposits in the banking system and then for USP as well?", "Terry Dolan", "Gerard, thank you. We talked a little bit about that earlier but you know, when you end up looking at what the Feds -- the Fed still needs to kind of define a level of reduction in the balance sheet and really the pace of it and I think that they've been really transparent that that pace is really going to be gradual over several years and I think that that will cause any impacts of it to be very manageable on the banking industry. And as the market adjusts, I do think that as -- or we think as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits, I would also expect that the long end of the curve on a relative basis would be a little bit higher; as a result some of their activities -- that have [indiscernible] from a deposit standpoint is most likely to come on the wholesale side of the equation.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Very good. And then just lastly, you know, obviously you guys have industry leading profitability with your ROA and your ROE at the present levels. What -- is it going to be more the net interest margin improvement or the efficiency ratio when you look at how you're going to or could drive that higher? As you know in the past, your numbers were higher but is it more of a margin issue or is it more efficiency ratio or leverage; what are you guys looking out for the levers? Do you even take it higher than where it is today?", "Terry Dolan", "Gerard, I think it's both parts of the equation, it's accelerating revenue growth and moderating expense growth; positive operating leverage which will improve the efficiency ratio and ultimately improve ROA and ROE.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. Just one question, the bottom of Slide 8 really stands out; and that U.S. bank has built reserves for the last six quarters whereas your peers even through 2Q for those that have reported continue to release those reserves. So could you talk about it as something in terms of the mix shift or the loan portfolio that's driving your ability to grow reserves, again when your peers are just not in that same position?", "Andy Cecere", "Well, one of the things you're looking at is that lot of the peers have larger energy exposure so they added more and like us, we can see improvement in this quarter so they may have released more reserves out of their energy book. And we're pretty much steady as she goes from a credit standpoint; so at this point in the cycle we have a very stable credit environment and we're still growing loans, so that's what we look at and we will add to reserves to support loan growth if you think about what they are for and they are for potential future losses out of your loan book and as you grow the loan book, that's what the reserve is for. So if we don't have big upswings, we're needing to add to reserves in a downturn like the energy portfolio. Then we're going to be adding for loan growth.", "Bill Parker", "Sorry about that, it's been a lot lower than everyone else and so simply stated if we're not adding a lot, we're also tracking a lot.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Then just a follow-up question for me. Andy, this concept of one U.S. bank which you've talked about I believe is in the annual report; as you think about the second half of this year there are any areas within your core businesses that stand out in terms of benefiting from this strategy as you work together under this one U.S. bank kind of a strategy?", "Andy Cecere", "Terry, has a long list, there are a number of initiatives across the company from the way we handle our call centers, the way we do innovation and the way we communicate with our customers, to how we share information among the business lines. So there are a number of initiatives and I would say it's probably our number one focus of the company right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The final question is from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, I just had a couple of small ones on the -- making sure we're getting the payment -- merchant cost JV, it's right in the model; so were there any pain associated with the exit either in 2Q or back half of the year? And then the second just in terms of the guide, I think you said your 3% FX adjusted growth now in merchant processing and you see that flat in 3Q; was that -- how -- is it the earnings -- is it like equity method accounting that was being booked or is there revenue and then we should think about some expense coming out also in P&L? And I guess last, maybe just curiosity -- which JVs are you exiting? I saw something about [indiscernible] but couldn't find the other.", "Andy Cecere", "So first I'm going to ask Terry to go on the other details, there was no material gain or loss in the second quarter as a result.", "Terry Dolan", "Yes, so if you just end up looking at and trying to think about the growth rates over the next couple quarters, certainly reported growth rate is about 2.7% excluding the foreign currency as we said. I'd also say that same-store sales percentages and organic business growth has generally been quite strong which I think is good to see, that gives us insights with respect to the future. Reporting growth sales have been impacted by three factors; we talked last quarter about exiting some large volume low margin customers, that's been muting sales volumes and that has been dissipating and it's getting behind us, and certainly will be behind us as we get into the end of the third quarter; and so we're starting to see sales volume starting to grow.", "We are experiencing some margin compression in Europe because of interchange caps that were put into place late 2015, and that has continued to impact our year-over-year sort of growth rates and will continue to do impact at least through the third quarter if that will start to dissipate in the fourth quarter and then really be behind us as we get into 2018. And then the impact of exiting the two joint ventures will have an impact on merchant acquiring, really for the next several quarters as we think about the year. To kind of give us some, maybe specifics; when we look at the third quarter, we do expect the year-over-year growth rate for the third quarter to be essentially flat and that's essentially what we said. As I look into the fourth quarter, I do expect the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter of this current quarter. And then as we continue to see organic growth that we are experiencing, you know that will start to benefit us as we go into 2018.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And are you able to disclose which JVs are not at this time?", "Terry Dolan", "Yes. I mean the one joint venture is related to our joint venture in Spain with Santander. And you know really, they've had changing priorities with respect to what they want to focus on; and as we think about Spain, it continues to be an area that has some economic challenges. So from our standpoint we really do believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow in that market on our own with a focus on the right customers and I'd be very clear we're not exiting the market. With respect to the second joint venture, that is the joint venture with KeyCorp [ph], so we thought key merchant services; and in that situation our partner really wanted to focus on a third-party servicing arrangements and we respect that decision on their particular part. And we also say that we're retaining the clients that we believe will create the best growth opportunity for us as we move into the future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, that was very detailed and I appreciate the answers.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you for listening to this review of our second quarter results.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, October 25 at 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.", "I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.", "I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy.", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Terry and I will discuss third quarter results and provide you with some forward-looking guidance, after that, we'll take your questions.", "I'll start in Slide 3 of the presentation. Third quarter net income totaled $1.6 billion or $0.88 per diluted share. Our performance was highlighted by record revenue in net income and earnings per share and our return on tangible common equity was 18%. Slide 4 highlights our key profitability metrics, each of which improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. The return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.38% and return on common equity was 13.6%. You can see on the far right of the chart that our efficiency ratio improved to 54.3%. On our second quarter earnings call, I told you that we will deliver positive operating leverage in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis and we did. ", "Our revenue growth remained strong in the third quarter while our year-over-year expense growth dropped to 3.7% which is a significant improvement compared with the year-over-year growth rate we've experienced over the past several quarters. The above normal expense growth rate over that timeframe was primarily tied to expenses incurred to address the AML consent order. The people and processes needed to address these issues are substantially in place. And these costs have beginning to normalize towards the company's overall expense growth rate. We've reached in inflection point and we expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018. ", "I want to emphasize, however, that we'll continue to make prudent investment in our business to world that is changing at a faster pace never before. We are embracing the new reality of constant change and evolving customer behavior. Our ability to leverage technology and innovation to drive growth and improve efficiency will be fundamental component of our success. While the banking environment continues to evolve, our balance sheet is strong and growing. Credit quality is stable, we are winning market share in our businesses and we are delivering positive operating leverage.", "In summary, we are well positioned heading into the end of the year and looking ahead to 2018. Terry will now provide some details on the quarter. ", "Terry Dolan", "Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.0% from a year ago. Commercial loan grew 1.0% sequentially. While we continue to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses, some large corporate customers took advantage of a mid quarter decline in interest rate to secure low, long term funding. This preference for bond issuance benefited our capital market business and continues to impact total loan growth. The decline in commercial real estate loans reflects our prudent outlook for commercial real estate lending at this time and pay down activities as customers refinance to extend maturities at relatively low interest rate. ", "Retail loan growth of 2.6% was supported by robust growth in installment loans and retail leasing. Strong growth in retail leasing reflects customer preference shifts toward lease financing as well as market share gains with dealers and manufactures. ", "Turning to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year. We saw 0.9% decline in noninterest bearing deposits partly reflect the normal third quarter seasonality in our trust business, as well as investment managers deploying trust cash balances into other asset categories. Our total interest bearing deposit beta is similar to previous quarters and in line with our expectation. As future rate hikes occur, we would have expected the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level. ", "On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 47 basis points in the third quarter and non-performing assets declined by 7.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our $360 million provision expense reflects normal provisioning related to loan growth, as well as potential credit losses for markets affected by the two recent hurricanes which occurred in the third quarter. After an assessment of credit exposures within the impacted areas, we do not expect any impact to the provision for credit losses in future quarters. ", "I'll now move to earnings results. Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Record third quarter net income of $1.6 billion was up 4.2% compared with the second quarter and up 4.1% versus the third quarter of 2016. Revenue totaled a record $5.6 billion, up 2.2% on a linked quarter basis and 4.1% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. ", "On Slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the third quarter, up 3.8% linked and 8.3% year-over-year. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the third quarter, the net interest margin increased six basis points to 3.10% slightly higher than our guidance. The third quarter margin benefited from higher than expected interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points on linked quarter basis. ", "Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased by 0.1% on a linked quarter basis and was down 0.9% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, credit and debit card revenue increased 3.0% on higher sales volumes. Credit and debit card revenue growth was muted somewhat by fewer processes and cycles in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a year ago and year-over-year impact of previously acquired portfolio.", "Trust and asset management revenue grew 5.0% reflecting strong core business growth and favorable market conditions. Lower mortgage revenue primarily reflects a lower refinancing activity from a year ago. Merchant processing revenue was down 1.7% on year-over-year. As we previously discussed our recent exit of two joint ventures negatively affected the linked and year-over-year comparison. In addition, the recent hurricane conditions adversely impacted sales volume and related revenue in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the weather conditions during the third quarter, merchant processing revenue was essentially flat from a year ago as expected. ", "Turning to Slide 11, noninterest expense increase to 0.5% compared with the second quarter of 2017, and was up 3.7% versus the third quarter of 2016. On a year-over-year basis, higher personnel costs were partially offset by lower legal professional expenses and marketing expenses.", "Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.4%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.", "I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect linked quarter total average loan to grow at pace similar to the third growth rate. We expect that net interest margin to be essentially flat to the third quarter which included two basis points related to unusually high interest recoveries for this period in the business cycle. With respect to fee revenue, the third quarter is seasonally our highest quarter for growth. We expect fee revenue to be essentially flat on a linked quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis. ", "As Andy discussed, we will deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018, supported by expense growth in the 3% to 5% range. As a reminder, linked quarter expense growth in the fourth quarter is seasonally impacted by the timing of professional services and higher tax credit amortization expense. We expect credit quality to remain stable. ", "I'll hand it back to Andy for closing comments. ", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks Terry. This company has a history that is remarkable for its consistent high performance. But we are always looking for ways to improve. This is the time to look ahead and I am very optimistic about the future .At its core banking is a relatively simple business. As with anything execution will be the differentiator. The winners in this industry would be those banks that anticipate customer preferences and deliver the product and services they demand in a most convenient and efficient manner. Towards that end, every single leader in this company is focused on two mandates. First, deliver on the promise of one US Bank by putting the customer at the center of every discussion and every decision regardless which door their customer walk through. Second, figure out how to optimize everything we do whether it's optimizing the customer experience, the distribution model or the customer relationship. Figure out the most efficient and most valued way to deliver the highest quality product and services and then do it. If we execute effectively, which I'm confident we'll, results not only the industry leading but improving returns. And we will deliver those results within the parameters of a risk management framework that considers both the current and future environment. ", "I am looking forward to leading this company to the next phase of its evolution. Supported what I truly believe is the best team in the banking industry. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the deposit pricing strategy both on the interest bearing side and the noninterest deposits were down a little bit linked quarter on average basis, little bit more on a trade end basis. And just comments in terms of what type of migration that you are seeing out of the noninterest bearing into other buckets? ", "Terry Dolan", "Now so this is Terry, Matt. Let me talk a little bit about the deposit balances first. When you end up working at core deposit balances we really saw a little change relatively stable. Where the decreases did occur principally in a couple of different areas about $900 million it is really seasonal decreases that we always see for the second and the third quarter that's really tied to kind of our corporate trust business. Then we also saw some balances that went out simply because of custodial type of activities so those tend to be a little bit -- they fluctuate a little bit. Our time deposits were up a little and that was principally because of some decisions related to large customers. We expect that to be relatively short term and for those to flow out early in the fourth quarter. So but when you end up looking at the core deposit balances, they were reasonably stable during the quarter. The deposit pricing standpoint, let me just kind of talk about it, we haven't seen a lot of change relatively what we've been experienced in the past. We end up looking at retail deposit pricing or deposit beta they are essentially unchanged at this particular point in time and we don't see a lot of competitive pressure with respect to that. Our wholesale deposit pricing, we are essentially just being responsive to competitive pricing in the marketplace and that can be in certain markets a little bit on the West Coast and little bit in the New York area but not a lot of widespread competitive pressure that we are seeing. But those rates on the wholesale side are starting to go up. I'd also say if you end up looking at our corporate trust and deposits, those tend to be highly operational and fairly stable as well. So and keep that in mind too. ", "Andy Cecere", "And Terry you focused on average deposit being core relatively stable because any day period end could be very volatile given the trust. ", "Terry Dolan ", "Exactly, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ", "Scott Siefers ", "Good morning, guys. Terry you had just sort of given the outlook for sort of flattish fees as you see them in the fourth quarter and then I guess year-over-year as well. Just as you see what are sort of the major nuisances in that guidance? In other words what are the puts and takes? And as you think about just the payments business in particular, appreciate the comment on both the JV exit and the hurricane activity but just how you are thinking about progression in those businesses? ", "Terry Dolan ", "Sure. Yes, when you end up looking at fee income it's typically seasonally flat to down in the fourth quarter. And that comes from a variety of different categories. Mortgage banking, from a market standpoint is a typically seasonally and little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Our payments businesses are typically a little seasonally down especially in the corporate payments space. So there are a number of kinds of categories that tend to be flat to down. Our commercial product revenue is typically flat to down a little bit as well because capital market activities tend to slow a little bit in the fourth quarter. So there are a number of different areas where you see that seasonal impact taking place. Let me tell you -- let me talk a little bit which is kind of your second question on the payments revenue. And you kind of keep in mind that we have really three businesses that are part to that. First is the credit card and debit card business and year-over-year the growth is about 3.0%. That was impacted by fewer processing days, and that's something that's unique to US bank because it's based upon how we best process those sales transaction in any one quarter and the third quarter happened to have one fewer processing cycle if you will. Sales on a reported basis, on a credit card perspective were up about 5.1%, without that processing cycle would have been about 6%. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past. That 3.0% is probably impacted by about one percentage point because of that processing day. When you think about the fourth quarter, we would have expected that credit card revenue to rebound a little bit because of that processing cycle that I talked about. And when we think about that particular business we can think about kind of mid single digit in terms of revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Second category is really merchant acquiring and last quarter we talked about the fact that we exited the joint ventures. And we expected revenue to be essentially flat. And when we look at the impact of the joint ventures, that about 2% to 2.5% but the other thing that happened in the quarter as you know as we had three hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico and a variety of different things like that that end up impacting revenue growth by about 1.5%. As we think about fourth quarter, the impact of the hurricanes is going to continue. We still have a significant number of merchant that are either offline or have relatively slow sales as they continue to kind of come online. And so when we think about the fourth quarter we really think that merchant acquired revenue is probably going to be flat year-over-year. And then last business is our CPS business and we had a great quarter in CPS. If you end up looking at the total revenue within CPS it was up about 5% -- little over 5%, 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Then you know we've been investing in a business pretty significantly, we talked about virtual pay in and some other things but we were investing in a couple of years ago. And we are starting to see some really nice dividend and momentum in that particular business. And when we look on a year-over-year basis we would expect to see continued growth and strength in that particular area but on a sequential basis or a linked quarter basis, it typically is a lower quarter in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ", "Erika Najarian", "Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's line of questioning. I completely appreciate that's probably too early to give outlook on the puts and takes behind the commitment deposit operating leverage for 2018. But I am wondering similarly how you walk through in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a sense of the big trend that you are seeing over the next 12 months that could drive fee growth next year? And I am wondering that because clearly you outlined the seasonality in the fourth quarter but also the fees are expected to be flat year-over-year. So just the big trend would be great. ", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. At a very high level, again this is Terry. I think one of the biggest drags that we had this year was really related to mortgage banking revenue and so when we look into 2018, we see that has been relatively stable or starting to grow from there. And that was one of the biggest factors. And then within the merchant acquiring I think is probably the other major area that we'll continue to see strengthening in terms of the year-over-year growth rate because as those joint ventures kind of lapse in the second quarter of next year, some of the hurricane effects and some of the investments we've been making in that business, we should continue to see strength. Andy you want to add anything else here?", "Andy Cecere", "The only thing I would add to your question Erika is that on the expense side the equation as we mentioned in our prepared comments, I think we've reached an inflection point in terms of their higher growth rate that we've seen in the past. What you saw this quarter is more consistent with that 3% to 5% that we talked about. So balance sheet growth together with the income growth that Terry articulated and more normalized expense growth will give us that positive operating leverage. ", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you. And just a follow up to that. There has been a wide swing in terms of expectations for rate from just early in September to now. And I am wondering Andy you seemed very committed to the expense side of the efficiency ratio equation, if the revenue outlook for next year is not as robust as we think because of whatever the rate outlook is, is there enough flex in the expense base and that you could continue to make the investments that you referred to in prepared remarks but still deliver the positive operating leverage. ", "Andy Cecere", "So, Erika we are projecting what the market has in terms of rate increases both in December and then for next year. And that's set of assumptions that we are using to talk about and discuss positive operating leverage. To the extent that doesn't happen, we'll continue to manage expenses as best as we can like we always have and making sure we have the balance for the short-term result as well as the long-term investment in the businesses to make sure we can have growth going forward. So that's something we've always done and we'll continue to do.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "John Pancari ", "Good morning. On the loan growth side, I know you mentioned that the growth in the fourth quarter in average loan should be similar to that what you saw in the third quarter. So then about less than 1% so we are annualizing to about 4% or so. Is that a long, a fair assessment of where growth should really be trending even into 2018 and what could bring about strengthening outside of any -- as they are all macro factors that you need to see to really see pickup there in that growth rate. Thanks. ", "Andy Cecere", "John I'll start and then ask Bill to add some more color. So first of all it is lower than what we would expected over the long term and what we are seeing with our customers are couple of things. Number one is Terry mentioned taking advantage of lower yield curve and low rates, the lock in either to dead issuance and sometimes pay down bank lending activity is impacting us. So that's one. Second is much of the growth that we are seeing is M&A related and that I would call core CapEx and expansion. And I think that's a little bit of function of waiting for more clarity and certainty around principally tax policy and tax rates. And I think that will be a key driver of accelerated loan growth in 2018 when there is more clarity around tax policy. We also have some nuisances within category so let me ask Bill to talk about.", "Bill Parker", "Yes. The factor that Andy cited are macro factors right, low rate or the refinancing was certainly affects number of our C&I and commercial real estate. And then uncertainty holding back some of the natural activity, investment activity that our customers will make. So those are probably the two biggest drivers. That being said, we continued to be very aggressive in terms of our market share amongst prime customer base which is our customer base on across all the retail categories. So you could see we did grow our home equity loans that somewhat unique we never backed off from that. Credit cards, we've been growing those throughout the down turn in the cycle so we had steady growth in that. Auto loan, same thing, I mean we are in the super prime space there. Retail leasing, we never exited that, we stayed in that and we benefited from that lately. So we do have levers in the prime space that continues to give us loan growth regardless of what's going on a macro basis. ", "Andy Cecere ", "And I'd also mention that John our revolvers, utilization rate on a commercial revolvers are still right around 24% -25% that's about 10 points below what I would say is normal. So we are still growing commitment. We are taking market share but the utilization continues to be at low level. ", "John Pancari ", "All right. Thank you, Andy. And then separately on the credit side, I just want a little bit color on the consumer credit trends you are seeing, your card and auto charge offs and delinquency were up in a quarter and how much that is storm related versus not? Thanks. ", "Bill Parker", "Well, none of it is storm related now. That's too early for that. We did put in programs for reaching out to customers, providing loan application; we've already started that process. So that's well underway. But the reserve build that was mentioned that's really for what we expect to be kind of future credit losses as a result of the storm but that has not shown up. I think the increase that you are referring to in auto and cards, it's really just the seasoning effect, the fact that those portfolios have grown fairly significantly over the past several years. This is natural seasoning so they are performing within our expectations.", "Andy Cecere", "And again Bill they are -- they are prime portfolios, their average cycle on the leasing side 770 so nothing is going down stream in terms of that credit. ", "John Pancari ", "Got it. So nothing underlying in terms of deterioration starting -- okay, got it, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning. I just wanted to dig a little bit on the comments you made in the presentation on the AML BSA. It sounds like it's coming to close in your compliance program are nearing maturity I think were the words you used. Could you just give us a sense as to is that going to accelerate over the next few quarters and so we should see pull back in the expense side there? ", "Andy Cecere ", "So as we've talked about before that the story and that has not changed. Betsy, the people processes and technology what we -- pretty much in place by the end of the year. They are almost on a place, we have a few more technology releases but that part of the spend, which is the bulk of it that will be in place by the end of the year. And then we'll see the compliance related expenses migrate more towards what I'd call a normal expense rate. I don't expect them to go down because we have to continue to maintain the levels we have but I'd expect them to normalize and that will normalize our overall expense growth rate back to that 3% to 5% like you saw this first quarter. With regard to the consent order overall, once those people processes and technology component have in place we go into a sustainability mode which is proving the back that they are working as intended and that will start beginning of 2018 and flow into what I would expect the middle of 2018.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then once you get the green light from regulators you passed the test, there is an opportunity to reengage in M&A. Could you just give us a sense as to how important that it is for you over the next kind of planning cycle here or is that one of the cores that you are looking into or is that just gravy or something comes up?", "Andy Cecere", "Betsy, our M&A activity hasn't really been impacted by this. There hasn't been traditional bank deal that we not been able to do that we wanted to do because of the consent order. Our M&A has been focused on categories like card portfolios, payments businesses as well as trust and fund services. Both that deals that we've been able to do, we continue to look at and I'd expect that our emphasis and focus going forward would continue to be on those deals. If after a consent order exit we see an opportunity on our traditional banking, yes, we will take a look at it but it have to be meeting our criteria which is increasing our market share in our current states having the core customer capabilities that we are looking for and so forth. But it's not causing a significant disadvantage today.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just separately, the OCC changed their guidance on deposit advance product right, not allowed before now they are allowed again. Is that something that you would look at?", "Andy Cecere", "So Betsy we are looking at a number of different products in that category and that maybe something we pursue over the next few quarters over the next year. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just lastly on the online lending, you have kicked off a couple of new relationships and product recently. Could you give us a sense partnership, could you give us a sense as to how these are progressing and what your expectations are from those relationships? ", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. So I think one that's doing very well is our mortgage partnership with Blend which is online application tool, mobile application tool which is doing terrifically. It is exceeding our expectations, it's very well in terms of highly thought of and functioning as expected both from the perspective of a customer but importantly also the mortgage originator. So it is a real positive because they are able to do some of the simple things in a more digital format and really add value to the customers in terms of consultation. So that has been very successful and we expect to continue to grow that into 2018.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, all right. And then just last on the deposit advanced product. That was like 2 percent-ish of your fee I think when you had to wind that business down. So is it your expectation at this stage that you could over time build that type of level of revenue back into your business model getting back into that type of space? ", "Andy Cecere", "Likely not, Betsy. If it comes back it would probably be at a different fee level and probably not with the same size as what we saw historically. And again there is not much certainty that it will come back right.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to the NII side of equation and think about the balance sheet mix. So you are seeing as you mentioned all these ins and outs and out of flows and some might be temporary, some might be kind of this natural mixing and relate to the beta. But just wondering how did you think about just overall size of the balance sheet from here? I think we've seen a bit of slowing in AEA progression and given that loans are slower, how do you think that loans versus deposit growth is going to look for the fourth quarter and then beyond?", "Andy Cecere", "Yes. When we've talked a little bit about what we think loan growth is going to end up looking like in kind of what those categories are. Obviously from a balance sheet standpoint growth in loans is going to be really demand driven as much as anything. From a deposit perspective, I mean we are always looking for good core deposits and so when we have the opportunity to grow good core deposits they are going to be long term stable, we will take that opportunity to be able to do that. But I think what you are going to see really from here for a period of time is just some fluctuation with respect to deposit balances. ", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And will that mean will you be willing to -- the cost of your short term borrowing has actually started to increase a lot too. I would assume that's more market based type of funding. And so does that mean that we see a mix more towards that wholesale if there is more fluctuations in deposits and how that is kind of weigh on the forward outlook for the margin past the fourth quarter. ", "Andy Cecere ", "Yes. I don't think that you are going to see a significant shift in how we end up funding the balance sheet. I mean what ends up happening from a short term standpoint is just what sort of cash level needs, you need in order to have in place in order to meet liquidity requirement either on an average basis or the end of the month and so that's probably what you are seeing more than anything. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.", "Saul Martinez", "Hi, good morning. I have couple of questions on taxes. Any updated thoughts on your expectations for your tax rate assuming no changes in quarter in terms of corporate tax rate? And I think last quarter you said FTA adjusted 29%. And secondly on tax reform I think in the past you guys have indicated you feel like you can get something along the lines of 60% of the benefit. Obviously the devil is going to be in the details and there is lack of detail out there. But the blueprint did specifically seem to protect low income housing credit. So curious if there is any updated thoughts in terms of how you see yourself benefiting from tax reform and how much of that you feel like you can garner from any reduction in the corporate tax rate? ", "Andy Cecere ", "Yes. Well, so I'll take the first question which is really how we think about the fourth quarter. I think the tax rate in the fourth quarter would be pretty similar to what the third quarter was. So that's kind of our expectation. In terms of tax reform, I don't think our view has really changed in terms of what the impact of that might be on the company kind of going forward. But to be quite honest, we were in Washington here recently and what's going to ultimately be in the tax reform bill, there are still moving around a lot even though that there are some framework associated with it. So we are kind of in a wait and see mode in all honesty. ", "Bill Parker", "About 29% in the fourth quarter. ", "Andy Cecere ", "29% in the fourth quarter. ", "Saul Martinez", "Got it, that's fair. And then just finally on Elavon? Was there any FX impact? I didn't see that in the release. ", "Andy Cecere ", "Yes. The impact of FX was very insignificant in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran", "Hi, good morning. Just think about the payment business longer term. And I assume merchant processing is the biggest piece of that but really all four line items that we see on the face of the P&L. There has been department of percent issue, there was some FX headwinds, now there is the JVs so I appreciate there has been lots of puts and takes but what do you think it take kind of takes for those line items to show little bit more momentum and get back to the normal more significant growth rate that maybe they enjoyed in the past.", "Andy Cecere ", "Yes. Well, I think that maybe when you end up looking at the merchant acquiring business, we think on a longer term basis as kind of a mid single digits are a little bit stronger than that. One other things we are seeing or seen stronger sales volumes in their business and I think what we've to do is we have to get beyond the impact of the joint venture as well, some of the hurricane effect. And from a hurricane standpoint as an example, we've now -- we face four hurricanes and earthquake and some wildfire so I think there is a few things that we are going to end up having kind of work through over the next quarter or two. The hurricane effect in Puerto Rico where we have a fairly significant amount of merchants who is going to be there for several quarters. So I really look at it in terms of timing probably mid next year before we get back to that normalized sort of growth level because we'll lap those joint ventures. And I'd also add Brian and we talk about investment and innovation, this is an area we've been focused on historically and we continued to be going forward. I remind you we have a couple of great platforms, our international platform, our dynamic currency conversation capabilities because we invest in the business and merchant processes an area we continue to focused on particularly as it relates to e-commerce and value added services principally around data so it will continue to be an emphasis and an area of focus for us in terms of investment and capabilities.", "Brian Foran", "And then maybe just turn into the auto leasing business. Totally appreciate your comments that are all prime and partly driven by customer preferences. But maybe you could just talk about -- I mean the growth rates have been very high. One, are there specific strategy that are in place to gain more shares with dealers or geographic expansion or anything like that? And then two, you gave some helpful commentary, I believe it was back in April kind of citing some of the green shoots in used car pricing so as you roll forward today, are you still seeing the kind of stabilization and even recovery in used car pricing? And is this growth you are pursuing in auto leasing kind of you are saying that you think the market is overdone and how does it feed into the overall used car price outlook?", "Bill Parker", "So this is Bill. No, we are still bullish on our retail leasing portfolio. So it has been a good business or remains a good business. Used car prices have actually picked up even more in part because of the hurricane that increased demand for pickup et cetera. So in terms of expansion, we do go after different manufactures and we are very competitive in that space, provide an alternative to some of the old captives. So it's an area that we continue to work very hard to keep the growth rates up. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. ", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. You mentioned commercial real estate a little bit more caution, it's big chunk of loans at your company. So I guess is commercial real estate a friend or foe on the one hand or maybe you can make a case for home prices back above pre crisis levels and homebuilders or some others could do well. On the other hand you have retailers and a more competitive environment. Where do you come out on that?", "Bill Parker", "So commercial real estate is a friend. We are -- I think we've always been in active in that space. We did not cut back or exit our construction lending after the downturn, that's grown nicely. We've continued -- we are very active in this space but with the low rates and lot of our customers are appropriately seeking long term fixed rate for financing something banks are not great at offering. There are better sources for that in insurance company, some of the smaller banks, CMBS market but we are -- we remain very active with our client base. Some of our client base is gotten a little more cautious as well. Lot of the growth has been in multifamily, so people are little more cautious in that space, that's just for our client. Residential mortgage, construction we have been very active in that. And we never pulled out of that, they extended into Texas, and we had really nice growth in the Texas market. That's obviously going to be little disruptive by what happened with the hurricanes but that will come back. So overall we are very active commercial real estate lender and we like the business. ", "Mike Mayo", "So just one follow up. So one -- if you look at over the past couple of decades where are we in terms of being aggressive being conservative. When you look at your own experience, is this, 2010 is great and 5 is average and 1 is look out that's 1992, where do you think we are in the CRE cycle? ", "Bill Parker", "I don't really think of it that way because we stick with our underwriting criteria so we are consistent throughout the cycle. And different asset classes or a different spaces you mentioned kind of concerns with the retails. Well, that's been good for the industrial side. So we've seen nice growth in industrial activity. So there is balance of activity that we provide our customer base and its ebbs and flows, but it's a business we stick with. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Good morning. When you look at your owned portfolio, residential mortgage is now the second largest category and it's continuing to grow. When you look at the mortgage banking business, I am kind of looking at it in the sense there has been a shift from originate and sell and to originate and portfolio of loans because we just don't enough total loan growth in the market. So we are not squeezing out those loans like we used to. Is that a rational way to think about it? And if so is mortgage banking which is kind of business that you kind of continue to grow is going to pretty more fee income from that maybe just not going to get back on track from a fee income side but we have a heavier kind of contribution in net interest income. ", "Andy Cecere ", "Marty, I'd say it's balanced and we both originate a sell which are the qualified market just that we've always done and that continuous to be area for growth for us as well as the servicing component. And we portfolio those which are not typically jumbos in our core customer base. So I would expect growth in both categories and I wouldn't expect the major shift one way or the other. Bill, would you add anything to that? ", "Bill Parker", "No. I mean the portfolio activities that are a national platform along with qualified mortgages so we originate through retail channels and through from broker so we will continue to see portfolio growth in the jumbo category. And if you can look at the stack, extremely high quality and low loan to value so --.", "Marty Mosby", "Bill I think I was going to ask you about was seemed to be two things that kind of took a little bit of the earnings out this quarter in the $30 million build with net charge -offs going down and non-performers going down, you kind of handed that was hurricane related but want to make sure that because that's not what you have been doing in the past. So that big portion of that was related to hurricane and the expected losses going forward and then also the tax rate, the 29% this quarter and then foreshadowing that to next quarter, that's about 0.5% higher than what you have been. So just I was curious why the step up in the tax rate and the build and allowance for those two things. ", "Bill Parker", "Yes, this is Bill. I'll do the build and allowance, that was entirely related to the hurricanes. We had some modest -- we've been doing some very modest build related to loan growth. We will continue to do that but the loan bump up was definitely directly related to the hurricane. ", "Andy Cecere ", "And our expectations that is -- ", "Bill Parker", "That is sufficient to cover ", "Andy Cecere ", "Sufficient and including what we know thus far in the wildfire situation in California. ", "Terry Dolan ", "And the tax rate, really the issue there is that again kind of comes back to tax reforms and some of the uncertainty there. When you had a lot of conversations around tax credit low income, renewal energy and all sorts of things. There is a lot of pull back within the market and lot of change in related to pricing associated with tax credit. So part of the reasons why you are seeing the rate going up is a little bit lower level of tax credit production which is market driven as much as anything and then as earnings get stronger you had just have the marginal effect on the tax rate and that will cause it to go up as well.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "Hi, good morning. In regards to your credit, obviously it's been very good over last several years and running well below your long term target and what you think the normalized charges- off would be. And we start to see somewhat of an inflection point here in credit card losses moving higher after several years of being strong or even better than what we've seen in past cycles. When we look over into 2018 and maybe even to 2019, what are your expectations for where credit card losses are going and where charge -offs may actually end up given we are still at pretty good part of the cycle. ", "Bill Parker", "So they have gone up due to seasoning, due to sort of natural seasoning and growing the portfolio. But we do expect them to stabilize around the 4% rate that would be sort of normal -- that's not through the cycle rate but that's sort of normal rate during stable economic conditions. ", "Andy Cecere", "Current environment 4%.", "Bill Parker", "Yes.", "Kevin Barker", "And when you think about the outlook is it something where it grows to 4% in plateaus or is it something where you would incrementally continue to see move higher?", "Bill Parker", "No. We will think it will plateau around the 4% in this kind of economic condition. ", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then given the outlook on auto, we've obviously seen pressure on used car prices in here and to follow up on some of the John's questions, delinquency rates and frequency of the fall to start to slow across the industry, do you expect charge-offs rates decline in 2018 given some of the positive development we've seen with a little bit resiliency in used car prices and slight decline in frequency?", "Bill Parker", "I would say -- I wouldn't necessary say decline but I think they are pretty stable right now. So I would say about where they are right now. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning. Hi, Andy, how are you? Terry, if I heard you correctly on the earlier part of the call talking about the net interest margin, I think you said you had some maybe couple of basis points improvement due to the recoveries on some bad credits. Could you make sure that's correct that it was a basis point or two? And was that in the energy sector that you had to recover in the credits?", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. So it was two basis points impact from interest recoveries that occurred in this quarter and actually these recoveries relate to loans that were probably charged up as many as 10 years ago. So they went back long ways which is in part why they were so unexpected and unusual. And it's not something that we would expect to repeat. But it was about two basis points for the quarter. So you think we went up six basis points and our core basis of this four and we are really expecting the core basis go up another two in the fourth quarter from there. But it will be flat because of the interest recoveries. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good. Okay and thank you for the clarity. And then second, you guys talked about how the betas for the traditional consumer deposits really are not that high, but you did see some in the commercial area. What about within the Wealth Management segment? Some of the other banks that have reported have pointed out that the betas are rising and that part of their business. Did you guys see any of that in the Wealth Management business?", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. In the wealth management business we've not seen that yet although when we end up looking at the broader consumer sort of category that's the one area that we may start to see when we get into the next rate hike. But we haven't seen anything at this point.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay, good. And then with rising rates, obviously, some of your commercial customers will pay for the services you guys give them with compensating balances, and the credit they receive is reflective of the rate environment. Are you starting to raise those credits for them in a rising rate environment or not yet?", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. A little bit relative to what's going on with short term rate as well as the yield curve overall but I don't -- it's not material yet and we would expect to continue raise and as rates move up. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay. And does that show up in the treasury management fee line? I noticed it was down little bit sequentially. I don't know if that was more seasonal or not. But is that the way where we would see that?", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. Compensating balances show up there and the credit for compensating balances as you said but the decline was more seasonal in nature. ", "Operator", "Next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.", "Terry McEvoy", "Hi, good morning. It was mentioned earlier that US bank is gaining share in the commercial lending business and it sounds like that will likely continue here in the fourth quarter. Could you expand on specifically what's behind those gains? Is it some targeted industries or some specific markets that standout? ", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. This is Terry. Just kind of broadly we are seeing good growth in market share and loans in the middle market space across most of our markets. And we would continue to kind of expect to see although I would say recently we've seen some pay down occurring even in the middle market space so it's something that we are watching. ", "Bill Parker", "Yes. It really relates to the old products that we build out over the last several years in our national corporate strategy. So I think the capabilities in the capital market area for providing bond underwriting not only for our investment grade but also kind of middle market or non investment grade customers. So they can come to us and a more full service bank and that's providing a lot of fuel to the growth. ", "Andy Cecere", "And currently to that point Bill, the other area that I have to highlight is the virtual pay product which is corporate payment system product which is targeted squarely at that middle market customer base as well above that but that one is one of the drivers of the growth that we are seeing is taking additional customers and using that product. ", "Terry McEvoy", "That's good to hear. And then Terry just a quick question for you, within the corporate lines or these equity investment gains that were up $46 million, I believe year-over-year, could you just talk about the nature of those gains and what type of typical run rate would you see in any given quarter?", "Terry Dolan ", "Yes. We typically don't get into a lot of detail with respect to other incomes simply because there is a lot of different things and including the equity investments. Equity investments tend to be a little bit choppy from quarter-to-quarter so it's really I kind of stay away from giving guidance with respect to what I think they're going to be next quarter et cetera. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to the presenters for closing remarks. ", "Jen Thompson", "Thank you for listening to our call this morning. Please call us if you have any follow up comments or questions. ", "Andy Cecere", "Thanks everyone.

Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, and as usual we\u2019ll take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll start with Slide 3.", "In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.97, which included several notable items amounting to $0.09 per share. Let me take a minute to talk about these notable items.", "The tax reform legislation that was passed a few weeks ago is a very positive development that will provide immediate and ongoing benefit to our employees, customers, communities and our shareholders as we invest a portion of our tax savings in each of these important constituencies. As a result of the signing of the legislation, the company recognized a one-time fourth quarter benefit related to the revaluation of our tax-related assets and liabilities of $910 million. In connection with this event, we took the opportunity to make $150 million contribution to our charitable foundation and we accrued $67 million for a special one-time bonus to certain eligible employees. The impact of these two items was approximately $152 million net of tax.", "We also recognized an accrual of $608 million for costs associated with legal and regulatory matters and an investigation discussed in previous filings related to our legacy bank secrecy, anti-money laundering compliance program, and a legacy banking relationship between U.S. Bank and a former customer\u2019s business. U.S. Bank has worked diligently over the past several years to improve and strengthen its AML controls, processes and staff, including increasing compliance staff and making significant investments in systems.", "U.S. Bank embraces the highest standards of integrity, risk management and compliance, and we remain committed to continually improving our controls and processes across the enterprise to protect all of our stakeholders. The 8-K we filed this morning provides additional information on this topic.", "Our earnings per share were $0.88, excluding the notable items. Slide 4 provides highlights of our results. Loan growth was in line with our expectation at 0.8%, credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6.9% from a year earlier. We returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.", "Slide 5 highlights key performance metrics. Our performance, excluding notable items, in the fourth quarter was highlighted by a 13.4% return on average common equity, a 17% return on tangible common equity, and a 1.33% return on average assets. We delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and our efficiency ratio, excluding notable items, was 55.3%.", "Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.", "Terrance Dolan", "Thanks Andy, and good morning. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow up with a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. My remarks will be referencing results excluding the notable items.", "In the fourth quarter, average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 2.6% from a year ago. Commercial loans increased 1.0% sequentially. We continued to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses. Commitment levels increased in the fourth quarter; however; line utilization rates continue at historical low levels and pay down activity remained elevated in the quarter as some borrowers tapped capital markets to fund long-term funding needs. Pay downs also continued to negatively impact our commercial real estate portfolio. We remain prudent in our lending activity in both our construction and commercial mortgage lines, continuing to forego loan opportunities that do not fit our return and risk appetite.", "Primarily as a result of the pay down activity and our prudent view in lending in commercial real estate in general at this time, average total commercial real estate loans declined by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 40 basis point drag to our total average loan growth for the quarter. Retail loan growth of 1.9% was supported by strong growth in installment loans and retail leasing. During the quarter, credit card loans increased 1.4% sequentially, partly reflecting seasonality, and mortgage loans increased 1.0%.", "Turning to Slide 7, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 3.0% year-over-year. Compared with the third quarter, non-interest bearing deposits increased slightly and saving deposits grew 1.4%, reflecting growth in consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform consistently with past experience. We expect the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike will end up between about 30 to 35%. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level; however, the pace toward that level continues to be somewhat slower than we initially anticipated primarily due to lower than expected betas in our consumer deposits.", "On Slide 8, you can see that credit quality was relatively stable compared to the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans declined one basis point on both a linked quarter basis and year-over-year. Non-performing assets declined by 4.0% on a linked quarter basis and were 25% lower than a year ago.", "I will now move onto earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of fourth quarter results versus comparable periods. Record fourth quarter net revenue of $5.6 billion was up 0.5% compared with the third quarter and up 3.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up modestly compared with the third quarter and up 6.4% year over year. Linked quarter and year-over-year growth were both supported by growth in loans and higher loan yields.", "In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% as expected. Excluding interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points to the third quarter margin, the net interest margin would have been unchanged. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income, which increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and 0.4% year-over-year.", "On a year-over-year basis, corporate payments systems revenue grew 10.5% and credit and debit card revenue grew 5.4%, both driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 7.1% mainly due to favorable market conditions and net asset and account growth. Somewhat offsetting this strong fee performance was a 15.8% decrease in mortgage banking revenue driven by lower refinancing activity which impacted production margins for the industry, as well as slightly lower merchant revenue. In line with our previous guidance, merchant processing revenue declined 1% from a year earlier mainly due to the exiting of certain joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017 and the impact of weather events that occurred late in the third quarter of 2017.", "Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The increase in expenses was primarily due to seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects. On a year-over-year basis, expenses grew by 3.6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee benefits expense mainly related to hiring to support business growth and compliance programs. Regulatory and compliance expense growth has slowed in recent quarters and continues to moderate towards the company\u2019s overall expense rate. It\u2019s worth noting that in the fourth quarter, professional services expense decreased 27% versus a year ago, reflecting fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity.", "Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At December 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.1%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.", "I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking guidance. Let me start with a discussion of how our earnings will be positively impacted by tax reform on a go-forward basis.", "Our effective rate in 2018 is expected to be approximately 16% for federal tax purposes plus 3 to 4% for state taxes, or approximately 9% in total. We expect our taxable equivalent to tax rates to decline to about 21.5%. This compares with our taxable equivalent tax rate, excluding notable items, of about 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with our capital management policies, we plan to reinvest approximately 25% of the tax benefit we expect to realize in business growth initiatives, including technology, innovation and business automation, as well as in our employees. Inclusive of these accelerated investments, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2018.", "Now let me shift to first quarter 2018 guidance. We expect net interest income to increase at a mid-single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. Due to the impact of day count, we expect net interest income to be modestly lower on a linked quarter basis as is typically the case in the first quarter. We expect fee income to increase at a low single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. On a linked quarter basis, fee income is typically lower in the first quarter due to seasonally lower credit card and merchant processing sales volumes and seasonally lower deposit service charges. We expect expense growth on a year-over-year basis to be in the mid-single digit range. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense is typically seasonally higher in the first quarter due to higher compensation costs reflecting the timing of merit increases, employee benefits, employee incentive programs, and marketing activities. This is somewhat offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and professional service costs. We expect non-interest expense to increase slightly on a linked quarter basis. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter.", "I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks Terry. We are now 10 years past what, in hindsight, was the beginning of a national crisis. By almost any account, the banking industry has re-emerged stronger, safer, and more nimble. Today the economy appears to be on firm footing. The regulatory environment is becoming more supportive of growth and tax reform will arguable promote job growth, consumer spending, and prolong the growth base of this business cycle.", "Against this backdrop, U.S. Bank is well positioned to win market share in our lending and fee businesses and deliver improving returns on equity while operating with the same risk discipline that has served us well through many credit environments. The delivery of predictable, industry-leading profitability and returns has been a constant over the years, but recently the pace of improvement in these metrics has been limited by headwinds we have faced, some within our control, some out of our control. However, there is reason to believe that these headwinds are starting to abate.", "First, expenses have been higher than we considered normalized primarily due to costs related to addressing our consent order with the OCC. However, the heavy lifting is completed and we expect compliance and regulatory costs to continue to revert towards our overall expense growth trajectory.", "Fee headwinds are starting to shift in our favor. Mortgage refinance activity, which has been a headwind for the industry, is declining at a diminishing pace, and home sales continue to strengthen. Strategic decisions and market challenges depressed our merchant processing in revenue in 2017; however, we remain confident that merchant processing revenue will return to a mid-single digit growth trajectory by the third quarter.", "While diminishing headwinds are beneficial, what we are most optimistic about is the potential for investments that we have previously made in our businesses, as well as investments we plan to make in the future, to increasingly manifest in the form of improving top line revenue growth and profitability. Our corporate payments services business is firing on all cylinders heading into 2018. For the first time in many years, both the commercial business sector, which is benefiting from higher T&E spend, and the government sector are showing good momentum. In our wealth management and investment services businesses, market share gains are being driven by new client growth. In our traditional banking businesses, we are up-tiering our clients in corporate bank and moving up the lead tables in our capital markets businesses.", "On the consumer side, investments over the past several years aimed at enhancing our auto relationships are driving strong market share growth. We are well positioned as one of the few remaining non-captive lessors in the industry and as one of the few financers to offer both a lending and leasing option to our dealers.", "It is clear that past investment spending is delivering the intended results, and we expect to reap those benefits for years to come. Now, because of tax reform, we have the opportunity to accelerate our investment spending. We will target additional technology and innovation spending on the initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging our competitive positioning, with a particular focus on payments, digital and mobile banking, and B2B capabilities. Technology and innovation are core to our long-term strategy for growth, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to advance key initiatives that will support both top line revenue and improved operating efficiencies.", "To wrap up, I believe that 2018 will prove to be a very good year for U.S. Bank, and by that I mean for the entirety of what makes us U.S. Bank - our employees, our customers, our communities, and of course our shareholders.", "That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Your first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Amanda Larsen", "Hi, it\u2019s Amanda Larsen on for Ken.", "Andrew Cecere", "Hi Amanda.", "Amanda Larsen", "Did you all say that your effective tax rate is going to be 19%? Can you go over that again?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, it was 19%.", "Amanda Larsen", "Okay, great. Then the expense outlook, you noted that you\u2019re planning on reinvesting approximately 25% of the benefit, and you noted that there would be an expense growth rate in 1Q18 of mid single digits. Should we expect that for the full year \u201918, we\u2019re going to move to the mid-single digit range in lieu of that 3 to 5% you guys had previously discussed?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes. When we end up looking at expenses for the full year of 2018, because of the reinvestment that we plan on making, you would expect us to be in that mid-single digits and the high end of that range.", "Amanda Larsen", "Okay, thanks. Then also, can you touch upon the growth outlook for \u201918, particularly in deposit service charges area and treasury management? A couple of your competitors have announced some changes - overdraft, making more customer friendly, and then on treasury management, just if you are moving that earnings credit rate yet. Thank you.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, and thanks for the question. From a fee standpoint, so if you think about deposit service charges, we made a lot of those types of changes a while back, and so I wouldn\u2019t see us making any further changes with respect to our fee structure at this particular point in time. We have seen good growth with respect to deposit service charges, and that is really tied to both deposit balance and just growth in terms of consumer accounts.", "In terms of treasury management, treasury management has been a real success story for us this year. We\u2019ve seen good core growth in terms of client relationships throughout the year, and we would continue to expect that that will have a positive impact going into 2018. As deposit rates do rise, though, we would expect that we would be making some adjustment to the earnings credit rate, and that would dampen it a bit.", "Andrew Cecere", "I\u2019d add, Terry, as we think about treasury management, we think about it in combination with corporate payments because they\u2019re really two parts of the same component, and corporate payments in particular has had a wonderful year - 11% growth, both on the government as well as the corporate side. Our virtual pay product is growing 22%, and as we think about the future, there\u2019s going to be that combination of thinking about treasury management together with corporate payments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "John Pancari ", "Good morning.", "Andrew Cecere", "Morning.", "John Pancari", "On the merchant processing side, Andy, I know you indicated that you\u2019re confident you can get back to that mid-single digit growth rate by third quarter. What are you seeing that\u2019s giving you that confidence in the rebound?", "Andrew Cecere", "I\u2019ll ask Terry to add on, but I think the principle reason is two of the impacts this year and this quarter were weather related as well as the exit of the joint ventures that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The weather related will diminish greatly in the first quarter and going forward, and we lap the exit of the joint ventures starting in the second half of \u201918.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, so the impact of those two is about 2.5 to 3%, and again the weather events diminish pretty significantly in the first quarter and then by the end of the second quarter, as Andy said. The other thing we\u2019re seeing is that sales volumes in our merchant acquiring business have been particularly strong. We\u2019re 4%-plus in terms of same store sales, which was good - we saw some nice lift in the fourth quarter, and then our overall sales were about 7.3%, kind of in that ballpark, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing nice growth in terms of new business. We believe that that momentum that we started to create in the merchant acquiring business is going to help us generate that mid single digits by the end of the--by the second half of 2018.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s good. Then on the loan growth side, just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of what you\u2019re thinking about for 2018. Is it fair to assume still around GDP, GDP plus, so 2 to 3% growth in loans as you look at \u201918; and on that front, on commercial real estate, just want to get your updated thoughts on when we could see some stabilization and possibly some growth in that line. Thanks.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, so let me take it first and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Bill. If you think about loan growth, in the near term there is certainly going to be impacts of tax performance. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to forecast, but quite honestly loan growth in the near term is going to be dependent upon the level of pay downs that we see and that sort of activity in the capital markets as corporate customers realign or rebalance their debt structure, the capital structure if you will.", "I think your expectation of GDP, kind of in that range or a little plus of that is a good or reasonable estimate as you think about the full year, but in the near term it\u2019s going to be impacted by some of the things that we see in terms of customer behavior.", "Bill Parker", "I\u2019ll pick up on your question on commercial real estate. The commercial mortgage line, which has seen decreases for the last several quarters, I think that\u2019s a function of the interest rate environment. Once we get through this rate increase environment, see more stabilization there, I think we\u2019ll be more able to build that book. On the construction side, we are seeing some positive growth on our residential construction area. We\u2019ve been expanding that into the southeast and we\u2019re hopeful with the tax bill that perhaps multi-family should come back, so we\u2019re looking forward to being aggressive in that area in \u201918.", "Terrance Dolan", "Then John, maybe the last thing I would just add in terms of loan growth is that in the latter half of 2017, and I think with tax reform, we are seeing momentum in terms of consumer spend and consumer activity, and I think that that bodes well with respect to loan growth on the retail side.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.", "Scott Siefers", "Morning guys.", "Andrew Cecere", "Morning Scott.", "Scott Siefers", "A quick question just on the mid-single digit expense growth for \u201918. Just so I\u2019m clear, can you give maybe the dollar amount off which--for 2017 off which you\u2019re basing the mid-single digit growth expectation?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, I think if you end up looking at our growth rate this year, it was a little bit above 5% on a year-over-year basis, and we expected that to continue to improve excluding the tax reform and some of the reinvestment that we end up making. With that tax reform, that really is kind of what causes us to think we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range, or in the mid-single digits.", "Andrew Cecere", "I think, Terry, when we\u2019re talking about the base for that, it is off of the numbers excluding notable items, which I think is about $12.1 billion of expense.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, yes.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay, perfect. Yes, that clarifies it. I appreciate it. Then I think you guys said in the prepared remarks that you would expect positive operating leverage excluding the investments. I guess that implies revenue growth somewhere at or below the mid-single digits?", "Terrance Dolan", "No Scott, we expect positive operating leverage including the investments - including the investments.", "Scott Siefers", "Oh, including - okay. All right, good. I appreciate that clarification. Just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly, and I did not, so. That\u2019s it for me, so I appreciate it.", "Terrance Dolan", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Kevin Barker", "Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the innovation spending that you\u2019re making, and when you think about the range of mid-single digit growth rates, can you put some parameters around that?", "Andrew Cecere", "Our focus is going to be on the things I talked about, which is digital, mobile banking, B2B, brand, continuing our expansion of our customer base and our customer experience, and as well as our employees, and we talked about the increased $15 minimum wage. But those are all the things we\u2019re talking about, and as you think about what we\u2019ve been doing, our success is really dependent on continuing to innovate and continuing to deliver the very best customer experience, so those are the things we\u2019re focused on that, over time, will continue to drive the growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing.", "Then Terry, in that mid-single digits, we\u2019re talking around 5% or so in terms of expenses, right?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, that\u2019s right.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay, and then in regards to the flow through into 2019, 2020, will you start to return back to your longer term target 3 to 5% expense growth rate, or do you feel like that will continue for the next couple years?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes Kevin, maybe let me take that. If you think about incremental investments that you\u2019re making, there\u2019s kind of an arc, and I think about it over kind of a two or three-year time frame, making the investments today and you start to see the revenue benefit in that second half of the second year and then into the third year. So when we think about 2019 and 2020, we have to kind of think about that arc, if you will. I do believe that as you get down to the 2020 time horizon, you\u2019re going to see that incremental revenue that\u2019s going to be impacting the business positively, but the double benefit of that is that with the digital initiatives that we have going on, we also would expect to see efficiencies come from those investments as well, following that sort of time horizon.", "Andrew Cecere", "And importantly, Terry, as you said, we\u2019re looking at this from both a revenue and an expense perspective, and we\u2019re making the additional investments to grow the revenue, and to simply say that we\u2019re going to manage both sides of that equation, the positive operating leverage in \u201918,\u201919, \u201920 and going forward.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Terrance Dolan", "Thanks Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Ricky ", "Hi, this is actually Ricky from Matt\u2019s team. Sorry if I missed this, but I\u2019m wondering if you could touch a bit on NIM outlook for the year, both with and without additional hikes, and the puts and takes there.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, given all the moving parts, Ricky, I think one of the things we\u2019re going to focus really on is giving guidance with respect to net interest income, so when we think about net interest income going into next year, we would expect growth pretty similar to what we see this year, fee income growth being a little bit stronger. That net interest income growth is going to be driven by our expectations around loan growth and just the rising rate environment.", "Ricky", "Got it, and then maybe one follow-up. It looks like securities ticked up a bit this quarter. Wondering if you could talk a bit about that and what the trajectory for the securities book should look like in 2018. Is that going to track overall balance sheet growth, or what\u2019s the thinking there?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, the way that we end up managing our investment portfolio is really from a liquidity management standpoint, and that will track very consistently with the growth in average earning assets.", "Ricky", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Terrance Dolan", "Hey Erika.", "Andrew Cecere", "Morning.", "Erika Najarian", "Good morning. My first question is just on the regulatory backdrop. It seems like there is bipartisan momentum to pass some amendments to Dodd-Frank, and obviously the Senate version has a dollar threshold of $250 billion. I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of share some feedback - does that simply mean if the new threshold for SIFI is $250 billion that nothing changes for U.S. Bank, or does that put you in a different tier in terms of SIFI rules?", "Andrew Cecere", "My expectation, Erika, is that we would see limited changes to the U.S. Bank. As a reminder, we\u2019re above $250 billion but we don\u2019t have a SIFI buffer on the capital component. We\u2019re already at the capital levels. We have the processes in place for CCAR and stress testing, so I expect limited change or impact to our company.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Just as a follow up to Ricky\u2019s question, could you share embedded in your positive operating leverage guidance how many rate hikes you presume for 2018, and also the shape of the curve for 2018?", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, so when we\u2019re thinking about 2018, we expect that we\u2019re going to see rate hikes, probably a couple rate hikes, and then one in December, so we\u2019ll see two kind of midyear, and then in terms of the yield curve, we kind of established our plan or our forecast based upon where the yield curve was in that mid-December time frame, and as you know, recently it\u2019s steepened a little bit but I think there\u2019s probably going to be movement up and down in terms of where that yield curve is. There\u2019s going to be pressure, and I think it\u2019s probably going to flatten a bit as rates rise during the year as well.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it, thank you.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thanks Erika.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "David Long", "Morning everyone.", "Terrance Dolan", "Hey David.", "David Long", "Just wanted to get your thoughts on any potential competing away of any of the tax benefits, whether that happens in 2018 or further on down the road.", "Terrance Dolan", "Yes, so this is Terry. When you think about tax reform, I think how it ends up getting utilized, we talked about the reinvestment; but the competition in terms of pricing, we obviously live in a pretty dynamic environment. I do think that there is going to be some bleed that will take place because of competitive pricing, but I also expect that that\u2019s going to take place over time and it\u2019s probably going to be a little bit different, depending upon the product and the service and the customer segment that you have. Obviously, we operate in a pretty competitive environment, so ultimately how much gets competed away will be dependent upon that competition.", "I would say that if you think about the last 10 years, though, the industry has run at lower return levels because it\u2019s been real difficult to price in things like regulatory costs and the cost of capital and liquidity, and all sorts of things. So I do think that especially for some period of time, the banking industry is going to try to recapture some of that in terms of its returns, and as a result from a competitive standpoint I think that will be a little bit delayed.", "David Long", "Got it, appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Again if you would like to ask a question, press star, one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from Brian Klock with KBW. Your line is open.", "Brian Klock", "Good morning everyone.", "Terrance Dolan", "Hi Brian.", "Brian Klock", "I have a question, I guess probably for Bill. Talking about the CRE pay downs, I noticed that there was a tick-up in charge-offs after being in a net recovery position in the CRE book for a while. Can you talk about that? I think the note was related to enclosed malls that were written down, so can you give us a little bit of color on that?", "Bill Parker", "Sure. Well, obviously at this point in the cycle, you eventually run out of the recovery, so we\u2019re pretty much there on the CRE book. On the enclosed malls, we do have a smaller portfolio of what I\u2019d call small market enclosed malls, and I think some of those were more harder hit with this shift to online, so that\u2019s where we saw that. The overall portfolio is about $700 million, but we don\u2019t expect that to continue each quarter. We just had a couple of deals this quarter that we had to deal with.", "Brian Klock", "All right, great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. A follow-up question for Andy, I guess - thinking about the legal settlement or the legal accrual that you had in the quarter related to BSA AML, and I know you guys have spent a lot of money and a lot of effort to remediate that, can you give us an update on where you stand, or where you think you stand with that regulatory order?", "Andrew Cecere", "Yes, that hasn\u2019t changed, Brian. We completed most of the--all of the systems integration and process and build, as well as the people and process at the end of 2017, and we\u2019re now on a sustainability phase of it and we will continue to be in there for the first half of \u201918, which is really ensuring that the processes we\u2019ve put in place are acting and performing as expected.", "Brian Klock", "Okay, so it\u2019s possible maybe back half of \u201918, you could be looking or being able to pursue bank acquisitions again? Is that reasonable, or is this something we should think about for \u201919?", "Andrew Cecere", "You know, that\u2019s dependent upon the regulator, certainly, but we are doing everything on our end to make sure we\u2019re performing as well as we can. As I said, I think we have all the processes and systems and people in place, now it\u2019s just a matter of going through it and ensuring that they\u2019re working appropriately.", "I would also remind you that the M&A activity that we\u2019ve been focused on has been not related to the AML consent order of things, like card portfolios, payments, and trust activities. We\u2019ll continue to look at those items.", "Brian Klock", "Right. Helpful, and thanks for your time.", "Andrew Cecere", "Thank you, Brian.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Jennifer Thompson", "Thank you everyone for listening to our call.
