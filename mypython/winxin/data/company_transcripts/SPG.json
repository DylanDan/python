Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We got a great start to the year, we continue to achieve strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We opened two new international outlets in April. We amended and extended our $4 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our strong financial flexibility. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.74 per share, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a net benefit of $0.08 in FFO per share from a gain on the sale of two residential assets. Normalizing the FFO per share growth rate for the gain in the prior-year period, FFO per share increased approximately 7.5%.", "We believe the FFO per share consensus for the first quarter did not include an estimate of our share of the losses from A\u00e9ropostale, which is typical for a retailer in the first quarter. Our share of those operating losses in the first quarter was $0.03. Even though on an annual basis, we measure ourselves versus our plan, and not first-call estimates, let's put in perspective that we have beaten first-call estimates 42 out of the last 44 quarters. The only two misses were one-time write-offs, in 2009, which was the year of The Great Recession. This is an unprecedented performance for the REIT industry, and the S&P 500.", "Now, let's go to operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for our space across the portfolio, as evidenced by our mall and premium outlets occupancy end of the quarter at 95.6%, which was flat year-over-year. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimum rent was $51.87, up 4.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.31 per square foot an increase of 13%.", "Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $615 per foot compared to $613 per foot in the prior year period, an increase of 30 basis points. We are pleased to see retail sales increased from the prior year as well as the seasonally strong fourth quarter, also please keep in mind that Easter was in April this year compared to March of last year, which has a real impact on our many leading tourist oriented properties.", "Total portfolio NOI increased a very strong 5.6%, or over $80 million for the first quarter and comp increased a strong 3.8% for the quarter. Our best properties are industry-leading assets and large markets and drive the cash flow, growth and profitability of our business. We understand that many of you believe that standard operating metrics just mentioned are of most interest. However, it is important to remember that each of those metrics reflecting equal weighting of each of the properties across our portfolio.", "We believe it is important to understand our operating metrics on an NOI weighted basis, which more truly reflects the performance of the portfolio. With that said, if we had done that, reported retailer sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $765 compared to the $615, the average base minimum rent would be $67.60 compared to $51.87.", "Leasing spreads would increase to 16.4% compared to the 13%. We have the largest portfolio of the highest quality retail real estate in our industry. These high quality properties drive the growth and cash flow of our business, and what and where retailers want to be located and consumers want to shop and create memorable experience. These weighted metrics clearly demonstrate the highly \u2013 higher quality nature and more accurately reflect the health of our portfolio.", "At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 25 properties across all three platforms with our share of net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. Construction continues on several major ones, which we've mentioned before, including the Galleria in Houston, La Plaza Mall, Woodbury Common, and Allen Premium Outlets, most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months.", "Subsequent to the quarter end, we opened two new international outlets with our partner Shinsegae Group, we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in Seoul, South Korea, this center is our fourth premium outlet and build upon its tremendous success we've enjoyed in the region. And with our partner McArthurGlen, we opened Provence Designer Outlet, the first luxury designer outlet in the South of France, construction continues on another full-price development at Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, Neiman Marcus recently opened and the mall will open in the fall of this year.", "And we have three new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, two in international markets including Malaysia and Canada. Our share of those four is approximately $300 million. Last week with our partner McArthurGlen, we also acquired Rosada Designer Outlet, a leading outlet center in Netherlands with significant growth opportunity. Just turning quickly to our capital markets, we are very busy as usual, we refinanced our $4 billion revolving credit with the 2022 maturity date our fortress balance sheet with access to many forms of capital continues to differentiate us among our peer group.", "Our liquidity stands at more than $7 billion. During the quarter, we also extended our $2 billion share repurchase, and we repurchased 870,000 shares of our common stock. And today we announced a dividend of $1.75 for the quarter, which again is an increase of 9.4% year-over-year.", "Finally, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance in the range of $11.45 to $11.55 per share, which is approximately 6% growth compared to our comparable FFO per share growth, which we believe will lead our retail real estate industry peers. This expected growth is a testament to the strength of our company and our ability to actively manage our portfolio to provide industry-leading returns to our shareholders, even in the current choppy retail environment. We now welcome your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good morning. Good morning out there.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey, how are you?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I'm doing great. I'm doing great.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "We can hear that. We can hear that in your voice. So, quickly David, first, you guys have a long track record of beating and raising guidance, but you've equally been upfront about the challenges out there in the market. So, just very curious, the no-raise in full-year guidance this year is that because, yeah, there is more A\u00e9ro post-out losses that potentially come up this year as you run that business? Or is it just general caution or you're seeing some things out there as your leasing folks come back or operations people come back that give you a little bit of pause?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look, I would say, the entire \u2013 again, 42 out of 44, that's 11 years, is that 11 years guys?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That's 11 years.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That's 11 years, okay. So, the missed from first call consists was entirely A\u00e9ro, which is very typical for a retailer to have operating losses in the first quarter. So, I would \u2013 in answer to your question simply, it's a little bit of both. I mean A\u00e9ro is a fourth quarter business for \u2013 like most retailers. And there is a range of outcomes there, we're still very comfortable with our investment but there is a range of outcomes that's a little harder to predict. So we're being a little more cautious in that front.", "And then obviously on the retail front, I mean, we've got some retailers that were trying to navigate exactly what might happen and so we're being a little more cautious on that front. We're not backing off our comp NOI number even with that uncertainty in the retail world and we'll see. But, I mean, we're not backing off on it, and I'm optimistic that we'll continue to perform very well.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. And then the second question is, you guys made the lifetime fitness announcement, but just curious, in general, yeah, you spoke in the past about a lot of apparel brands in the malls and the need to diversify, but at the same time there is also a consumer that's much more fickle they don't, yeah, I mean, there was a Neiman Marcus article, but the shopper is much more conscientious about where they are.", "Overall, one, the ability for you guys to really diversify out of apparel into other uses of the mall, how is that going; and two, are you seeing the brands themselves get more serious about understanding that the consumer has changed and therefore full price as full price may not just work anymore, they need to invest more, are you seeing the retailers themselves adapt?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I'm hopeful that the retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience and that could be a lot of different ways, that could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel, that could be through better merchandise et cetera. Now, I will tell you, I mean, this is the great narrative that is being absolutely ignored by the national media. And I continue to tour properties each and every week as does Rick, as does our team, the traffic is there. It's so funny when all the malls go out of business, what are these poor people going to do instead of going to the mall. I don't know, I mean, I just think the narrative is a way ahead of itself, the traffic is strong, it was up throughout our portfolio were we measure it, but you know at the end of the day, we've all got to have a better experience for the consumer, because they're tough nut to crack. We also need a growing economy. I mean our GDP growth is going to be anybody's guess, what's your guess, Alex?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "GDP something probably in the 2%, a little over 2%.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, what is it for this first \u2013 what is that for this first quarter?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "It's subdued. It's subdued, but if we get anything out of DC, it should be better.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I mean, I have been waiting a lot of stuff for DC, I'm still waiting for the internet sales taxation fairness to kick-in. So, the reality is people are going to the good centers, traffic is up, our sales even with Easter being in April are up. Our NOI is up, our comp NOI is 3.8%, we've certainly got some retailers that have not performed the way they wanted to or should have, a lot of that was driven by the private equity leveraging up. These businesses more than just the common theme, which is the internet. I'm hopeful that they're going to reinvest in their stores, improve their inventory mix, and service their customer better.", "And, by the way, we've got to have the same pressure on us to do that. So, it's a two-way street. We are up for the challenge. We have the conviction in our business to do that as you know if you go through our properties by and large, they look they feel great. We're going to redevelop a lot of opportunities. I think any department stores, if and when we get back, are great opportunity for the company. King of Prussia is a great example, Penney's announced closing. We could have saved that deal, we decided absolutely unequivocally not. We're going to make that a mixed-use development, won't be apparel-oriented. So again, we're frustrated only by the narrative, but not by what's happening in our business.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thank you. I'm here with Craig Schmidt. David, Rick, to be a little bit more specific on the retailers, there have been many more plans announced for spending in bricks-and-mortar for closings. I guess, can we be a little bit more specific and help us, provide your latest view, are you happy with the current announcements, is it enough because the last couple of years you have been asking for this?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we don't \u2013 we really do not comment \u2013 I'm not sure I understand your question. But we really don't \u2013 we don't think this is a good form to comment on retail specific issues. As I said, there are things I'm happy to comment on like, we are \u2013 apparel has been in the doldrums, we are moving our mix away from that, I think we've done that already, we've lowered it Rick by...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That was 5% or 6%.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. We've lower that already. We do think private equity has been more of a detriment to our and by the way most of these guys are my buddies, okay. But I mean, when you lever up, you lever up any business, whether it's the mall business, the retail business, and you can't invest in your product, then you got a problem. We've seen a lot of that. I'm happy to talk to you about that trend, but I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to sit here and comment on specific retailers, I'm not really sure Jeff what you're after, explain it?", "Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I guess, are you feeling better now that the retailers are finally talking about specific investments in the stores pruning some of their portfolios, it feels like finally they are taking some action before, or Craig and I said, it is a little confusing to figure out, are these winning formulas or not?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think my concern about how they overspent in the Internet versus the store fleet continues to be a concern for me. But I do think they're starting given that the returns in the online between free shipping and free returns is no man's land form and the price transparency and no service add, value add, I hopefully, they'll recognize that they should pivot toward the in-store experience.", "And I think that's beginning to happen. I also think as I've mentioned to you in the past that there is a number of Internet \u2013 pure Internet retailers that will not be able to really sustain their business model and my humble opinion unless they have a physical presence. So, they're still cleaning out to do and we will suffer from that like anybody else, but at the end of the day, if there is less retail space in the United States and I expect there to be, so I'm not suggesting that it won't be, we will be the net beneficiary of that because of the vastness of our portfolio and scale helps and a big balance sheet helps.", "So we've got $7 billion of capital ready to go to work in whatever form we can do to increase our profitability. And so we'll weather the storm like we have in the past, we've done some of our best work when it's the most foggiest and that's what we do, and that's why we're making $11.50, that's why that's the REIT's highest per share number and that's why dividends grow more than anybody else, and I don't know what else to tell you, that's what we do.", "I'm not \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. Do we have to work to get to the 3%? You're darn right, but we put that pressure on us each and every year and yeah, sometimes we don't get to the finish line, but we get pretty damn close most of the time. So again, I have no idea if I'm answering your question, but that's what we do.", "Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That helps, thanks. And Craig has just one quick question.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, great. Thanks. Just given the strength and shift to some of the value and discount retailers. I'm wondering if we may see the introduction of more value off price like Marshalls at Del Amo and T.J. HomeGoods at Prien Lake Mall.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think there'll be a little bit more of that for sure. They do a great job, a lot of the discounters. And I think there is a great opportunity for us to bring them in into the mall environment. Not \u2013 you wouldn't want to do it in every mall environment, but certainly there is a handful of malls that make sense to do that and I do think that will continue. And look, reality is \u2013 the mall \u2013 and again, this is what frustrates us is that the traffic that we see in the malls is good. So yeah, we can always point out to a mall that's gone out of business or the mall that's done, that's got no traffic, like we can at hotel, like we can \u2013 movie company that makes movies and they have a flop, doesn't mean all movies are a flop. It just means that one movie they have is a flop.", "We could talk about network TV and talk about the lineup that all they have and they have a new show that's a flop. Well, it's conceivable that in our portfolio we have a couple of flops, but it's immaterial. That's why we gave you those weighted NOI statistics to reinforce that. But the reality is that we do think that in some of these properties, we will be able to bring in some of that \u2013 because I think some of these centers that they're in and the strip center will might suffer a little bit, and they're going to go where the traffic is. And in most cases it's the mall environment, not everyone, but in most cases.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, it's Michael Bilerman. The good news is Mall Cop and this is not a flop.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The Mall Cop, the number two wasn't that great, but I think the first one was pretty good.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. So, David, strategically over the years, you've been able to adapt to different cycles, right. You're very early on in the consolidation wave, focusing on these big major market malls. You got into the outlet business, when you bought Chelsea, you bought Mills, enhancing sort of all the value retail. You sold off or spun-off certain lower-quality weaker malls, lower productivity smaller assets. You expanded globally and you had a rock-solid balance sheet.", "So as we think about adapting to the cycle, where is your main focus? Is it adapting and putting more mixed use at your properties? Is it may be going further global? Do you want to focus on other forms of retail, and I don't know maybe get back into the strip center business? Is it really focusing on this whole model of the future and the consumer experience in taking ownership of the consumer at your mall? I guess \u2013 or is it something completely else? How should we be thinking about your next adaptation to the cycle?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well it's very, very good question. So, let's just talk about our businesses in those segments. Our European and Asian business is actually very strong. So that's good news. Our outlet business and mills business continues to prosper, continues to have very good comp NOI growth. And the mall business generally is dealing with a lot of the retailers that we generally understand and know that are out there in the public. However, the great opportunity I think in that business will continue to be reclaiming the department stores and our opportunity to redevelop them that will further expand the mix, whether it's mixed use, whether it's lifetime, whether it's some community-oriented activity. But I think that's going to be a big focus for us is, how do we take advantage of the department store, we do and I think Sandeep has done a very good job explaining this, we do probably have too many department stores in each, in the mall business.", "And so, but instead of looking that as a concern, given that they pay no rent, we actually think that's a great opportunity for our redeveloping the mall to the next level. And again, I don't think there is any cookie-cutter answer, but since they don't provide any income, there is nothing but upside in how we redevelop and redevelop those assuming we get the appropriate return on cost.", "So, I would certainly say that's a very important phase what we've got to focus on. And I'd say the next very important phase is we do continue to bring technology into the mall environment, just like many retailers are bringing technology hopefully to their in-store environment. And I think what that will do is make the shopping trip more convenient, more productive, and they'll gain more knowledge by going through the mall. And we've right now under development in a pretty significant way to deliver product, probably realistically a year from now that might facilitate that with also collecting the data, that's important to be able to communicate directly with the consumer. So I would say, those are two areas.", "And then obviously, we're going to be opportunistic, that's just the way we are. There are no current plans to be opportunistic, but that's just part of our core culture here is to try and be opportunistic when we can.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "All right. My second question is, you talked about the narrative that effectively every models did despite the traffic in sales that are going on in your assets. And I'm curious, if you can share with us some of the tone of your leasing discussions with both the bricks-and-mortar retailers that are expanding and want to open stores and how those discussions or negotiations are going with the overarching negative narrative that's out there. But also discuss how those discussions are going with the pure e-tailers that are expanding their bricks-and-mortar presence? And whether there's a difference, clearly the narrative is only on one-sided with all these tenants that are shrinking their store base or going bankrupt. Clearly there has to be some positive to produce the sales of a traffic that you're talking about?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And I want Rick to answer that. But again, the ones that essentially, if you really cut through it all, the ones that aren't surviving in a tough REIT apparel environment or the ones that were highly levered and had the imprint of private equity on it, okay. And again, I'm going to get a lot of criticism from all my buddies, but that's the truth. So if you look at kind of where that pressure point has been, it's more than just our apparel business is bad, it's because, well, they couldn't survive with leverage on it. They paid a special dividend, they bought stock back, they did some financial maneuvering that increased the pressure that wouldn't allow them to deal with a kind of non-robust meddling environment.", "With that said, I'd like Rick to comment on the rest of it.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I would tell you Michael, the key as in all of these things is the person with the most compelling properties is going to win and all you have to do is, visit some of our properties like King of Prussia, ,like Galleria, like Sawgrass Mills, like Woodbury across the four platforms and you will see new retailers, both the e-tailers and the international retailers and our existing brands and new designer brands that all wanted to take advantage of the space that is becoming available either because we created it, because we took back space from underproductive retailers or we consolidated those on productive retailers into more productive space to free up space. There is still very compelling demand out there across each of the ones that you talked about. Are we fighting about rent? Sure. But we've been fighting with our tenants about rent for 40 years, that doesn't change.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you, guys.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. I've just a couple of questions. Maybe Rick and David, just to kind of follow that theme on leasing. I know occupancy was flat year-over-year, but you had a little bit of a bigger decline sequentially. I know that there is always a decline sequentially, but it seems to be a little bit bigger and probably stems from some of the bankruptcies. Can you maybe just talk or help quantify, how much of that space has been released and do you have any kind of occupancy goals that you can share with us for the end of the year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Steve, I would just simply say the metrics are the metrics we focus more on comp NOI growth. And I mean, obviously, if you go back in a little bit of 2015 we had more bankruptcies than 2016. This year, we'll probably have more in 2017 and certainly 2016. And some of these are still in a state of flux. So, I would not want to like tell you where our occupancy is, other than to say we haven't backed off the comp NOI number of three.", "Like I said, we're got a lot of work to continue to do, but that comment I would say first quarter in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, I mean that's just the way we look at our business. So, that's the number that we're more focused on than sales per square foot, rents spreads, and occupancy, it's all manifest itself. You put it all in a blender and it all manifests itself into one number and that's the number that I care about.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Right, I think \u2013 well, now I understand that, I think just to the extent that there was maybe a step or step-and-a-half back and people just want to see the progress moving forward, which obviously will manifest itself in NOI growth. I think if there was just a way to help quantify how much of that's maybe already been put to better lease, might just give some clarity that leasing remains strong, but...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look we're making deals, I mean and we're moving the pile. If we worth-making deals given the bankruptcies and the store closures that we're dealing with, we couldn't produce the 3% comp NOI number, that we weren't doing new business. So that's how I would answer that. I mean, again, I don't \u2013 we don't look at occupancy the way you might and I'm not disrespecting how you might look at it. I'm just telling you, the way we run our businesses for comp NOI or cash flow growth and we're not \u2013 if we didn't have any new lease up given the bankruptcy and store closures that exist in our industry, we wouldn't be able to get to that 3%. So I hope that gives you at least some trend as to how we feel about leasing up some of that space.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. Okay. I guess, secondly, you've mentioned traffic strong and it's upwards measured and you said it's good. Do you have any sort of stats you could share and if you've done anything sort of technology-wise in the malls to help quantify this and if you have, is that data that you'll be sharing with us over time to perhaps comment (34:43)", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, you know how I feel. I think we have given you plenty of data, okay. So the odds of us giving you more data are not great, but I will tell you that in the \u2013 we don't have traffic counters in every mall, but we have in a good percentage of our malls and I standby that traffic comment, we have parking counters in our outlet business and when you factor in through April and I had it somewhere but I can't find it. If we have it through April, our traffic overall in \u2013 because it's important to remember, March had Easter of last year. The traffic \u2013 the parking counters in our outlet business is up one or, I'm sorry, Rick now has the number in front of me, 2%. So that gives you a barometer when you look at, if it was through March in the outlet business, it would be essentially \u2013 we look at it by region, be essentially flat. But it's up 2% given the \u2013 if you go all the way through Easter in April.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And I guess just last question. As you think about sort of CapEx and what you need to spend to kind of maintain malls or to keep the cash flow growing, do you get a sense that there may be a higher level of CapEx that's needed to generate that 3% compounded CapEx. And do you sense that the returns on the boxes that you may recapture might change possibly to the downside as you take these stores back?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I don't think so at all because we're up against very little income against those boxes. So it's a function of what you pay for them and what the income is and the last thing we'll do is hold. I mean, that's not to say we don't make silly decisions here. But we know we can back into what the right number is to buy that box. Like King of Prussia, we get it for free. It's a lease. The lease ends, I think, in 2020. And they're going to pay the rent all the way through it, which is great, we get to redo our plans, maybe we'll get the mat early, but that's all given that lease payment, I mean that's a lot of upside. So, I think it's possible a deal here or there, it might be, but that's always been the case, and Steve as you know, we spent a lot of capital in the portfolio to upgrade the look and feel.", "We're going to continue to do that, the worst thing that we can do and this is a comment for everyone. And the whole \u2013 is not invest in our business, that's the worst thing you can do. And I've seen it, and I don't care if it's a hotel, an office building, a movie business, the network business, the internet business, if you don't invest in your product, you can't continue to produce returns, that's the nature of Corporate America.", "And so, we're going to continue to invest, I think the returns will be there, and I don't think the dynamics of today's current environment have changed that. So, that's what we see, but again if something changes, I think it's a fair question and if we feel a trend there we'll start to set expectations differently.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That's it from me.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Your line is open.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Just on the buyback, we've talked in the past about kind of how the role you see stock buybacks and how you used in the past with around specific catalyst. And maybe you could just comment on the buyback in the first quarter and given where your evaluation is, how you think about that as a use of your free cash flow relative to redevelopments and other uses?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, the good news is, we'll not crowd out our investment in our product. That's the most important thing you cannot do. And we've seen it as an example at the department store level where stock buybacks have crowded out store investment. We will not let that happen. On the other hand, we have spent a lot of capital on our portfolio. You know kind of what we expect there. And other than \u2013 I think the first quarter should continue to give you an expectations of what we'll continue to do. Obviously, the price is lower. And you do come into a blackout period that you're all familiar with. That has almost gone. And we think, I mean, you can do the math, we believe in our business, we believe in our product, we can do both and we will do both.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. So, this is sort of \u2013 you see right now at least at kind of these levels, there is sort of a recurring role to play for the buyback alongside your other CapEx initiatives? That's fair?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think that's a fair assessment.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. And then just kind of secondly, a lot of people kind of have concerns about the outlet industry just because of what seems to be a disproportionate share of the apparel and accessories retailers, which has been a tough segment more broadly, and I was wondering, because you lump them together, broadly \u2013 although, I appreciate the traffic comment, if you could talk about maybe, whether there is much of a disparity in terms of kind of the momentum there from, I think, same-store NOI perspective? And then maybe, if Rick is able to provide some of the retailers who are sort of kind of taking space that, it might be coming back from other segments that are liquidating investment like that...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up, because we've heard this like, chatter. Absolutely, unequivocally the business is strong. It's so far from the chatter, I don't really know how to react other than we can start breaking out statistics again and my goodness, we'd like to be viewed in totality about our entity as opposed to a bunch of statistics, but the reality is absolutely not, it's that chatter is inaccurate, the only pressure that we've seen in the outlet business, which we've been consistent in describing, is we have a number of tourist-oriented centers, and given the strong dollar, we continue to see muted spending because the tourism and all of the psychology of coming to America is different than it was maybe a few months ago. We're dealing with that, but if you isolate those, it's absolutely au contraire, I wanted to show people, if all my years of going to Paris, I can speak French, and no, that chatter is just wildly false. So, I don't know, what else to tell you.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "I was just wondering if Rick can maybe talk about something that were (43:20) growing in that segment in particular?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean you garble there.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Oh, sorry, I was just seeing if Rick could maybe talk about any of the retailers that are sort of taking space like he's done in the past, but particularly focused on the outlet side?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The answer is I could, in fact I have a list here of them, I could take up the rest of the call with the names, but because David always makes fun of me when I rattle off names, I'll be very limited. But things to bear in mind with our outlet business, we have some of the greatest outlet centers in the world. So literally we're getting international designer tenants that are opening their first, second or third outlet store in the world at our properties. But we're having the more people that are in bulk; ASICS, Citizen, Scotch & Soda, (44:10) I could go on and on, I literally have a paper in front of me of probably 150 names, and one of the reasons it's so strong is because the occupancy has been so high, this is the first time we've had even a little inventory that we can accommodate all the people that want to grow. So it is just not an issue whatsoever with demand.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And I think an important point is that the value oriented, I mean, you can get discounted goods a lot of places and it certainly proliferated, but to the consumer having them all together in a nice pretty coherent layout is why consumers will travel to our outlet centers and shop and I will tell you this. The comp NOI growth in our outlet business exceeded the mall business, okay. So, I've heard this chatter, I don't know where it's coming from but I'm here to officially refute it.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning. You and your retail peers don't report same-store revenue and expense growth, just NOI. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on those two pieces of revenue versus expenses? How they've been trending? It seems like some of your NOI growth maybe more attributable to the expense savings side versus revenue growth?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That's incorrect. You see our P&L. You can analyze it. That I thought that's your job.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Then on the same-store NOI, you guys did have a strong first quarter which is above your full-year guidance of 3%. So, I was just wondering, if we should expect a slowdown later in the year or if you're more just sticking to the previously laid-out guidance of 3%?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think I already answered that question a couple of times. And we've affirmed our guidance, that's really all that I need to answer on that front.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Then just last one on the development pipeline, mall redevelopments and the grand of (46:46) outlets have been a traditional good growth drivers? So I was just wondering what your outlook is for new outlet supply and to what extent also separate from your (46:57) JV, you might be able to be proactive with some of your Sears stores?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, on the outlet side, we've got a very interesting pipe. I think in Asia, we've got a very interesting pipe with McArthurGlen. We're hopeful to start a new project in Spain here in the next couple of months and I think the investment community should realize, we have a really strong business outside of the U.S. and it's worth much more than what it's on our books, okay? But, put that aside. So, there is a nice pipe through McArthurGlen. And by the way, we just open a new center in Provence, which is \u2013 which we own 90% of and that's no small feat to accomplish in France, and we have our partner McArthurGlen to thank for that.", "We have a very nice pipe in Asia, very nice pipe in France. We will have one project that we'll probably start construction in the next couple of months in the U.S., which we'll announce shortly. And then, we've got a couple of more that are in the works that will probably won't start till 2017 \u2013 I'm sorry, 2018 for 2019 delivery.", "So, we continue to look for opportunities on this \u2013 there is nothing more than what we do is plan for potential department store redevelopments. And we're working both on sourcing the demand and then ultimately, trying to get the boxes back and that's an ongoing process that will continue to be. But we think that will be beneficial to the company in the long run.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Someone has to go back to that CapEx question. And you have a lot of great information on your supplemental. But one thing that isn't very clear is how much CapEx, quarter-to-quarter you're having to payout to get that 3% or 3.8% same-store NOI or those leasing spreads? So, I was curious, how has that trended over time, and he (49:27) was talking about retailers investment in their stores, but are you incrementally having to find that maybe you help \u2013 you have to help them out with that part of process?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, this is Rick. Frankly, though the thing I think you're probably referring to is our tenant allowances and if you look, they've been relatively consistent over a very long period of time, we give virtually no allowance on our renewals. We tell you the allowances that we do on a per square foot basis for our new leases and happily this quarter it happened to be a little higher, because we're able to do a lot of great leasing for some very high impact tenants, and so it's a little more allowance, but as David has said consistently all that is built into our NOI growth, and it is consistent with where we've been over a long period of time.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. So nothing on the margin, that's changing at all?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, I mean, it moves from quarter-to-quarter, but no, we don't \u2013 we \u2013 here's you got to put companies in \u2013 you got to think a little bit broad, Kim. There if we were loosey-goosey with our capital, we wouldn't have the best balance sheet in the business with the most fire power. So we don't buy upper end, we don't throw capital after tenants that may fail, that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes but we \u2013 there is just no change in our approach to that, and it will never change, and that's why see these things are related, right. That's why you have \u2013 that's why we have the balance sheet here as because, you're right, it is all about capital allocation. It is all about not putting good money in the rabbit hole. And we are not perfect there. We make mistakes. We do take chances every once in a while. But there's just no trend there, it's just not what we do as a company and I'm \u2013 would have hoped that seeing us operate for this long period of time, you would understand that.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And just a second question, going back to your comments about technology. From a consumer standpoint, when I go into a \u2013 you might not like this, but when I go into a Westfield mall or a Simon mall, I think, from a consumers perspective, it doesn't \u2013 you can't really tell a difference, right? And why I say that because, some of the technology improvements you're trying to make, at the end of the day, do you think the mall companies have to be more collaborative to really make a big change? And what they're offering at the malls?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, first of all, I view that as a complement. I think, Westfield is a very good operator. So, that's number one. Number two is, look, we do \u2013 it is potential, we could collaborate. We do that currently for instance Deliv is a consortium of three or four mall owners. We talk to \u2013 the mall owners talk on technology front all the time. We talk to Westfield, we talk to General Growth, we talk to Macerich, Taubman, et cetera. When there's a new product that we think and that we can \u2013 because at the end of the day, we really don't compete all that much locally. I mean, if you are really fascinating about our businesses, yeah, we have skirmishers here and there. But we don't have a lot of overlap with our top operatives in markets of all that significance. So, there is the potential to collaborate, we're more than happy to. And I do think there is potential to do that and we have done it, and there'll certainly be more potential as we move forward.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask questions. It seems like the bankruptcies that have been filed so far have come fairly late in the quarter. So, I just curious, if you had relative to the 120 basis points or 130 basis points quarter-over-quarter decline in the ending occupancy, do you have a sense of what the average occupancy was for the first quarter?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No. Okay. Is it fair to say that there would be some lingering impact from what's already happened now in the second quarter?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I mean, yeah, I mean we can, again we'll look at it. It's just not, we're not obsess with it, okay. We'll look at it and maybe Tom will give you the number, maybe he won't, I don't know, okay.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. And then earlier, you had mentioned that the department stores are a big opportunity that you're looking at. And just curious in the near term, you got three anchor expiries, I think they're all \u2013 just looking at the average size, looks like department stores. Curious, if there's an opportunity with those three or how those discussions are going?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Basically, those were all subject to option. So we expect them to be exercised.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then last question. Just in terms of the comments you've made today and in the past about retailers investing in their stores more maybe than the omni-channel or the e-commerce side of their businesses, can you just maybe share a little bit, I know we've asked this question in the past too, but just in terms A\u00e9ropostale in-store investments, some of what you're doing on that front?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, they did a clean up to restart the brand during when it went from the liquidator to the new owners. It wasn't really material, but it was a good beginning to reintroduce the brand to the consumer. And centrally most of the stores were touched, some more than others.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And I guess, are there further plans for other in-store investments that sort of improve the...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, look, I think that's probably not this year, but we'll \u2013 we evaluate it all the time, we're not afraid to invest in it, but it's \u2013 to go through bankruptcy is somewhat traumatic, okay. So, and again, we weren't in-charge of liquidating it in the periods. So, again, I don't want to get into all the technicalities of it, but we just took it over January, I don't know, 1 or 2 or 6, whatever the date was. So, this year is just to stabilize it, we did clean up to reintroduce it. We are sourcing new product. We are going through all that, but it's the first year.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Good morning, thanks for taking my question.", "So, first question, can you share what the average price of the stock you repurchased during the first quarter was?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It will be in our Q.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "But I think it was around $1.74.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. We've seen you do a few non-retail developments to some of your top urban properties. The hotel at Phipps Plaza, hotel in Luxury Tower at Galleria. So, I guess my question is, what's your appetite for more of these office apartment or hotel type of projects. What role do you envision in playing in platform going forward and can you give us a broad sense of what type of returns you look for?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we're going to do returns that create value for our shareholders, that's number one. Number two, I don't think we'll do much office frankly other than we have built office on top of the few of our new developments like at Domain and Clearfork, just to name a few. We think that's nice mix, but I don't think \u2013 I sell the land or do something probably before I built an office tower and I think we have a very nice pipeline for hotels and multi-family throughout the portfolio. We're talking to a lot of people. We got some great plans and I think that will be a growth vehicle for the company going forward.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "So it sounds like you are bringing some partners for that.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, yes and no, we might. We'll certainly bring in operators, but we could bring another developers that just \u2013 it depends on the market and there is \u2013 again there is no one set answer, but the reality is we could do both and we have done both.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. One if you more on readout please. So, first, can you talk about the lease up and early feel for some of your recent readouts and expansions like at Roosevelt Field, Del Amo, King of Prussia. I know, it's a bit early in some of these cases and you have a strong track record. But I'm wondering how pleased are you with the early read and trends from these projects and have your return expectations changed at all versus your underwriting?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Not really. I mean, the \u2013 it always takes time to lease up new expanded space. Most good developments do not have a 100% lease to start, you always kind of want to calibrate or you want to wait for the retailer. I'd say we're pretty much on plan on those.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. And then, your upcoming projects, Norfolk, some of the others any change in readout expectations there \u2013 return expectations? Are we still thinking similarly 7%, 8%?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Norfolk will do better than that. But now it's all in our 8-K and you can see nothing really changed, in terms of our returns.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the 2017 leasing plan and how far through you are? And also, on the development and redevelopment spend front, are you still expecting about $1 billion a year in 2017 and 2018?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes, on $1 billion a year. And Rick, you want to...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. On the renewals in 2017, we're probably about 10 basis \u2013 100 basis points ahead of where we were last year at this time and we're already starting on 2018. And we're probably about 20% due our 2018 renewals, which is ahead of where we were in 2017 this time last year. So, we're very focused on that and making good progress against it.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. That was it. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L.

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "...losses. Good question, though.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys. Loved the French earlier, David, though I think the pronunciation could do some work.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Among other things...", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I can't talk...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I can barely speak English (61:43) French", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Few questions. I guess, just first I was curious, I mean, earlier this month, David Contis announced his plans to leave, I was just curious how his departure affected succession planning for leadership roles at Simon, does that cause you to rethink some things?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, I mean, David left for family reason. Yes, there is no impact on succession planning there. And it gives \u2013 we have a great strength in our bench and our development team; Kathy Shields, John Phipps, we just hired a real quality veteran that was in Luxottica running that real estate, Mike Nevins. So we have a very good bench and so really not much to say beyond that. So no worries on that front.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And maybe for Rick, I recognize maybe it's early for some of those, but in situations where you guys have ether had anchor closures or even a competing mall in the market that you compete with has closed, do you guys have any harder anecdotal data and I guess I would call the sales transfer that you might have ticked up either the other anchors in the same mall or your mall relative to a close competing mall, I'm just curious how that shift might have happened because usually retail sales aren't destroyed, they sort of move elsewhere.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Anecdotally, what we have heard from our department stores is that they do gain market share both when they close their stores in the market and frankly that was the point that David alluded to earlier when he said in the long run, this retail consolidation is going to benefit us because those sales that are in the market, we're going to get our share of them. Also, we have heard from our department stores that when a store closes in the mall, those shoppers for the most part stay in the mall and those sales do get redistributed among the other department stores that are in the property.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The most interesting thing on that front is that when they \u2013 if they do close a store or they leave a market, those Internet sales that are in that market go bye-bye. So that's really the \u2013 just to broaden your question in terms of the answer, I mean that's what's interesting when they leave a market, those Internet sales in that market tend to go bye-bye.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And what's your take on concept of grocers returning to the mall. One of your competitors has paid a little bit of lip service to that and I'm just curious what do you guys that think about that dynamics since it's been frankly a very long time since the mall industry has had grocers, I think I last saw them in like The Blues Brothers movie or something?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, you hit like anything else. There is certainly opportunities and when there are opportunities, we take advantage of them. We added Wegmans in Montgomery Mall. We've added Fresh Market in The Falls. We're literally in a process of adding a supermarket right now at College Mall where we demolished the Sears. So where it fits the market, there's certainly a great use. You got to be able to accommodate their physical constraints and it also has to make sense economically, but we're actively talking to them. And hopefully we'll have others that are going to find their way into our properties as we get space available.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, I think it's a good move and we'll certainly pursue it. So, we think it's interesting and we have done in the past, we'll continue to do it.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Just a last question, maybe a little involved, as it relates to occupancy costs, the last several years Apple has been and other retailers have been early pronounced influence on mall sales. Some people have estimated that adding an Apple to the mall or a Tesla, for example, can boost overall sales on average about $100 a square foot. But that 10%, 15%, 20% increase in mall sales sort of implies that the typical in-line retailers' occupancy costs might actually be 15% to 20% higher than the mall average that we can kind of see.", "And I guess my concern is just, is it that the occupancy cost where a typical retailer might be at a big premium, but at a time when their margins are under a lot of pressure, I guess, the question here is, do you really think occupancy costs in the next few years can continue to hold steady or do you think we're doing to see some need for them to roll down just because maybe they've risen to a point where it's just very difficult for them to afford it, given where there profits are?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think it's a retailer-by-retailer case. That's certainly the case for some retailers without question. So, it's a case-by-case. So one thing I would \u2013 with respect to your question, remember our sales, we have all the outlets in it. So the dramatic impact is from a highly productive tenant is not that \u2013 it's not dramatic, okay. That's not to say though. There aren't \u2013 certainly, there are some retailers that \u2013 because their productivity is so low that they have too high \u2013 they can't afford the rent, that's what makes our business. That's what's moved our number is that those guys go out and we find somebody else to replace them. If we could not replace retailers, then it would be an issue, but we can and we have to, and that's what we do.", "In Europe as another example, I mean, the occupancy cost there are much greater for in line tenants, yet they have all find the ability to become more profitable. So, again, I think certainly that's the case for some retailers. When that happens, we tend to replace some and again when you think about the impact on some of those higher productivity tenants, just put in less than perspective because we meld in the outlet business, so that doesn't make it as \u2013 not that it doesn't have an impact, but it's not dramatic.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. No worries.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. I just want to go back to the redevelopment issue, in particular when you're redeveloping an anchor box. Can you give us some of the math behind your 7% target return? For example, is there a good rule of thumb on the cost to reposition, the space on a per square foot basis?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "There is really no rule of thumb, every one of these development opportunities is evaluated on its own and the returns are going to be a function of how you redeploy the space. If it's all small shops, the returns could be considerably higher. If you're substituting a single user into the existing box, the returns could be a little bit lower, but the capital expenditure will be lower. It's a case-by-case situation and frankly, as you can see, when you look at our reporting, we've been very active in bringing anchors to our property and that's been going on for years. And it's going to hopefully only accelerate as we get control of more of the space.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I guess, if you're replacing an anchor with like Dick's for example. I mean, is there a \u2013 on a per square foot build, is it $200 a foot, is it $300 a foot, I mean any perspective you can give us on that?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No. We don't go into the specifics. I mean, that's something we disclose our capital in our schedules, but we're not going to go into the specifics of an individual redevelopment project.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I guess, the reason I ask is because there is obviously a lot of questions about where are rents going, where is occupancy going, I think one of the other concerns from investors is the amount of capital going to malls and how much of it is really a return on investment or rather just maintenance capital and so?", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, I encourage those inventors to look at our financial statements, okay? I mean, that's what instead of the rhetoric, instead of the narrative, just look at our financial statements, okay? Look at our return on equity. I don't know what else to tell you then. I know you're trying to get ahead of a trend. But I mean we disclosed a tremendous amount of information. And I would just encourage you to look at our financial statements.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, David. Just had a quick question about A\u00e9ropostale and sort of going back to the operating losses. Appreciate why 1Q is seasonally a low income quarter. But just thinking about A\u00e9ropostale specifically, the last time they publically reported, it looks like they posted operating losses in every quarter with first quarter and second quarter obviously being the worst. So, just in terms of modeling purposes, so wondering if you could maybe give any sort of frame of reference for how much the operating losses compare to 2015? And if we should think about that $0.03 as consistent for 2Q and then coming back down, how should we think about that from a modeling purpose?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, we don't give quarterly guidance, number one. We think that's a waste of everybody's intellectual curiosity. There's just no way to compare it to 2015 and 2016 because the fleet was the 1,000 stores and now it's 500. We've done a dramatic job on sourcing, we've done a dramatic job on overhead. And again, we're just building the inventory back up because of the liquidation. So it's really an apple and an orange. And the reality is, just to put in perspective, $0.03 on $2.74 is what percent is that? Somebody do it, 1%. So it's not like it is what it is in our cash investment between OpCo and IPCo was in the $33 million. So again, let's just put all of this stuff in perspective. And again, it will probably continue to have generally \u2013 it will probably continue to have operating losses through the \u2013 until the fourth quarter, but I'm not going to give you per share stuff, because we just don't do that \u2013 per quarter stuff, I should say.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Good. Got it. And I wasn't looking for you to give guidance, I appreciate you don't give quarterly guidance. I was just looking for some frame of reference that...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I...", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "...operating loss is 50%.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Rich, I know you're smart, but you can't go back to 2015 and 2016, because that company is completely different then it is today. So...", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, exactly. And that was sort of the \u2013 I guess, the point of my question, is it 50% of the losses that it was in 2015 or not. But okay...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well \u2013 and fact of the matter is, we're not \u2013 I don't even look at 2015 or 2016, I am looking at what they're doing going forward.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. My pleasure, my pleasure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my call. Maybe to alleviate some of the fears here in terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call. Can you just give us a sense of a percentage of ABR those stores would represent collectively in your portfolio?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The \u2013 let me \u2013 I don't understand it. Can you restate the question, please?", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sure. In terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call, the incremental ones, what percentage of ABR does that represent in your portfolio?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's not how we would look at it, so what percent of the average base rent would we \u2013 I don't \u2013 the answer is I don't know.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Something like annualized rent.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We put in \u2013 look, the way we look at it is, we've got our total revenues for our properties, not our share, but our total is over $6 billion, right? So, it's very \u2013 it's immaterial when you look at it on that perspective.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. And then you've touched on this topic already, but maybe just to ask a little differently. When an anchor goes dark, what's your thought process that goes on to decide the best and highest use of that space? To the extent that you're getting these anchors back faster and sooner than you expected, are you thinking about these redevelopments differently in aggregate, maybe from a merchandizing perspective than when they were fewer happening across the retail landscape?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we're always thinking about things differently, I would say. In this case, the reality is, we don't have any empty boxes, okay? Now, I guess King of Prussia is going to be empty and that will be our one and only empty box. And I guess, it's fair to say that we are thinking about that a little bit differently and that given the dramatic changes that the malls had in that particular area of the wing, with Sears going out and Primark and DICK's taking that over. And the interest in mixed use, we'll probably go more mixed use, more big box, and since we added all the small shops connecting the two malls, yeah, you could say maybe, our thinking is different, but I would tell you that I \u2013 hopefully it evolves every day, so maybe on the margin.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "But I would also say to you that we are analyzing virtually every box that we have and we keep a running strategic assessment of who is not in each of our properties that would be appropriate to be added to that property including the other mixed use potential because it's a market specific analysis. So we are anticipating potential opportunities to recover these boxes, and so we are not going to be caught flat-footed when the opportunity present themselves.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is open.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood", "Great. Thanks, guys. I have a question. And David, this sort of relates to your comments about your private equity friends employing leverage. What are your plans for your Hudson Bay joint venture? And what do you \u2013 how do you see that business evolving?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I don't know \u2013 Floris, I don't know why you would relate those two. I mean, those are \u2013 those guys are real operators, and I think they're going to \u2013 they're evolving to be best-in-breed, so in that, in the department store area. So look, I think that we've got so much optionality with that joint venture, it's \u2013 right now, it's business as usual, but those optionality to take it to another level is as the landscape changes, but right now, it's business as usual. We're looking at selective boxes to redevelop within the existing portfolio. They continue to improve upon their fleet putting money back into the physical real estate and I continue to be impressed with how they operate through stores.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood", "Okay. And then a question, I guess, on the \u2013 your international properties, just \u2013 I know you talked, your leasing spreads you usually cite are for the U.S., but I am just curious with the 99.8% occupancy in your international portfolio, what kind of leasing spreads are you getting there, are you really able to push rent?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes, very much so. A lot of it's new. So we don't have a lot of rollover yet, but the answer is yes. It's a good question. Again, we kind of look at the cash flow growth, but maybe there is some numbers there that we can get to you next time.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood", "Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Harris from Uniplan (79:38). Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. Good morning. So I am 20 years plus working on my American, but hopefully you can understand my question, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Only too loudly and clearly, okay? We understand everything you say.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. So yesterday, the administration put forward plans to reduce the corporate taxes down to 15%. Now, this is not a new idea and who knows whether that ends up at that number. It does look though there is a move to lower corporate taxes. I mean, if you can give any thought to a level at which it might make sense to become a C-Corp.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Again, a very good question. I thought you're going to bring out the game yesterday. Tottenham, my \u2013 and we're on a good streak until yesterday.", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah. I know. Well, yeah, I think you'll make it, so that's an aside.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "All right. So I \u2013 you sounded a little depressed on the call, but anyway it's a good question. The reality is, it's worthy, doubted we would change. But let's see what the number is and \u2013 I mean we do have a lot of depreciation in our business. So...", "Unknown Speaker", "But that might go away.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, I don't think so. I mean \u2013 what I understand is bonus depreciation is part of the thing to go back and forth. I mean there is no reason to model it right now, because you know God knows what's going to happen. But it's interesting our taxable income is $7 thereabouts. So at 15% without accelerating depreciation, I'm not sure why I would suddenly want to pay that to Uncle Sam. But if they change something with the depreciation rules, maybe it's of interest. But I would rather give that 15% \u2013 I'd rather give that money to our shareholders as opposed to the government.", "Unknown Speaker", "No, I mean, I guess the flexibility that would come from being a C-Corp would be a potential in setting aside what rate it is...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, I agree other than you know we do have taxable income of $7. So, which again, if our FFO per share is $11.50, the mid-range, $7 that's not too shabby.", "Unknown Speaker", "Right.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "...so, maybe they'd have to change the depreciation rules to really get us to think about it, I think.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Good luck for the rest of the season.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Unknown Speaker", "Bye.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. It's Michael Bilerman again. David, I'm curious you've talked a lot about the narrative in the negative rhetoric that's out there in the popular press. I'm curious if you've opened \u2013 if you had an open invite to these journalists to come to something like King of Prussia or Del Amo or Aventura where, I don't know if they can find a parking spot at 2 o'clock in the Saturday, but bring them to those assets?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I don't know. I mean, I'd rather bring my shareholders there. So I mean, I think some have tried to paint the other side of the picture and it just doesn't seem to be working. So I'd rather \u2013 I think our folk \u2013 I'd rather bring shareholders wherever they like to go, we're happy to tour them, explain the business, we certainly do it with sell-side and so on. We're certainly \u2013 we communicate all the time with our investors and shareholders. I think that time better spent and time is better spent running our business than trying to get the narrative change, it just \u2013 I'm only expressing that point of view to try to anybody that's concerned about the narratives, see \u2013 that's on this call, at least sees the other side of the story, that's all I'm interested and expressing on this call. And importantly, that's evidenced by our numbers, but I'd rather spend more time with our shareholders and our teams, they're just \u2013 I just don't see as being successful and changing it right now.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "One of the things you talked about in your shareholders' letter, was it, we have too much retail per capita in the U.S.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Some of it becomes obsolete. I know we have little exposure to this industry will feel the pain and this feeds the overall narrative? I guess what is your expectation of retail that needs to come out? I mean, is there any \u2013 is that shifting at all?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, it's interesting. Look, I can't sit here and predict what per capita we should have. That's way above my ability to forecast or even have an opinion on. I will tell you this. Certain malls are actually that maybe shouldn't have been built or maybe in the right trade area or actually \u2013 they last a lot longer than people think. And so, I don't know, I have no idea. All I worry about is what our portfolio can produce in terms of cash flow and I don't really have an opinion on kind of what the right U.S. numbers should be. I just don't have an opinion.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. All right. David, thanks for the time.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you. All right. Thanks. Sorry, this ran a little longer and appreciate all your questions. We do like giving everybody a chance if interested to ask your question, and given there's no more, we can go on through the rest of our day.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Whitley, and I will be your operator for today.", "At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Ward, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Tom Ward", "Thank you, Whitley. Good morning and welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.", "Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today\u2019s date.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay. Good morning. We had a strong start to 2015. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, two great properties that we are excited to have in our portfolio. We created two joint ventures with two of our longstanding retail partners, one with Hudson's Bay Company and the other with Sears Holdings which will serve as additional avenues for growth. And of course we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance.", "As you know, results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.28 per share, exceeding once again the First Call consensus by $0.03. And that was achieved even though we had a decrease of approximately $0.03 for the quarter due to the strong dollar against the euro and the yen. And on a comparable basis excluding the operating results from WPG properties in the prior year period. Our FFO per share increased 6.5% or $0.14 even with the currency devaluation.", "Let me turn to our operating metrics, cash flow. Occupancy was 95.8%, leasing activity remains strong and healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $11.19 per square foot, an increase of 18.9%. Now let\u2019s talk about comp NOI. Comp NOI increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to an increase of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And very importantly with respect to this quarter, our comp NOI in the first quarter was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points, due to a significant overage retroactive billing within the mills in the first quarter of 2014 and if you remember, we put in the mills in terms of our comp NOI beginning last year.", "If you wanted to understand our comp NOI on the outlets and the malls it\u2019s approximately 4%, and right on our budget. Total sales across our portfolio increased 2% in the first quarter, compared to the first quarter of last year and I will also point out there was a recent pitch affirming our A rating. They did a report that I would suggest at the Analytic community review just to put in the back of your mind on our comp NOI growth.", "We have exceeded our peers by an average of 240 basis points from the period of time of 2005 to 2014. I thought that was interesting reading, in any event let\u2019s go to construction. We continue new premium outlets in Gloucester, which will serve the South Jersey in Philadelphia areas and new centers in Tampa and Tucson, as well as our designer outlet in Vancouver. All our great high quality major markets and each is scheduled to open later this year.", "We are slated to begin construction on as many as three additional domestic premium outlets in 2015, as well as three international outlets in 2015 for a total of six. We are beginning side work shortly at the shops at Clearfork, which as you know is our new full price development in Ft. Worth anchored by Neiman. We plan on opening that in early 2017. Yesterday, we were excited to announce our partnership with Swire and the Whitman family for the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which is anchored by Saks.", "We look forward to contributing our leasing and management expertise to this signature project, which includes a significant residential component and that will open in the fall of 2016 and on Oyster Bay, which we are renaming Syosset Park. We have began the approval process for what will be a unique mixed use life style center with retail office hotel park for the families of the Oyster Bay area and residential components. Initial feedback on our plan has been positive. We expect the process to go well.", "On the redevelopment and expansion we\u2019ve got 24 properties across our three platforms in the U.S. and Asia for a total commitment of $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed a 265,000 square foot expansion at Yeoju Premium Outlets in Seoul and recently completed a 136,000 square foot expansion of Shisui Premium Outlets in Tokyo, both off to great starts; and let\u2019s not forget construction continues on major re-development expansion projects at some of our most productive malls, all under construction including, but not limited to Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets in Woodbury, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, and Chicago, all under construction, all bringing significant amount of new square footage for 2016 and over the next 18 months.", "Kl\u00e9pierre, we were pleased to have played the key role in Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s acquisition of Corio, which became effective at the end of March, creating the leading pure-play retail property company in Continental Europe. We now have a \u20ac21 billion portfolio in 16 countries. And to remind the investment community, this was a \u20ac7.4 billion M&A transaction. We are pleased to see the rebound in the European shopper. Kl\u00e9pierre will report the results next week and we expect a higher and stronger growth portfolio given the acquisition.", "Capital markets, we expanded our $2 billion revolving credit facility to $2.75 billion and extended its maturity to 2020. Our current liquidity, including revolvers and cash on hands is over $6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us from our peer group.", "As you know, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. We have not yet repurchased any shares as a result of our trading window blackout due to earnings and the timing of our buyback announcement. And proudly, we are proud to announce yet another dividend increase of $1.50, which is a year-over-year increase of 15% and a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2015. Again, nobody has got our dividend growth. We will pay at least $5.90, an increase of nearly, as I said, 15% from last year.", "So let me turn to guidance. We\u2019ve increased our guidance based on our view of the year, again, from $9.65 to $9.75, again, nobody in our peer group has the kind of growth that we have. And we continue to feel very comfortable, as I mentioned to you, on the comp NOI growth of 4% for the year for malls, Premium Outlets and Mills.", "And we are ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy.", "David Simon", "How are you doing?", "Michael Bilerman", "Great. So, David, I was curious as to how you think about your stake in Macerich at this point. You sort of view it as a $470 million mall, that\u2019s given you a 3% yield, you think it is potentially worth $570, or do you sort of view it as worth $470 million, you bought it for $370 million, you have a $100 million and sort of take that money and go home?", "David Simon", "Well, Michael, frankly, since we were not able to engage with Macerich, even though we tried very hard to, as you know, we put what I felt was a unbelievable hell of an offer on the table and I, obviously, tried very hard to engage. We have been so busy between the Sears and the HBC, finishing Brickell, doing Clearfork, making sure our redevelopment is on time and on budget. The three new deals that we have internationally, I have really not had the luxury of figuring out what I\u2019m going to do with that stake.", "So at this point, I can\u2019t really answer your question, but at some point, I will address it in the near future. But we had just been too busy running the business, producing very good strong results, raising the dividend, doing the buyback, doing all the redevelopment, all the new ventures that I haven\u2019t really sat down and figure out what to do next. I\u2019m open to your ideas if you have any though.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yeah. I don\u2019t think I should publicly say that on a call. In terms of Europe and you talked about the Kl\u00e9pierre Corio transaction and being instrumental in that deal, as you think about potentially putting additional to Europe when you originally made the state, the euro was about EUR 1.30, you are under EUR 1.10 today, you obviously have some hedge because you have some euro denominated debt. But I am just curious as you think about potentially taking your stake backup to a 30% level, if that\u2019s in the cards and putting capital out given where the euro is and how you sort of think about that.", "David Simon", "Well, that kind of opportunity is always on the table. I will say that, we are up a EUR 1.4 billion in our investment. Guys, right?", "Andrew Juster", "Yeah.", "David Simon", "So that\u2019s not too shabby of a trade if I can quote out on Sandler who is one of my heroes. I quoted him last year, not last year but in 2013 annual letter, but all you talk about is Steve Ross letter, he haven\u2019t mentioned mine but I thought I had a pretty good line in there. I mentioned in our call I think people who site, we did helped engineer a $7.4 billion European merger. That again is not to \u2013 don\u2019t underestimate the fact and the role that I played \u2013 we played in putting together those two companies that was a EUR7.4 billion investment. And as you know that the capital going towards Europe and the timing of that deal I think is going to be very attractive for us in the long run. So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with my investment, but we will just see how that evolves. There were couple other large shareholders, they certainly haven\u2019t indicated to me anytime that they\u2019re going to \u2013 that they\u2019re looking to get out. I think they are very pleased with what those transpired since our involvement over the last three years.", "Christy McElroy", "Hi, good morning, David. It\u2019s Christy here. You\u2019ve talked often about your larger regional model re-development and expansion projects, but I am wondering with the new Hudson's Bay and Sears JVs and this may be more or so with the Sears boxes. But is your new control over [indiscernible] boxes unlock any future potential major redevelopment projects in any of your centers or is it too early to tell? And maybe you could just provide some general comments on the future opportunities for investments that could arise from these JV?", "David Simon", "Well, I think the JV with Sears clearly is all about redeveloping those boxes with Sears potentially as taking some of that space and in some cases maybe not. And as also part of that deal, we bought the Plaza store which is a fantastic mall, does I don\u2019t know 750 a day of food. It got a lot of demand. So that also gives us the ability to look at expanding that mall. So the answer, I don\u2019t want to put a number on it Christy but I would definitely say that it\u2019s all about retaining with Sears maybe downsizing their stores and then into Plaza certainly \u2013 there is a major expansion in the works there that we are going to move very, very fast on. And that will, the Plaza just is a general scope, will get couple of hundred million bucks at the end of the day. So all of that was part of about \u2013 all of that was done in the mind to faster redevelopment for sure.", "Christy McElroy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Craig Schmidt", "Thank you. This is something related to Christy\u2019s last question. There seems to be more churning in both the mall, especially in the mall anchor space. I am just wondering from Simon\u2019s mall portfolio perspective, is that actually an opportunity for you, something you actually would welcome just given your dominant portfolio and opportunities at distance you from your peers?", "David Simon", "I would say we have \u2013 we don\u2019t use the word dominant here. We have a very high quality portfolio that\u2019s produced outsize comp NOI growth with our peer over and I know we get focused on a quarter here, quarter there, but if you look over any kind of extended period of time we\u2019ve clearly outperformed our peer group. I would say there is, there is not a lot of churning in the department store world, I think we have brick one, empty box out of how many Rick?", "Richard Sokolov", "450 onwards.", "David Simon", "And what is that one, I should know it actually.", "Richard Sokolov", "It\u2019s in [indiscernible].", "David Simon", "Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah that\u2019s a tough one. But in any event like in Riverside, we got the Saks building back we actually just approved internally yesterday a whole redevelopment of that Box, so we were down to one box, but clearly on the specialty side we did lose a handful of retailers and I think at the end of the day there will be an opportunity from it obviously we are focused on releasing it on that space, but we are going to put in better retailers and as you know, I mean the retail business like any business in today\u2019s environment is Darwinian and the retailers that are going away are relatively weaker ones. There is a whole host of stronger ones in the pipeline that we would expect to be able to add excitement to our properties and ultimately increase our cash flow from their participation in our building. So, that\u2019s the nature of our business.", "As you know Craig, we like showing the slide about the top 10 retailers at 93, we went public till today, it is a little more going on today then maybe it was a year or two ago, but nothing that we are overly concerned about and we are poised to do the work necessary to make these properties better and obviously having a high quality portfolio like we do will make it happen.", "Craig Schmidt", "Okay and then just beside your significant redevelopment pipeline efforts. Are there any emerging areas or real estate formats that you are looking to down the road that could be in the area of growth for Simon?", "David Simon", "Like other users or\u2026?", "Craig Schmidt", "I mean obviously you haven\u2019t been that interested in highs steel, but is there, I mean just thinking you know the malls is mature business at some point the opportunities for premium outlet slow and then what are you seeing maybe five years down the road that might be an opportunity to grow?", "David Simon", "Well, look we have always looked. I think the Hudson Bay joint venture is going to give us another avenue of gross in that whole single credit tenant kind of business, both internationally in the U.S. you know street retail potentially out of that I don\u2019t know, you know the values there are pretty salty when the deals that we have seen. So, you know I think Craig, we\u2019ve always been creative in trying to find other areas, it will focus around retail real estate, but we are not concerned not at all about not being able to find avenues of growth, but clearly we still got a big pipeline of redevelopment.", "The outlet business, our outlet business is very strong. So, we posted great comp NOI numbers this quarter. Sales were very strong. So, we see that growth continuing and then with the redevelopment that we are doing at some of our iconic mall properties, again these aren\u2019t pipe dreams. They are \u2013 Houston Galleria, Roosevelt Field, Stanford Galleria, Del Amo, King of Prussia I mean this stuff is, maybe we should put on our website to show you the steel, but this stuff is all happening. So, we got plenty to say grace over right now.", "Craig Schmidt", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Good morning, guys. Just a first question on \u2013 back on Macerich. What were the pursuit costs related there? And I guess where do they fall in your Q1 numbers?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s in other expense and they are done and we have no more.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Are you able to give an estimate or?", "David Simon", "Immaterial. I mean, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it basic \u2013 immaterial. We do a lot of this in-house, you are looking at them.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay.", "David Simon", "For better or worse, okay?", "Jeff Donnelly", "And you work cheaply. So\u2026", "David Simon", "Some may argue that. But the point is, for better or worse, you are looking at the M&A guide here, okay?", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay. Maybe to switch gears, I\u2019m just curious on occupancy. I think Q1 occupancy was down a little bit year-over-year; and maybe I missed it in your remarks, but is that just a return to a more normal \u2013 what I will call sort of pullback post-holiday, or is there something else going on there?", "David Simon", "Well, I would say, Jeff, we clearly \u2013 normally, we are always going to close 60 bps to 80 bps from the seasonality part of our business, right? We had more than that this time and that\u2019s all related to, I\u2019d say, another 50 bps or so, all related to bankruptcies.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay.", "David Simon", "And, again, we had planned that, that\u2019s why we were cautious on our comp NOI growth, so there is no surprise there. Cautious being \u2013 I\u2019d argue 4% is not \u2013 is pretty significant when I look at other categories, I look at office, I look at industrial, I look at across the platform, 4% ain\u2019t too bad. But nevertheless, it is a little bit lower and it was all because we were planning the guys that were on the ropes. And the guys that were on the ropes ended up on the mat, so to speak. In the spirit of the upcoming Pacquiao/Mayweather fight, okay?", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay.", "David Simon", "They ended up on the mat.", "Rick Sokolov", "The only thing I would say, Jeff, is we expect that occupancy to go up as we move through the year and get some of that space redeployed, which we\u2019re in the process of doing right now.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Yes, because I think at the end of the fourth quarter you guys were looking for sort of flat occupancy by year end. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was still the case.", "Rick Sokolov", "Yeah.", "David Simon", "Yeah, look, could we be a few basis points below it? Sure. But, again, you also have to factor in we\u2019ve got a lot of redevelopment going on. So our portfolio is in a pretty significant \u2013 undergoing a pretty significant activities going on. So it will be very close to that number.", "Jeff Donnelly", "I saw that David Contis was working on converting temporary space to permanent space. How much do you guys have in the way of short-term tenancy today, and how does that compare to history?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s been going down pretty significantly. I\u2019m going to say, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 in our occupancy, we only include folks that have a lease of a year in. So, now we do \u2013 sometimes we do year-to-year leases because we are looking for a better group, but that number has been \u2013 is high. The year-to-year guys have been as high as the mid-5%s, we are down about 4% now, Jeff, roughly, rough numbers, right, guys?", "Rick Sokolov", "Yeah.", "David Simon", "Getting close, we will get there.", "Jeff Donnelly", "And just the last question or two is on WP Glimcher. Is there a set date when you expect that arrangement on providing services to end?", "David Simon", "May 16th is the end of that right, Rick?", "Rick Sokolov", "May 2016", "David Simon", "Yeah.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay. Then on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys \u2013", "David Simon", "Let me clarify May 2016, not May 16th. Okay?", "Jeff Donnelly", "Right, right. And just on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys to getting the necessary approvals to move ahead there?", "David Simon", "Look it is a process; I think by the end of this year, we will be in very good shape. But we have a lot \u2013 there is a lot to go through. So we are shooting the next six months or so are going to be very important but that\u2019s how we are thinking about the timing.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "David Simon", "How are you?", "Ross Nussbaum", "David, let me first ask in stock buyback. Do you intend to actually buyback any stock around the current levels or was it put in place as a placeholder or was it a statement to Macerich a little of everything.", "David Simon", "Well, I mean I think the REIT market I would say this obviously I am not going to tell you when or how we\u2019re going to buy stock back, but I would say we wouldn\u2019t have announced it once we were serious about it. We couldn\u2019t buy any stock back because we were in our blackout period when the announcement came. And as I look at other companies and their valuation and I look at ours, and our growth prospects and our track record, I continue to think we are extremely well positioned. As I look at history year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter and all that we\u2019ve got going on, look at our valuation compared to our peer group and I feel very comfortable that we are a very strong and good investment.", "Now with the added volatility in the REIT sector, we want to be able to take advantage of that volatility. So I think you will see us at the appropriate times of volatility and no statement had nothing to do with Macerich obviously had that deal gone forward maybe the capital would have been allotted differently, but I look at our growth profile, I look at the history of our results, I look at our balance sheet, I look at the peer group, I look at revaluations generally and I think I can\u2019t pick a better investment than ours as we look forward. So we will take advantage of volatility. We\u2019ll do this opportunistically and you will see us in the market at the appropriate times.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. Appreciate that. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the department store industry right now? And I know you\u2019ve got different motivating factors behind what happened with Hudson\u2019s Bay and with what is going on with Sears. I guess a couple of questions. One is, did you discuss with Sears or do they want to sell you more than what you actually bought? I am curious what you think of their, I\u2019ll call it spin rights offering and do you see other department store companies also transacting with their real estate any time soon?", "David Simon", "Well, look I would say that Sears and us got comfortable with the portfolio. It wasn\u2019t dramatically different from the beginning to where we ended up. And I think it\u2019s good to have that kind of relationship. I think it can grow overtime. I think they have valuable real estate and we see [indiscernible] has been able to know as a company we wouldn\u2019t invest in it less we saw that going forward. And frankly, Hudson\u2019s Bay I think they \u2013 I really like their management team. I really like that real estate being a partner with them and their real estate and looking for future growth opportunities, [indiscernible] and other avenue of growth. So I see that as another very good opportunity.", "Could other retailers take advantage of their inherent real estate value? Sure, but if they do it to the extent or they\u2019ve got a balloon if they squeeze one end too high, you got to be very careful on how they do it. But if they\u2019re thoughtful about how they want to take advantage of the real estate, I am sure those value to be made for their shareholders. But that\u2019s not necessarily a focus for us. We are very pleased to have partnered with both these folks and we expect them to grow. Rick?", "Richard Sokolov", "The only other thing that I would add is that it does put a spotlight on the fact that the credit worthiness and operating stability of our department store companies I believe is greater than the analyst in the investment community has recognized before and when we\u2019ve said all along we thought that they were in a stable position. I think that\u2019s being worn-out by the ability to add financial stability by taking a focus on the real estate asset.", "Ross Nussbaum", "And David did you separate out the Hudson's Bay venture from SPG because you didn\u2019t want a bunch of boring long terms net leases in SPG or was there something other than that?", "David Simon", "Well I think it is part of SPG and first of all it hasn\u2019t actually closed yet. We are closing when we announced that it should be closing in the next, by the end of the quarter probably, but we\u2019ve always view that is ultimately a standalone business going forward. Now that will help grow faster, the credit, the net lease retailer, I mean we \u2013 they are great retailers. We are going to run that joint venture. They\u2019ve got great real estate entrepreneurs. We certainly can underwrite retail credit. We have ideas on how to grow that business. So, ultimately that business could in fact end up separated from us, but we will want to add value to it through our deal making capabilities and yes it probably, if it ends up more focused on the credit, you know the credit lease business you know it\u2019s \u2013 that probably is better separated from SPG in long run, but of that is to be determined whilst as we go forward.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler ONeill. Please proceed.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Good morning. David just a few questions here, first you brought up the rating agencies in your comments. So, two questions on that, one is the 7% cap rate that they are using clearly we\u2019ve had a number of demonstrable mall trades that show cap rates are well below, so curious if they are going to move away from the 7% and second on that is, as you guys entertain the Macerich to buy them, did the rating agencies do any push back to you guys on your rating or their view is they know who you are and even if anything was breached they know that you would resolve that in due course and therefore a rating impact was unlikely.", "David Simon", "Well. Look I will speak to the last first, I mean, no they have all the confidence in the world in us when it comes to doing a transaction of that nature that we were \u2013 that we did not expect to be downgraded or notched at all, right Andy?", "Andrew Juster", "Right. I mean they\u2019ve done $40 billion of acquisition and they\u2019ve been very pleased with the results.", "David Simon", "So, and again as not that this is all that interesting anymore, but part of the reason we were selling assets to GGP was in fact, you know the primary reason was in fact to make sure that our A rating would stay in place. As far as the seven, yes they should update it, it\u2019s silly. But you know\u2026", "Andrew Juster", "It is a disastrous scenario\u2026", "David Simon", "But they are being conservative. It\u2019s not market, I agree with you. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.", "Andrew Juster", "I used to be eight and nine.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. So, glacial compression there. Second question is, on the Hudson Bay can you just talk a little bit about the challenges of having real estate and other people centers and we\u2019ve seen other companies in the past trying to do that hasn\u2019t worked out, was there a different perspective that you guys have on making that work or how should we think that this time it may work versus what we\u2019ve seen historically?", "David Simon", "That\u2019s not really even there is no thinking that boy it\u2019s great to have own real estate in other peoples centers. That\u2019s really not \u2013 this is a growth vehicle to go find other opportunities in the credit world based on retail real estate. Right now, Hudson\u2019s Bay has all of the plans to operate those stores, so there is nothing about in that sense. Obviously if for whatever reason they decide to not to operate the store, we would have that opportunity. So that\u2019s really not anywhere near on the agenda.", "We value this at a pretty attractive cap rate 6% and 8% in really good mall. So we think it\u2019s attractive accretive transaction for us from a value point of view, and it\u2019s really about creating the entity to go do more stuff and seeding it with these stores as opposed to we\u2019re going to go play. We have no intention at all to go play any kind of habit or anything in other people\u2019s mall, so that\u2019s not even on the agenda.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then just finally, your presentation on Macerich you guys disclosed your top center productivity and some of your mall stats. If there is any way if that could be obviously quarterly would be great, but annually I mean it was tremendous retail candy for us and obviously helps in the analysis of you guys. So if there is a suggestion box, would love to see that on an annual basis.", "David Simon", "Speaking of suggestion boxes, I better not say this because I might get criticized but I remember at a golf club that was built by Pete and Dye, a Crooked Stick here in Indianapolis. And the member\u2019s suggestion box is in the middle of the pond, okay. But I will not, that will not be duly noted and I am not saying that but duly noted. And look I think we put that together because we felt it was important if there are any confusion about stuff that was said there, we wanted to clarify that.", "Frankly, Alex, we look at ourselves differently than a collection of assets, but duly noted express \u2013 everybody express their views on that. To Tom, we have been I think as clear and as articulate in our financial presentations as anybody. We have never wavered from FFO as an example. We delivered via the white paper. Occasionally like with WP Spin we separate that out because it\u2019s important to note a transaction of that nature but we give you WP first or we give you FFO first and then we show you whatever is important to change.", "So I feel like we necessarily are a little different in that area, but duly noted we won\u2019t make [indiscernible] to the pond to put in your suggestion. We will take it up Tom and we\u2019ll see about it in the future.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Awesome. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Good morning, David.", "David Simon", "Hi.", "Steve Sakwa", "Couple of questions, I don\u2019t think you disclosed the percentage ownership in the Brickell transaction. Is that something you could provide and what role exactly is Simon playing in this development?", "David Simon", "We\u2019re going to have a 25% interest in the retail and we are going to see the manager of the retail portion of the project and we are going to be leaving the leasing effort along with Swire and Whitman Property.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. So you will be the \u2013 I guess the leasing agent on this.", "David Simon", "Yeah.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. I guess David on Copley, I didn\u2019t hear any talk on that. Where do we stand on the residential project?", "David Simon", "Well, we have an upcoming BRA meeting which is there in the next month. We are hopeful to get approved and there will be a couple other hurdles after that, but that puts us on the path to start construction. So the next month or so we thought we were going to be able to do it. This month things got a little, couple of political things happened out of control, but we\u2019ve been assured that we can get back on the agenda here in this upcoming month.", "Steve Sakwa", "No, it sounds like maybe kind of June, July start.", "David Simon", "Yes. I think we should, we feel comfortable by July. We will have all of the permits and all of the approvals done. You know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but that\u2019s correct.", "Steve Sakwa", "And if that\u2019s the case I guess when would the sales process, like just help us think through the timing if you start construction. When does a sales office start, just how far after that, is that a year later?", "David Simon", "That\u2019s not going to start for a year after that, only because you know the complexity of this build is significant. So we have to go down the turnpike support the foundation and then we got to go into Neiman Marcus store, relay that and then go up. So, there is no real need to rush that. I\u2019d say roughly a year from now that would be the focus, a lots going on at the mall. We are going to start the renovation of the actual interior of it. We are going to do the south west portal entrance. So there is a lot \u2013 we are finishing the office reno, so it is a property that were a lot is going on, but I\u2019d say the sales office would be probably roughly a year from now.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay and then last question, I mean you mentioned all of the major projects you\u2019ve got going on in the U.S. here, I am just curious how do you feel about sort of the international investment opportunities versus domestic?", "David Simon", "Well, with the outlet business, you know we\u2019ve got, I mentioned in my call we have three that we think we\u2019re going to start this year. We have great outlet in Provence partnering with MGE, McArthurGlen. We\u2019ve got a new site with fantastic developer in Mexico [indiscernible] which has built some of the best malls who is our partner in Mexico City. We expect that to start this year and then we\u2019ve got with Genting Group, we are very close to finalizing the deal to start our second outlet in Malaysia and I mentioned to you we just finished Yeoju and Shisui expansion. So that\u2019s a lot of activity internationally. We are also working on a couple of other opportunities in the outlet with some new joint ventures and then we have got another site, two sites in Canada.", "So, internationally on the development front with the outlet, premium outlet product we are busy. And then again, with Kl\u00e9pierre we help do this huge deal that here domestically people don\u2019t think about, but it was a 7.4 billion euro deal. They just closed March 31. They also bought a great asset in Spain shortly thereafter, you know there is tremendous amount going on with the integration and the portfolio review of the long terms assets. There is a lot of development work going on as well within the total combined portfolio. So, that to us is kind of we view that as our full price retail entity going forward in continental Europe and I expect that company to continue to grow. So, we are active internationally. I don\u2019t see us buying full price retail in Asia or other parts, I mean I think right now it is kind of finding new markets for our premium outlook product.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys \u2013 I guess first question just on the factors behind your higher FFO guidance, curious if there is any changes to your FX outlook and the middle guidance. And if there is any level of perhaps share repurchase baked into the full year with outlook?", "David Simon", "The answer is no on the share buyback and no \u2013 we\u2019ve factored in the currency where it is today. So we have a few cents. Last quarter, quarter one of \u201914 the Euro was $1.37 average, this year it was $1.13 so that\u2019s a pretty big gap, now it\u2019s $1.08.", "Andrew Juster", "41%, right.", "David Simon", "We are pretty proud that we took a $0.03 hit in our Q1 \u201915 and still beat consensus pretty good within our numbers. It\u2019s clearly going to affect our total. We have $0.10 roughly year-over-year that was in that range. We have a little bit exposure, but drops further but nothing that we can\u2019t deal with.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay, fair enough. And following up on the Miami project with Swire, just want to clarify first. The 25% ownership, that\u2019s just on the retail or is that the entire project?", "David Simon", "Just the retail.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay. And then the strategic decision involved with the project now. Why now did you approach them, did they approach you and then how should we think about the project in terms of merchandising mix? It looks like GDP their nearby design district has a bit of stranglehold on luxury. How much of a challenge do you think that might present your ability to track a higher tier tenant retailers?", "David Simon", "Well, they approached us and look we have been involved in this for a while. We feel unbelievably confident we are going to deliver obviously they designed it and they\u2019ve done the most of the work, but we feel together we\u2019re going to deliver a great product that I think is going to the marketplace. There is no question that this is going to be a unique terrific long term mixed use retail asset. I think it will blow \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to blow people\u2019s minds away and the leasing. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on leasing and we are very, very confident about our ability to deliver a very, very compelling mix.", "Andrew Juster", "The only thing I would add is that this project in and of itself as a hotel to condo towers and to office towers and surrounding it, there is another eight or nine residential office and hotel projects going on in the hotter brick haul. So it\u2019s a very young, very sophisticated and very well paced submarket inside of the State County overall market we are very excited about it.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Too early to talk about target yields?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yeah. Look since we have partners in there, it will be put in our 8-K but that kind of stuff is probably not going to be singled-out out of respect for partners, but we think it\u2019s an attractive investment and we wouldn\u2019t make it otherwise. And as I said, this will be produced in a very high level. Swire and the Whitman family are first-class operators you couldn\u2019t pick that of partners and we all know Bell Harbor for sure and we all know what Swire has done in China and Hong Kong. It built some of the most amazing stuff. So to be associated with those kind of folks on a long term basis, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased and we will make money in this investment, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t do it.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Could there be more or you contemplating additional investments with Swire or is it again too early to talk about that?", "David Simon", "We are not in Hong Kong and this is their big investment in the U.S. which certainly have a lot of respect for that organization.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay but just to be clear at this point there is nothing talked about perhaps overseas with them in Asia, Hong Kong or China.", "David Simon", "No.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Alright thank you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Andrew Rosivach", "Sorry guys I tried to get out of the queue it was running away, but really quick, you guys have listed amazing metrics, specially relative basis, especially when you are taking to account leverage and unfortunately you can go through quarters where that actually doesn\u2019t influence your share price and I am just curious just in terms of, unfortunately my clients have tried to get rate and discussions over the last couple of quarters, you know when you bid for another company that your shareholder don\u2019t own you can actually harm the relative performance of your supporters and I\u2019m just wondering like is that part of the decision making process you kind of know it will hurt and you make the call that the long term gain actually offsets a certain pain or is it not in the calculus?", "David Simon", "Well we always want feedback from our shareholders and we always take that into account, but hopefully they have confidence in us, but we are making right decisions that will add to the value of their investment and we are always confronted whether it is a M&A deal or new development or redevelopment to weigh short-term paying for long term gain. We thankfully, hopefully will continue, but certainly historically we\u2019ve made pretty good decisions on that front. We\u2019ve certainly have embedded a 1000 of where we\u2019ve been made risky investments. We\u2019ve done it on a low key basis and small basis compared to the enterprise and I go back to two to jump out of me, you know one was the one in China.", "The other was in, I call my blue period where we are doing all the technology, you know in the late, whenever I was \u2013 I try to forget about it. Late 90s early 2000, so you know I would say to with this last situation, I mean the shareholders that we spoke to at least what they told me they were supportive of what we were trying to accomplish and that\u2019s what they told me and again, I mean we never got to the point where we were able to lay out all that we could do there, but we certainly always factor that in. We do know that sometimes doing these things is not the easy road. You know the easy road is to just do what a lot of other folks do, which is not a lot, okay. But this company is all about not doing what is easy.", "And then it\u2019s easy just to you know I don\u2019t know redevelop a thing here, build something there, but that\u2019s not what we are about, we are about and are trying to make this company unique and when you do that you sometimes you do create short-term confusion and/or short term underperformance. We hope, all we can do we hope is that people look at the track record and look at dividend growth. I mean 15% dividend growth at a company our size \u2026", "Andrew Rosivach", "There is not push back on that. There is no push back that you are actually great at doing M&A, it just when it goes on for a quarter and most of my clients are based on one of your performance on a relative basis that after a while it starts to hurt and I even got the impression you know when you wrote your March 20 final offer, I got a sense when you were saying not to go through multi-year proxy, I think you were starting to notice the pain it was creating with your share price.", "David Simon", "Well look that is a whole different subject that is probably better off, I am happy to have you with or anybody else, but it is probably better off to have that not necessarily on \u2013 in this kind of format, but we \u2013 look short term, we are all about short term gain if there is a long term play there but it\u2019s important to have support from our shareholders. And I can say to you that they were the ones that I talk to or relatively support of what we try to accomplish, but on the other hand going through a multiyear proxy fight et cetera. If we had done that, that\u2019s when we might have lost support. That\u2019s a judgment call I have to make and I made the judgment call and I did. I think the support would have been there had we on the deal, rather the support would have been there on a long drawn out battle, I don\u2019t know. But I decide to not to ask for.", "Andrew Rosivach", "Thanks for your commentary. Appreciate it.", "David Simon", "Sure. No problem.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Vincent Chao", "Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to the FX question a little bit, I appreciate the comments on the earnings side of things. Just curious last quarter we talked a little about the impact on some of the tourism driven markets. Just wondering if you could give I guess an update on what you\u2019re seeing in those markets as it pertains to FX impacts?", "David Simon", "In the U.S. side with the strong dollar.", "Vincent Chao", "Right.", "David Simon", "Yeah, okay. Fair enough. We are seeing a little bit \u2013 I would tell you that it\u2019s just really volatile right now on some of those tourist markets where there is a good month, a good week, and then there is a bad month and a bad week. So it kind of balances out, but I would say it\u2019s safe to say that the strong dollar is affecting to some extent sales in some of the really highly international assets that we have but nothing that\u2019s going to change our financial profile or earnings or any of that. But it is a lot more volatile, you hear occasionally in South Florida a little bit, you hear \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen anything at Woodbury but I\u2019ve heard a lot in New York, now we have no exposure there but you hear and then when I say hear, I\u2019m hearing from the retailers, but with something to pay attention to it.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks. And then just more domestically just given the drop in oil prices, it seems like there was expectations that would flow into the economy, but seems like it\u2019s being saved. Just curious if you are seeing anything different from that in your own mall traffic and that kind of that.", "David Simon", "I\u2019d still say generally we are still dealing with a cautious consumer, it\u2019s safe to say and it\u2019s volatile. So the comment I heard about the tourism also applies to just the domestic consumer as well. The patterns of the consumer are tougher to predict right now. I still think there is \u2013 confidence is getting better, but there is still a lot of debt being reduced and it\u2019s still there is a good month, good week, and then a bad month, a bad week and the pattern is sloppy enough but it\u2019s certainly not getting busters. And look we had 2% total sales increase from quarter-over-quarter \u201914 to \u201915. That\u2019s the kind of world we are in right now. We did get unbelievably so we did not mention this, Nova [ph] mentioned in it so I probably shouldn\u2019t mention it but we had another awful winter in northeast. For those of you in Boston only, we have a lot of exposure in northeast. Believe it or not, our snow expense was higher this year than last year across the portfolio. So we still had to deal with a little bit of the weather, but we are dealing with a cautious consumer and we are delivering \u2013 the good news is, we are delivering results in that environment. That\u2019s all we can do.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed.", "Carol Kemple", "Good morning. Thinking about the premium outlet pipeline out there, how much room do you think there is for premium outlets of Simon\u2019s quality to be built in the U.S.? Can you quantify a number? Are there 20 possible sites left in the U.S., or where do you think that number would be?", "David Simon", "Well, I think that would be a real challenge of our kind of quality to produce. Right now, the way we look at it, 20 additional outlets. I still think it\u2019s a handful. We are going through \u2013 the industry is going through a little bit of a growth spurt. But, Carol, I would say, 20 would be a stretch. I\u2019m going to \u2013 this is so hard to give you a real number, but I would say \u2013 as we look at the stuff that we might see building, we\u2019ve got three now that will start, maybe another two or three next year. But from our standpoint, I would see under 10 over the next three to five years, domestic starts within our portfolio.", "Carol Kemple", "Okay.", "Rick Sokolov", "The one thing I would say to you Carol is when you think about growth, please don\u2019t forget about the expansions that David mentioned earlier. They are almost the equivalent in terms of productivity of a new outlet. We are adding a lot of square footage at Chicago and at Woodbury and at San Francisco. And all of that is adding mass, and that\u2019s absorbing demand in the most productive way that could possibly happen. And I encourage all of you to go out and see what we just opened at Desert Hills, and if you are out in Las Vegas, what we are opening in Las Vegas North the week of the ICSC convention. These things are dramatic expansions with great retailers that are highly, highly productive.", "Carol Kemple", "Okay, thanks. And then this question is for Rick. We\u2019ve heard a lot about store closings. I know you love to give your list of who wants the space. Do you have any new names for us?", "David Simon", "I can\u2019t wait.", "Rick Sokolov", "Well, you have to relax and stretch. But I think one thing that I would like to point out to everybody is we talk about all this, the tenant that has the broadest footprint in our portfolio is L Brands, with Victoria\u2019s Secret and they are doing great results, and they are growing and they are expanding and they are adding things to the Victoria's Secret stores. But we are doing with a lot of international retailers that people haven\u2019t -- DAVIDsTEA has come down, we are growing UNIQLO, we are growing H&M, we are growing Sephora, and we are growing Altar\u2019d State, which is a great retailer that has got a significant growth platform. And frankly, as David said, the ones that left are low productivity, oversized. So that gives us the opportunity to bring in higher productivity retailers that are just going to increase the market share of our properties.", "Carol Kemple", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Michael Mueller", "Yes, hi. Just a quick one. It sounds like a lot could be going on at Syosset. So how much of that project would you actually do yourselves?", "David Simon", "Yeah, in terms of the mixed use, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point, Michael. We probably \u2013 when it gets to the office, we will probably sell the office. We might partner on the residential, but \u2013 again, there is roughly 400,000 of retail, so that we will do with our partner. The other hotel we may or may not do. So my guess is at the end of the day, we\u2019d probably look to either sell or joint venture. We probably won\u2019t do the office; we might sell or joint venture the other uses.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it. Okay. That was pretty much it. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure. No worries.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Linda Tsai", "Hi. When people talk about omni-channel, my sense is that they think of traditional mall-based or full-priced stores. To what extent are you seeing omni-channel capabilities incorporated into the Premium Outlet model? Do you think this is something that makes sense for you and the retailers?", "David Simon", "Well, I think the retailers as they bring in the omni-channel world to their physical stores will certainly apply to the outlet world as well. And again, they are all at different degrees of that integration. But I don\u2019t think outlets would be ignored on that front at all. So I would expect that to be part of it.", "Linda Tsai", "Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question, we have a follow-up from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman, again. David, I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts a little bit on Land and Buildings and Orange Capital\u2019s proxy campaign post them rebuffing your offer. And at least in Jon\u2019s letter he references a conversation that he had with you and, obviously, I don\u2019t know if that conversation is done verbatim. But it implied that what you had told him was based on where Simon\u2019s stock is currently, almost $200; that that would imply $100 for Macerich. So I\u2019m just curious how you think about that as well as their campaign.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 put it this way, I\u2019m not surprised by Land and Buildings\u2019 and Orange\u2019s \u2013 that they might pursue something like this, or others. But as you can see from their proxy materials, we are not participating or providing any financial support in their proxy. But I\u2019m not surprised that someone like them would take up this particular issue. But, again, we are not\u2014this is not us, this is them. And I said to you, you can see it from their preliminary proxy stuff that we\u2019re not supporting or involved in that at all. And then, as a shareholder, we will wait and see what happens.", "Michael Bilerman", "Right. I guess as a shareholder, when they came out after rebuffing your offer for the final time, then they put out their presentation of the plan forward, I guess as a shareholder would you have wanted to know how they achieve a price equal to or greater than the offer that you had put on the table? And I guess did that surprise you that that wasn\u2019t in there?", "David Simon", "Well, look, that\u2019s up for Macerich to respond to. I mean I can only tell you what I told you earlier, which is I think we put a hell of a deal on the table and I was looking to engage with Art. I consider Art a peer. We\u2019ve had a good relationship. People say hostile offer. I don\u2019t \u2013 let me give you my thinking on this. Any time somebody offers a lot of money to somebody, I never consider that hostile, okay? Now, it may not be \u2013 it maybe unsolicited, but it ain\u2019t hostile\u2026", "Michael Bilerman", "At a 30% premium, no less.", "David Simon", "Okay. It ain\u2019t hostile. So I hope Art and the board realizes that I didn\u2019t view it as hostile. I view it \u2013 sure, it was unsolicited, but it was a hell of an offer done in the spirit of trying to negotiate a deal at a big number and I will leave it at that. It\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news, but I will leave it at that. But it was not hostile. Unsolicited, absolutely. But, again, anytime I think \u2013 I\u2019m a simpleton when it comes to this \u2013 but anytime you offer a big number to somebody, I don\u2019t view that as hostile. I just view that as of the way of the world, I guess.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yes, okay. Thanks, David.", "David Simon", "All right. No worries.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to David for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "All right. Thank you, everyone, and take care and we will talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Tanya, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "I would now like to hand the presentation over to our host, Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly J. Doran", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our reports filed with the SEC for detailed discussion. Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that our call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, October 25, 2011.", "During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.  ", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Thank you for joining us today and I'll just give you a quick update on some of the highlights and then we'll open up for Q&A. ", "First of all, we reported funds from operations of $1.71 for the quarter, which represents an increase of 19.6% over the FFO in the third quarter of 2010 as adjusted for the third quarter in 2010, which adds back -- add back our debt extinguishment charge. This result beats First Call consensus by $0.05 per share. We have now met or exceeded expectations for 29 of the past 31 quarters. ", "Let me talk about some statistics. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $517 per square foot, up 9.3% from $473 as of September 30, 2010, which is nearly 60 million square feet of GLA.", "Now that we've owned Prime for year this quarter, we have begun to include the Prime portfolio in our statistics, and so we've adjusted our September 30, 2010, to give you a sense of comparability. There were a couple of analysts out there that suggested that our average base rents went down sequentially. Keep in mind that we did not go back and adjust 630 numbers for Prime. So that reduction in base rent is all associated with adding Prime into our portfolio. And in fact, when you add Prime in on 630, we've had -- we did have sequential average base minimum rent growth, and Shelly can give you those details later. ", "Occupancy was 93.9%, 10 basis points higher than the year earlier period, and 30 basis points higher than the end of the second quarter. This was achieved despite the loss of over 160,000 square feet due to liquidations of Borders and Anchor Blue. ", "The releasing spread for the 12 months was $4.77 per square feet to positive 9.6%. Our releasing spread continues to include all in-line space, including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet, and most importantly, comparable property NOI growth was 3.8% for the quarter and 3.2% year-to-date. It was driven by increases in minimum and overage rent. ", "Development activity. Quickly, we have 3 new developments under construction, all are Premium Outlets, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Malaysia. We have 22 renovation and expansion projects under construction in the U.S. with completion dates scheduled for this year and 2012, and the restoration of Opry Mills continues with the completion expected in the spring of 2012. We also have expansions, significant expansions underway at 3 Premium Outlet centers in Japan. As we have discussed with you in the past couple of quarters, our development or redevelopment programs in the U.S. and abroad are accelerating. We're seeing good value creation opportunities. We expect our share development spend to approximate nearly $500 million in 2011, and the potential for 2012, again, depending on timing, could approximate $1 billion. As always, details on the cost and returns and timing on these projects are provided in our supplemental reporting package. ", "On the acquisition front, we continue to demonstrate our ability to strategically invest capital. We completed 2 in this quarter. First of all, in July, we acquired ABQ Uptown, a 220,000 square feet -- square foot lifestyle center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The center generates sales of approximately $650 per square foot and adds to our presence in the growing Albuquerque market, where we're also on Cottonwood Mall, and in August, we acquired a controlling interest in King of Prussia, one of the truly iconic shopping destinations in the U.S., increasing our ownership from 12% to 96%. In addition, we have the contractual ability to acquire the remaining 4% interest in the fall of 2013. This acquisition will be immediately accretive to our earnings and the property has excellent growth prospects as we expect to increase the NOI at KOP by approximately 30% in the next 3 years. ", "Capital markets. We closed on -- in early October on a new unsecured revolving credit facility well ahead of its maturity date that increased our revolving borrowing capacity to $4 billion, with the ability to increase it to $5 billion during its term, and can be extended to October 30, 2016, at our sole option. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 100, and the facility provides for money market competitive bid option, which we expect to even more lower the indicative pricing of LIBOR plus 100. We also have lower pricing grid from our previous facility and the new maturity, as I mentioned, up to 5 years, which further enhances our already strong financial position. We also have nearly $930 million of cash on hand, including our share of joint venture cash. ", "On dividends. We're very pleased to announce that our common stock dividend for the fourth quarter will total $1.10 per share. This is comprised of 2 separate dividends. First of all, we've now increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.90 from $0.80. This represents a 12.5% increase of the dividend that's payable on November 30, to shareholders of record on November 16. We also announced the special cash dividend of $0.20 per share. This dividend is payable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 16. These 2 dividends, as I mentioned to you earlier, total $1.10 for the quarter and increases our total payout from the $3.50 for the 2011 calendar year, which we expect to approximate our 2011 taxable income. The new $0.90 quarterly dividend rate also positions us to have a trajectory of at least $3.60 per share in 2012, and we would expect to revisit our dividend again in October to ensure that we're paying 100% of our 2012 estimated taxable income. ", "Now let me turn to guidance. Based upon our strong results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year, we increased the low end of our 2011 FFO guidance range by $0.15 per share to $6.80 per share, and raised the top end by $0.12 to $6.85 per share. The midpoint of our current guidance is now a full $0.30 above the midpoint of our original 2011 guidance provided to you in February.", "Before I open it up for questions, let me just conclude by saying, we're pleased with 2011 thus far with our performance. We've had strong performance at our core properties, accretive acquisitions. We continued to strengthen our already industry-leading balance sheet, all of which will serve us well in 2011 but also position us for more good stuff in the future. ", "We're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "David or Rick, with respect to Gap's plans to close a chunk of their stores, specifically, where are their rents relative to the $54 level you've been signing leases at? And maybe from a broader perspective, do you see this is a trend to some of your older more established chain of rightsizing their store counts now that they're coming up upon lease expirations?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me start and then Rick can add. First of all, I think with respect to Gap, Ross, it's very important to put in perspective. They've been shrinking their fleet for the last few years, and I think the recent announcement was nothing new to us, and in fact, as I mentioned to you, we've been seeing a reduction in their fleet with us for the last 3 or 4 years as they continue to add very anemic sales per square feet, as well as decreasing sales per square feet. Now just to put The Gap in perspective to your next question, it is kind of where do we think rents are with Gap. They were very effective in being able to negotiate a large amount of space, a great space in highly productive malls at below market rents when they were going through their growth phase. Now obviously, those days are over, and even though we're likely to lose some space in less productive malls, we will more than make it up, and I think we've already have -- I don't want to get too granular in rollovers with certain Gap stores, but we will more than make that up as we reclaim the space in the higher producing malls that we will either shrink their footprint or in fact, eliminate their brand in those centers. It's a trend that we're seeing outside of Gap and the answer to that is not really, but it's a trend that we have seen years and years of experience, where concepts tend to get bigger than what they should and it's a natural evolution in retail, but frankly, they're the only one going through this kind of downsizing in a material -- on a material basis.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then my final question, there's been a few, what we'll call, A malls that have traded this year.", "David E. Simon", "Yes.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "But the trend in B malls changing hands didn't occur. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing differential between those 2 categories? And do you think that they've been overdone on both extreme?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I can only speak to our point of view. I mean, we were able to buy King of Prussia and though we don't talk about individual mall transaction, we're extremely comfortable with the going in yield and the expected yield that we will get from that asset. As you might know, we didn't really run the property. We kind of ran it through a joint venture and that was a terrific relationship over the years with our partners. The fact is we're very comfortable that there's a lot of upside to achieve from that asset, so I can only talk about what we've bought and there's absolutely no concerns on my behalf in terms of what we paid and the growth that we have from the assets that we bought. The B malls, look, I think we're still trying to figure out kind of where that market is. There's not right now natural buyers, so it is going to require a group of opportunity type funds or entrepreneurs that are going to want to gobble these up, and a lot of that is dependent upon financing. There will be strategic assets here and there that certain mall companies might buy, but I still think price discovery is going to eventually occur there, and I don't think it will be all that earth shattering in terms of cap rates. I still think kind of where the talk is. Assuming the market comes back on financing, we'll ultimately deliver the values that people are kind of circling in those -- for those assets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe the first question is for Steve. When I kind of look at the implicit fourth quarter FFO that you're giving, given the full year number, it's just up a little bit from the first -- fourth quarter of last year, and I'm just trying to sort of understand why earnings would only be up 1% or 2%. What was nonrecurring last year? Just given the strength in the core business, the acquisitions that you've done and probably some savings on refinancings.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "So you're accusing us of being conservative? If that's the case, I hope you're right. One thing that you do need to think about, Steve, is that the Prime acquisition does anniversary, and so it is in the full fourth quarter of 2010, and so that will make a difference.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I understand but if you -- and I understand you won't be up 19% again, but at the midpoint of your new range, you're talking about earnings of kind of $1.85 against $1.82, so I know you like to be conservative. I know you've got a very good track record of beating, but is there anything else that's one-time that occurred last year, like lease termination fees or gains that may not come up in the fourth quarter this year?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, lease termination fees, generally speaking, were higher in 2010. We've had very little lease termination activity in 2011. The other thing that you do have is that in 2011, and I'd have to look at the fourth quarter specifically, Steve, but bad debt expense turned out to be a credit for most of 2011 where -- because of some of the bankruptcies that have occurred this year, we have seen -- while still a below normal level of activity, we have seen some bad debt expense.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then David, maybe can you just talk about some of the international opportunities. I guess, there's been a lot of chatter just about your interest in Brazil and you're up over the last 3 to 6 months, and as you kind of traveled around the world and look for opportunities. As we kind of look through the European business in terms of the assets that you own, occupancy was up a bit but the sales were kind of flat. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about some of these markets today in light of sort of the dislocation that's going on in Europe and the stronger growth in the emerging markets.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think Europe is going to be in for a challenge for sure. So we still like the outlet business worldwide, and right now, that continues to be our primary focus worldwide. We had a worldwide franchise in the outlet business, so that's the primary focus to take advantage of, and that could be Europe, that could be South America and certainly Asia. We want to -- you see all the stuff that we're doing in Japan, expanding that platform. Korea, we think we have another deal on the horizon there. Malaysia, we open up in December. So I think from a international point of view, the priority will continue to be the outlet business. Look, I think -- generally, I think we've proven that we have a unique model that allows us to acquire, develop and improve real estate worldwide. We certainly want to look at everything that's out there to do it. We do believe that there is some -- if there's a company that could really turn into a global retail real estate company, it's us, and that's going to require us to look at everything there. There could be dislocation in Europe that could create buying an opportunities. On the other hand, sometimes, those things never come to fruition, but day to day, we're looking at how to grow the outlet business internationally. That's the #1 priority.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "David, just back to the original question in terms of store closings. If you think about leasing spreads over the next 12 months, is your assessment that there really should be a minimal impact, I guess, maybe in your leasing spreads and occupancy?", "David E. Simon", "From The Gap or generally?", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just in general from some of the store closings that have been talked about recently or planned store closings.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Look, I think not everything is robust in retail real estate. It never seems to be, and every year we got to fill the book again from people that are scaling back, but we believe strongly that, that as we look at our rents and our occupancy cost, we will have the ability to increase our rents as we recapture space. We've proven that almost 20 years now as a public company, so I don't expect that to change at all. I think The Gap is a great opportunity. They're underperforming. A lot of those spaces are well below our average rents, and we look to take advantage of that as well, and we're going to look at those one by one, individually, so I would expect our ability to produce rent spreads, assuming we generally have a decent economy, to certainly be produced again next year. Rick?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes, the only thing that I would add is that we're focusing on a Gap announcement, but there is a significant number of tenants that are doing well, are looking to expand and in fact have already come to us and said, \"Well, if you get that Gap room back, we want it.\" So I would not just view this through the prism of a Gap contraction. You have to also bear in remind all the tenants out there that are doing well, looking to expand and the fact that there's virtually no new development, so whatever demand is being created among our retailers, it's going to be satisfied out of the existing inventory in the industry.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And Rick, maybe as well, can you give us some sense of perhaps demand for 2012 or commitments at this point? Or is it booked early?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, we're in the midst of our leasing now, and demand has maintained pretty stable. There are a number of tenants I've just said, like Apple, Forever 21, Loft, Love Culture, that are expanding. You've seen a significant number of IPOs being done by retailers that are active in the mall area, and they're recapitalized and looking to grow, and we are sanguine about our prospects, but as David emphasized, we are at the mercy of the macroeconomic environment. So if things stay as they are, we should be okay.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and just final question in terms of some of the Class A transactions that we've seen in the mall category. With the 30% increase in NOI, are you really looking at stabilized yields of 6 plus percent?", "David E. Simon", "Oh, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citigroup.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well. Just in terms -- just going back to the international question, I believe you were down in Brazil recently and it sounds like internationally, you're more focused on the outlet center business, but I'd be just curious to get your takeaways on the mall business in Brazil and whether or not that something that could interest you at some point?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's a vibrant economy. The malls there produce a significant amount of cash flow, higher cash flow per foot or per meter, however you'd like to look at it, then they do in the U.S., which to me was very interesting. They charge for parking, which is very interesting given that you've got an emerging customer there that you would think would be hard to charge for parking, but a lot of positives. I think, long term, Brazil is -- I'm sure there will be lots of ups and downs given its historical nature, but long term, I think the country, obviously, has got a tremendous amount going for it. There are some worries because the cash flow per foot or per meter is so high. It's counterintuitive versus, say, an emerging market. You would think it would be low and growing, but despite that, I think a lot of that has to do with supply and demand. It's a very intriguing market. Lots of supply coming on, so it'll be interesting to see how that all shakes out, but an impressive group of companies and malls and overall, an impressive marketplace.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "David, its Michael Bilerman speaking. Just a question on the dividend, just thinking about how you sort of thought through the process in terms of paying out a special to get to a 100% payout ratio versus setting sort of a dividend run rate without doing this sort of top-up specials at the end of the year, and how you discuss that with the Board and sort of how you came to this decision, And I assume you could have paid out the bare minimum to 90%, but you went to 100%, and to thinking about where you stand and how you think about next year.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think this year, to put our dividend in perspective, there's a thing called bonus depreciation that we took advantage of, and the reason we -- so our taxable income is lower probably than a normal run rate because the fact of the matter is that we took advantage of the kind of the bonus depreciation that has -- the Congress has put forward to kind of stimulate the economy. Whether that's worked or not, that's for another debate. Next year, we don't know if that's going to be there or not, and I think we told you from Day 1, we want to pay out our taxable income at a bare minimum, so our run rate now is 360. We probably will have a higher taxable income than that next year, and I kind of like having a run rate that's going to grow over time and then the ability to top it off based upon our taxable income, which includes a lot of different things, so I actually think it's the more elegant way than raising it significantly and beyond the kind of where the raise was and then in terms of a few taxable income ends up less than that you're paying out more than that, and given what's going on with taxable income for corporate America today, we thought this was the best, more prudent. It also reinforces our strategy to provide a growing dividend. Not many REITs are growing their dividends. Certainly, not many are growing on a 12.5% basis, and being able to use the extra capital that we have to fund our business and generate even more earnings, and I think it's a pretty good cycle to be on. So I read your thing. I was confused that you'd said disappointed. I don't know. I've had a lot of shareholders that we're very happy, including the Board.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But it's a question more or so of, do you get paid for a $0.20 special at the end of the year? Or do you generate more institutional interest especially from generalist investors about having a consistent quarterly dividend that increases over time?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it did increase. It went from $0.80 to $0.90, and if we had -- we have to pay out $3.50, and so if you take the logic of what you're saying is that we would have to pay out $1.10 in the quarter, and that would be $4.40 for next year, and that's not kind of the trajectory that we really want to convey. So I think it's the right thing to do. We appreciate your input on it. We're very pleased with the outcome of it.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What was the bonus amount, the depreciation in terms of how much it affected taxable income for 2011?", "David E. Simon", "It was roughly, I'm going to say, $0.25, something like that.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, about $0.20. Yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, so you're set up for $3.75 for next year, so you're already...", "David E. Simon", "No. I think next year will be higher than that, and that allows us to be put on a trajectory higher than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "So if you guys take a broader view of the economy, it seems like for one of a very few times in history, it seems like retail sales are doing very well despite the lack of consumer confidence. How long do you think this divergence can last especially in light of today's pretty bad print?", "David E. Simon", "Today's what? I didn't hear the last question.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Especially in light of today's bad consumer confidence number.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think we have a bifurcated consumer, and generally, the people that shop at our malls are -- the unemployment for the college educated is in the 4% to 5% range. Certainly, we would like all the people to be benefiting from a growing economy, but the general view of our business is that we want to attract the better consumer that does have disposable income to spend, and we've been successful in doing that. We don't always do it. We have certain properties that don't do that, but generally, I think as long as the economy continues to at least have some GDP growth, we'll be able to continue to attract the better customer that has -- that I think has disposable income to spend.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just a follow-up on a previous question, what would your sales per square foot and same-store NOI numbers be without the Prime inclusion?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, Ki Bin, this is Steve. The sales without Prime, I think, would have been $3 a square foot higher, and the -- excuse me, $7 a square foot higher, and the comp NOI number does not include Prime. It won't include Prime until the next quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "We know from what the retailers have been saying on their calls that there's...", "David E. Simon", "Paul, can you speak up?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "We can barely hear you.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "We just know from what the retailers have been saying that there's been a lot of demand for the As and what they comment about the As and Bs, they talk about [indiscernible] still, but from your perspective, has there been any shift in the negotiations for space in the Bs this year, as retailers maybe get a bit more encouraged by their sales? Or is it still much harder slogging than in your top kind of quartile?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Paul, this is Rick. I think we have always seen a pretty direct relationship with the productivity of our properties and our ability to drive our rents. As we have been able to increase the productivity of our properties, we're making them more attractive to retailers and we have been able to drive occupancy and rents in those properties. We put in our press release the fact that in 2011, we're opening 39 new anchors and big boxes or almost 1.7 million square feet across the portfolio. We're renovating another 18 properties. All of this is making our properties more attractive, driving market share, driving sales and helping us lease the property. Is it always going to be a function of the market position and productivity? Sure, but we think we're creating better product for our leasing guys to sell.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Just sort of on a similar thing, as I look at the expiring leases for 2012 at $32, that's like 20% almost below where you\u2019re in-place average is. How should I think about -- I mean, is that an opportunity to take releasing spreads higher from where they are now? Or is it maybe representative of the big portfolio but could be representative the type of malls where you have more expirations? How do we think about next year based on the $32 number?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think it's very positive, right? So -- look, our size is such that these numbers actually mean something, whereas others with smaller portfolios may have statistics that could indicate something other than what it is just because they're smaller. So the fact is, at the end of the day, that rollover is a great opportunity for the company and we intend to take advantage of it, and we've said consistently that our leases are under market. I think that helped us perform in the Great Recession. Recall, if I could, Paul, that we did not have negative NOI growth in our portfolio during the Great Recession, and I think that, that is a good statistic that creates the insurance policy of our ability to generate comp NOI growth. The size of that spread is dependent upon a lot of macro things, but the bottom line, it's a great spot to be in, and additionally, it lasts for a long time, so it's not a 1-year event. So let's hope we can continue on the track that we've demonstrated for the past several years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, this is Jeff Spector. I'm here with Craig. We have a few questions. If I could just ask a couple first. David, I guess, just thinking about the bumps in 2011 in your guidance, what were some of the surprises, I guess, you felt happened during the course of the year? And as you're laying out your 2012 budgets, I guess, from a macro standpoint, what are you thinking at this point?", "David E. Simon", "Well, the biggest surprise, a pleasant surprise, is that we've had comp NOI that's been higher than the budget. To me, that's the most important thing that we can do. Sometimes, it's out of our control because it's tied to retailer sales. Bankruptcies could impact that. We've had some -- we've had more of that this year than the last year, if you recall. So to me, that's always the #1 focus, is how do we increase the cash flow on a comp basis from the properties. So with that said -- I mean, that's the focus, what -- Prime is -- we have outperformed on our Prime portfolio in terms of our underwriting and our expectations there that helped fuel our growth. Rates were a little lower than what we projected as well, and so those were kind of the material things we had. Offsetting that was some bankruptcies, less lease settlement income, but that's kind of the ups and downs.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And how are you then thinking about your 2012 budget from a macro standpoint? I know you're not providing guidance, but anything you could comment on?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we're just about to start that excruciating process. Don't remind me. We actually do bottoms up property by property, so if we look a little dazed, if you see us at the end of Thanksgiving, we kind of get dazed by that time, but we actually do that work. It's a little early. I mean, I think the fact of the matter is, the biggest caveat that we have is all about the macro. Where is the economy? Where is consumer confidence? The election year throws a whole set of psychological issues at the consumer, none of which are positive, but you know what? We will figure it out, and I expect to have another good year and another year of growth, but we're right now in that process. As you know, Jeff, we do that beginning or kind of right when we do our year-end results, so -- but we'd expect to have another good year.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Maybe just one more question for Craig. I'd ask his. I guess, thinking about the different formats, it's pretty clear that Premium Outlets continues to shine, outperform. I guess, can you -- any -- could you provide any information, I guess, on your shopping center portfolio versus the malls as we head into Christmas, the holiday season? Any feedback from tenants, whether it's the smaller tenants or the big box?", "David E. Simon", "I'll let Rick. Rick, go ahead.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "A couple of things. One, all 4 of our platforms are positive to both budget and to actuals last year. So they're all performing well year-to-date. In terms of the holiday, we literally have 4 tenants in here today and talking to them, they're all anticipating up probably 2% to 3%. Inventories are very tight. People are not chasing sales. They'd rather leave a few sales on the table and make sure that they drive their margins and are not over inventory. Then the only other point I would say is, there is a -- and as we think about our world, there's are pretty high correlation to the better retailers and how the S&P 500 does. So we're to a degree, I think, really focused on how that better consumer is thinking about their position, and that will be reflected to a degree by the S&P 500.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess -- this is Craig. I had a question on the King of Prussia, the potential 30% increase in NOI. Clearly, the conversion of Strawbridge would be a big part, but is there other things that will be helping you push towards that goal?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think that is part of that, Craig, for sure, but additionally, it's just we believe that in -- putting in all of the Simon programs that we didn't put in previously because of the partnership limitations, all of that led to that cash flow, and whether they're all of our marketing programs going to fix cam [ph] as an example, we feel like the rents weren't at the level they should be given the quality of the asset, so all of that -- plus it's really interesting and it's probably somewhat premature to talk about it but I'll go ahead, is that we are looking to put Strawbridge aside because as you know, that's under construction, but our ultimate focus in this property will be to combine The Plaza with The Court, with additional retail, and we have the FAR ability to do that, and we're just discussing that concept with the Village, but we think that's a great opportunity to really integrate both of these properties and make it one unbelievable shopping destination beyond what it is today.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "But just to be clear, Craig. This is Steve. That's not in the 30%. The 30% is just executing the redevelopment of the Strawbridge and then finalizing the property by doing some of the things that David talked about, like the conversion to fix cam [ph] and the full implementation of the marketing programs.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great, and then just one last question. If you could talk a little bit about what you're doing with Nanuet Mall. I mean, I understand that maybe more of an outdoor or mixed-use and if you're going to be doing any kind of repositioning by the future tenants?", "David E. Simon", "We are about to demolish the mall in the next month or so, and we will end up creating a -- what I'll call for better or worse, a lifestyle center, an open-air center that will be anchored by Sears, Macy's. They will stay in place. It will be a road and retail kind of through the property. We'll add a health club, where we'll add a high-end food operation, restaurants and specialty retail, and all systems go there. We're just about done with all the planning, and the demolition, as I said, should occur here in the near future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen and company.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "A question -- first question for me, it's in the area of the several other questions have kind of been on, and maybe coming out of from a slightly different angle, David, looking at your average portfolio base rent and average sales. Obviously, sales trends have been very, very positive in spite of the negative productivity contribution, I guess, from Gap, and your average base rent in the portfolio is now at 7.5%, about as low as it's been in a long, long time now. We know the outlet center portfolio is included in that metric now, and I just wonder if you could help us think about how you think about that 7.5% number over the course of the cycle. In the past, it can run up to the mid-8s or higher, and do you think it will have that upside potential given the change in the composition of the total portfolio?", "David E. Simon", "There's no reason, assuming we have a stable economy, growing economy, that we're not going to work our way back to that level. Now retail, I mean, there's a lot of pressure in retail. We have the consumer under pressure. So it is going to take work. It's going to take some level of stability. It's going to require the mood to get a little bit better generally in the country, but I'm actually feeling that these things will work their way through the system in that way, and it's hard to give you a specific number, but we do think that, that presents a lot of opportunity on the rent. There's no question about it.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And I guess, going to the point about Gap, given that Gap's productivity trend is negative to the rest of the portfolio. Presumably, the sooner you get that space back, the better off it will be in terms of that metric.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. There's no doubt you will have a step backward and then 2 steps forward because as you reclaim the space, you're going to have downtime, and in some cases, it's going to take a little bit of period of time to lease it up, but at the end of the day -- we've done all sorts of analysis on this. At the end of the day, we just think there's tremendous upside overall. It's not to say there aren't going to be some holes that will be generated as we lose some of The Gap stores, Gap brands, whether it's Old Navy, Banana or just The Gap brand, but over a -- not a long period of time, but over a 2-year period of time, as you lease up the space that we reclaim, there's going to be tremendous upside, and even in A malls, their productivity does not allow them to essentially pay market rents where others do, and the benefit that we see in A malls from them there versus others has been diminished somewhat as they shrink their portfolio appetite.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just a quick question regarding the projected rate of return on development spend. In the quarter, the projected stabilized return on the anchor big box segment of the development went down a little bit from 12 to 10. I know there was movements in and out of what's on that schedule. Was there any changes in cost projections on projects or was it  simply -- it's the lower number simply because of what came out in the third quarter?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It's just a matter of the mix of projects, Jim. In fact, we've had very good forecasting in the overall environment. Our construction costs have been coming in at or below what we have been using for our capital allocation approvals.", "David E. Simon", "And I think -- I would say one thing. Jim, our people are used to -- hopefully, the conservative nature and how we present ourselves resides throughout the building, and certainly, when we approve projects -- I mean, the level of sandbagging in our projects depends on who's doing the project but it's institutional in nature. So I would hope over time that we would produce better results in that, but Rick's right. It is in the mix, but we're being very aggressive and really focused on trying to make our properties the best as they can be, spending a lot of time. A part of the reason to do more quicker are the reason why we hired Contest [ph] to help in that area. He is very focused on and so -- but hopefully, we will outperform those numbers. Now, Jim, you did mention in one of your reports -- I tried to address it. I garbled. I'm not very good at reading those things, but you -- I do hope you realize that the 630 base rent did not include Prime. When you do, we actually do have sequential growth, so I just wanted to reinforce that with you.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. And final question for me. David, the Marketplace Equity Act recently introduced in Congress, I know it's a modification from the prior bill that was post or proposed. I just wonder if you would like to make a comment about it. I don't know if you're hearing anything from people you work with about what kind of success it might have.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think we're very focused on it. ICSC is very focused on it. I'd like to thank David Henry and ICSC for finally recognizing. I think David's been the key to this to really to get -- to create a level playing field. There's 2 or 3 or 4 different approaches on how to do it. The good news is, I think, Congress is beginning to understand the difference. The fact that the level -- the field is not level. We're still educating certain congressmen and women about the fact that this is not a new tax. That's going through its process. Everybody that we talked to understands the fairness of it, and I think even Amazon, with their different deals that they're doing state by state, recognizes that the days are over where they get the level -- where they get the unfair advantage, but it would be much better to do it at a national level. That's what's really being cried for than to do it on a state-by-state level. But as you might imagine, it's a process, but we're actually feeling -- Rick is involved, too. He can add to it -- but we're actually feeling like there is hope to get something out there that can be passed by Congress.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And the only thing I would add is that, you're talking about billions of dollars in lost revenue from the states and it's a tax that's already on the books. So the combination of factors are coalescing that I believe it's going to happen in this cycle after it being in the conversation for 12 years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If I could actually stick on that topic, David, the Marketplace Equity Act, are you concerned that solution could actually prove to be something of a Trojan horse? And that by leveling the playing field, that really the door is open for online retailers, like Amazon, to actually provide same-day delivery service to major markets because...", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think they're looking to do that anyway, right? So that's going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if people like ourselves play a role in that. Believe me, we're focused on that. So Jeff, the fact is that's what Amazon wants to go to. We've got to create the mall version of that, but we still not want to give them the benefit of exemplary sales tax. I don't think it's a Trojan horse. I don't think it's going to hugely change the fact that Internet shopping is important, but the fact of the matter is, there's a lot of people, the more research you do -- that do lot of -- it used to be they researched online and went to shop physically. Now they go shop physically. They understand the difference that they don't have to pay the sales tax and actually go to the physical environment, do all the research, and buy online. All you have to do is ask Best Buy to get their perspective on it, and I think that needs to be eliminated. There's no reason why Amazon and certain others need that benefit, so same-day delivery is a different issue, as far as I am concerned.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And the only thing I would add is that our retailers that are operating the malls are also very focused on fulfillment and allowing their customers that want to have an online experience to fulfill those purchases at the property, and that just emphasizes one of the benefits we have of being able to facilitate those things in a much more efficient manner.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I think, I would agree, and it's not necessarily all one or other, online or bricks and mortar. I mean, in some ways, you saw that there's a Gap announcement, whether it's a scaling back on our mall stores, but I think ultimately, retailers are trying to find a way to provide value, and in that case, you saw The Gap increase or looking to increase their outlet store count. They kind of switched gears to that. I mean, do you think that -- you mentioned that you did not see a trend among mature retailers looking to scale back their store count, but do you think we're at the beginning of maybe another secular growth period for outlet demand as retailers maybe begin to discover that channel, if not here, then maybe, I call it, more broadly outside of the U.S.?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think the outlet business has been going strong for a number of years partly because I think we had a little bit to do with it, if I could, in that we took it out of the back room, more into the front room. We personally -- Rick and I, personally talked to a number of retailers talking about how it's not brand negative but brand positive for them, and what's brand negative is when they do want to sell merchandise to sell it in their store, their full price store, it creates all sorts of promotional issues, and in a lot of cases clouds what they're trying to do at the full price level. So that change has been going on for a number of years, plus the quality of the product that we build, how we executed the tenant mix, the marketing kind of all has been upgraded it to the next level, and we're still making improvements on it to make it the best experience that we can make it. So I think that trend continues. They still want -- there still is a high amount of outlet demand. We're seeing a lot of demand in our Mills portfolio because that's representing an outlet distribution channel. So I think it's -- we're seeing that internationally. I just happened to talk to a worldwide retailer that was talking to us about -- wants to talk to us about China outlet, which I've always a little bit worried about for all sorts of reasons, but for crying out loud, we're building an outlet in Malaysia, right? It's going to open in a month. So it's there. We expect to take advantage of it in other markets as well.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If I can just ask a last question back on the B and C mall topic. As a property investor, what realistically is the bull case for B and C mall investment today? I mean, do you think it's a fundamental story about occupancy and rent? Or is it really a capital market story about leverage because your earlier comment, it's more of a play for the entrepreneurial crowd. It kind of implies non-attractive risk return profile, and not to leave Steve out, I was curious, what does the state of the capital markets look like for B and C products because there a lot of anecdotes out there that the traditional equity and debt capital providers do to mall space. They really don't look at malls anymore under $350 a square foot in sales.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, it's very simple. The operating story is that if it's a B and C mall and there's a reason for it to exist, it's going to have a stable cash flow. And in fact, if that area continues to have economic growth, that cash flow will grow. And the fact of the matter is, if you have a appropriate management running it, you are able to add to the critical mass of that B&C property. The market may not be overly exciting, but the cash flow ought to maintain itself, and in fact, if you execute appropriately, you may even increase market share because there's a lot of -- where the market share got the fuse, where a lot of the strip centers that are -- then in a lot of cases are suffering from oversupply and not clear winner and loser in a lot of box movement back and forth. So from that standpoint, I think you're going -- and I think frankly, from our B Malls, they've actually performed reasonably well in a lot of cases in the Great Recession. Obviously, depending on the cap rate and depending on the financing, there is a pretty good return on equity that they're generating, and I think the ability to gain market share is all part of the story. Today, the CMBS market, 1 week it's on, 1 week it's off. We're getting bids, so I think it's back on. Last week, it wasn't. I still think that, that market still has a lot of -- it's more affected by what's going on in the risk on, risk off trade than it is what's going on in the real estate world.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a -- we're coming up on roughly the year anniversary of the Capital Shopping Centres saga, and looking at their stock price performance over the past year, looking at your stock price performance, I'm just curious if any of their stockholders have sort of called you up and said, \"Hey, if you make another run, you have our blessing and we'd be supportive.\"", "David E. Simon", "Well, that's not the British way, is it now? To admit that they may have made a mistake. The answer to that is no, but again, we have no interest in doing that either. We put our best foot forward. At that point, the Board, for whatever strange reason, turned down that deal, they shouldn't have in hindsight. We felt comfortable that we would have been able to execute a better gross story than they would have had by themselves. We\u2019re still waiting. We're still shareholders. I have more faith, frankly, today than I did before because at least Mr. Whittaker is a large shareholder. I think he is a very capable gentleman to reignite that company. So we're assessing how that proceeds, but we have no interest in buying the company.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So right now, you're more of just a passive shareholder who obviously would be there for advice, but you're not looking to get active in the company. Is that correct?", "David E. Simon", "That's correct.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Then sort of following that trend, what's your strategy for -- is it just simply now a stock investment? Or is it something that you would look to unwind then?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think in this case, we'll look at all of our options. That market is relatively depressed just from a lot of macro issues. So we're kind of adopting a wait-and-see approach. That could change, but right now, it's wait and see. I do think Mr. Whittaker is the kind of entrepreneur that, that company needs to get it reinvigorated. So we're kind of waiting to see whether or not that can happen. And look, we're certainly an important shareholder. We're certainly there to help anything we can do to make the company perform better.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Second question is, recently, there have been a number of items, sort of public-private, whether it's -- obviously, Westfield going back into World Trade. There's the Willet's Point here in New York, where it looks like Mays, Rich [ph] and Topman, are looking at putting together bids. The journal this morning featured the Fulton Street subway stop adjacent to World Trade, where maybe there's an opportunity for a retail landlord to come in and manage some of that retail space. I'm curious from your perspective, you guys have spoken a lot about development, redevelopment, but none of it has involved public-private. Just sort of curious if that's by design, maybe it's not worth the headache or the opportunities are -- the yields just don't make sense or if those opportunities are truly few and far between for the real, out of the park type situations?", "David E. Simon", "I'd say all of the above. I mean, we've never been -- we've never -- we've kind of always adopted the approach not to do RFPs, whether it's from a private -- whether it's just a private company or individual that's looking to sell his land, whether it's a public entity trying to redevelop something. We just don't really like the RFP process. We won't rule it out, but the fact of that matter is I've never personally gotten excited about it, and the public-private stuff is hard to make money. I think if we felt like we didn't have a lot of opportunities with our existing fleet of assets and our ability to look at things throughout the world, maybe we would resort to that. But at this point, we just -- I just have never personally gotten excited about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "The only question I have that hasn't been answered is relating to the income statement. Is there a reason why G&A grew so much in the quarter?", "David E. Simon", "Well, a part of that is our recent LTIP program that we've had with the senior management.", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "So is that a good run rate going forward then?", "David E. Simon", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm not sure I saw it disclosed anywhere, but what was the investment in King of Prussia and how is it financed?", "David E. Simon", "That -- again, we don't disclose individual mall transactions, and it was financed, I think we announced that, partly cash and partly in the line of credit.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And secondly, the leasing spreads of about 10% for the 9 months -- or for the year-to-date spreads of 10%, what is the difference between the cash spread and the GAAP spread?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Michael, this is Steve. That is a cash spread. That is ending cash rent at the time the lease expired or terminated to beginning cash rent with the new tenant or the renewal of the existing tenant. So if you convert it to GAAP, it would be higher.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, about how much higher roughly?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Michael, I don't have the number in front of me. It's not something that we tend to look at because as David had said on many, many occasions, his laser focus tends to be cash, but let us take a look at it, and I will get you a number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, following up on that for a second, the line of credit is at about $1.8 billion at this point. What are you guys thinking there in terms of -- I mean, you have about $900 million from the last quarter, I assume, again, mostly because of the acquisitions. What are you thinking about in terms of terming that out?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, as you know, Rich, the spreads in the bond market gapped out late summer and have been in kind of wide for the year over the course of the last 2 or 3 months. The good news is they have gotten better. The tender in the bond market has clearly gotten better, so it is something that we're paying attention to, and the good news, is have the flexibility to be patient, but as we think about that level of outstandings on the credit facility, if the bond market continues to improve, we'd love to term it out.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so doing CMBS, it sounds like it's not really something that's an option at this point but maybe an unsecured note over the next 6 months would be the way to go.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Rich, the CMBS market, as David mentioned earlier, we're getting quotes, and on many assets, we're getting very good quotes, but where we're focused there is primarily just to refinance existing mortgage debt that comes due as opposed to put mortgages on current unencumbered assets. I think...", "David E. Simon", "Yes, and I'd just add. Rich, this is David. Even with all of the ups and downs of the capital markets, both unsecured market and the CMBS market, it is more cost-effective in the unsecured market versus the CMBS market for sure, especially as you look at -- factor in fees, amortization, any...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Audit costs.", "David E. Simon", "The whole 9 yards.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Appraisals.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. And Rich, you made a comment about our sequential average base rent, you are clear on that now, I hope.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. You made that very clear. Let me ask you guys...", "David E. Simon", "That's part of my job.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes -- no, that was good. I got you on that quick. On the redevelopment scene, I think you guys have said you were looking to do a couple billion dollars of deliveries over the next, say, 5 years. I mean, should we think in terms of $500 million kind of average per year deliveries as we look out to 2015? Is that sort of a scope of the redevelopment scene?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think -- Rick can elaborate, but I think right now, '12 could shape up to accelerate some of that, so it could end up in '12 that we would have committed $1 billion in our redevelopment portfolio, so it would actually -- that number could accelerate, Rich, in terms of the timing of it.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, and Rich, this is Steve. If you recall, the number that we floated out was a quarter or 2 ago and it was primarily centered about the 17 or 18, what we called transformational opportunities. I think, number one, we've added to that list as we've continued to examine the portfolio; and two, the ordinary course of business stuff, like Rick mentioned with 40 boxes and all that, is kind of on top of those transformational opportunities.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good, and would you -- are you guys doing any densification sorts of efforts. I didn't really see that. I'm guessing they're in there somewhere, but where you add apartments or you add condos or office, that kind of thing.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, we are very focused on that, and if you look at the projects that we have opened, several of them have both office and res multifamily and hotel components, the primary one being domain, where we have a Weston [ph] plus multifamily in both phases, plus office in both phases, and obviously, we're working right now on the approval process for a very substantial residential tower over Copley in Boston, so it's very much a part of our focus and we, in fact, have a dedicated team looking to bring those incremental uses into our property.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good guys. And then the last thing I have was, David, it seemed that on the last call, that the Chinese outlet scene was a little closer than you made it sound just on one of the previous questions here. I mean, how close are you guys are doing something in China with -- as far as outlet centers go?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think we'll make a decision here in the next couple of months. So it will either happen or won't, but it won't drag on for 2 or 3 years, so it's -- we're in the serious discussion phase and that will either come to fruition in the next couple of months or it won't.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance ", "David, listening to your comments earlier in regards to B malls or at least those that are legitimate in terms of their existence given the quality in the market and their ability to maintain cash flow, I know I've had another question perhaps in the past, but do you feel more inclined to be a consolidator of B malls space at this point? Or is it still something that's far in the future?", "David E. Simon", "I don't think we will be other than we'll always look at what's there and if there's a strategic fit for us, we could do a few deals. That's not to say we run away from the product. It's just that we've got a lot to do within our mall portfolio as it exists, and unless there's a strategic view of that asset or something that do really -- something special with it, we probably wouldn't, and the fact of the matter is, what? We've grown in the mall business, frankly, through M&A. We'll never rule that out, and when you tend to do bigger deals, you tend to get -- despite what we all say in the mall business, we don't all have A properties. Nobody does. So you tend to -- if there was ever deals to be done or kind of on the broader, more portfolio basis, we'll tend to get some Bs in that area and that would be a natural way for us to have more exposure in that product, which is we're fine with, but to go out and look to grow that business on a one-off basis just doesn't excite us as much as taking what we have and making it better.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And just to emphasize David's point on not running away from it, if you look at our capital expenditures, we are actively renovating, redeveloping and adding anchors to a number of the properties that are perhaps lower productivity just because they're in smaller markets, but they're providing very stable cash flow and with renovations and anchor additions and opportunity to contribute to our comp NOI growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I have another question on the international plan. David, you did make a few comments on China, and I realized that's not an immediate priority, but one of your peers recently purchased a real estate consulting firm based in China. So I'm curious, you mentioned maybe building outlet centers here, but if you ever decide to re-enter China, do you see yourself maybe taking a similar path as this peer?", "David E. Simon", "You broke up on the last part.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Well, I'm just wondering. I mean, you mentioned maybe building out with centers in China, could we possibly see you buying a company already on the ground there instead?", "David E. Simon", "No. It would be our people. I mean, we would likely joint venture with an existing Chinese company, whether they own the land or whether they were in the development business or retailer much like we did when we built the Wal-Mart stores, but we would not buy a company to do that now.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just last question, you mentioned The Gap closing more stores than they had previously planned being no surprise to you, and since it sounds like they're basically not renewing upcoming leases and I assume you can look through their portfolio to figure out how many leases are expiring over the next few years, where they are located, good centers or bad, what's your expectation for store closures from The Gap and how many of the spaces there are spoken for today?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me just clarify what I did say. I mean, they're not closing all their stores. They're closing certain stores that they want to close, and we're taking over space that we want them to close, and we're trying to find a happy middle ground on the majority of the stores so -- but -- so that's the first point that I just want to clarify, but the -- and I will tell you that I don't think their acceleration of store closures is all that different than what they've done in the last couple of years. Now it may be marginally accelerated, but it's not all that different than what they have been doing, frankly, since '09, '10 and '11 and going into '12. So that's -- the second point is at the end of the day, when we look at everything there, we've got all the real estate back for whatever reason, they want to get out, we want them out, they decided not to do any U.S. fields, whatever the reason, at the end of the day, we think the income stream that would come from those spaces would be higher than it is today that they're paying.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Can you just remind us how many Gap branded stores are in your portfolio? And of that amount, what do you -- how many do you think are going to close based on this?", "David E. Simon", "Let me just say this. If you look at our schedule, we have 386 stores, if I'm right. Take away 138 of those because those are in the outlet business, so that gets you down to kind of the whole breadth, whole Gap fleet. So that's like 240, and then I would say roughly 50% is Gap, 25% is Old Navy, and then the balance is Banana, somewhere in that range.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So it sounds pretty modest overall?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's a big relationship, but we're certainly focused that we're going to replace as much of the real estate where we don't think they're paying market rent.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Most of questions have been answered, but I have just 2 very quick ones. Going into Christmas, I know you talked a little bit about just what you're seeing from your retailer perspective, but in regards to the typical temporary tenants that show up during Christmas, what are you seeing demand-wise from those guys to take up space?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Demand has been pretty stable. We are finding that happily, there are more and more national tenants that are also now looking to establish stores on a short-term basis as a way to seeing if there are customers located in that property, and so that demand is constant pretty much year-over-year, and we're very pleased with where we are today on that.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful, and then just in regards to the recent deals that you've done, Steve, I know you -- pricing-wise, you went talking about King of Prussia, but could you give any pricing details on Albuquerque?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Again, we don't do individual mall deals, but we're great stewards of capital. Both of these deals will -- are very accretive and they've got good rent growth in both of them.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just one more last question with the Davis Street [ph] asset, any reason why you were not involved in those deals? Is that something you were interested in, but you just didn't play, obviously, a part in that process just given that class A malls don't come up that often in the market?", "David E. Simon", "We just had no interest.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Any reason why you didn't have an interest?", "David E. Simon", "No interest.", "Operator", "We have no additional questions at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remark.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thank you. Listen, we're very pleased with the quarter, and we're very happy to be paying our shareholders $1.10 in cash this quarter, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for attending today's conference. This concludes your presentation.

Please be aware that statements made during this callthat are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actualresults may differ materially from those indicated by forward-lookingstatements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to ourfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussionof these risks and uncertainties. ", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast forsome time to come, we believe it is important to note that today\u2019s callincludes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019sdate, October 29, 2007. ", "The company\u2019s quarterly supplemental information package wasfiled earlier this morning as a Form 8-K. This filing is available via mail ore-mail and it is posted on the Simon website in the investor relations sectionunder financial information, quarterly supplemental packages. ", "Participating in today\u2019s call will be David Simon, Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief OperatingOfficer; and Stephen Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. Now I will turn thecall over to Mr. Simon. ", "David Simon", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will justtake a few moments at this time to provide comments on the results for thequarter and recent activities, and then we will open the call up for yourquestions. Third quarter diluted FFO was up 12.3% over the prior year to $1.46per share. Positive factors contributing to the quarter include strongportfolio operating metrics in all our domestic platforms, strong operatingresults from our European investments and our premium outlet centers in Japan,and the accretive impact of our acquisition of the Mills. ", "You should also note that our 12.3% FFO growth was achieveddespite the fact that our share of land sale gains was $7.8 million lower thanlast year at this time and our share of the provision for credit losses wasactually $5 million higher in the third quarter of \u201907 compared to the thirdquarter of \u201906. In addition, during the third quarter of \u201906, we recognized aone-time, $3.7 million gain related to the sale of our holding in a technologyventure by Chelsea. ", "Comparable sales were up 3.6% to $491 per square foot in ourdomestic regional mall portfolio. Sales increased 8% to $499 per square foot inour U.S. premium outlet center portfolio. Comparable regional NOI, mall NOI was5.6% up for the quarter, higher than both the first and second quarters of2007. This is primarily the result of strong operating results. ", "Comparable NOI growth for our premium outlet portfoliocontinues to be strong at 9.4% for the quarter and the nine months. Occupancyin the mall portfolio increased 20 basis points over the year earlier period to92.7%. Our premium outlet portfolio remains effectively fully occupied at99.6%. Releasing spreads remain very strong. The mall portfolio is $8.85 persquare foot, representing a 23% increase. Releasing spreads for the premiumoutlet portfolio was $7.53, representing a 31.8% increase and we are well intodealing with our 2008 expirations. ", "The general economic health of our tenants remains strongthrough the end of the quarter. We lost only 53,000 square feet ofoccupancy to bankruptcy for the first nine months of 2007 versus 612,000 square feet lostin the year earlier period. ", "We opened three new international centers during thequarter, Kobe-Sanda premium outlets in Japan on July 5th; Porta di Roma, thelargest shopping mall in Italy, opened in Rome on July 26th; and Ciniselloshopping center opened in Milan on September 27th. Construction continues onsix new U.S. projects, two community lifestyle centers, three premium outletcenters, and a 950,000 square foot open air regional center, as well as twoshopping centers in Italy and five in China. ", "On July 5th, we completed the sale of a portfolio of fivenon-core assets in Poland. Our share that we repatriated back to the U.S. fromthe sale exceeded $121 million. We would calculate an IRR for you for thetransaction, but since we had no equity in those centers, we can\u2019t come up witha number. I think this is a great example of the value we have created throughour international development activities. ", "I just want to make a note on the mall numbers, they don\u2019tinclude any impact from the Mills. So that\u2019s just strictly the mall portfoliowithout the Mills malls as well. ", "As we have grown our business, we have maintained theintegrity of our balance sheet, as evidenced by our A-minus A3 ratings, thehighest investment grade ratings among U.S. [retes]. ", "We believe it is critical to be positioned at all times to accesscapital in multiple forms. In these challenging credit markets, the strategycontinues to pay off, as evidenced by our ability to execute two significantcapital market transactions at favorable terms. ", "On August 22nd, we syndicated a senior loan facility for theMills Limited Partnership. The facility was initially closed for $925 millionin June of 2007 but due to strong demand, the facility was increased to $1.025billion, including a $50 million revolving credit facility. The facilityinterest rate is LIBOR plus 125. ", "And on October 4th, we implemented the $500 millionaccordion feature of our revolving corporate credit facility, increasingcapacity of our revolver at our credit facility up to $3.5 billion. The baserate on this facility is currently LIBOR plus 37.5 basis points. ", "As a result of our strong performance and confidence in ourbusiness strategy, today we announced that we expect to achieve at least thehigh-end of our previously updated guidance of $5.83 to $5.88 per share for2007 diluted FFO. I remind you that our original 2007 guidance issued back inJanuary was a range of $5.70 to $5.80 per share.", "With that said, we\u2019re now ready to open the call up forquestions, Operator, so we are pleased to begin the Q&A session. ", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  And your first question comes from the line ofJay Habermann of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Habermann -Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, everyone. I guess David or Rick here, can yougive us some thoughts just on Mills in terms of your leasing to date? And Iguess the strategy, especially as you head into the end of the year?", "David Simon", "I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve had some impact onMills. Not a huge impact, because we took it over, as you know, in the spring.So we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re going to have a significant impact in the future. ButI think the results of \u201907 from Mills ultimately will have marginal impact butnot a material impact, just given the nature of how long it takes to lease andopen up space. ", "I think we\u2019ve had a relatively big impact on charting thefuture strategy of a number of the centers and the redevelopment opportunities,outlining those, coming up with a game plan. But I would think that \u201908 reallyis going to be the year where we are going to see the impact that we\u2019ll have ona number of the assets. Some will take longer but it\u2019s safe to say that \u201907,we\u2019ve had marginal positive impact but not a lot. ", "Jonathan Habermann -Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and you mentioned I guess 53,000 square feet interms of bankruptcies year-to-date. Any sense of how you anticipate theupcoming holiday shopping season and implications for next year?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think in our last call, we threw a little bitcaution to the wind and we continue to throw a little bit of that. There\u2019s alot of economic uncertainty out there. We\u2019ll have to see. Our properties arewell-positioned. They are high quality, high quality tenants, but it would bena\u00efve for us to suggest that we won\u2019t have some -- there won\u2019t be some impactin terms of what\u2019s going on in the economy for us. ", "Now remember, percentage rents aren\u2019t a huge part of ourbusiness. They are a little bit higher at the Chelsea level because they have anumber of the anchors that do straight, percentage rent deals. But look, thereis caution to the wind economically. ", "We actually embrace these kinds of economic changes. That\u2019swhen we\u2019ve done some of our best work, so we\u2019ll just have to see how the nextfew months transpires. ", "Jonathan Habermann -Goldman Sachs", "Okay, last question for me; in terms of just expendituresinternationally, can you give us a sense of just how much you are thinkingabout spending over the next several years in terms of new developmentoverseas, whether it\u2019s Chinaor Europe?", "David Simon", "Very hard to quantify, other than what\u2019s in the hopperthat\u2019s laid out in our 8-K, primarily because China, we are going to build thefive and take kind of a step back and see how those are resulting. Japan andSouth Korea, just on the outlet side, I think we have a good handle that wethink over the next few years, we\u2019ll add more, two or three more to SouthKorea, perhaps two or three more to Japan, but that\u2019s still -- there\u2019s stillnothing imminent in terms of what\u2019s going to happen on the construction side. ", "And then in Europe, primarily through Simon Ivanhoe, we\u2019restill awaiting various approvals to construct some great high quality productbut the approval system in France is taking a little bit longer.

We\u2019ve gone through the budgets on those. I don\u2019tremember exactly where we budgeted for the malls that the Mills owned. But Ithink we\u2019ll bridge at least half the gap is my gut. ", "We also have a couple that are in the midst of majorredevelopments, so let\u2019s take Southdale as an example. We expect over \u201908 tocreate a major redevelopment vision for that property, so there may be someleasing that we won\u2019t be doing because we\u2019re in the process of coming up withthat plan. Del Amo is another example, might fall into that category. ", "So there are a couple there that may make it look a littlebit lower than really what it is, just because we are going through theredevelopment process. But I would think over the long haul, there is no reasonnot to anticipate that we would get it up to where we are. The centers do $450a foot on average, so we don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t get it up to thatlevel. ", "Christy McElroy -Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful.

Some of it in terms of our retailersattribute it to the warm weather, some of it may be the economic uncertaintythat exists in our country today. But so far, it\u2019s safe to say the vastmajority of our retailers have not changed their plans in terms of storeopenings for \u201908 and their view on their future performance.

Sokolov", "Frankly, we were just down in Domain, and when you walkthrough there, it is very vibrant. The addition of the residential componentand there will be a hotel component, an office component, provides a much morevibrant environment. The restaurants are all open at Domain and on a Wednesdaynight, were fully filled with people extending our shopping hours and to theextent that we can bring in these kinds of elements on a basis that makes senseeconomically and complete the environment that we are creating, it\u2019s somethingwe\u2019re continuing to look at and we have a number of others in the pipeline.

The focus on the international outlets, will thatremain in Asia or do you see any other opportunities for some premium outletbusinesses?", "David Simon", "Craig, I think long-term, I don\u2019t know what that meansanymore, but we would anticipate having at some point a presence in Europe. We stillare sorting through exactly how we are going to execute that but I think it\u2019san objective that we have. Obviously we are going to do it on a basis where wethink we can add value, and if we can\u2019t do that, we won\u2019t. But it\u2019s clearly anobjective that we have, is to have a premium outlet presence in Europe over thelonger term, medium term to longer term.

I would put that -- to get the right to build inEurope is a real headache. We\u2019re not even at that point where we can use thatas an excuse. We had that problem in Simon Ivanhoe. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019re going tomake some progress there. So we are not at that point where we can blame it onthe zoning. ", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a challenge, but we have a great presence inItaly that we think we can take advantage of with our premium outlet product. Ithink Central Europe is another example, as ultimately there being a time andplace for the outlet business. So I think it\u2019s a matter of time. We have toaddress it organizationally, but hopefully we\u2019ll be able to do that. ", "Craig Schmidt -Merrill Lynch", "Great.

Is the upside in Mills moreon the traditional mall side? And on the landmark assets, is it more on theoccupancy side or is there also some upside in rent?", "David Simon", "I\u2019ll let Rick answer too, but I would say I think the upsideis going to be across the board. It\u2019s going to be in development,redevelopment, boxes, marketing, the operational side, leasing, increasing theoccupancy, so I would view it across the board. ", "The portfolio is not perfect, as you know. The good news,the less perfect assets don\u2019t contribute a lot of material NOI to our venture,or FFO. But I would say the upside should be across the board in each and everyaspect of the business that we are in.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And I would just pick up on something David mentionedearlier; we have put together for the entire venture portfolio, both malls andMills, very detailed strategic and tactical things to be done at each of theseproperties. And one easy example at Esplanade in New Orleans, we\u2019ve beenoperating with a vacant Macy\u2019s. Well, Macy\u2019s has announced they are reopeningin the Fall of next year. We are adding several other anchors there and that isgoing to substantially reposition that asset and drive occupancy and rent. ", "Each of our groups have put together their plans forintegrating these properties into the programs we have already in Simon andthose things are ongoing. And we would expect and we have seen the beginningsof a contribution from all those efforts. ", "Jonathan Litt -Citigroup ", "And then on the management income side, it basically doubledfrom 2Q to 3Q. Should we think of 3Q as the run-rate or were there one-timeitems in 3Q?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "No, Ambika, you should think of 3Q as the run-rate. ", "Jonathan Litt -Citigroup ", "Okay, and then on the expense recovery rate, that alsoticked up as you previously had guided in the first half of the year, that itwas going to come up in the back half. Will it remain at this level for thefourth quarter and also into 2008?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I would expect it to remain at that level for the fourthquarter. As you know, as we talked about on the call last quarter, some of thevariability in the recovery ratio is because of the timing of key capital. Aswe get into \u201908, clearly within quarters, we could see some variability again.But I suspect as you look at the full year \u201907, we\u2019d expect \u201908 to be at leastcomparable on a full-year basis with where we ended \u201907. ", "Jonathan Litt -Citigroup ", "Okay, great. And my last question -- do you have anyguidance on gift card revenues in the fourth quarter, now that the timing ofrevenue recognition has changed?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, the timing hasn\u2019t changed relative to where we werelast year. The timing changed as a result of our change in the program, whichwas back in I think late \u201905, early \u201906. We expect the card sales to be updouble-digits this year. I think we did about $515 million last year and we\u2019llbe in the high 500s, maybe to as high as $600 million this year. So I thinkyou\u2019d see a corresponding increase in the revenue growth in that 10% to 15%range. ", "Jonathan Litt -Citigroup ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan ofFBR. Please proceed. ", "Paul Morgan - FriedmanBillings Ramsey", "Good morning. In terms of -- you\u2019ve been in the market,whether selling some of your non-core properties or with the Mills properties,and I\u2019m interested in what you are seeing since July, August, in terms of thenumber of bidders for B and C type properties and the spread between cap rateson those types of properties and at least what you think they might be for A\u2019sstill. ", "David Simon", "Let me go back to Craig\u2019s question a little bit. We have --I think it\u2019s safe to say on a quality project, the cap rates haven\u2019t moved inany material way, whether that\u2019s an enclosed mall or a community center oranything else. ", "And I think we are very close to selling two Mills malls, asyou know. Westfield disclosed the cap rates associated with those, which were-- I don\u2019t know, five-and-a-half or something, maybe a little less than that. ", "The ones that we sold just -- these aren\u2019t perfect cap ratesbut it will give you a sense. I mean, like Boardman Plaza we sold was -- youknow, it\u2019s not pretty real estate but I think we sold it around a seven caprate. University Mall, we were losing money and we sold it and Alton Square was-- it\u2019s been a tough project for a number of years but my guess is at around anine cap rate. Now, that\u2019s a very small mall, so it did like $1.8 million ofNOI or $1.4 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that range. ", "So that gives you a sense of -- you know, trades werehappening but I think it\u2019s safe to say that if it\u2019s quality asset like Westlandand Broward, they\u2019re quality assets. I think in the mall side, you\u2019re still atthe five to five-and-a-half cap rates. ", "Paul Morgan -Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Are you less likely to go for more of those nines, or justkeep them, or do you think this is actually sort of a return to what might be amore reasonable spread between A and C, and there\u2019s no reason to expect -- noreason to wait?", "David Simon", "Well, I think Alton Square, I hate to say it, was going tobe a nine today or a nine a year ago. We\u2019re one of the few companies thatadmits that sometimes we don\u2019t have perfect real estate, and I don\u2019t think thechange in the credit markets or anything else really affected the -- we\u2019ve beentrying to sell Alton for -- maybe this if the reverse think about it. We\u2019vebeen trying to sell Alton for two years and in the height of the real estatemarket, we couldn\u2019t get anybody to buy it. We finally found somebody that willbuy it. I hope they do well. I\u2019m sure they will. ", "So what does that tell you about cap rates? I don\u2019t know. ", "Paul Morgan -Friedman Billings Ramsey", "My other question was there\u2019s been a lot of talk over thepast couple of years with lifestyle developments in terms of some of thelenient leases for a lot of kick-outs, or co-tenancies, and some people havespeculated than when sales slow, you might see the ramifications of that andopportunity for -- to get retailers back into malls who might have left forthese projects, or to see a lifestyle center, a new one, completely unwind. ", "Do you think we\u2019ve gotten to the point where you might startto see that, or has it just not been a long enough period of soft sales?", "David Simon", "My gut is to tell you that the new stuff on the drawingboard, I don\u2019t have -- this is just my gut, but I would tell you that the newstuff on the drawing board I think is going to be very hard to execute. Andwithout naming names or retailers, but the four or five retailers that areinvolved in most every one of these, they are not like having really high comps-- in fact, [negative] comps, so the bargains they are going -- I mean, thedeals that they are going to drive to do those are going to be tougher andtougher in a very tough comp environment, and in some cases even in a negativecomp environment. I would think that construction lending will be a much higherstandard because there\u2019s not the immediate CMBS take-off for the constructionlender. ", "So I think the good news for us and other mall owners isthat the hypothetical let\u2019s get four tenants and give them a bunch of greatdeals and we\u2019ll do a lifestyle center are probably currently -- are probablygoing to go by the wayside, if I had to guess, just because I think it\u2019s goingto be very tough to execute. So I think that gives us some opportunities, maybethey\u2019ll partner with some people. ", "Some of the ones that have been built may come undone andmaybe you can buy those at a decent price. We haven\u2019t seen much of that yet butI think that\u2019s coming, so I think that world has changed significantly. ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only other thing I would add is that the biggestconstraint we have on adding those retailers to our properties is inventory, sowhen we are -- basically we took back all these Macy\u2019s stores and are knockingthem down and adding square footage expansions on our existing properties,every one of those retailers is saying let\u2019s come and in fact, they are openingnow and you can see that in the 8-K. We\u2019ve got four or five of those projectsopening over the next literally two months. We just opened an expansion of St.  John\u2019s that opened last Friday, so one, when we havethe inventory that\u2019s well-located, the retailers want to come into thoseprojects.

Please proceed.", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Good morning, guys. A question I guess for Rick and forSteve. Are you guys seeing a change in the pace or tenor of either financing orpending lease discussions around A and B properties? Can you break that down,if possible, I guess either by segment or geography?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "You mean, Jeff, is it taking longer to get leases done?", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Yeah, or conversely, or -- exactly. Are tenants showing morehesitancy?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "We have not seen, in the stable properties, the tenantdemand is consistent. Obviously in the best properties, we could addsubstantially more square footage and have more demand, but it is not aslacking of demand and the other in the B stable properties. ", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Steve, what about on the financing side? Are you seeingspreads widening much more aggressively there in the B assets?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, the C and B market, as you know, has been reallypretty much shut down for the last 60, 90 days. It\u2019s interesting because we areseeing more activity from the life companies now, which I think is just afunction of them having always been at the same pricing level and the marketkind of have come back to them,  if youwill. ", "I mean, there\u2019s no question that it is at wider spreads toget a refinancing done on a property. There is a little bit of differentiationin quality but I would say most of what we are seeing now is just a reaction tothe repricing of risk in general and less specific to differences in quality ofassets. ", "David Simon", "I think, Jeff, the issue for A and B is not spread -- it\u2019sloan to value. The days of having a big, huge, over-refinance, at leastcurrently, is probably tougher to come by, obviously dependent upon how muchdebt you have on the existing property. ", "But the big issue, whether it\u2019s A and/or B, is really loanto value right now. ", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "I guess maybe a follow-up question on -- ", "David Simon", "Jeff, but let me just finish. I mean, that is what puts usat a competitive advantage because we don\u2019t just rely on that market. ", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Okay. Rick, to follow up on one of your comments then, doyou expect maybe the timeframe for projects and design or planning could bepushed back as a result of less robust retail interest there at the margin?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We would certainly expect that some of the new projects thatare in various stages of pipeline are going to be delayed in their execution. ", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Particularly ones under construction today or just ones thatare more in the design stage?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Once you\u2019re under construction, the people have to deal withit. Frankly, we have been more conservative in our approach to new ground upstuff and happily, our pipeline is pretty much being delivered over the nextsix months and is substantially leased. But to the extent we were inconstruction today for a brand new ground up project, I think that that wouldbe a much more conservative approach to that underwriting than would have beenthe case a year ago. ", "David Simon", "Let me just give you -- maybe I could encapsulate ourstrategy, Jeff, if I could, to take the moment. We are full steam ahead on ourredevelopment pipeline, because as you know, it\u2019s very easy to underwrite. Youknow what you are trying to accomplish, you know what tenant demand is going tobe, and not only do you add value from the redevelopment but you add value fromthe existing asset. And that\u2019s a huge program. It\u2019s $3 billion to $4 billion.It will increase with the Mills, both the Mills and the malls from the Mills aswe sort through those opportunities out. ", "Nothing from our point of view has really changed as we lookout in the future. Our new development on Chelsea, same thing and we are --demand is great, returns are fantastic, and we are on an extreme mission tocontinue to find new Chelsea outlets, domestic as well as in Asia. Andhopefully one day in Europe. ", "From new development in the U.S. though, I do think it\u2019ssafe to say that all of the projects that we\u2019ve had --now, none of this ismaterial because the stuff that we were looking may have been in 10, nine, 10,11. We are making sure that that stuff that we want to do that can be executedand an appropriate return, some of which will change and some of which may bedeferred and/or dropped. ", "Jeff Donnelly -Wachovia Securities", "Well, if you guys are becoming more stringent, sayunderwriting future ground-up development, is it fair to say you\u2019re concerned,or are you concerned, maybe, that any of the domestic markets could beoversupplied, either due to sheer construction or just rooftops that arefailing to materialize out there?", "David Simon", "I think that is certainly part of it. You also have thegeneral economic malaise. You have high land prices, construction costs haven\u2019tcome down a little bit, so you need a little bit of -- if you are going to gointo a tougher economic environment, I think you want to see some flexibilityfrom land, pricing and construction costs. ", "Now look, the fact of the matter is we all think about thesethings as five, ten-year horizons, so that\u2019s not going to deter us completely.On the other hand, we have plenty to do and plenty of opportunities, so for usto chase any new development that we are going to have to work ouryou-know-whats off to whether that, we\u2019ll take our resources and plow them backinto our existing portfolio, plow them back internationally, plow them backwith Chelsea. I just think we are taking -- it\u2019s not so much the economy. Thiswas really brewing, but just make sure that the new stuff that we have reallyis going to meet future demand. ", "And you know, look, a lot of new stuff has been built -- notby us, thankfully -- but a lot of new stuff has been built and is still takinga long time to meet the demand.

Obviously you\u2019ve givenus more numbers here on the income statement.

Is that a misstatement on my part? Andif it\u2019s not, what\u2019s changed here to slow things down?", "David Simon", "I think it\u2019s a misstatement. We\u2019ve done a lot on theoperational side but I think it\u2019s -- the leasing side takes time, so I reallythink the response to the earlier question was what impact do you have onleasing and we\u2019ve done a tremendous amount on the operational side. Our viewhasn\u2019t changed at all, just trying to be realistic that it does take some timeto get the leasing repositioned in the appropriate way.

Sokolov", "And the only other thing I would add to the Chelseaproductivity is that as we have worked with the Chelsea leasing team and ourleasing team, there are now a number of incremental full price concepts throughour intercession and pitching that portfolio that are now looking to expandwithin the Chelsea portfolio and these are operators that are also going todrive sales at a higher percentage. ", "Michael Gorman -Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And just one last one, if I could, Steve, Iguess this would be for you; I noticed that the mezz loan to Mills picked upduring the quarter. Is that due to redevelopment spending or was there just --is that just normal fluctuations?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It was due to the cash component of the limited partners ofthe Mills. We cashed a number of them out. We also redeemed some of thepreferred stock of the Mills. ", "Michael Gorman -Credit Suisse", "Did they have an option to stay in the partnership, or no?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It was dependent upon the number of units in the Mills thatyou held to begin with. ", "Michael Gorman -Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of MichaelMueller of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Michael Mueller -J.P. Morgan", "I know you already talked about the tenant demand a littlebit, but do you worry at all about the industry as a whole, the ability tolease out the space that\u2019s slated to come online in \u201908 - \u201809 if times arestill tough? I mean, you just have, industry-wide, it looks like a lot moredevelopment and redevelopment going on than say five or six years ago. ", "David Simon", "I don\u2019t think from our standpoint we\u2019re concerned at all. Wehave a lot of work to do but we don\u2019t anticipate opening projects that aren\u2019tleased, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a relevant concern. ", "I do think you\u2019ve got to be careful about pushing newdevelopment. A couple of years ago, maybe a new development where it was easierto push today, but the stuff that we\u2019re building, we don\u2019t anticipate havingany lease-up issues. ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And on the redevelopments that are opening in \u201908, they areleased. In fact, Burlington, Nordstrom is opening next March. We\u2019re openingsome small shops yet this quarter because the small shops are ready to open andthe space is available for them, so that really is not an issue. ", "Michael Mueller -J.P. Morgan", "And you mentioned the impact on Mills leasing; has most ofthat to date been on the landmark side or on the traditional mall side?", "David Simon", "Well, the impact for us has been relatively the same. Wekept a lot of the existing landmark people together so that the downtimeassociated with that was not as great. Whereas the malls, we basically had toput a new team together that we did here in Indianapolis, and that has had alittle bit more of a transitional nature to it. But again -- and it\u2019s easier. Imean, you have to remember, as you know, if you walk a Mills, it\u2019s easier toget a tenant in there because the build-out is not like a mall build-out. Soyou can make a deal in April and get them open in October, where in the mall,you can do that but you have to, depending on the mall, it\u2019s going to be alittle bit tougher to get done. ", "Michael Mueller -J.P. Morgan", "And last question, I know it\u2019s not exactly apples-to-apples,but the leasing spreads on your malls, up over 20%, outlets about 30%. When youlook at the landmark Mills, can you give us any color as to where the spreadsare there?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Mike, I think it\u2019s really too soon to say. I mean, one ofthe -- you\u2019ll notice in the 8-K, we didn\u2019t provide you any historicalinformation and there\u2019s a reason for that and that\u2019s our lack of comfort withthe integrity of that historical information. ", "I mean I\u2019d suffice it to say, there\u2019s leasing activity goingon. We think we\u2019re getting market rents. We think we can both grow theoccupancy and the rent at both the legacy Mills portfolio but also their mallportfolio. But I think it will be another quarter or two before we\u2019ll be in aposition to give you much color on what the leasing spreads are, just becausewe need to get that data in our system and make sure we are comparing a goodapple to a good apple. ", "Michael Mueller -J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Louis Taylorof Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Louis Taylor -Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning. David, could you talk a little bitabout the tourism impact and especially if you can talk -- ", "David Simon", "Lou? Hello? Lou, we lost you. Lou?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Operator?", "ShellyDoran", "Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, I\u2019m here. ", "ShellyDoran", "Did we just lose him?", "Operator", "Yes, one moment. Your line is open, sir. ", "Louis Taylor -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, sorry. David, could you talk a little bit more abouttourism and especially the impact on Florida? I mean, is it offsetting some ofthe weakness that may be occurring due to the weaker residential market there?", "David Simon", "Well, I think it\u2019s -- put Chelsea aside, for the mallbusiness, yeah, we are seeing a sales -- the tourist malls that we have, and wehave a number of them, like Florida Mall, Miami International, Boca, et cetera,are still doing great in sale increases. I think the malls that are cateringmore to the particular marketplaces are relatively flat, and so I think we areseeing a little bit of a bifurcation between the tourist centers there than youare a traditional enclosed mall that basically caters to the marketplace.", "Louis Taylor -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and second question, could you talk a little bit aboutyour expanded credit line? Given your just vast financial resources anyway,what kind of opportunities do you see out there that would necessitate thelarger line?", "David Simon", "Well, you know, we did this initially -- we always had theaccordion feature. I think, as we all know, August was a volatile month. Wedecided we wanted to be aggressive in this kind of marketplace with respect toallocating capital. We continue to have that view of the world and so wethought it was best to go ahead and implement that. It\u2019s not so much for anyliquidity issue here at the company but really just so we can be ready and ableto take advantage of whatever else is out there. ", "I mean, if you look at some of the best deals that we\u2019vedone, we have always been -- it has always been a little bit contrarian. Wewere contrarian with Chelsea, to some extent. We were contrarian with [Rodanko]after 9/11 to some extent. We were ahead of our time at CPI and I\u2019ll let Rickdecide how he wants to classify [inaudible]. ", "So that\u2019s what we\u2019re about, so we just figured it\u2019s there,we don\u2019t have to really pay much for it, and it\u2019s always nice to have that kindof corporate flexibility. ", "Louis Taylor -Deutsche Bank", "Could you just give us a little bit of color? I mean, areyou seeing opportunities to either buy debt, buy assets, buy land? I mean, isanything percolating to the surface in any of those categories that isparticularly interesting?", "David Simon", "I tell you, not yet, to be overly simplistic on it. But Ithink it\u2019s coming. ", "Louis Taylor -Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time. I would liketo turn the presentation back over to Mr. Simon. Please proceed, sir. ", "David Simon", "Okay. Thanks for everybody\u2019s interest. We\u2019re proud of thequarter and I think our business is well-positioned to prosper going forward.Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Shelly Doran", "Good morning and welcome to the Simon Property Group's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.

", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that today\u2019s call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date, February 1, 2008.

This filing is available via e-mail or mail and it is posted on Simon website in the investor relations section under financial information, quarterly supplemental packages. ", "Participating in today\u2019s call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard S. Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Stephen Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Simon. ", "David Simon", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Let me take a few minutes just to provide some comments on the quarter and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. We are very pleased to report FFO for the fourth quarter of $1.76 per share, up 12.1% over the prior year. You should note that our 12.1% growth in FFO was achieved despite the fourth quarter impairment charge of $0.12 per share, net of applicable tax benefit of about $19.5 million resulting in our tax benefit of $12.2 million. We had a tax expense of approximately $6.5 million, so we netted those two, related to the write-off of our equity investment in an Arizona land joint venture. ", "Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, diluted FFO per share increased 19.7% for the quarter to $1.88 per share. ", "Positive factors contributing in the quarter include strong operating results for our regional mall and premium outlet platforms, positive net tenant recoveries were related to our continued conversion to a fixed CAM program with effective cost control and lower cost related to our captive insurance program, continued integration of and positive impact from the Mills acquisition, including our benefit from managing the portfolio. ", "We did experience a slowing of retail sales in the fourth quarter in our regional mall portfolio. Comparable sales were $491 per square foot, up 3.2% for the year but flat in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 7% for the year to $504 per square foot in our U.S. premium outlet centre portfolio and fourth quarter sales were up 5%. ", "Comparable regional mall NOI growth was 6.3% for the quarter, 4.5% for the year. Comparable NOI growth for the outlet portfolio continues to be very strong at 11.1% for the quarter and 9.8% for the year. Occupancy increased 30 basis points in both the premium outlet portfolio and the mall portfolio. ", "Releasing spreads for our mall portfolio contracted somewhat during the fourth quarter as a result of opening of several big box and large restaurant tenants, in particular at our lifestyle expansions. For the year, spreads in the mall portfolio were $5.64, or 14.4%, which is somewhat lower than our historical average but if you take out the openings related to our lifestyle expansion, the releasing spread for the mall portfolio for the year would have been $7 and 21%, or 18%, which is obviously slightly above our historical norm. ", "Releasing spreads for our premium outlet portfolio were $7.79 for the year, representing a 33% increase. Excluding embedded renewal options in some of our older leases, the premium outlet portfolio releasing spreads were over 40%. ", "Gift card sales in 2007 were relatively flat over 2006 at $516 million. We attribute that really to the proliferation of retailer gift cards throughout the nation. Based upon the results of \u201907 and our outlook for \u201908, in addition our board of directors yesterday increased our common stock dividend for the quarter of 7.1% from $0.84 to $0.90 for this quarter. ", "Let me turn just briefly to talk about capital markets. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the real estate industry, as evidenced by our A-minus, A3 ratings. We built our balance sheet so that we would be positioned at all times to access capital in multiple forms and I believe we are well-positioned to weather the continuing challenging capital market and credit market. ", "Given the state of the capital markets, let me just walk through, just for your benefit, what our 2008 plan is. We only have $350 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2008. Our share of secured debt maturing in 2008 totals $1.7 billion, although almost $700 million of that total will be extended through pre-existing extension options. ", "We also have a development, re-development pipeline that is not otherwise funded by construction debt of approximately $800 million in 2008 and in total, when you add the unsecured maturing, our share of the mortgage debt and our pipeline that\u2019s not funded by construction debt, that\u2019s about $2.2 billion. We anticipate funding this but I underline -- but we are not limited to this. But here are the following sources that we have available to us.", "First, $1 billion of secured debt maturing as an aggregate loan to value of less than 40%. The underlying assets generate sales per square foot of $555 per square foot. We expect to generate total proceeds of $1.5 billion, or $500 million of excess proceeds from the refinance of these high quality, low levered assets. We don\u2019t expect any issue with that. ", "We currently have $1.1 billion available in our revolving corporate credit facility. We have over $500 million of cash in the bank at year-end, and we will generate over $400 million of free cash flow in 2008. Therefore, when you add it all up, we are not -- obviously we are very comfortable with how we are going to fund our business plan for \u201908. ", "Finally, in \u201907 we had a very good year for our company. We generated very strong FFO growth, continued to successfully execute our development and redevelopment pipeline in the U.S. and abroad. We completed a strategic acquisition, again very financially profitable with Mills. We fully integrated that portfolio and are now working to grow the cash flow of those assets. ", "And while 2008 promises to be a challenging period because of the macroeconomic environment, we believe we are poised for success. Demand for space for our retailers continues to be solid. We will expect to get more space back than in recent years. However, much of that space comes from healthy retailers abandoning certain concepts and obviously they are going to have to negotiate with us to exit their corporate guaranteed leases. ", "We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Our development and redevelopment pipeline will continue to create value for us and we will also look for opportunities in this type of environment when they arise. And we also expect to continue to create value from the Mills portfolio as we work through the development and redevelopment pipeline associated with that. ", "Based upon these factors, the results of our internal budgeting and planning process, and our view of current market conditions, we\u2019ve provided 2008 FFO guidance of $6.25 to $6.45 per share, representing per share growth of 6% to 9% for the 2008 time period. ", "With this said, this concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re more than happy to open it up for questions, so Operator, we can begin the Q&A session. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Paul Morgan, Freidman Billings Ramsey.", "Paul Morgan - Freidman Billings Ramsey", "On the expense recovery rate, it continues to be high and you mentioned that contributing to the upside and it came up last quarter, but as I look into \u201908, what should we expect the full year recovery rate to be versus the full year for \u201907?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I think you have two things that really contributed to the improvement in the recovery ratio in the quarter. One, which is ongoing, is just our conversion to fixed CAM. We are north of 60% now. We\u2019ll be north of 70% by the end of \u201908, and so that improvement I would expect to continue. ", "There was also an improvement in the quarter which is related really to a bit of a catch-up, and that\u2019s in our insurance program. We had lower insurance expenses in the quarter, which improved the profitability in the recovery. ", "There is an element of that that I do expect to continue on an ongoing basis but a part of it was clearly a bit of a catch-up for activity that occurred throughout the year. So when I think you look at it on an annual basis, I think we are comfortable in telling you that the recovery, the profitability in recovery is there. We probably got a little bit of an outsized performance in Q4 that in retrospect, some of it could have been pushed back into the [first few quarters]. ", "David Simon", "I\u2019ll just add that as we said historically, and I think we were one of the first companies to anticipate the fact that the macroeconomic and retail environment was going to slow, we have been very focused on our operating expenses. So we have a pretty good plan for \u201908. Obviously we have to execute it but we have a pretty good plan for \u201908 to drive down our operating expenses, so we are enthusiastic about that opportunity. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "And because over the course of the year, two-thirds of our leases will be fixed CAM, two-thirds of that benefit would inure to our bottom line. ", "Paul Morgan - Freidman Billings Ramsey", "David, last recession you guys dialed down development pretty meaningfully and given your outlook for sales and the overall environment, and you have a bunch already under construction but if you think about your starts over the next 12 to 24 months, are there any moving pieces that you might push out?", "David Simon", "Well, the biggest focus we\u2019ve had is on redevelopment and I will tell you that that really has not changed. I mean, we are obviously very focused in terms of reaffirming the profit potential from the redevelopment, given the current environment. ", "Now, on the new development side, we have pushed a couple of the potential deals -- like we have a site in west Houston, we think that\u2019s delayed a year or so. I wouldn\u2019t attribute that to the economic environment. I just think retail demand is not quite there yet. ", "But no real change in Chelsea at all. I mean, I think there\u2019s real demand there. We\u2019re very excited about opening in Houston, New Jersey. We\u2019re very excited about getting the right to build in New Hampshire. They\u2019ve got a couple of other sites that were doing it, so I would say no change in redevelopment, no change in new development on Chelsea and on the mall side, we\u2019ve pushed a couple of deals back but I wouldn\u2019t attribute that too much to the economic environment. More just feeling that the retail demand was not quite there. ", "Paul Morgan - Freidman Billings Ramsey", "Okay, and a last question for Rick -- in terms of the composition of the store closings that have been announced over the past quarter or so, is there any color you could provide about the mix between top tier properties versus lifestyle centers versus B malls?", "David Simon", "Let me answer that, if I could. The closings that have been announced, we are always going to have some closings every year but the biggest closings that have been announced have been more concept oriented closings, so just take an example -- Jasmine Sola from New York and Company -- we have five stores. They are going to close it. Now, they\u2019re in good centers. In fact, I think all five are in our New England are because that\u2019s where they wanted to start, and that\u2019s really a concept change. I mean you had the -- one of the problems we had, I still don\u2019t know how to pronounce it, Pavia, Pivia, The Finish line concept. ", "Again, those are in good centers but that\u2019s women\u2019s oriented, Talbot\u2019s Kids and -- so right now, the biggest potential closings are associated with the concept closing as opposed to closings associated with A, B, or C malls. That\u2019s what we are seeing the most of. Sigurd Olsen with Liz Claiborne, and you know, you have chains going out of business like Bombay. I\u2019d say that\u2019s across the board but most of the new closings that you\u2019ve seen year-to-date have been associated with that kind of activity. ", "We\u2019ll still see a Foot Locker shedding a few stores, KB\u2019s shedding a few stores. Ann Taylor\u2019s announced shedding a few stores but you know, that\u2019s by and large happening year-in and year-out, and that can happen basically across the board, A, B, or C properties. ", "Paul Morgan - Freidman Billings Ramsey", "Do you think on a net basis, you might not lose as much space if the retailers are maybe trying to put a different concept in that location?", "David Simon", "Well, my guess is we\u2019ll end up making a deal to get them out of the space, releasing it so we may have a down time but obviously we are going to be very focused on getting the appropriate value for letting them out of the lease. ", "Paul Morgan - Freidman Billings Ramsey", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Banc of America Securities.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities ", "Good morning. David, when you outlined your funding options, I don\u2019t believe you mentioned potentially accessing the unsecured market. Do you see this as another option or is the pricing there too high? And can you give us a sense for what the pricing would potentially be?", "David Simon", "You know, the market is not -- I mean, the market is there for us if we wanted it but the pricing is too high and we have no real need to go to that market. ", "I will say that obviously we have the liquidity to deal with our \u201908 plan and there\u2019s all sorts of other ways we could finance the business beyond what I just described, but we are not -- there is just no motivation for us to go to that market, as choppy and as expensive as it is. And there is no reason for us to do that. ", "Now, at some point it might calm down but if it doesn\u2019t -- we\u2019re assuming it does not calm down, so that -- and where it would be, I mean, it would be very wide of where we did our last big deal. ", "Now, our credit default swaps, I don\u2019t know if this is damning with feint praise, but this is what Steven and our treasurer tell me all the time. We are kind of the lowest credit default swaps in the industry and much lower than a number of big, well-known companies but I think it\u2019s damning with feint praise at this point. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I think they are certainly much wider of where they were a year ago at this time. ", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities ", "Okay, and then who are the likely types of lenders for the refinancing of the $1 billion of secured debt that you have coming do, whether it\u2019s life insurance companies or banks?", "David Simon", "Well, I think you\u2019ll have that. I think you\u2019ll also have this -- I mean, I think you\u2019ll have the secured market as well. The CMBS market I think is still available for good quality stuff. I mean, the mall product really hasn\u2019t experienced any kind of hiccup. I mean, obviously spreads are a little wider but there is still demand out there for some financing on that level. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Right, and the life companies historically have always valued the mall product very highly because of its stability, so I would expect them to be much more in the mix than they\u2019ve been over the last three to five years. ", "David Simon", "And the bank market for credits like us, companies like us, the bank market, to the extent that window is not there, to the extent the insurance window is not there, I don\u2019t expect that but again, with that market -- the bank market is very strong for a company like us. So we can access basically whenever we need it, if we need it. ", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities ", "Okay, great and then just lastly, following up on the question before about the store closing announcements, what level of lease termination income are you currently assuming in your \u201908 guidance? And then I think you are forecasting roughly flat to down occupancy at year-end, but can you give us a sense for what that should look like throughout the year?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Our historical run-rate over the last three to four years has kind of been in the $15 million to $20 million a year range, and actually if you look at I think \u201906, that\u2019s about where we were. In \u201907, that\u2019s where we were absent of the two or three large department store termination that we did. And that\u2019s kind of consistent with our plan for \u201908. If it exceeds that, you\u2019ll typically have an offset up in your minimum rent line somewhere so the two tend to net out. ", "David Simon", "But at this point it\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve historically budgeted. ", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities ", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Litt with Citigroup.", "Jonathan Litt - Citigroup ", "I\u2019m here with [Ambica]. Just sort of curious -- there\u2019s obviously been a lot of press about what\u2019s going on in the debt markets and discussions about the impact that\u2019s going to have on the pricing of real estate. What\u2019s your sense of what\u2019s happening in your space? Any large assets that you are seeing on the market?", "David Simon", "Well, you know, the big A quality malls are -- there just hasn\u2019t been any transactions. The last couple have been frankly what we sold to Westfield and what I guess Macerich bought recently. And my personal view is that on that kind of quality asset, if cap rates have moved, they haven\u2019t moved all that much. You know, where the lack of really understanding value is probably on the lower quality product where a lot of that was bought by entrepreneurs with cheap debt. And again, that market is pretty much shut down for the time being so there\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to figure out where those cap rates are but it\u2019s safe to say they probably moved up. ", "Jonathan Litt - Citigroup ", "So what would you peg -- if transactions came to market in the class A space, do you think that\u2019s in the five?", "David Simon", "Yeah, no question about it. ", "Jonathan Litt - Citigroup ", "And retention funds would probably do it with relatively low debt at those levels, or you guys?", "David Simon", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. ", "Jonathan Litt - Citigroup ", "I think [Ambica] has a question as well. Thank you. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "If we\u2019re thinking about the same-store NOI guidance for the malls, you mentioned that Simon is really focusing on driving operating leverage. If we think about the guidance, what percentage -- is it half of the growth is really going to be driven by driving operating leverage? And then, could you list the specific items that you are focused on to reduce operating expenses?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Let me talk a little bit about the guidance. We are beholden to some degree to our lease exploration schedule. We ordinarily have 7%, 8%, 9% of our leases rolling a year. We have not seen any diminution in pricing power so we would expect our leasing spreads, as we\u2019ve noted in the guidance, to be in the historical range. ", "If you got 10% of your leases rolling and you are re-leasing them at up 20%, inherently that\u2019s 2% comp NOI growth and then the rest of it comes from either better recoveries or growth in ancillary revenues or, as David mentioned, we may get more of a bump in \u201908 from driving down the operating costs. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then could you give more color on what specifically you are focused on the operating cost side?", "David Simon", "I would say we have -- we are reviewing a number of our vendor relationships. We are also looking at how to take advantage of economies of scale in the field level with personnel. We\u2019ve got -- obviously we are very focused on increasing energy efficiency for a number of reasons, one of which obviously, as we think it\u2019s the right corporate thing to do in terms of trying to give back to the environment, but also because it makes good, sound business sense in terms of driving our operating expenses. ", "I mean, those are a few that jump out at me. We are using our kinds of scale in purchasing but we\u2019ve grown a lot. We\u2019ve been very income oriented, which is appropriate when you have a very strong economic environment. We are in a less strong economic environment and so it\u2019s always good every few years to take a step back and figure out how we become more efficient and more expense controlled. ", "You know, those are -- I could sit here and tell you a few that come off the top of my head. Now, when we budget, we do it by lease, by mall, by asset, so we\u2019d have to spend some time to say this effort would get you 20 basis points or not. But basically when we roll it all up, you know, even in a tough environment, we think we could grow 3% to 4% comp NOI. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great, and then just one last question -- do you have an update on GAP and Limited and their strategy? Should we expect any store closures or a reduction in the size of their stores?", "David Simon", "Well, let me say Limited, just essentially Vicki\u2019s and Bath & Body at this point, they\u2019re actually growing, at least at Vicki\u2019s, they are trying to grow their store size and -- so there\u2019s no real change there. And on an express, it\u2019s spun out now on its own. Their actual results have been pretty good and I think they are -- it\u2019s interesting now that it\u2019s out of Limited. We are very excited about the prospects of that company going forward. ", "On The GAP, it\u2019s early. We haven\u2019t -- I personally have not met with the new CEO. I think that\u2019s obviously one of my goals here in the next few months, to get a better handle on the real estate. We are pretty well set on a real estate strategy for them through \u201908 and I think we\u2019ll be working on \u201909 here shortly. But not a material change in the \u201908 GAP plan for us. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. A lot of questions on store closings but I\u2019m just curious -- as you look out 2009, 2010, is it too soon to have a sense of the new store openings, or do we really have to wait until ICSC? What sort of early read are you seeing at this point in terms of tenants that are pulling back in terms of new store openings?", "David Simon", "Well, Rick can answer this as well. I\u2019ll just say that most of the feeling that we get is a little bit of a hunkering down but not a -- most of the retailers that we talk to are pretty bullish on their business, are pretty well capitalized. They understand that we are going through an economic cycle here. They are hunkering down for \u201908. It hasn\u2019t changed their long-term view on what they are able to do in \u201909 and \u201910. ", "So assuming we get back with some more economic growth in \u201909 and \u201910, I think we\u2019ll get back to the store openings that we\u2019ve had historically, but that\u2019s more of a gut feel as opposed to specific data at this point. ", "But most of the retailers we are talking to understand these cycles happen and are pretty well capitalized and are just being extra cautious for \u201908. Rick, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything. ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing that I would add to that is there are several retailers that really look at this as an opportunity. They are hoping that there will be a little increase in supply and they are approaching us now opportunistically saying I still have open to buys for \u201908, if you\u2019ve got several spaces that open up, I want them. And there are a number of examples like that that we are working with that are going counter to that trend. ", "David Simon", "That\u2019s a good point. A great example of that is like a J. Crew that\u2019s -- I mean, they\u2019ve called and said I want to know who\u2019s on the ropes, I want to look at the space. Abercrombie is in that spot, so I think that\u2019s a very good point. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And it sounds like it\u2019s not going to come so much from bankruptcies -- is it more of a case of just tenants not renewing, so your renewal percentage drops this year?", "David Simon", "I think the biggest closings are going to be concepts where the tenant no longer wants to operate them. And for us right now, it\u2019s like a demo with Pac Sunwear and the rest are kind of not a big -- the only real bankruptcy liquidation that we are dealing with thus far in a material way is Bombay, where we have 35 stores. ", "But you know, Talbot\u2019s Kids & Mens is closing. That\u2019s seven stores. They\u2019re going to be in good malls. That\u2019s not a big issue, so most of it is really just concepts not working quite the way they wanted to and going from there. ", "The KB Toys, the Transworld Radio Shack, they\u2019ve been over a two- or three-year period kind of weaning down their portfolio and we\u2019ll always have a few of those. But I don\u2019t sense a huge change from historical closures on that. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "If you look at our top 50 or 100 tenant relationships, the risk of bankruptcy of any of those is quite frankly not very high right now. I mean, they are still in pretty good financial shape. I think we will always have some of the smaller tenants, just by the nature of the beast. But as we look out, I think bankruptcies will be relatively modest in \u201908. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and just on Mills, turning to that, could you provide -- is there any additional upside you are expecting in terms of occupancy from the value centers? And I guess as well, can you provide cap rates on the assets sold?", "David Simon", "Well, the two that we sold to Westfield were about a five cap rate, and that\u2019s -- so that\u2019s that. There are -- we feel very good -- we think we\u2019ll have about 5%-plus in the Mills EBITDA this year and primarily, that\u2019s a handful of better running of the portfolio, more efficiency, more lease-up, you know, bringing outlet tenants there with, given our relationships with those tenants through Chelsea. So it\u2019s really across the board and better in terms of better performance. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I\u2019d also say there\u2019s a significant opportunity to improve the occupancy in the regional malls side of the Mills. You know, those malls are $450 a foot malls. They kind of look and feel like ours but they are 400 basis points lower occupied than our overall portfolio is, so that will be clearly a point of focus in \u201908. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Ostrower from Morgan Stanley.", "Matthew Ostrower - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. I know in the past you guys would look at the B mall thing and didn\u2019t pick it up in terms of adding to your portfolio, but from your comments and looking at the public markets and for everything on the private markets, it sounds like the only -- looking at it today, which could change, it seems like the only really obvious place where you might be able to put some opportunistic money out is in the B and C mall arena. And I guess I\u2019m just wondering, based on how things keep evolving here, is there sort of a price that makes sense for you? Are you waiting for a price or have you really made a strategic decision here that those operations are too challenging and the fundamentals may be too challenging, so you are just not interested in that?", "David Simon", "No, I mean, we never get -- I never get too worried about B -- classifying malls, I frankly hate to classify malls A, B, or C. To me, it\u2019s whether we can increase the cash flow and obviously what kind of return we would get based upon the price. ", "I don\u2019t think our strategy is going to change in terms of what we\u2019ve done over the last several years, in terms of we want quality real estate. Now, if we think we can pick up a mall that people might think a B or C, but we think we can redevelop it and make it better real estate, and we can justify it on a risk-adjusted basis, we\u2019ll do it. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us chase not such good real estate just to create short-term accretion. I think our strategy has been pretty consistent. We\u2019ve flirted with the idea but we felt at the end of the day we were going to chase not such great real estate and we didn\u2019t really want to do that. ", "Mills we felt, you know -- hey, look, they have had some real estate that wasn\u2019t great but we felt by and large, this was pretty good real estate in pretty good major markets and that\u2019s why we chased that deal. ", "I\u2019m rambling but the bottom line is I don\u2019t think our strategy will change given the environment today. ", "Matthew Ostrower - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then just on Mills, if I read it right, it looked like the average rent on the traditional Mills assets came down a little bit in the quarter. Did you comment on that already?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Nothing remarkable there, Matt. That may be as much as anything, just a mix in terms of the space leasing, you know, because that includes boxes the size of the -- the lease activity could move it. Quite frankly, it could also be just us continuing to refine the data. I mean, as you might imagine, we took our first stab at the end of the third quarter. I would tell you we are 99.44% pure but give us a little wiggle room there. There\u2019s nothing remarkable going on in that portfolio. ", "David Simon", "You might -- I mean, I would just say you might have, since you have 17, you may have a little more volatility in those numbers quarter by quarter, just because as Steve said, you do have boxes in there that are included in those numbers and if you sign two or three boxes in one quarter versus the next, you\u2019re going to get some volatility. ", "Matthew Ostrower - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and finally just on the impairment charge, did that all flow through the way that you guys had projected in the press release that you put out?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It did, pretty much. I think the press release, Matt, we said it was $0.11 a share. It ended up rounding up to $0.12, but it was a $55 million gross charge and then in our tax line in the P&L, there\u2019s a $20 million benefit against that charge, so the net\u2019s 35 on an SPG LP basis. ", "David Simon", "And you only see the benefit on the tax line of 12-something because we have a tax expense. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yeah, we do have a tax expense on --", "Matthew Ostrower - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Louis Taylor with Deutsche Bank.", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Can you guys just talk a little bit about your development, or redevelopment starts in \u201908 and what do you expect for volumes and give us a sense for -- in terms of mix, in terms of international/domestic, outlet center versus a redevelopment within the core mall portfolio?", "David Simon", "If I can turn to a page here, you may hear some rough numbers. Give me one second, unless Rick, you have it handy. ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The ones that are under construction for delivery in \u201908 are going to be Hamilton Town Center in Noblesville, Houston Premium Outlets in Houston, , and Pure Park in Panama City. Those are the new developments that are coming online in \u201908 and all those are in the 8-K. ", "David Simon", "Let me do it this way, if I could -- we have our share -- again, this is our share -- of about $1.37 billion and so it is pretty specific here, but just to give you a sense, the regional malls are 611 -- we do it by platform and this does not include international, so -- but we do it by platform, so let me just walk you through it, if you\u2019re interested. ", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "David, I was actually looking for the new activity for \u201908 in terms of the additions to the pipeline in \u201908. Should we --", "David Simon", "Yeah, well, it\u2019s pretty -- I mean, the pipeline is pretty much what we thought it was going to be, so it\u2019s $1.37 billion domestic. Of the new starts, again this doesn\u2019t include -- this kind of goes over periods of time but we have $300 million in the premium outlet business new; in the mall business, about $100 million new; and the lifestyle centers, about 70 new. The balance of that is basically redevelopment in the mall portfolio, a little bit of capital dedicated to the Mills portfolio, and then we do have some asset intensification of about $50 million in terms of residential and hotel.", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "So this would be new activity to begin construction in \u201908? ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "No, that\u2019s the total spend of everything, some of which will obviously start in \u201908 but some of which has been under construction and that\u2019s the \u201908 spend. ", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I\u2019m not looking for the spend. I\u2019m looking for what new projects do you expect to add to the list this year, so -- ", "David Simon", "It\u2019s really in our 8-K. I mean, the best way to do that is go through the 8-K. The ones we may add that are not in there are Chelsea\u2019s got two or three deals that are close to getting board approval and close to getting permitting approval. ", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, now, beyond the outlet center expansions that you\u2019ve listed in the 8-K, are there many more opportunities within the outlet center portfolio to expand existing centers, say two to three years down the road?", "David Simon", "Yes. Rick, do you want to add to that?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We are, just as we\u2019ve created a number of expansions that really were not on the Chelsea radar screen before we started really focusing on how we can maximize returns, and out of -- from our start, we\u2019ve expanded Orlando, we\u2019ve expanded Las Vegas, and we are expanding [Camareo] and we are working now on looking at at least three other expansions and, as we\u2019ve pointed out previously, even it the Chelsea new product, we are now building in much larger pieces of land and master planning expansions. So literally right now, Rio Grande is already expanding, and it is open a year. Philadelphia Premium Outlets was opened in November and it has its phase two expansion opening in March and we\u2019ve got additional expansions built into Houston, another expansion for Rio Grande, that are also building off of just the new product that\u2019s coming online. ", "So there\u2019s going to be considerable activity in that portfolio adding space. ", "David Simon", "Let me also just see if I can round up the conversation here; you know, when we announced our $5 billion development or redevelopment pipeline, when we did that, we probably spent -- you know, by the end of \u201908, we will have spent probably $2.5 billion of that. And we\u2019re -- some of it on the, is kind of pushed out, like a site in Houston, we had a site in North Atlanta that we don\u2019t think is ready. You know, we pushed a few deals out. I will tell you that Chelsea opportunities have probably increased so the balance of that $5 billion is still pretty good and we are more than halfway through that. But we still anticipate kind of the $1 billion a year. Again, it ebbs and flows but about $1 billion a year and I\u2019d say we\u2019re well over half of that done. ", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Okay, then, one just small follow-up question for Steve with regard to the expense recoveries. Was there much in the way of capital recovery in \u201907?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "There was, yeah. And you know, capital is a little bit of a wasting asset as you convert to fixed CAM. Now, some of that was not actual capital spending but it was capital that had been hung up on our balance sheet as deferred and we were able to accelerate the recovery of that, while we are still fairly substantially pro rata. So not a meaningful number and [a little bit of it]. ", "Louis Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector with UBS. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Good morning. In terms of 4Q sales, can you discuss how the different regions performed and maybe the different retail categories as well?", "David Simon", "For fourth quarter? Is that -- I didn\u2019t hear your first part. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Please, yes, fourth quarter. ", "David Simon", "Well, it\u2019s interesting. I think generally, as we reported it was flat, so it\u2019s pretty consistent with Midwest, which is relatively flat. We did see some softness in Florida and California, more than what we would have thought, ex whatever assets are that cater to the international tourist. And I guess that\u2019s really the color. I mean, Florida, if we had a regional mall in Florida that caters to the general marketplace, not the tourist, it was either flat or maybe even down a tick or two. ", "Orange County was pretty soft. Midwest has been flat. I think the Midwest has been flat for I don\u2019t know how many years, other than Indianapolis seems to be the best of the Midwest. ", "But generally, the thing about our numbers, our averages mean something because we have such a vast portfolio. I would say generally flat now and with respect to the specific retailers, you know, there were some shining spots in each category but there was no great category at all when it came to results, other than I\u2019d say the electronic guys seem to have the best performance. ", "Rick, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything. ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only other ones that -- I agree totally with the characterization. Accessories were also a little stronger. Juniors were a little stronger. Books and records continue to be a little weaker and the women\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how to phrase it politically correct, but the mature women\u2019s segment was softer. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Okay, and then just a follow-up to Matt\u2019s question about B malls and where implied pricing, what the cap rates are for those malls right now. Is there any institutional demand to partner with you? Previously you had talked about a B mall fund, whereas that -- in this market, is that -- ", "David Simon", "There is demand to partner for us with, you know, on new deals. It\u2019s always a little more challenging on existing assets because we always have to confront the issue, why are you selling X of this, but in terms of new deals, new opportunities, we always have interest to partner with us. I mean, look at the Mills as a great example of that. ", "So that hasn\u2019t change. It\u2019s a little tougher when we are trying to sell maybe half an asset but we really don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t really like that strategy. If we\u2019re not comfortable operating it, we\u2019re better off just selling the asset, so we don\u2019t do that as a routine. When we do bring in partners, they tend to be for new opportunities. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Can you comment on how much of your \u201908 leasing is completed at this point?", "David Simon", "Rick, do you want to do that?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yeah, we are -- as a matter of fact, we are meeting next week with all of our regional teams to focus and I was going through that. We today are probably 65% to 75% through the renewal process and we\u2019re now working on frankly starting on \u201909 and we\u2019ve been pushing our leasing group to be more proactive in anticipating perhaps where there may be some renewals that won\u2019t come through, so we have other tenants already lined up that we can move in that space with a minimum of downtime. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Last question -- can you just update on domain and how that\u2019s doing?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s basically 100% leased, doing about $500 a foot. And we are building -- I don\u2019t know why we ever called it Building P, but we call it Building P -- we\u2019re building Building P. It should open in the fall and we will be starting Domain 2 here in the next month or two for an \u201909 delivery. ", "Jeffrey Spector - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Merrill Lynch.", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "Steve, if we think about your normalized number for 2007, it\u2019s a little over $6. I know you mentioned the lease termination fees would maybe be cut in half. Is there anything else we should think about that was sort of non-recurring? I know you had the mezzanine loan to the Mills joint venture and I don\u2019t know from a profitability standpoint how much that contributed but maybe outside of those two things, is there anything else non-recurring?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, you\u2019re right in that Arizona obviously and the $20 million-ish of lease terminations from the department store deals that we did, there was probably an accelerated amount of fee income, primarily related to the financings that we did around the Mills transactions, so that would be non-recurring. ", "You know, the only other thing that\u2019s a nuance Steve is that for the first half -- actually, the first three months of our loan, the mezzanine loan, we did not have an ownership interest in the Mills. If you\u2019ll recall, we made that loan before we closed the transaction and under the accounting rules, we could recognize 100% of the profit where, post closing because we own half the enterprise, we could only recognize half the profit. And that\u2019s probably $10 million. ", "So I mean, there\u2019s -- but those would be the big items. ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "So just to be clear, so $10 million of earnings in \u201907 that won\u2019t recur because of a change in ownership -- ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That\u2019s correct. ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "A decrease in lease termination fees, and then an acceleration of other fee income from the Mills deal. ", "David Simon", "Part of that you are going to offset because you are going to have a full year of Mills and we\u2019ll have a full year of running the business, which is profitable. So the net net of that probably is pretty close but we probably -- I mean, we can give you specifically. We don\u2019t have that at our fingertips, but it\u2019s probably going to make it a little bit lumpy quarter by quarter but from a year-end, it\u2019s probably going to be pretty close because we\u2019ll have the business longer, we\u2019ll run it longer, and that may offset some of the extraordinary fee income that we got from the transaction. ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "I guess the reason I\u2019m asking is if you take the 602, which I think would be sort of a normalized number, and you look at the low end of your guidance, it\u2019s about 4% growth. And given your expectations for NOI growth this year, even though you are cautious on retail sales, and given your leverage profile, one would think you\u2019d get higher growth than 4%, so there\u2019s clearly something that\u2019s pulling that growth rate down at the low end. ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, you certainly have to back out the $20 million of lease terminations that we got in the first quarter of \u201907. Those are as non-recurring as the Arizona write-off was. ", "David Simon", "Well, if you take that out, then you are back to the -- ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yeah, you\u2019re basically back to 6% at the low end and 9% at the -- ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then David, I guess from a big picture, you\u2019ve obviously been I think appropriately cautious, but the NOI forecast that you\u2019ve put out there I guess are more optimistic than maybe your tone would be about sales. And is that just because it\u2019s sort of, if you will, the spillover effect that happens from all the things that you did in \u201907 that just kind of carry over? And the real impact of this slow down, to the extent it continues, would really be felt more in \u201909?", "David Simon", "Well, look, the mall product is very resilient, so even in a -- if we get into a terrible recession, then that\u2019s a different issue right now. But we are thinking it\u2019s recession like, but the mall product is very resilient and we are pretty confident that we ought to be able to grow our business 3% to 4%, even in a tough economic environment. ", "Now, if it gets to where we are in a deep recession, all bets are off for us and anybody else. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change our tune in \u201909 given what we think the environment is now. If it gets worse, you know, maybe but there\u2019s ways we\u2019re going to run the business so that we can create that kind of cash flow growth. ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then one last question on international -- can you remind me where you are and sort of your thought process on Brazil?", "", "David Simon", "We think Brazil -- we\u2019re not really active in Brazil. We think -- what I\u2019ve seen, some of the recent deals, we think it\u2019s -- listen, the growth there is pretty interesting but we think clearly you\u2019re better -- on a risk-adjusted basis, to put capital in there at the valuations that are talking about now and you contrast that to the U.S., the U.S. is a no-brainer. And I frankly feel that way in most developing countries right now because I think the growth expectations in a lot of the developing countries is probably overstated right now.  ", "So I think it\u2019s a no-brainer in terms of putting capital there versus the U.S. I\u2019d bet on the U.S. right now. ", "Steve Sakwa - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks.

Fick - Stifel, Nicolaus", "I\u2019d like to circle back on the releasing spread question.

Sterrett", "Well, David, if you\u2019ll recall, and we\u2019ve talked about it several times on recent calls, we are doing a fair bit of redevelopment of some of the old Federated boxes. And several of those came online this year fourth quarter. A lot of that was big box activity and those are 20,000, 30,000 square foot boxes where instead of getting $40 or $45 a foot, we\u2019re getting $20 or $25 a foot. Still a good reutilization of the space, certainly more profitable than the original department store, but if you do enough of them, and there was 600,000 square feet of that stuff in the fourth quarter alone, that\u2019s enough to pull your spread down -- ", "David Simon", "Yeah, and if you look at -- if you look at -- you know, again, quarter to quarter, you\u2019ve got to be careful. I think year-end is a pretty good number but you look at, we were at 17.6% last year, 20.7%. When you take out 17.1 in \u201904 and when you take out the boxes that Steve pointed to, you\u2019re at 18%, so it\u2019s right on line.

Fick - Stifel, Nicolaus", "That\u2019s what I assume, and so I don\u2019t know why it would even be consider re-leasing I guess in terms of the -- ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Because the way we look at re-leasing, which I think is pretty comparable with the way most of the industry looks at it, is what was the sum total of all your expirations and terminations and compare it to the sum total of all the space that you lease. ", "We do look at it, David, on a comparable space basis and we look at only the leasing activity that we did in \u201907 and go back and look at what that identical expiring rent was for that same population of spaces. That number was over $9 a foot in 2007. ", "David M. Fick - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And as a percentage?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "That number is available but we don\u2019t really post it because --", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "The percentage was like 23%, 24%. It was ,more than $9.50 a foot.", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus ", "That seems hugely relevant, thank you. David could you comment on your exposure to Sears in gross and where you see the process right now as it related to you?", "David Simon", "When you say what our total base rent is from Sears?", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Yes.", "David Simon", "Is that what you\u2019re asking?", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Yes. And strategically, how you are viewing them right now as a tenant?", "David Simon", "Look , we\u2019ve had an under-performing Sears for several, several years. I mean we do think they\u2019re very smart people so we are optimistic that they will turn the business around. Our financial exposure is --", "Stephen E. Sterrett", " ", "About $13 million a year in base minimum.", "David Simon", "I mean it\u2019s not huge, that\u2019s $0.04 a share.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It\u2019s spread over, I don\u2019t know what percentage of the 150 stores we have that have leases, but it\u2019s clearly spread over a large number of stores.", "David Simon", "We have a good working relationship with them, we get things done, development approvals and whatnot. But we are not privy to their internal strategy.  I mean they keep it close to the vest like they do with everybody else. So we\u2019d like to know more but frankly we just don\u2019t.", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Finally, you didn\u2019t buy back any stock in fourth quarter, what are you assuming about this year and what\u2019s your current posture on your share repurchase?", "David Simon", "That\u2019s a good question. Right now we have not modeled any stock buy back, we still have authorization to do it, but it\u2019s not in our numbers. Obviously it would be accretive to do so. We feel right now given the world that we want to keep our powder dry to be opportunistic but we don\u2019t rule changing out, changing that view on a day-by-day basis. So we\u2019ve got their authorization. What we did we in the fourth quarter was tumultuous. ", "I don\u2019t want to be one of these guys that read I bought the stock at $100 and it\u2019s now trading at $80 which a lot of corporate America did frankly, so we\u2019re going to be conservative there. Our authorization is serious and to the extent that we think we should do it, we will do it.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Greg Stuart \u2013 JP Morgan", "I just had a couple of questions. The first one is relating to guidance I noticed the range seems pretty widened. I wanted to know what key concerns impacting the sensitivity of that range that would probably make you come out on the low end versus the high end?", "David Simon", "Well look, I mean the world is a little wacky right now so we tend to be when we do our guidance at the beginning of the year, we tend to be conservative. We also tend to narrow that range as we get through some of the operating months. But we\u2019re taking the same strategy we\u2019ve taken over the last few years; nothing has changed. ", "When we roll up our budget, LIBOR had not materially moved. There is a lot of volatility in today\u2019s business world so we felt like a higher or wider range was appropriate given the extreme volatility that\u2019s occurring with the economy, with job growth, with interest rates, with capital availability, et cetera. So that\u2019s really reflected in the wideness of the range. ", "At the end of the day, we\u2019re very comfortable with our business and where we\u2019re positioned and we\u2019ll operate accordingly.", "Greg Stuart \u2013 JP Morgan", "Could you just run over quickly for me what CapEx expectations were for \u201808?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", " ", "As David mentioned earlier we\u2019re going to spend just a little bit over $1 billion in new developments, redevelopments here in the U.S. I think our spend internationally is a couple hundred million dollars. In terms of just the operating CapEx, it won\u2019t be much different than we\u2019ve seen in prior years; I think in \u201807 our share of operational CapEx looks like it was about $175 million and our tenant allowances were about $120 million, I think. So you\u2019re about $300 million in total I think that\u2019s probably a fair number for \u201808 as well.", "Greg Stuart \u2013 JP Morgan", "Bigger picture, as you look at the world what will have to happen for you to push back on your developments? What do you see for tenants to pull back in \u201808, \u201809? Development pipeline?", "David Simon", " ", "I tell you with what we have right now in the pipeline, we feel pretty confident we\u2019re going to go ahead and execute that. There are a couple that are like, for instance, we\u2019re going through the approval process on [Topley] to expand the retail as well as build a residential tower there. That\u2019s the one deal that we might be somewhat sensitive too in terms of timing but on the other hand, it is really assuming it\u2019s a two-and-a-half, three year build it\u2019s really, given the quality of the real estate, you\u2019re really talking about what it\u2019s going to look like in 11 or 12. ", "So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that\u2019s going to deter us with existing pipeline based on \u201808, \u201809. We\u2019re very well capitalized. We have our plan very well put together. Again on the margin, a few deals here and there but I would say the one that jumps out at me that we\u2019re very sensitive to the market would be the residential tower in [Topley]. But again, that\u2019s a judgment call in 12 or 11 depending on when or if we get the approvals we need to build it.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "Good morning, guys. Are you seeing any concessions, any retailers asking for concessions from in-place retailers? I guess I\u2019m looking for guidance, who aren\u2019t going bankrupt or necessarily closing stores but are looking for some kind of concession?", "David Simon", " ", "We always deal with that, I mean there\u2019s always some retailers that do that. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing, nothing -- and I underline emphatically -- nothing like what we had to deal with in early 90s, mid 90s, nothing even close to that. There\u2019s always going to be a few tenants that are doing the horse trade on that stuff but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing, nothing like what we\u2019ve dealt with in prior economic slowdown. ", "Rick, do you want to add to that?", "Richard S. Sokolov", " ", "I think that\u2019s right. We have not seen anyone coming in saying we want a wholesale renegotiation of our rent and I think one of the things to underline is our retailers generally their balance sheet -- notwithstanding their stock prices -- are really very good. I think that we really are not particularly seeing that at all and it\u2019s really just a case-by-case basis in ordinary course of business.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "If you did get any of that, the mechanics of that would be that they would actually renegotiate the lease? Is that how that works or would you just let them not pay a month or?", "David Simon", " ", "We tend to say no first, okay. I don\u2019t want to give you my negotiating strategy over the phone. But really ultimately our decision is if we don\u2019t work with the tenant, what\u2019s the ramifications of that? Are they going to go into Chapter 11? Do we believe in the long-term viability of the tenant, in the relationship? That kind of goes through and there is no one pat answer other than we always start with no. ", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "Okay that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s good. ", "Second thing, do you guys have any thoughts on what\u2019s going on with the equity interest in the sector from private equity, from big pension funds? Any color on that?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", " ", "Do you mean on a direct investment basis Rich?", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "Yes I realize Steve that that\u2019s not so much what you guys are doing but have you got any feel for how many times your phone rings with requests or any color on it?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "The answer is a lot. I mean I think it has always been a product that the institutional quality investor has very much liked and their interest tends to be skewed towards the A level assets but demand for space or demand to own the higher quality assets is very strong. The phone rings a lot because quite frankly I think they all recognize they need another operator/partner because of the intensity of the management of the assets. ", "But it\u2019s an asset class that have always been very highly valued by the institutional community.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "So you have not seen that slow as a result of what\u2019s been going on in the broader market?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", " ", "No. Obviously as David mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t have a lot of product but there is high interest out there.", "David Simon", " ", "And I would just say that the interest tends to be for new opportunity just because that creates a level playing field. So if we were to go buy a new mall or new company X, I think the interest on those kinds of deals is extremely high and unabated because then you can underwrite it together. Everybody is on the same page etcetera versus if we were to sell a half interest on the existing asset there is some concern as to why we would do that. We certainly don\u2019t need to do that from a capital point of view.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets ", "Okay, very good. Thanks and then the last thing is the other subcategory under other income, was a bit higher this time Steve, any thoughts on that?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Rich, I did mention that there was a little bit of fee income that was one of the drivers, financing fee related. That\u2019s pushing that number up because when you compare it to \u201806 obviously there was none. That\u2019s probably the only thing that\u2019s really remarkable in there Rich. Simon\u2019s rate of interest continues to grow and so to the extent that there is a component of income in there and some of that flows through that line item that\u2019s added to some of the growth. Those are the two biggest drivers of the business.", "Operator", " ", "Your last question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors ", "Question on the lifestyle centers, I\u2019d love to get your opinion on how you think lifestyle centers are going to fare in a recessionary type situation? It seems like the retailers that you see so commonly at all lifestyle centers are the ones that are reporting already some pretty ugly same-store sales comps and when you think about the product type that they are in, the  mature women\u2019s apparel and the national restaurant chains etcetera, what is your outlook on how lifestyle centers might fair in a recession? Is there much of a difference between say the lifestyle centers that are attached to existing mall properties versus the standalone lifestyle centers that a private guy might\u2019ve built across the street or down the road?", "David Simon", " ", "That\u2019s a good question let me take the last first. We\u2019ve had great success in adding, doing that two-for, which is adding some of those tenants and book stores and restaurants, popping it out on the mall. There\u2019s a lot of, I hate using the word synergy, but there is just a lot of good that comes from it. It reinvigorates the mall, it gives the customer what it wants, so it\u2019s really a nice thing to do. It seems to work for the tenant. It seems to work for the developer. So that seems to be continuing on unabated. ", "Obviously some of those tenants are being more cautious as you pointed out because of the macro thing. We have not been a big believer, other than there have been some that have been good, but we have never really been a big believer in the cutesy lifestyle center that has a couple hundred thousand square feet. We do think they long-term viability issues. The bigger ones, the ones that we build and some of our colleagues you have to look at those as a mall frankly without a roof. Again, that ends up being is it good real estate? Does it have the right tenant mix? Does it have the right anchors? ", "We do think and we should ask Rick as well, but I do think that the cutesy ones that do rely certainly on the, as Rick phrased it, the more mature women are certainly going to fare poor in this environment until those retailers turnaround because that\u2019s what drawing the customer there in the first place. They don\u2019t have the diversity of mix to draw that customer so those will suffer significantly. Rick, what do you think?", "Richard S. Sokolov", " ", "I agree totally. I think the way to think about a lifestyle center is what\u2019s its franchise value? As David pointed out, the properties we\u2019ve built that are open air are basically anchored by the department stores, restaurants, theaters, bookstores and are upwards of a million square feet. They\u2019ve created a franchise and a market share that\u2019s significant in their market ", "Where you have a project that doesn\u2019t have that market share and franchise value, I think it\u2019s going to be much more subject to losing its market share because there are many less reasons for any shopper to visit that particular location when you have a narrower mix and a narrower number of offerings and less square footage.", "David Simon", " ", "I would say the only other point is it\u2019s clear that at least what we\u2019re seeing is that there are a number that are being built that are going to have a hard time leasing. None of ours of course, and a lot that\u2019s been on the drawing board I think obviously in the current environment both from a capital point of view mostly but also from a macroeconomic view, I think they\u2019re going to have a very hard time getting off the ground.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors ", "David on your last call in response to a question regarding the state of the economy and retailer bankruptcies you said we actually embrace these kinds of economic changes. That\u2019s when we\u2019ve done some of our best work. What did you mean by that? Do lifestyle centers perhaps represent the opportunity this time around?", "David Simon", "Well I think they could. There\u2019s a few that again we would want them to have a certain critical mass. Because again I think generally the 200,000 square foot ones were not that enamored with long term. ", "But they could and I think simply we have always conservatively financed our growth since being public. We\u2019ve been criticized over how we did it, but that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s what being public is all about. ", "When times are challenging is when we\u2019ve done some good work. Look, it\u2019s challenging out there. I would rather have no bankruptcies, I would rather have no leases turn over but on the other hand that\u2019s when you can make some hay and that\u2019s where great wealth in our industry has been created either through development or buying at the right price. We tend to be able to buy at the right price when few can buy.", "Operator", " ", "This concludes our Q&A session.

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "", "David Simon", "Good morning and thanks for joining the call.  I\u2019m just going to take a few minutes to discuss the highlights and then open it up for your questions.  Second quarter FFO was $1.49 per share, up 13.7% over the prior year.  Please note that this growth was achieved in spite of the $20.3 million extinguishment charge incurred in connection with the redemption of $200 million of [mopper] notes.  ", "These notes, which matured on June 15th, contain a re-pricing mechanism that allowed the underwriter to remarket the issuance as a new 20-year SPG security.  An exchange for this remarketing right, we received an $8 million payment from the underwriter when the moppers were issued in 1998.  This remarketing feature would haves resulted in the issuance of above market rate debt due to Treasury rates being lower than when the debt was originally issued and marketing conditions on the exchange date; therefore, we elected to simply retire the notes and pay the premium.  ", "As a result of the redemption, we expect to save approximately $5 million annually in interest expense over the 20-year term that these notes would\u2019ve been in place had they been remarketed and reissued as compared to current rates available to us from other financing activities.  Excluding the impact of this one-time charge, diluted FFO per share increased 19.1% for the quarter to $1.56.  ", "We continue to benefit from the impact of solid operating results from all of our five property platforms.  As well as decreasing LIBOR rates, results were also positively impacted by cost control, including our energy efficiency efforts.  Occupancy in the mall portfolio was down 20 basis points as compared with the year earlier period.  Square footage lost to bankruptcy for the first six months of 2008 totaled 151,000 square feet as compared to 30,000 square feet during the first six months of 2007.", "As we discussed in the first quarter, the decline in the premium outlet occupancy is primarily due to lease terminations or bankruptcies of four tenants comprising about a dozen spaces and the late March 2008 openings of Houston premium outlets and Phase 2 of Rio Grande premium outlets, we expect occupancy within the premium outlet portfolio to return to previous levels.  ", "Sales in the mall portfolio that is comparable sales were $494 per square foot, up 1% as compared to the year earlier period.  Sales continue to moderate due to the general weakening of the U.S. economy as well as our portfolio\u2019s exposure to Florida and California.  Premium outlet sales growth remains strong, increasing 5.5% to $519 per square foot driven by our centers with substantial international tourist exposure.  ", "Comparable NOI for the mall portfolio was 5.4% for the quarter.  Comparable NOI for the premium outlet portfolio was 7.3%. Year-to-date comp NOI is up 3.7% for our malls and 5.7% for the outlets.  The releasing spread for our mall portfolio was $8.32 for the first six months, representing a 23.1% increase.  The releasing spread for our premium outlet portfolio was $13.33, representing a strong 50% increase.  ", "Pricing power remains strong in the outlet business due to low occupancy costs continued sales growth and ongoing demand for space from tenants.  In addition, the premium outlet bankruptcy space that we mentioned earlier had a positive impact on the releasing at double the previous rents.  [Inaudible] control and continued conversion tenants the fixed CAM resulted in continued higher recovery of common area maintenance expenses.  Today, we\u2019re about 70% converted to fixed CAM. Interest income included in the other income line of our income statement was $11.5 million lower in the second quarter 2008 as compared with the prior period, prior year, primarily related to our loans to mills. The loans are now nearly $1 billion lower in 2008 than they were in the first six months of 2007.  ", "The Mills portfolio is performing at expectations if not above and it\u2019s contribution to our FFO is equivalent in the second quarter of 08 to the prior year as improved property performance and profit for managing the portfolio offset lower interest and fee income from a year ago.  Our development, redevelopment pipeline remains intact and will be a contributor to a future growth.  We continue our focus on redevelopment and the expansion of franchise assets in the U.S. and new premium outlet development in the U.S. and Asia. ", "Our recent U.S. openings include Pier Park and Hamilton Town Center and performing very well.  Our Chelsea projects currently under construction include Jersey Shore opening later this year and Cincinnati premium outlets opening in the summer of \u201909.  We remain very disappointed in the allocation of capital to only those projects that meet our return expectations.  ", "On May 12th, we raised $700 million of five-year 5.3% notes and $800 million of ten-year 6 and an eighth notes that will re-offer spread of treasuries plus 235 basis points. This pricing applies zero new issue premium on the new offer.  We received over $5 billion of order for our bonds and our issue is well planned as market conditions have deteriorated since then.  We remain exceptionally well positioned following the bond offering.  Our share of maturities in 2008 of less than $500 million evenly split between secured and unsecured debt.  We also have approximately $2.8 billion of current capacity on our line as well $500 million of cash on the balance sheet.  ", "Based upon our strong second quarter results, projected activity for the rest of the year and our view of market conditions, today we gave 2008 FFO guidance of $6.38 to $6.45 per share, increasing lower end of our previously provided range by $0.03. Please note that this guidance includes the impact of the second quarter extinguishment charge of $0.07 per share. This is particularly meaningful as when guidance was last given in early May.  We're working toward exchanging the moppers into new notes, which would have resulted in no charge being recognized.  ", "Finally, let me just say before I open it up to questions, these are clearer challenging times, but we\u2019re positioned, well positioned to succeed. In this environment, our high quality and diverse portfolio, real estate, strong balance sheet and robust infrastructure provide the necessary framework.  On a final note, I\u2019d also like to thank all of you for your support and confidence.  We were pleased to be recognized by Greenwich Associates in June as having one of the best IR programs in corporate America.", "Operator, we\u2019re now available for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Gorman with Credit Suisse. ", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "This question is for Steve I think.  Could you just spend a little time going over the provisions for credit losses in the quarter?  Obviously it was up a lot year-over-year and sort of in line with what we saw in the first quarter.  Could you just talk about, a little bit about what went on there?  ", "Stephen Sterrett", "Yeah, Michael, you got a couple of things. We take a relatively conservative pack in that when a tenant files for bankruptcy, we reserve 100% of the receivables.  So with the tenants that are currently in bankruptcy, including the recent filings like Steve & Barry\u2019s, we are fully reserved for all of the receivables that were outstanding in June 30.  I think when you couple that with just the fact that it\u2019s a tougher environment out there and we\u2019ve got receivables that are a little bit higher level and they were a year ago, we think we\u2019re pretty conservative in how we provide for that added expense.  I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that run rate in the first half translate into full year provisions, but you couple those two or three factors and we kind of are where we are. ", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "\t", "So the run rate should drop off a little bit from here?", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "I would think it would a little bit because I think with some of the tenants who are there, we won\u2019t necessarily see a closing of all the stores and so I would say it firms some of the leases in those receivables will come back to us.  ", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "\t", "Rick, just quickly, could you talk about what happened with the leasing spreads on the community center portfolio? I notice it went negative this quarter.", "Richard Sokolov", "", "They are relatively small inventory, so they\u2019re much more influenced by if there are a couple of box fields that are in there, but there\u2019s nothing.  The amount of activity in that portfolio is very small so it can have a higher degree of deviation from quarter-to-quarter. ", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I guess just what type of space was it that had negative mark-to-market?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "It was that basically we had a couple or boxes and we had two CompUSA stores that closed and a Nordstrom Rack at Shops Northeast that closed, and the Rack was replaced by Barnes and Noble, and we\u2019re working on the CompUSA.  ", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "I wouldn\u2019t classify it as mark-to-market.

I think it\u2019ll be\u2026 I think it\u2019ll boil down to real estate play. I do think Boscos has a little bit different retail angle that may be able to in a different capital market structure may be able to operate accordingly. I think their more constrained capital. They do things a little bit different from a retail point of view.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Green Street Advisors ", "Then last question, you talked about your China investment garnering say a 9% going in yield. Are there any major structural differences in how leases are signed there versus how you do them here?", "David Simon", "", "Well look, I mean there are lots of them because let\u2019s face it, and this is what I think we all have to be sensitive about this sexy overseas development, the right to pursue tenants if they don\u2019t pay is a lot different in a lot of different markets. So I think our big issue is if a lot of these tenants don\u2019t perform, how do you get rent?  We don\u2019t know yet?  We\u2019re not confronted with under performance, but the laws associated with that are a lot different. Now these are longer terms leases. I mean the leases look a lot ours in terms of land and fixed common area reimbursements and alike. The real issue though is if performance isn\u2019t there and they don\u2019t pay, do you have an issue?  ", "Now, it\u2019s interest in Japan, which I like their system, I\u2019d like to bring it to the U.S., is what they do is they collect sales from the actual customer and then they send the retailer everything but what the landlord share is.  We\u2019re actually putting that in China as well, but the process of that hasn\u2019t been adjudicated.  So it\u2019s a risk, that\u2019s why we\u2019d like to see returns. It\u2019s a huge market. We\u2019re doing thing in R&D. We\u2019ve executed the plan the way we though, but we\u2019re very cautious in a lot of future opportunities until we get better handle on exactly that question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.  ", "Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "You mentioned earlier about it being harder to lease up new developments, harder to justify it.  Could you take a minute and talk about the pace of leasing and the appetite for space when you\u2019re looking at the redevelopment projects, particularly the ones you\u2019re adding new shop TLA?", "David Simon", "", "Well, it depends. I mean there are\u2026 We have a lot more scrutiny in ability to execute, not that we\u2019ve had execution problems but the days of all the tenant is interested let\u2019s build it are done, so it\u2019s a function of who the tenant is, how much we can rely on their good faith intentions and our judgment. It\u2019s a judgment call. Now we\u2019ve been doing this a long time, so our judgment here ought to be pretty good. Our track record is pretty good, but the intense focus has certainly increased because we got to rely on the tenant.  We got to rely on our people in terms of what they can delivery and there will be a few instances where we are going to slow it down just to make sure that we can pull it off as pro forma.  ", "Richard Sokolov", "", "The one thing in the redevelopment area, because you\u2019re adding tenants to an already demonstrated productive property, it is an easier proposition. If you look at the redevelopment program, we\u2019ve added Nordstrom to Burlington. We\u2019re opening in the spring of next year Nordstrom at North Shore, year after it\u2019s Nordstrom at South Shore.  Nordstrom is opening a Keystone fashion this fall opening at Tacoma this fall while in all of those instances where we\u2019re adding incremental small shop space, we\u2019re substantially improving the market share of the property and it\u2019s an easier proposition to attract the retailer.    ", "David Simon", "", "I would say we just don\u2019t have a lot of risk. To us, if we add GLA, we want a 100% leased.  The risk we have is it\u2019s 90% leased.  I mean the deviation from our plan to the results is not going to be all that material, yet it\u2019s going through a further level of scrutiny giving the environment that we live in.", "Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan", "So for new ground up development, non-Chelsea in the U.S., it sounds like that\u2019s slowing Chelsea.  It sounds like the pace is keeping up. If we\u2019re looking at the redevelopment expenditures say \u201807/\u201908 levels, versus 2009/2010 expectations, do you think the capital spend is still about in the same ballpark?", "David Simon", "", "I would say clearly new ground up ex-Chelsea, you\u2019re right. I mean it is.  The only thing that have opening in \u201909 that\u2019s really Phase 2 of Phase 1 which is domain and then had three or four others that we have backburnered for all sorts of reasons, not all of which are recurring economic environment, but they were early projects and there\u2019s no reason to push it.  ", "On redevelopment, we\u2019re on a straddle of a couple, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that I think redevelopment in \u201909 will be similar to \u201908, though, it could be less. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be more. There like I said, there are a couple of projects that we\u2019re straddling. The good news is I look at both from, obviously you want the redevelopment because it\u2019s accretive.  On the other hand, if we don\u2019t and we want to hold on it, our cash flow increases from an after dividend and so on and there\u2019s nothing like fire power in an uncertain economic environment.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "", "David, I guess two-part question for you on just the outlook for occupancy more broadly.  Given your experience with cyclical downturns with retail space, demand and the timing it take for retail or appetites to change to absorb that FS space, when do you think mall occupancy in the U.S. as a whole [inaudible] its bottom? Is that a 2009 event or do you think it\u2019ll be far out as 2010?  Do you think we\u2019ll see much variability in the performance between A and B malls over that time period?", "David Simon", "", "Well, I think it\u2019s tough because we\u2019re I think kind of in the\u2026 We\u2019re in the first half of the downturn let\u2019s say, okay.  It\u2019s a very tough judgmental call. I do think we\u2019ll see the worst of it manifest itself in \u201909, not \u201910.  But a lot of the story hasn\u2019t been written and clearly the trend of better properties getting better and worse properties getting worse is only going to accelerate in a tough economic environment. But it is\u2026 That trend has been with us for quite some time.  It\u2019ll accelerate it, but it\u2019s not going to be a dramatically different outcome in that. I think good properties are going to continue to get better and bad properties are going to get worse.  I don\u2019t look at it so much A or B, I look at market share, the property getting better, what are the demographics; what\u2019s the trade area, etc.  That trend I think is with us and has been with us for quite some years.", "Now on the other hand, we\u2019ve had some centers that have really under performed that we actually have some very interesting development plans and that\u2019s the big delver that I mentioned earlier that if we can pull off some of the things they\u2019re working on, we have some real upside in some of these and we\u2019ve already suffered through the downside, so that remains to be seen.  But I think \u201909 is going to be a little bit of we\u2019re going to use \u201909 to bounce back, the industry I should say because you\u2019re going to see more stores closing because of the credit situation.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "I guess building on that, maybe this one is for Rick, is that since the kiosk and temporary tenant business I would say probably tends to skew more towards a less sophisticated operator than perhaps your typical in line tenant. Any sense of how this economic environment is weighing on appetite for rental demand from those tenants, particularly as we near the holiday season where it\u2019s more dominant for the mall business?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "So far we have and this has of June 30.  We are on track to hit our budgets in those businesses for 2008.  So it\u2019s one of the things is we have been, we\u2019re very focused on the leasing as we get a little more space back from the small shops closing, that\u2019s incremental inventory for that business and that\u2019s on track still.  ", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "How many of rents typically structure those, a percentage of sales or just fixed rate?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "It\u2019s fixed rate plus a percentage.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "One last question is for Steve; I don\u2019t want to leave you out.  For your 2008 guidance, can you just tell us what\u2019s implied I guess from an occupancy perspective for the back half of 2008 versus where you were the same period of 2007?  ", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "Well a continuation of the environment that we\u2019re in right now and I think it would be reasonable to say that we\u2019re expecting occupancy to be lower at 12/31/08 in the malls than it was at 12/31/07.", "David Simon", "", "Just on the occupancy, I mean there\u2019s a lot of occupancy stuff that\u2019s out of our hands because we do have some tenants that are in Chapter 11, whether they reject or assume leases is out of your hands.  So as precise as we\u2019d like to be, precision is not available to us at this point.  With that said, we\u2019re going to grow our comp NOI in the way that we\u2019ve described it and that\u2019s going to be a function of temporary tenants and the like and so on.  But pinpointing occupancy is going to be a little bit tricky given at this point it\u2019s a little bit out of our control.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "I\u2019m curious, though, do you think there\u2019s a chance that your year-end \u201909 then is lower than year-end \u201908, or just too difficult to say right now?", "David Simon", "", "Too difficult to say.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.  ", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Hey, Rick, you had a good list of tenants that might be available to backfill Steve & Barry\u2019s, and I was wondering who in the small shop space is opening stores? I mean who stands out for you is particularly strong in that arena?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "We\u2019re doing a lot of business now with Forever 21, with [Sofour], with Apple, Coach is still opening stores, Tilly\u2019s coming out of California, Zoomies,  Express, Abercrombie, American Eagle.  Abercrombie\u2019s rolling out [inaudible].  We still have substantial demand across the portfolio from tenants.  Game Stop is still opening stores.  Liz Claiborne is converting from a wholesale distribution channel to a retail distribution channel, so they\u2019re opening Lucky Jeans, Lucky Kids, Kate Spade, and Juicy stores.  H&M, we\u2019re doing a lot of business with H&M, so there\u2019s still a great deal of activity here and the tenor of the demand is strong. Echoing David\u2019s points, the good malls are getting better and supply almost is, demand is almost only elastic in those better properties. It suffers a downtime just to reconfigure and release the space, but we could add more space to our better properties and have demand.  ", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Are you thinking of those names for 2009/2010, is that where their interest is? I mean I assume 2008 is supposed to be done so not as important, but 2009/2010 both they have interest in both years?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "Oh yeah, absolutely.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Steve, on the debt, if you had to redo a big mall mortgage, like you say had to redo Roosevelt Field, would that get done do you think as a mortgage or how does that work in this environment?", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "Yeah, it\u2019d work because we don\u2019t have a mortgage on it.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Say, you were going to put a mortgage on it.", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "Rich, as an example, we just refinanced Stanford, which is obviously an A+. Yeah, the demand at the end of the quality spectrum is obviously better. But even then, you run into two challenges.  1)  Is loan to values, because the underwriting is very conservative. 2) The big malls are obviously worth a lot and so if you want to put in an appropriate loan to value piece of debt [inaudible] do it through the bank market or you\u2019re going to have to involve multiple life companies and some kind of club deal.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "So it would probably be multiple banks you think and maybe more insurance companies, but probably a consortium of banks?", "Stephen Sterrett", "", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s the most likely scenario.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "David, you mentioned earlier a little bit about getting more restrictive on some of your lease terms. Can you just talk about the existing leases? What kind of co-tenancy exposure do you have especially to some of the names on your top anchor list like a Sears or a Dillard\u2019s or Bon-Ton? ", "David Simon", "", "It would depend on the center, but not that much really. I mean usually if there is any co-tenancy it\u2019s the for department store mall and maybe two anchors. The fact of the matter is if the anchors are going out of business, you don\u2019t really have those tenants anyway, so it\u2019s somewhat of\u2026 I can\u2019t recall anywhere co-tenancy is really affected us financial. It\u2019s a thing here, but it\u2019s really not for us a material financial issue.", "Richard Sokolov", "", "Michael, probably three/four years ago now we also started writing in those instances where there are co-tenancy show ARM provisions, so it\u2019s just not the event, if the event then coupled with a sales decline.  ", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sorry if I missed this, but when you were discussing acquisitions earlier, do any of those opportunities include buying back space at existing centers that you don\u2019t own?", "David Simon", "", "Sure, if the price is right.", "Michael Gorman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Have you had any?", "David Simon", "", "You know, I would say at this point nothing major is happening there.  Sure, I mean occasionally like\u2026  Rick whispered to me \u201cSharper Image.\u201d I guess a good example of demand for retail space is Sharper Image is liquidating and we have actually bid on some of our leases because there were hostile retailers bidding on it and even though we love that retailer, in this particular few malls, we didn\u2019t want that retailer in that particular space, so we had to pony up some money to buy the leases from the estate.  So, yeah, we\u2019re doing that in cases. I mean when it comes to the big departments stores, we\u2019re still\u2026 There\u2019s a bidden mask there that is a normal process with us.  So we are going to be buying some anchor spaces over the next few years, but there is a value gap between the owner and the what we want to pay for it at this point.  ", "Richard Sokolov", "", "The only thing I would add is that as David said, this is not new business for us. I mean we acquired a lot of stores from Macy\u2019s when they merged with May.  We\u2019ve acquired stores from [Belt].  We\u2019ve acquired stores from Lord & Taylor, and we\u2019ve been able to very effectively redeploy those assets to make our properties better. If you go back in past 8-Ks, you\u2019ll see the capital we spend and the returns we got through those redeployments.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup.", "Michael Bilerman", "", "I have one follow-up for Rick.  Rick, as you think about your leasing plan when you\u2019re talking about being ahead of pace for 2009, how does that leasing plan for \u201909 compare to what it was for \u201908?  I think you\u2019re dealing with about 6 million square feet of scheduled roll in the mall portfolio.  How much did you increase your store closures?  How much did you increase your bankruptcy expectations relative to the \u201908 plan?", "Richard Sokolov", "", "Well it\u2019s not a planned per se, Michael. It\u2019s really a productivity measure.  What we track is what results we are generating, so we have basically told our teams that we need to be far further ahead in our expiration and so our teams are now working on \u201909 and 2010 expirations so we can get further and further out ahead of the tenants in the planning.  So it isn\u2019t really a planned per se that we said we wanted to be X.  We are tracking it against our past performance and every year we\u2019re getting better in getting further out ahead of the expirations so we can be proactive in dealing with these spaces rather than reactive.", "David Simon", "", "I would just add to that, Michael, that we are clearly aware of inventory.  The inventory has increased just because take an example, Demo\u2019s out of business.  We decided to work with Pac-Sun, take a lease termination payment and then added that to the inventory, so the inventory at Sharper Inventory is obviously added to the inventory.  Even guys that are in \u201911 where we don\u2019t know exactly say Whitehall, where we don\u2019t know exactly what space we may or may not get back depending on the outcome of that preceding, our people are leasing as if they don\u2019t exist.  So the inventories increased, yet we\u2019re fully aware of it and we\u2019re obviously shopping the inventory to the best of our abilities.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Louis Taylor with Deutsche Bank.", "Louis Taylor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "David, what\u2019s the limited acquisitions in more difficult development environment? Is it more likely you\u2019ll be a buyer of your stock around these levels?", "David Simon", "", "Well, we\u2019ve been very conservative given the world in terms of capital. At this point, I think we\u2019re going to, we still have the open to buy.  We\u2019re still ready to take advantage of volatility yet where prudence at this point is not an unwanted asset so we\u2019re going to be very prudent as we think about that.", "Operator", "", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue.

We are pleased to report another strong quarter and I would like to just take a few minutes at this time to review highlights for the quarter, and then we will open the call up for your questions.", "Third quarter FFO, funds from operation was $1.61 per share, up 10.3% over the prior year, all of our property platforms continue to perform well, occupancy in the mall portfolio was 92.5% as compared to 92.7% in the year earlier period despite the fact that square footage lost to bankruptcy for the first nine months of 2008 totaled 435,000 square feet as compared to 53,000 square feet during the first nine months of 2007.", "Our premium outlet portfolio remains nearly fully leased at 98.8%, comparable sales in the mall portfolio was $493 per square foot, up four-tenths of 1% as compared to the year earlier period, sales have been affected by the weak US economy, premium outlet sales growth remains strong, increasing 4.2% to $520 per square foot driven by our centers with substantial international tourist exposure as well as the US consumer seeking value.", "Comparable property NOI was up 3.1% for the mall portfolio and 6.6% for the premium outlet portfolio for the nine months ended September, 30th. The releasing spread of our mall portfolio was $8.65 for the first nine months representing 23.6% increase. The releasing spread for our premium outlet portfolio was $13.02, representing a strong 49.4% increase.", "We recently completed significant redevelopments at Tacoma Mall in Tacoma, Washington University Park in Mishawaka, Indiana and started construction on our eight Premium Outlet center in Japan. In the last month, Nordstrom has open new stores at the Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis, Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh and Tacoma. This week, we will open the fully leased expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets, and next week, we will open Jersey Shore Premium Outlets, which is over 90% leased.", "We will continue to remain diligent in allocating capital only to those projects that meet our return requirements. In fact given the current economic conditions, we anticipate our capital spending will be down significantly in 2009. In the third quarter, SPG completed six financing that totaled $1.220 billion of proceeds with a weighted average term of six years and an average interest rate of 5.72%.", "During the quarter, we also unencumbered six assets that generate over $57 million of annual EBITDA and our unencumbered portfolio today generates annual EBITDA in excess of $1.7 billion and sales of approximately 500 per square foot.", "We have addressed all of our 2008 debt maturities; we are well-positioned financially given our significant cash position of over $950 million including our share joint-venture cash and our availability in our corporate credit facility of over $2.5 billion.", "Before I get to guidance and my concluding remarks, I would like to address two items out in the public domain, the first of which relates to traffic and occupancy. There are a number of firms that monitor and report shopper traffic and occupancy at US malls.", "These firms issue releases and are interviewed by national media sources purportedly as industry experts on the topic. I would like to go on record and state definitively that we do not report any data to these firms. I believe that several other owners of high quality retail real estate assets also do not participate. Therefore, I leave to it your judgment as to whether or not their data is representative of the industry and certainly not us.", "Additionally there has been a great deal of public speculation about possibility of our acquisition of General Growth Properties. While our policy is generally not to comment on specific rumors like this, I will tell you that in the current environment I can not envision a set of circumstances that would result in such a transaction.", "Now let me turn back to guidance and my concluding remarks. Based upon third quarter results, projected activity for the rest of the year and our view of current market conditions today we gave 2008 FFO guidance of $6.40 to $6.45 per share increasing the lower end of our previously provided range by $0.02.", "Our initial guidance for 2008 was $6.25 to $6.45 per share, and did not anticipate the second quarter 2008 debt extinguishment charge of $0.07 per share. I believe with the drastic change in the economy, we are probably one of the few real estate companies that have effectively increased our 2008 guidance.", "These are clearly challenging times, but I believe we will continue to be successful including generating positive NOI growth from our portfolio and FFO growth in 2009. We anticipate, obviously, a slower leasing environment and have worked diligently to execute leases for upcoming exploration. As a result, we are ahead of where we were at this point in time last year in leasing our upcoming year's explorations, we are aggressively managing our cost and our capital spend and we have a strong balance sheet.", "I remind you that we are more than a regional mall company with substantial income generated by our community center and premium outlet portfolios, both of which should offer benefits in a challenging economic environment as consumers continue to look for value.", "With that said, we are pleased with our results and we are now open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jay Haberman of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Hey, good morning, here with [Johan] as well. I guess, David, clearly the change in outlook in the credit markets, can you talk about sort of the 2009 outlook for debt maturities and what options remain available? I mean you did do a substantial amount of refinancing in the quarter and that's certainly positive news, but it sounds like you're keeping some powder dry here, you want to keep cash in the balance sheet as well as your line free and clear?", "David Simon", "That's accurate. We have $900 million of senior unsecured notes that come due next year as well as our share of secured debt around 900 million. We don't anticipate any concern about refinancing the secured debt. We're making progress. Obviously the capital markets currently are more or less shutdown. I think we've been anticipating for a year now that the world was about to change. We are well positioned to handle that, as evidenced by our credit facility as well as the amount of cash on our balance sheet.", "Steve Sterrett", "Hey Jay, this is Steve. I'd just add one comment on the secured debt that's coming due in 2009. It's property that average $500 a foot. Its property that even at pretty conservative cap rates are 50% loan-to-value, so, I think even in a relatively difficult market, we feel good about our ability to roll that over.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, sounds good. And you mentioned as well reducing sort of the CapEx for next year. Can you comment on specifically what percent decrease you expect and also, David, your comments with regard to a large competitor, I mean would you look at one-off acquisitions in terms of individual assets?", "David Simon", "Well, let me talk about capital spending. We anticipate, it's kind of a flexible number, because we continue to work very diligently. We have a lot of value to our portfolio. We feel that there are going to be a number of unique opportunities to do that in the upcoming years. I call kind of [flex off] and flex defense. Right now, we're in the flex defense.", "Our share of capital spending, we anticipate being just under $400 million next year in '09 that can certainly increase opportunistically if the world stabilizes, which I think it will in '09, but we're certainly planning that it won't. That's just my judgment.", "I went outside of our corporate policy on that commenting on M&A transactions, but I felt like given the size of the transaction, the importance of what's going on there. I felt like I had to answer it other than that, Jay. I really can't shed anymore light on that other than those statements. We've been really good storage of capital here. We will not do anything stupid. And we are very focused on continue to grow our company prudently. Beyond that, I don't want to comment other than those statements.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Sounds good, and then just last question, In terms of the NOI growth, you gave the year-to-date statistics. Obviously the third quarter result was a bit of a deceleration from the previous quarter. Was there anything in there specifically, whether it was higher bankruptcies you referenced?", "David Simon", "Jay, let me just focus on that. I would always look to the year-to-date number. I go back for instance in the second quarter of '07, the malls had 1.6% NOI growth and the quarterly numbers have a lot of variability to it. We still think very comfortably that in '08 we're going to grow the comp NOI of the mall portfolio consistent with the guidance we gave. The third quarter was a little bit lower than that, but what we see in the fourth quarter, we think we'll make it up, so we're within that 3% to 4% range.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Rick is there any comments on October sales, or any thoughts on the GAAP, the announcement to close stores.", "David Simon", "I'll just add Rick while Rick is gathering his thoughts. What GAAP is doing is not unusual and it's something that we've frankly have seen and been dealing with over the last couple of years.", "We don't have October sales. We get those anywhere from 20 days to 30 days in arrears, But anecdotally, we think the October sales are going to be tough. Rick now that you've gathered your thoughts.", "Rick Sokolov", "I think October sales are going to be tough. I will say to you that this environment from the credit side is certainly more unique by the terms of the give-and-take with our tenants. We've gone through this a number of times before. We're working through with our tenants and we are still proceeding with all of our leasing activities and that is continuing a pace.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Great, but it sounds like the spreads are still holding up which is good.", "Rick Sokolov", "There you are.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Lou Taylor of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning, guys. David, can you talk a little bit specifically about your January (inaudible) and philosophically, how do you plan to address those either through secured financing, just using cash, using a line? How do you specifically think if you are going to refinance those bonds?", "David Simon", "We are going to use our corporate facilities and/or our cash. We are assuming right now that the unsecured market is not going to be that attractive. So at this point, that's why we have husband or capital appropriately and obviously that's not an issue for us. We believe that there is lot of opportunities for us to access capital of the company, of our position, and our liquidity, but right now we are not anticipating that, we'll just use our cash that we have husband on the balance sheet.", "Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you. And then second question for Steve, Steve in terms of the JV share of FFO or contribution FFO this quarter. It's like kind of other income and other expense bounced around a bunch from Q2. Any major events or drivers there?", "Steve Sterrett", "Lou, there was jut one thing. We sold the residential component of the domain, which was a mall that we opened in Austin, Texas about 18 months ago. That was a 50-50 venture with a multi-family developer and our share of that gain was about $9 million.", "Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Banc of America. You may proceed", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Just following up on same-store sales growth, can you break that out by month during the quarter? I know that you said that October is not going to be great, but I am specifically curious about the [churn] in September?", "David Simon", "We don't do it by month, but September was worse. Basically we were up July and August and September was a tough month in terms of sales. We still ended up four-tenths of 1% but the important thing that we are not a retailer, so we don't live and die by monthly sales. September was a bad month and you saw the retailers but beyond that we do this on a quarterly. I think it's more important to do on a quarterly basis because in fact we are not a retailer and what happens in one month really doesn't have any bearing on us at all.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "And then I noticed in the regional mall portfolio, there was about a 2% decline in comp store sales. Would you say that type of a decline was fairly characteristic of the Class B, C malls in your portfolio in Q3?", "David Simon", "No, not really. I think you got to look at where the malls are and any new competition that comes to the market, nothing there that would cause us to be overly concerned.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "Okay. And then, regarding to development leasing in this environment. How much more difficult has it become over the last month to get a retailer to sign a lease on a new development project both in the US and internationally. And have you seen any tenants pulling out of projects.", "David Simon", "The fact is, we don't have much new development, we have the expansion of Domain under construction and we have Cincinnati Premium Outlet and we're open in New Jersey. And we have the options of starting some new stuff next year, but that's it.", "So we don't have new development really undergoing this year. I will say though there are handful of retailers that have cut to open to buy a handful of retailers that are essentially waiting to decide how much they're going to spend next year in terms of CapEx, kind of waiting to see what happens for the next three to four months. Some plans are on hold. And frankly, we anticipated. That's why we're been pretty prudent on new development. But, Rick, you can add to that.", "Rick Sokolov", "And the only other thing I will tell you at Domain, we are done with our anchor down. We are probably about 65% leased as we sit here today for an opening in November of '09. So, what we're finding is that on the good opportunities, people are still interested and happily we do not have a lot of inventory out there right now, but we need to deal with it's new.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "Is it fair to say that redevelopment leasing has been already there?", "David Simon", "Well, it is. But we have been successful on our new development as well. So for us, right now even thought we've had some volatility with certain retailers on a few stores here and there. We feel that we're executing both, our redevelopment and our development pipeline according to plan.", "Now, we expect '09 for new store openings to be at a reduce level, that's why we're been a little bit cautious, we're listening to our clients. We're not forcing the issue. We certainly could in some cases, but we are choosing not to. But we\u2019re still seeing success and we're accomplishing, both through our redevelopment and development efforts.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "Okay. And then and just last.", "David Simon", "As evidence, Rick and I were in Pittsburgh, I don't know it was last week, and what we did, I was in Boston the week before with Burlington, and what we've done there, so we are getting the job done.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "On your lease explorations in 2009, I know you said you are ahead of last year, but how much of that is already addressed today and what should we be looking for in terms of kind of releasing spreads versus '08 levels?", "Rick Sokolov", "Well, just to give you a sense of the activity that we've had in the mall portfolio. Year-to-date this is all fully executed. We have 6,900,000 square feet of leases that had been fully executed in '08. That includes new deals, relocations, expansions and renewals and that' 2,451 deals through September 30.", "We have that for signature. Now these are in process, but once they get to a certain point in our system, we have a relatively high confidence that they are going to be executed an additional 4,230,000 square feet of space representing another 1,336 leases.", "So as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we have been very focused on dealing with our tenants on a much broader outlook. In terms of years, we are substantially ahead, probably 10% to 15% as we sit here today.", "On '09 renewals, where we were as against '08 and we are now substantially into renewals that are coming up in the first quarter of '10. And that was an increased focus on us. We instituted it back in '06 and it's standing in very good stead with us, so to-date our spreads are holding up as we reported. And certainly, we are going to continue to make sure we price our space appropriately.", "Christy McElroy - Banc of America", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Rick Sokolov", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Mark Biffert of Oppenheimer & Company. You may proceed.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer & Company", "Good morning. David, my first question is regarding the redevelopment, development pipeline. When you look out to '09, what are you guys raising your hurdle rates to when you assess new projects?", "David Simon", "Yeah. That's a good question. Clearly, our cost of capital has increased reasonably, right? Not more than marginally, so now we do think that the volatility associated with it, and its rapid rise is not a stabilized number, so we are trying to get a handle on that.", "But I think from new development standpoint, thankfully the new development focus continues to be with the Chelsea product. The returns continue to be probably in the 12% to 14% range conservatively underwritten. That will continue to motivate us to build assuming we can still achieve those.", "And the redevelopment is a little bit lower than that. We still are looking for double-digits. I think we can justify that given also what it does to the other parts of that asset and also how it positions it in the marketplace, but I would tell you that new development would be north of 12% to 14%. And redevelopment would clearly we would be looking try around 10.", "And if the current volatility and rapid rise in our cost to capital and the industry's stabilizes at that level then we are going to have to reassess, but my guess is, we are dealing with the temporary phenomenon right now. ", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer & Company", "And how temporary in your view do you think that will be?", "David Simon", "Well, I wish I knew. I really don't. But I think historically, our cost to capital has been a lot lower than that, and I think it will trend toward the mean. I may not reach where we were in the 2007 period, but I do think it will revert back to the main and those kind of investments will add to our net asset value and the value of our firm overall.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. And then, Rick, if you can talk a little bit about the pent up demand you might have in any of your malls in terms of the replacement tenants for those that are closing stores like Boscov\u2019s and inline retailers.", "Rick Sokolov", "I think we demonstrated over the years that we have been very successful in replacing those type of tenants. And an important thing to point out with the Boscov's stores that are closing, those are currently owned by others.", "All the Mervyn's stores that are closing are owned by others, so we are working with those owners in order to coordinate activities. We have been actively solicitating interest and we have identified a number of users and it's a combination of working with the people that owned those stores and identifying users to come up with the way to go.", "There are still boxes that are interested in taking these locations. But frankly as you saw with our Macy stores, a lot of the opportunity comes from just adding additional small shops and in the properties that are better properties that's the significant advantage for us, because we want additional small shops space to take advantage of the demand.", "In the better properties, demand is unabated. There are still people that are interested in coming into the better properties. And if we're going to obtain these boxes back, it gives an opportunity to do that.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of FBR. You may proceed.", "Paul Morgan - FBR", "Good morning.", "David Simon", "Hi.", "Paul Morgan - FBR", "If I just stick on that point for second, does that suggest that this is one area where you still do have an apatite for investment in buying back some of these boxes like you did with Federated May, or is there less of interest than there was than given the market bit now?", "David Simon", "No. look I think there is. I think the fact is though they are the people that bought those or refinanced those boxes, bottom in a robust market. And they have to understand that values associated with those boxes are different in our view than their view. So the answer is, yeah, we're interested in buying them. It's probably not if the prices they have either on the books or what they would like to get. And we'll see how it shakes out.", "Paul Morgan - FBR", "Okay. There have been a lot of retailers putting out various releases and comments about aggressively renegotiating their rents and requesting relief and various things like that. Could you just give your comment about when you see those? What's going on right now and for example, are you giving the type of relief of going to percentage a only percentage rent only type structures or what your stance is in those negotiations?", "David Simon", "Sure, it's safe to say that this is we have dealt with rent relief and rent relief quests basically since I've been here since 1990, right? So that's about 18 plus years. And it really is very retailer specific. And ultimately the judgment call mostly comes in if we think that the tenant is about to file Chapter 11 and whether we can help offset that through some combination of rent relief or negotiated store closings.", "And we'll look at it. We have a basically an unbelievable staff that can assess viability and what we might get in Chapter 11, re-org versus the prospects of them going forward if we grant them rent relief. Lot of that times, it's an industry issue. So if we are doing it, we'll find out what the other developers are doing and more or less come up with a consistent format.", "So that really is retailer specific. If it's an existing lease and if it's a healthy retailer, we really won't entertain rent relief. And the only other item is if it's at the expiration of a lease and that's a typical depending on the market value of the space, what the tenant brings and so on. And I will tell you that there is anecdotally some increase in rent relief, but our policy and procedures in how we deal with that hasn't changed in this market and I will say that I've been doing this for awhile not as long as Rick, but I will tell you that our approach to this has not changed and what we've seen really isn't anything that causes us by any stretch of the imagination alarm.", "I mean, this is consistent with a down economic cycle and one that we know how to navigate through.", "Rick Sokolov", "I would only add two things. One, we have made it [incumbent] upon our leasing agents to look out a year to identify those tenants that David just mentioned that are coming to an end of the lease term with lower than appropriate productivity and we want to make sure that we have already started leasing their space to another tenant, which will enable us to hopefully maximize our ability to either renew that tenant with better rent or just say, thanks, we appreciate that you have to leave, good bye because we have a replacement tenant at market rate.", "And the only other thing I would say and this is to David's point that we are not a retailer. We are very focused on the credit of our tenants and we have an entire department here that is constantly assessing that credit and [happily] in this cycle the credit of the tenants that we are doing business with happens to be substantially firmer than it was in previous downturns, say in 80 and in 90. So you have many less people walking in and saying I'm out of business, now let's talk.", "David Simon", "And the only other thing I would add to that, Paul, is obviously our position in the industry, our quality portfolio, our Premium Outlets portfolio allows us to be best positioned to negotiate with the retailer the best possible outcome for us and for the retailer. So we have tools available to us that are somewhat distinctive.", "Paul Morgan - FBR", "", "Thanks. My last question on the rent spreads, there's a big healthy spread between where your expiring rents show up on your lease schedule versus the rate at which you've signed leases so far this year. Is there any reason that we might be cautious in interpreting that as just a very healthy cushion? Is there some vulnerability? I don't want to just all of a sudden assume that you are going to get the same spreads or even assume that the spreads will be positive, but is there anything that we should think about in terms of the size of that spread now and where you think it will come out next year given what retailers are saying?", "Steve Sterrett", "Paul, this is Steve. The mix of leases that are expiring does change from year-to-year, so looking at for example the leases that we signed in '08 and trying to compare them to '09 expirations is a bit of (inaudible), but what I would tell you is that you can go back and look at five years of history in our K. and our rollover spreads in the mall business has been pretty consistently between 15% and 25% and I think we would expect that same range of outcomes in 2009. ", "Paul Morgan - FBR", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dimler of UBS. You may proceed.", "Michael Dimler - UBS", "Hi, good morning, this question is for Steve. Just wanted to try to get a more numerical sense of what's going on at the mortgage level with respect to your JVs. Compared to a year ago, maybe two years ago, what kind of a cap rate are the lenders putting on the properties now versus then? And what are you seeing in terms of the bids on the rates?", "Steve Sterrett", "The market is obviously much different than it was a year ago. The cap rate specifically is going to be very dependent upon the quality of the asset, but I think it's fair to say that cap rates are higher. Loan-to-values are lower and spreads are wider and we've clearly seen all three of those moves in that direction over the course of the last six to 12 months.", "David Simon", "If you look at our historical [finance] policy, Michael, we have never been looking for that last marginal cost. So even though cap rates have moved up, say 9% to 9%, as we run through our maturity schedule on secured assets, it will be something abnormal for us not to be able to refinance our existing secured debt.", "We may have a couple of once that even in today's environment that may require some level of capital contribution in terms of dealing with the amount of new mortgage. We have never been the next proceeds guy on secured financing. And remember we also have partners in these and where you see most of the secured financing is with our JV partners.", "So to the extent that that does happen, our partners are going to have to come over the capital contribution, but I will tell you and underline that we don't anticipate other than a couple of mortgages here and there, assuming the world stabilizes even in the higher cap rates.", "In addition, the most important fact that I can tell you is that we have $1.7 billion of EBITDA that's unencumbered. So whatever cap rate you want to put on that, I think I made it my statement $500 a foot in sales. That gives you a sense of the fire power that we have to deal in today's volatile financial markets.", "Michael Dimler - UBS", "I just want to clarify; you said that 9% is not out of the question in terms of cap rate on some of these assets.", "David Simon", "Yes.", "Michael Dimler - UBS", "Okay. As a follow up, I'm curious as to there is a lot of noise out there, the life insurance companies might be pulling back on direct real estate investments and lending. I was wondering if you could just sort through like who's really out there in the market right now and who's pulling back?", "David Simon", "I think it's safe to say and that's why '08 has done for us, a lot of life insurance companies that are on hold for the rest of this year. We've been told by them they are anxious to replenish their investment next year. They are on the side lines. That's fine for us. It doesn't matter because we are done, but there are a number of life insurance companies that aren't making commitments for the rest of the year, no big deal. We anticipate them coming back into the market. It would be awkward for us to go through and list them other than we've been a wonderful borrower from life insurance companies.", "Sponsorship is more and more important as they go through credit committees. They are going to want to put dollars out. We have tended to perform for them. So we think when things normalize or stabilize in '09 that we will be able to tap into that market. As we did in the third quarter we closed, we closed a life insurance company deal at the end of the third quarter.", "Michael Dimler - UBS", "Okay, good color. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi. You may proceed. ", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Thank you, [Quinton] is with me as well. David, just going back to your comments on GGP, you are very specific to say that you can't envision a set of circumstances that would result in an acquisition of the entire company. What are those circumstances that led you to say that?", "David Simon", "Well, Michael, we are important stewards of capital here. We will look at any and all transactions. But we are also realist about capital markets, return expectations and so on. And that's kind of led us to the conclusion that where we are today.", "Beyond that, I mean it's awkward for me, I would rather not comment more than what I've done. There's been lots of public speculation so we felt it was important to address it. But obviously the size of the transaction is probably the biggest reason. And where capital markets exist today for size, we are realist, so that I think that's important to communicate to the market given the speculation out there.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "And I guess at the same time based on your relationship and your capital position if you are able to de-risk the transaction some how by bringing in partners, by craving up the portfolio and getting it at the right price and working with the lenders is not off the table. I mean this is just saying look and I am not me alone is going to do it in the current state.", "David Simon", "Beyond what I said I can\u2019t elaborate, but I just want to reinforce the fact that in all of our transaction that we've done, we\u2019ve done appropriate I think and hind side I think the market can attach to that. The last thing we want to do is absolutely make a mistake or an undue risk in today's environment and that's where we stand.", "Jeff Quinton - Citi", "It's [Jeff Quinton] here. You commented that same-store NOI and FFO growth would both be positive next year. Can you just comment on the drivers behind that assumption?", "David Simon", "Well, again I mean just so everybody knows we have a consistent cycle on how we budget at the company. We do that basically unfortunately in the month of November, so we are actually we\u2019ve been had a little bit longer so we\u2019ve been doing that.", "Then we announce our growth kind at the end of, I am sorry, at the beginning of '09 somewhere near our earnings, first quarter earnings our year end earnings call. We are going through the same process, but obviously we know what we\u2019ve developed, we know what we redeveloped.", "We have preliminary budgets that were going through from all of our various platforms and we can put it in the blender and get a sense of where things are headed. And that's what gives us confidence to state that. The exact ranges and numbers well communicate that to the marketplace, I also want people that get some sense of comfort that even in today's world, we feel like we'll produced positive NOI growth. And we'll do that through leasing, cost containment and than what's coming in the pipeline. So, I think that's the important statement that I wanted to convey the people.", "Jeff Quinton - Citi", "Okay. And just in license through liberty, you've increased your stake and there is obviously a lot of rumors out there at the movement. Are you able to make a comment on that at all?", "David Simon", "No. Other than, we continue to own the stock. We believe the stock we own is under the intrusive value of the company even at the world adjust in terms of what the cap rates are. And beyond that, we don't have any additional comment.", "Jeff Quinton - Citi", "Where is your stake currently?", "David Simon", "It is what --", "Rick Sokolov", "Same as we disclose at the end of the quarter, Michael.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Think you haven't bought any more in the market?", "Rick Sokolov", "In the UK, you have to disclose additional increments of over 1%, so it's safe to say that we have not increased the stake beyond the 5% or else we had to disclose.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "And then I guess when you're talking in terms of same-store growth for next year, I guess it wrapped up in that is not a huge fall off in unexpected closures on the retail front, occupancy declines that you just are really out of your control.", "David Simon", "Well, look, we are certainly budgeting what we know in these numbers. And we are certainly being conservative, but as much as we would like to say I mean there are things out of our control, that's correct.", "Biggest of which is that, but the biggest one also is to some extent percent sales and it doesn't, it's not a huge number, but I mean it's obviously hard for to us predict where sales for a particular retailers are going to be in '09.", "So, sure, there is some volatility. That's why we give a range and that's why we will treat that the same way we've treated our earnings guidance in addition. The good news is I think I've had Shelly look at this thing. I think, we've gotten really good at this. I think if Shelly knows these numbers, I mean I've looked at the last 20 quarters, I think we've beat 17 or whatever it is that once, twice. It's really good performance. We would hope to be able to continue to do that next year.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Just one last one. On the international Premium Outlets developments, it looks like two projects have dropped off the list, one in Italy and one in China. Can you just comment on what has happened?", "David Simon", "Yeah. I'll take EMEA cull for the team even though it wasn't my typo. We accidentally dropped off the deal in Sicily. It's not a Premium Outlets it's actually hypermarket anchored mall in Catania. That is still all systems go, it's under construction. We just had a typo. Don't lose confidence in the other data. It happened and Steve Sterrett, turning into our China expert with a little guidance for me, we have put that in kind of a holding pattern, waiting for just a little bit more data from some of our existing four centers there. We may be pushing that back or we may be putting that on permanent hold. So at this point, we anticipate putting that on hold for the time being.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of UBS. You may proceed.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "Good morning.", "David Simon", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "Is there any way you could quantify some of the things that could impact same-store NOI in '09? And you talked about the pressure retailers are putting on renegotiating deals, some of the other things that we could see?", "David Simon", "Well, I think it's the same metrics that affect us every year. I don't think it's any different '09 versus what's transpired historically. It's lease up, it's occupancy, it's sales growth, it's rent spreads and then it's what we can do on the cost side. So I mean all of the same fundamentals apply even in the more difficult retail environment that exists.", "As I said, we still feel pretty good at the moment where we stand today that we are going to generate positive NOI growth out of both the material parts of our business being the mall business and the outlet business.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "And you talk about leasing progress for '09? I'm not sure if you said it what percent you've completed so far?", "David Simon", "We are ahead of '09, as we sit here today we are probably about 70% through our '09 renewals, which is an advance of where we were at this time last year for going into '08 as we sat here on our third quarter call in '07.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "Can you talk about the releasing spreads you've gotten so far on that 70%?", "David Simon", "Well, as we said earlier, the spreads as demonstrated in this quarter are holding up. We just have to get the leases. We've already fully executed a substantial number this year and we hope to have more and the spreads are holding up.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "Okay. And did you provide an update on King of Prussia?", "David Simon", "No.", "Steve Sterrett", "No.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "No update?", "David Simon", "We haven't updated it as far as I know.", "Jeff Spector - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thanks", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Green Street Advisors. You may proceed.", "Ben Yang - Green Street Advisors", "Hi, good morning. David in the past, you've talked about your expectation that the company might take advantage of certain distressed real estate opportunities and not necessarily pertaining to GGP, given what's happening in the retail and credit markets yet, it sounds like you are clearly concerned about the availability of credit as well as your own capital needs, probably a few years from now.", "So in light of that, how do you balance the desire to pursue attractive real estate opportunities versus maintaining a healthy balance sheet?", "David Simon", "Well, I mean that's what a CEO does. So, let me just say this, I'm not worried. I just want to underline what you said, which is, I have no worries at all about our ability to deal with what we have to deal with here. So, there was a phrase in your question that suggested that we might have a worry about what our capital needs are here and how we are going to deal with it. I want to underline this strongly, I have no worries about our ability to deal and meet with our capital needs here. I love opportunities. I think we've been opportunistic historically. I think in this environment, we will be able to do that, Ben.", "On the other hand, we've got to be thoughtful on how we do that and the world is a little bit unstable and I think we are just being extremely cautious, which is what I think appropriate to do given the environment. Now, my instinct is to be aggressive and opportunistic and I think we will continue to find those opportunities, but we've got to balance that with caution in this market. We are not nervous. We are all steam-ahead. We are doing pretty much what we want to do, but we are just adding a little more caution to our approach.", "Ben Yang - Green Street Advisors", "Is it premature to start thinking about your maturities in say 2010 and 2011?", "David Simon", "No, not at all, and obviously 2010 we have our secured debt, we have got a fantastic group of assets coming due including Forum Shops, Copley, Westchester. If you look at all of those in the amount of outstanding all those I think you'll see that those are under levered and again I just reinforce, it's never too early to plan for the future. That's what we're all about. We don't see any issue there.", "Ben Yang - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. You may proceed.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Hi, David, earlier when you were talking about lenders and underwriting, you said some of the weaker assets, you think the lenders would use maybe a [nine cap]. When you look at the opposite end of the spectrum for your strongest assets, where do you think, lenders are underwriting those today and do you think they are appropriate?", "David Simon", "I think everybody is being cautious right now. So, they are clearly under that. The debt service coverage is higher than it was. I thought I stressed, but let me stress again, our model has never been the max leverage on individual assets. So even with today's more stringent underwriting requirements, the vast majority of the mortgages that we will refinance in the upcoming years, we don't see any issue with refinancing the existing indebtedness.", "In addition, you look at our corporate cash, you look at our corporate facilities and then you couple that with $1.7 billion of unencumbered EBITDA, which is unprecedented in the real estate industry. So, these are things that we are obviously focused on, but the strict underwriting requirements will not have an impact on us other than on the margin.", "Steve Sterrett", "Mike, this is Steve, just to add one comment; our financing model isn't dependent upon the ability for us to rollover mortgage debt and generate excess proceeds? In an environment where we can do that and it makes sense cost wise, we will do that, but our business model doesn't depend on that. So as David said if we are in a scenario for '09, 2010, what have you, all we are doing is basically rolling over existing debt, That's fine because we've got other avenues of capital like the bond market, like free cash flow, like our unencumbered EBITDA to draw.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Understood, but when you're looking at where others are pegging the value of the stronger assets on the lending community, are they using somewhere in the neighborhood of a seven? Are they in the sevens? Is it higher than that or lower than that?", "David Simon", "Again, it depends on the asset. It would be in that range.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning, guys. Rick, do you have the list or thoughts on retailers that are opening stores in 2008, 2009? I guess 2009, really, or has that sort of shrunk to irrelevant at this point?", "Rick Sokolov", "In the specialty area, we are continuing to do business with the retailers that we have done business with historically. We've got significant openings schedule in '09, Coach, Arrows PLS+T, Forever 21, Limited Brands, Express, [Suffora], Buckle, [Twin], Wet Seal, and all of those are things that have been reconfirmed in the last few weeks. So I think David made the point that our retailers becoming more cautious. Certainly.", "Are they evaluating how much incremental open-to-buy they are going to have in '09? Yes. Is it going to be like May of '07 when retailers would come in and say, I want to open 20 new stores that have in my budget? Probably not, but where they've had budgets they are maintaining the budgets and they are continuing to open stores.", "David Simon", "I'd just underline another important point to that, Rich, is two things, one is there is no new development. so the open-to-buys that exist will reside in existing centers, which is a really important point for us in that what's happened with the economy and capital, basically eliminates new development and I mentioned this last quarter, quarter before, it could be as long as a decade of new development in a material sense. There will always be a few deals here or there.", "Additionally the retailers are as focused on sponsorship and who they do business with as lenders as shareholders and as other constituencies and again that reinforces where we are in the industry.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. All right. Good, thank you, David. And then on the debt side, Steve, you guys were talking about where you stand with insurance companies. What's your feel for what the bank guys are saying? I realize you don't necessarily have to give mortgages, but when you talk to these guys, I'm sure you do the loan officers in particular, do you sense any improvement in their tone or are they just sort of dead in the water at this point?", "Steve Sterrett", "I think it's a little earlier to sense an improvement, Rich. Don't forget that the financial institutions have gone through a dramatic re-pricing of their own cost of capital. And I think they are still [ferreting] out what their business model looks likes. They are in the business of lending money, but I think it's a bit early yet to say that they are back active in the market. We expect that to happen. It may not be until the back half of 2009, but there is very little activity in that market right now.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Great.", "David Simon", "I hate to say it, Rich. But again sponsorship and quality of assets and the team is an extremely important criteria that they will do, and I mean I think they want to go with the proven player.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then the last thing, guys, is same sort of thing on the private equity side. Is there anybody out there who has any interest in working with you to find again GGP-type things aside, just distressed opportunities, or is that sort of capital interested at this point, or are they sitting on the side lines?", "David Simon", "I would tell you that there is capital for those kind of investments. And again I hate to, I mean I think that they would love to align themselves with someone like us. The good news is we've again been able to kind of avoid a mine field in a sense.", "I mean we looked at the fund business. We chose not to do it after thoughtful consideration. I think given where that business is in hindsight it was the right decision to make. But on the other hand we've been very successful in our mills deal and align ourselves with opportunistic capital.", "Rich, there's no doubt in my mind that that kind of capital is available for us depending upon the situation.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wachovia. You may proceed.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia", "Good morning, guys. This might be for Steve. But I think, David, you mentioned in your comments about 2009 about cost containment as one opportunity. Are those costs that can be trimmed a way today or are you speaking more about at the margin in terms of trimming expenses?", "David Simon", "Well, look we've provided ourselves on always being reasonably run, so it's a little bit of both. It's all on the margin given the size of our company, but look, we are out to be as profitable as we can. So there are things that we can do and different environments. The good news at the property level, again, is if we are able to generate the savings at the property level that that adds to our bottom line given the fixed cam scenario.", "Obviously inflation is out of the system, which is really good. That's going to help on utilities. I think that's going to help on real estate taxes in terms of assessments. You can go down the road. We were looking a few months ago at a tougher economic environment, higher utility costs and the like and now we've got a tough economic environment, but we are seeing savings on the cost side.", "So we are going to pull as many levers as we can to be as profitable as we can. But yet we are not, this is a company that's been reasonably run. We can always be better. So I don't think it's going to be a dramatic savings in totality.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia", "And just a question concerning occupancy given what you're hearing from retailers, can you give us an update on when you think industry occupancy might hit a bottom in the future, what that bottom looks like versus say today or occupancy this year?", "And maybe and beyond that, when you think that turns a corner? I could ask you questions all day long, I guess I'm trying to figure out variability between market size and mall productivity at this point.", "David Simon", "That's really hard one. I do think it will bottom some time in '09. But that's a crystal ball thing and the important point here is even with the retailer restructurings that exist, the slower sales, somewhat reduced open-to-buys. We still think we are going to generate positive NOI growth and that's the important metric to look at.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia", "Just a last question or two for Rick if I could. How is demand looking for your 2008 seasonal business around in-line and kiosk temporary tenants, and I know it's early, but do your gift cards sales pace at this point provide any indication for holiday sales?", "Rick Sokolov", "Well, let me address the former first. We are on track for our inline business and we really don't have any indications that that is going to setback. And in terms of the gift cards, the vast significant percentage of that business is done in the fourth quarter and so it's really not a leading indicator as we sit here today.", "And but on the seasonal business, we still have the demand and there is still the entrepreneurs that want to take advantage of that and we've bench more focused now interestingly I think another enhancement is we are now really looking at those tenants as a source of incremental permanent tenants and we've been able to convert a number of the tenants that started in our portfolio as temporary tenants in carts into very successful, full inline tenants with good unique local businesses, so that's an important source of leads for us as well as just revenue.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia", "Last question concerns the Nordstrom in Boston. I know you don't have a time for a case study here, but it opened in Burlington in recent past and I think liberty tree opens this week. What's the new and renewal leasing discussions has been like around these deals and how is that shaping up for south shore?", "Rick Sokolov", "Well, I'd just say if you go, liberty tree as a Nordstrom rack so that's a different animal, it's not a full (inaudible). I will tell you if you look at Burlington and the lease up, Nordstrom is a wonderful retailer and they add a lot to the mall environment. And they bring, they allow us in a lot of cases to execute an upgraded dependent mix, which is what we did at Burlington in their wing. And even though the timing is not great it's a great long-term situation for us.", "Rick Sokolov", "David alluded to this earlier but an interesting study is Ross Park where we added Nordstrom in Lou of a Macy's and with the announcement of Nordstrom we got a LL Bean and a Tiffany Louis Vuitton and Michael Kors and a Juicy Couture, so we have substantially transformed Ross Park Mall into the unambiguous place to shop in a trade area over 1.5 million people and that's what we do here.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "David Simon", "And your next question comes from the line of James Ellman of Seacliff. You may proceed.", "James Ellman - Seacliff", "Yes, thank you. Could you give us a little bit of outlook on how your business would have the ability to show flexibility or what happens to your business? If some of the prognostications of same-store sales for this holiday season being down 10% to 15% due to loss of consumer credit as well as slowing economy?", "David Simon", "Again, not a lot of our earnings is tied directly to sales. Most vast majority in the mall portfolio is tied to fixed rent. And then the overage, the part that's tied to sales, it's a combination of sales throughout the whole year. And what we've noticed is that, if some people go out of overage rent, others go in, it is a pretty static environment.", "The outlet business we have more of the anchors are tied is a direct percent of sales, but, we think the outlet business is somewhat countercyclical in that consumer and certainly with gas, there was a lot of questions on gas prices and how that may affect the outlet. We actually think the consumer may look for more value, and so maybe, there is better sales despite the environment. We don't know. We'll find out.", "So the long story short is, it's a couple of cents here and there, out of 640 to 645, so in my view it's somewhat immaterial. I let you judge whether that's material or not, but it's not going to make a break us one way or another.", "James Ellman - Seacliff", "I understand the percentage rent is a relatively small size in your revenue statement, but if we had a 10% to 15%, a significant drop in holiday sales, I imagine that would put many of your tenants to the wall. How do you deal with that? How do you react to that?", "Steve Sterrett", "", "Well, again, I think as Rick said if you look at the vast majority of tenants that we are doing business with, they are well capitalized. And so it would depend on the tenant and so on in terms of reaction to it.", "David Simon", "I would also make the point that the tenants have not been operating their business in a vacuum and they've been substantially reducing their inventory, reducing their in-store employees because they're running their businesses for bottom-line EBITDA as well. So while they care, that's another thing going on.", "James Ellman - Seacliff", "So, last question would be if they have been cutting back significantly, is there a chance that you're going to have significant empty shells this holiday season?", "David Simon", "No, no.", "James Ellman - Seacliff", "Very good. Thanks for the time.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fred Taylor of MJX Asset Management. You may proceed.", "Fred Taylor - MJX Asset Management", "At this point the question I had, the rollover of secured debt was probably beaten to death, but let me ask this slightly different angle. Would you refinance maturing unsecured debt with secured debt thus changing the mix?", "David Simon", "Not at this point.", "Fred Taylor - MJX Asset Management", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi. You may proceed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "I just had a follow up on Las Vegas and what you're seeing in Forum Shops and trends and sort of how you're looking at the market overall?", "David Simon", "", "Well, look Forum Shops continues to be the leader in Vegas. Clearly, I think we said this in our first quarter call, I believe that we had seen softness in Las Vegas. It continues to be that way. There is no drop in sales that we saw after the year continues to be that kind of drop, in other words, the drop percentage not increasing, it's kind of at that same level that we saw the 5% to 10% drop, but even with that said, its still the number one in Vegas, but Las Vegas obviously has had its issues.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "I guess in this sort of environment, would you be less willing to put more capital to work in Vegas?", "David Simon", "Do you have something specific in mind, Michael?", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "I'm not a broker. So I'm not hocking anything.", "David Simon", "I think we can underwrite Las Vegas reasonably well given our knowledge of it. And beyond that obviously we are pleased with the Forum Shops, but I think we have to take into account the fact that Las Vegas economy is not doing so well right now.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I am showing that you have no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, I would like to turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay. Thank you for participating. I'm sure, we will see a number of you at NAREIT, so take care.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's call, Miss Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed. ", "Shelly Doran", "Good morning and welcome to the Simon Property Group fourth quarter and year-end 2008 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risk and uncertainties.", "Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Acknowledging the fact that this call maybe webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that today\u2019s call includes time-sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of today's date, January 30, 2009.", "The company's supplemental information package was filed earlier today as a Form 8-K. The filing is available via mail or e-mail and it is posted on the Simon website in the Investor Relation section under Financial Information Quarterly Supplemental Packages.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon ", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in our release this morning our fourth quarter performance was strong. We reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share, up 5.7% over the prior year. For the full year FFO was $6.42 per share representing growth of 8.8%. I remind you that our initial guidance for 2008 was $6.25 to $6.45 so we performed at the top end of that range despite the unprecedented turmoil in the economy and capital markets. ", "FFO for the quarter included an impairment charge of $0.07 per share for costs related to certain predevelopment projects that we are no longer pursuing and the write-down of one operating asset to its estimated net realizable value. Also included in FFO for the year was the extinguishment charge of $0.07 per share incurred in connection with the redemption of $200 million of moppers notes in the second quarter of 2008.", "Excluding these charges full year 2008 FFO per share would have been $0.14 higher or another 2.4% of growth. Occupancy in the mall portfolio was 92.4% at year-end as it compared to 93.5% last year. In spite of the challenging conditions of 2008 mall occupancy is still very much in line with our recent historical results. ", "Square footage lost to bankruptcy in 2008 in our mall portfolio totaled 508,000 square feet as compared to only 61,000 square feet in 2007. During December we experienced some lost occupancy as a result of certain liquidations and bankruptcy lease rejections. ", "During the year occupancy was also negatively impacted by approximately 320,000 square feet of negotiated early store closings and temporary occupancy reductions also occurred at several properties which were under renovation or redevelopment. ", "Despite all of that we came in at an occupancy that is consistent with over the last few years of our results. Our premium outlet portfolio remains nearly fully leased at 98.9% and the Mills platform gained 40 basis points to 94.5%. ", "Premium outlet center retail sales growth remained good, increasing 1.8% to $513 per square foot and sales in the Mills portfolio was flat at $372 a foot, both as a result of the consumer continuing to seek value in this current economic climate. ", "Comparable retail sales in our mall portfolio were $470 per square foot down 4.3% as compared to the year earlier period. You will recall that our regional mall sales at September 30 were relatively flat, actually they were up 40 basis points. The fourth quarter decline we experienced was the direct result of the unprecedented weak 2008 holiday season experienced across the US and in particular the performance of luxury and higher end retailers. ", "Even with weak fourth quarter sales please keep in mind that our [2000] sales are in fact in line with our 2006 year-end levels. The 2008 comparable property NOI for the mall portfolio increased 1%. Comparable NOI growth was impacted by the decline in overage rent due to the weak fourth quarter retail sales as well as higher then normal bad debt expense as a result of tenant bankruptcies.", "Comparable property NOI for the premium outlet portfolio increased 7.7% in 2008. The releasing spread for our mall portfolio was $8.02 for the year representing a 21.3% increase and again speaking to the fact that our releases, our expiring leases are still below market and the releasing spread for the premium outlet portfolio was $12.48 representing a strong 48.8% increase, again showing that our expiring leases there are below market. ", "During the fourth quarter we successfully opened two new developments, Jersey Shore premium outlets, and Sendai premium outlets in Japan. Both centers opened well leased and projected first year returns are 11%. ", "Significant redevelopment projects were completed and opened at North Shore Mall in Boston, Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh, Tacoma Mall and Orlando premium outlets. In the US construction continues only on two new projects, Cincinnati premium outlets and the second phase of Domain in Austin, Texas and two significant redevelopment projects. ", "Net of construction loans already in place our domestic development capital expenditures are expected to approximate $250 million to $275 million in 2009, less then one-third of the 2008 spend and at this point our 2010 spending is projected to be less then $50 million. ", "Our share of 2009 international development capital expenditures is expected to approximate $120 million. The vast majority of these expenditures will self-funded by joint venture resources and will require little or no equity from Simon Property Group.", "Currently we do not expect to begin construction on any additional new projects or major redevelopments in 2009.", "In the fourth quarter we completed seven new asset financings that raised $584 million of proceeds. Our share was $313 million with a weighted average term of 5.7 years and average interest rate of 5.9% on the fixed rate financings and a rate at year-end of 2.4% on the floating rate loans. ", "For all of 2008 Simon completed 21 new secured financings generating $3.2 billion of proceeds, our share being $2.2 billion with a weighted average term of 5.2 years and 5.4% on the fixed rate financings.", "In addition we issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured bonds in May of 2008. As of December year-end we had approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand including our share of joint venture cash and our availability on our corporate credit facility of $2.4 billion. ", "In addition our unencumbered portfolio generates EBITDA in excess of $1.7 billion and retail sales at those centers are approximately $500 per foot allowing for a tremendous amount of room under all of our bank and bond covenants. ", "We recently announced two senior management changes within the organization, both the result of retirements. John Klein has been promoted and will oversee the premium outlet portfolios president of Chelsea. John\u2019s career spans 23 years in the retail real estate industry and has been with Chelsea since 1995. Mike Clark continues to oversee the Chelsea international activities.", "Greg Goodman has been promoted President of the Mills platform. In his capacity Greg will assume direct oversight of the leasing development property management marketing functions of the Mills asset base and Greg began his career in 1985 and joined the Mills in 1994. ", "I believe it is a testament to the depth of our company\u2019s management team that we\u2019re able to promote from within the organization to field these two key management positions. ", "Let me turn to the dividend and then the guidance. First of all as you all know our balance sheet strategy has been a conservative one and we believe that we should be especially prudent in liability management and the allocation of our capital given today\u2019s economy and uncertain capital markets. ", "Our projected 2009 taxable income is $3.30 per share and we expect to maintain our dividend at the $3.60 per share throughout the 2009 level given our taxable income. Therefore after much thought and deliberation our Board decided to adjust the composition of the dividend to be 90% in common stock and 10% in cash.", "If adopted for all of 2009 this change in composition would result in the retention of over $925 million of cash. Needless to say we have a history of strong balance sheet management and appropriate capital allocation and our past accomplishment in this area should give confidence to our stockholder and all of the financial community that we have made the appropriate decision. ", "Our current liquidity as I mentioned before is approximately $3.5 billion. By paying our dividends 90% in stock and 10% in cash we increase our estimated free cash flow for all of 2009 after debt service dividends distributions and ongoing capital expenditures to approximately $1.5 billion fortifying our company and maintaining our goal of being one of the beacons of this industry. ", "This decision is not made in response to the current retail environment but a means of being conservative with our capital. We intend to evaluate this decision each quarter and we have also reserved the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash if conditions warrant.", "Today we gave 2009 FFO guidance of $6.40 to $6.60 per share. This range takes into account the dividend composition decision as well as our view of current conditions including those in the retail real estate business. As a result of our high quality portfolio, strong balance sheet, cost control measures, we were able to grow FFO per share of 8.8% in a very difficult operating environment when most REITs are reporting negative earnings and no expectations for growth in 2009 which is opposite of what we are saying and what we\u2019ve done. ", "This year, 2009 will be another challenging year however we are up to the task and now we are ready for any questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Can you talk real time and tell us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of occupancy expectations for 2009, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the lease spreads for the mall portfolio, for the outlet portfolio, versus what you put up in 2008.", "Rick Sokolov ", "As David said we are well down the road on 2009 activity. Just to give you some numbers, in 2008 we completed 12,221,000 square feet of executed leases between renewals and new deals. So far in 2009 we have already executed 467,000 square feet of deals just in January and we have another 7,786,000 square feet of new deals, downsizes and renewals in our lease process.", "What we\u2019re seeing is that we are very focused on dealing with the tenants across our portfolio. We are holding our margins and our rents where we can and that is in virtually all of our very good properties and where we have a tenant that we believe is in extreme financial distress, we\u2019re trying to work with them to come up with a mutually acceptable basis for maintaining their occupancy in the portfolio. ", "David Simon ", "As we indicated to you, we continue to believe that our comparable NOI for the mall portfolio will either be at least what the EBITDA was last year or up 1% and that\u2019s a pretty good testament to the resiliency of the mall portfolio. Occupancy might come under pressure in our numbers because of the expected bankruptcies of oncoming tenants. But even obviously that\u2019s been factored into our conclusion in terms of guidance and frankly right now our main focus is maintaining the cash flow and increasing it and that\u2019s where our energy is being spent. ", "Steve Sterrett ", "We are in the same place as we sit here at the end of January dealing with our 2009 expirations as we were sitting here a year ago dealing with our 2008 expirations. We are about the same percentage through the current year expirations. ", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "So if you\u2019re looking on a full year, if you were call it a 20% spread or slightly 20, what\u2019s your best estimate at this point as to 2009 and as you look forward to 2010, how they could compress. ", "David Simon ", "I think occupancies are going to come under some pressure. There\u2019s been lots of research about how much its going to drop. It\u2019s not going to be anywhere near the research that I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m happy to point that out individually in terms of who\u2019s coming up with these guesstimates and we clearly have lots of cushion in our market rents in terms of where our leases are rolling over. ", "So I think we\u2019ll maintain our spreads. They may come, they may not be $8, they may be $5, $6. We\u2019ve been outperforming in that category. We won\u2019t back off of that. Occupancy will come under pressure. I think the bottom line is we think we\u2019re going to grow our EBITDA.

", "Rick Sokolov ", "They were pretty much the same interestingly enough. There was not an outsized, in fact they were each down about the same and again the luxury tenants in some instances were down significantly. But part of that is because they were up so much in 2007 and one of the issues that the luxury tenants had is that they were basically caught in a U-turn in their demand so when they ordered their inventory for 2008 it was based on very robust trends in 2007.", "The more moderate priced retailers had less robust trends in 2007 so had more modest inventories in 2008 and were not as substantially impacted. ", "David Simon ", "Lots of retailers have already posted their comp sales. The vast majority and we keep track of this, if they post their comp sales up or down we will tend to, our portfolio will tend to outperform. So let\u2019s say a retailer reports 8% up our portfolio will probably be 10 or 11% up. Or if they report down we will be less down and again that\u2019s the vast, vast majority. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t quite happen that way. ", "I think when you look at comp sales for the retailers, you could make a probably a pretty reasonable assumption that we\u2019re outperforming slightly on the positive and slightly on the negative and that\u2019s something we track about and that\u2019s why we continue to be a very important ingredient to the retailer success.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  David Fick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "David Fick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "You mentioned you have more concerns about some of the box tenants and I\u2019m wondering if you might comment on where Sears, K-Mart goes given that you have them in more then half of your locations. ", "David Simon ", "I really don\u2019t like commenting on specific retailers. It puts us in a tough spot other then I feel very confident from a financial point of view that they\u2019re in good shape producing positive operating cash flow and they\u2019re focused on becoming a better merchant. Beyond that that\u2019s really all I can say. ", "David Fick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "You had approached them at some point about maybe taking some stores back and they didn\u2019t entertain that, is that something that you still think you have alternative uses should there be an issue going forward. ", "David Simon ", "Sure, and again I think what we\u2019ll see is, some of the very good centers will ultimately get some good real estate back because I\u2019ll take an example, the one Sears store that we were able to purchase was in South Park in Charlotte, where we added Neiman and Nordstrom, and other tenants and Sears just wasn\u2019t the right tenant for that higher end mall and that\u2019s always the case. ", "They perform very well in a number of higher end malls but and so I think in those cases there may be those kind of deals. Not just with Sears but with some of the other boxes or department stores. ", "David Fick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "How did the Cincinnati Mills sale come in against your basis and expectations. ", "David Simon ", "On Cincinnati, right on and otherwise we\u2019d have a gain or loss associated with it. ", "David Fick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "Bankruptcies in general for the small tenants have been below I think what most people thought and you indicated that for January, but what about as you look forward in terms of factoring inventory this summer, is there anything you might be prepared to do to help your tenants who won\u2019t find financing.", "David Simon ", "Sometimes we do and part of that would be what we can do on the rent side but the one area that is a concern for retail when they, remember retailers are still good retailers, their financial structure may not be appropriate or they took on leverage from a buying out of a tenant or they went private with too much leverage, there are all sorts of things.", "But and some of those are just good retailers with too much leverage. The one concern that we do have, one concern that doesn\u2019t seem to be breaking the ice is that those retailers with a good plan or a good operator but maybe have bad capital structure the lack of [dip] financing continues to be an issue. ", "And we saw this in December a little bit and that\u2019s why our occupancy got hit. Normally if a retailer went out of business or went into Chapter 11 [inaudible] they\u2019d get dip financing and they\u2019d restructuring their capital structure and they\u2019d be able to operate. Given the lack of dip financing right now retailers are just liquidating. ", "So we would like to see some stability or some market to come back in the dip world. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to play in but we would like to see that market come back. Its always been a profitable market for the lenders of that but as they reined in their loans this is one area where they are not taking any risk. ", "Rick Sokolov ", "The vast majority of our retails have very strong balance sheets with virtually no debt. So the retailers David are talking about are those that were maybe involved in some LBOs and added on a lot of debt but the credit profile of our retailers which we monitor on a weekly basis is frankly stronger even after taking into account substantial declines in the last 12 month EBITDA reflecting December\u2019s results. ", "So the good news is that the concerns you\u2019re talking about are going to be isolated among a small number of tenants. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Thinking about releasing times for a minute, if you have some bankruptcies in the first quarter how quickly do you think you release that space.", "David Simon ", "In 2009, that would be a challenge and that\u2019s where I mentioned earlier that the occupancy, if that happened, could come under a bit of pressure because that would be a challenge because there\u2019s not a huge open, to open for the retailers. So if that happened and we weren\u2019t able to, and that retailer liquidated and went out of business, to achieve that in 2009 we would make that up by doing some local leasing or some temporary tenant leasing which is still maintaining its demand.", "But to get the full occupancy the way we calculate it which is to have a lease over a year might be difficult to achieve for that calendar year in 2009.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "Thinking about the financing for a second, are any of these guys talking about extensions, is that a more prevalent conversation or how do they feel about extending debt if you or some of your peers can\u2019t get a piece of debt done.", "Steve Sterrett ", "I think its tow things, let\u2019s separate the life company market from the CMBS market. A life company who has a loan coming due know the assets, in the case of our portfolio is very comfortable with the asset and wants very much to extend so renewals is kind of an ordinary course of business there. ", "The question is when you\u2019ve got a CMBS loan and the loan is performing and that\u2019s the conversation that you\u2019re going to have with the servicer and we\u2019ll see. There\u2019s clearly maturities that are coming due. Having said all that for us as I mentioned, very comfortable loan to values, very modest leverage so happily its not a situation that  we\u2019ve been dealing with. ", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "The unsecured note that  you have that\u2019s due today, that goes on the line of credit I assume?", "Steve Sterrett ", "Correct.", "David Simon ", "We do have cash too.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Private equity, is there any thawing in terms of interest in the real estate space from pension funds, other equity sources.", "David Simon ", "I would say generally US based by and large, no. International based, yes. I think the US based pension fund is tougher because of their own what\u2019s going on either with their endowments or their retirees or their own, not so much that real estate has been black lined, its just they\u2019ve got lots of things to worry about, hedge fund performance, private equity LBL performance, capital calls, commitments, retiree benefits, the poor performance, etc.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "And is that international interest in US assets?", "David Simon ", "Yes. ", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "The three Vegas assets that general growth has, you are obviously a logical potential buyer of those assets, is that something you\u2019re looking seriously at. ", "David Simon ", "No. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James ", "RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James ", "You commented that the number of retailers struggling and coming back to renegotiate rents was very small, how does that translate into delinquencies, where are they now versus a year ago or even three months ago. ", "Steve Sterrett ", "Our receivable balance at the end of January will be pretty much right on top of where it was at the end of December and December 2008 was pretty much right on top of where it was at December of 2007. Not to say we\u2019re not having to work harder and chase a little harder to get those dollars in the door, but we have not seen a significant change in the composition of our receivable balance. ", "RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James ", "Who is currently on your credit watch list, which retailers are you concerned about. ", "David Simon ", "I think its no different then what everybody else is, again its very tough for us to name retailers publically but there are a handful and again some of these are good operators that are on there because they bought something or they went private or those kind of things as opposed to just bad performance. ", "But its very tough for us to name retailers publically like that . ", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. ", "David Simon ", "I just wanted to say thank you. We\u2019re proud of our 2008 performance when others aren\u2019t growing their company and I think again we feel confident that we\u2019ll continue to be able to maintain our unparalleled record of growth in 2009.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "", "David Simon", "", "Thanks, good morning everyone.   We are pleased to report an excellent quarter, which is a testament to our high quality portfolio as well as our early recognition last year of the severe economic downturn.  I would like to just take a few minutes to review the financial and operational highlights and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "We reported FFO per share growth of 10.3% to $1.61 in the first quarter compared to $1.46 in 2008.  First quarter 2009 FFO per share reflects $0.02 of dilution as a result of the issuance of the common stock dividend that we paid in March of 2009.  ", "Diluted net income available to common stock holders per share increased 15.4% or $0.45 in 2009, from $0.39 in 2008.  Comp and NOI growth for the regional malls was up 2.7% for the quarter and our comp property NOI statistics do not include lease settlements.  ", "Our occupancy in the mall portfolio was 90.8% at quarter end compared to 91.7% in the year earlier period.  Occupancy across all platforms was decreased due to the retail environment as well as the store closings in early 2009 by major retailers who filed bankruptcy in 2008 and subsequently liquidated in the first quarter of 2009, including for the mall portfolio 595,000 square feet, which was primarily the big box retailers Circuit City and Linens \u2018n Things.  ", "Comparable sales in the mall portfolio were $455.00 per square foot at March 31, 2009 as compared to $491 in the year earlier period.  Sales in the mall platform continued to decline due to the general weakening in the U.S. economy and the reduced performance of some of the higher end tenants.  We did see a deceleration in the rate of sales decline in the quarter, which is encouraging and remember that Easter fell late this year, actually in April as opposed to March of last year, and there was weakness in Florida, California, and the Las Vegas markets which also impacted that statistic.", "Our regional mall releasing spread was very solid at 24.8% for the quarter, in line with our historical levels and our expectations and what we\u2019ve signaled to the market again about the value of our lease rollovers.", "Now let me turn to the Premium Outlet portfolio.  Comp NOI grew 7.9% in the quarter.  Occupancy was 96.9% at the end of the quarter as compared to 97.9% last year.  The decline again was primarily the result of certain store closings and bankruptcies as well as we opened Jersey Shore last year, which is 90% occupied at the end of the quarter, which had some small impact on that number.  ", "The outlet business sales were $5.07 per foot at the end of the quarter as compared to $5.11 the year earlier period.  Our Premium Outlet releasing spread was a robust 33.5% and the pricing power remains strong to do a low occupancy cost stability of sales and steady demand for space from tenants.", "Our Premium Outlet portfolio contributes over 19% of our NOI and is without doubt the best collection of outlets in the country and without peer with the highest occupancy rate generating the highest sales per square foot, strongest comp property NOI growth, and highest development returns.  ", "Our third primary platform is the Mills.  That was 89.7% leased at the end of the quarter compared to 94.2% in the year earlier period.  This decline again was attributable to the bankruptcies of 840,000 square feet primarily Circuit City, Linens and Steve & Barry's.  Sales within the Mills platform was $373.00 per foot at quarter end compared to $379, which again I think helped demonstrate the importance of the consumers looking for value given the economic situation that they currently reside in.  Releasing spread for Mills was a +14.1%.", "Now let me turn to the capital markets.  As you all know we sold $17.25 million common shares and issued $650 million of ten-year unsecured notes near the end of the quarter and that was a total capital raise of approximately $1.2 billion which reduced our borrowings on our corporate credit facility.  Our corporate credit facility has zero outstanding other than the foreign currency exposure that we keep outstanding as a hedge against our foreign income we generate of approximately $440 million of out standings.  In March we also refinanced two regional malls at $197.5 million with an average interest rate of 7.77%.  These loans were new originations by major life companies and in fact they had existing indebtedness of approximately $130 million prior to our refinance.", "We retired $700 million of senior notes.  At the quarter end we have approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand including our share of joint venture cash and our availability on our corporate credit facility is somewhat over $3 billion.", "Our unencumbered portfolio continues to include 150 wholly owned assets that generate EBITDA in excess of $1.7 billion.  Our annual cash flow is still projected this year before dividends to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2009.", "Let me talk about development and redevelopment, talk about the dividend as well.  We opened the Promenade at Camarillo, in Camarillo, California, a 220,000 square foot expansion expected to generate a first year return of 13%.  In addition, on April 17 we opened a new Nordstrom at the recently redeveloped and expanded Nordstrom Mall in Peabody, Massachusetts.  In addition, we are finalizing the construction in the U.S. on Cincinnati Premium Outlets, the second phase of Domain in Austin, Texas and the redevelopment expansion of South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Massachusetts.  ", "We currently anticipate that our domestic development capital expenditures net of construction loans already in place will approximate $180 million for the remainder of 2009 and currently we\u2019re projecting less than $50 million in CapEx development spend in 2010.  ", "Now let me turn to the dividend.  As you know we have paid particular attention to this.  We have treated it with the most seriousness that we can treat any corporate decision that we can make.  We have worked hard and long with our board of directors and we have determined that the Company\u2019s annual common stock dividend will be reduced to the minimum amount required to distribute 100 % of our taxable income and maintain our REIT status.  This amount is currently estimated to be $2.70 per share for 2009 and the first quarter of 2009 we paid a dividend of $0.90 per share.  We expect to pay three quarterly dividends of $0.60 per share for the balance of the year to equate to the $2.70 of estimated taxable income.", "As you may recall, we originally forecasted our taxable income to be approximately $3.30 per share and based on our decision in the Q1 to pay the $0.90 per share dividend on that estimate.  Since that time we have been able to lower our estimated taxable income by taking into consideration the increased share count from our equity issuances as well as additional taxable depreciation available to us, both of which were not included in our original estimate.  Accordingly, the dividend announced today in payable on June 19 is $0.60 per share consistent with the dividend announced in the first quarter, the dividend will be paid in a combination of stock and cash.  The cash component of the dividend will not exceed 20% in the aggregate or $0.12 per share. The cash component of the dividend was increased by $0.03 per share or 33% from the first quarter dividend.", "Guidance today, we revised and adjusted our 2009 FFO guidance to $6.05 to $6.20 per share.  This revision was primarily driven by the 2009 common stock and unsecured debt offerings that occurred at the end of the quarter as our outlook on operations currently remains unchanged.", "Finally, let me just say that I am proud of the first quarter.  It continues to be a difficult operating environment, but we delivered excellent growth and profits 10% above last years numbers.  We strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet with our common stock and notes offering and we continue to be pleased with how the Company is positioned.  We are grateful to continue to maintain our leadership position in the REIT industry. ", "With that said, operator we are ready for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Mueller of J.P. Morgan.      ", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan      ", "Was there any magic behind the cash component of the dividend going up a few cents?", "David Simon", "Well look, it is our desire to get as much cash dividend as we pay comfortable paying.  I think we will continue this strategy for \u201809, but we\u2019re really looking to as soon as we get more and more clarity in the capital  markets and that is becoming a little bit clearer, that we are optimistic that we will reinstate the full cash dividend.  I just think it\u2019s hopefully a signal to the market that we\u2019re getting more and more confidence.", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan      ", "Okay, not knowing anything else, should we look at, I am assuming the $0.60 probably wouldn\u2019t be a run rate into 2010 or should we think as $2.70 as being an annual and just think of the dividend on an annual basis at this point?", "David Simon", "I would think that it\u2019s, obviously 2010 is awhile away, but our early projections on our taxable income for 2010 are anywhere between $2.70 and $3.00 per share.  Again, there is a lot of variability to that, but it would be our intention to obviously pay our taxable income and to pay the appropriate amount in cash given the current market conditions. ", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan      ", "Is the Mills occupancy decline, I know you mentioned the boxes who were the culprits there.  Was all of that expected and did anything else come out of that that wasn\u2019t expected?  Then can you comment on the demand, the activity that you\u2019re seeing in terms of leasing some of those boxes plus in the Community Center portfolio?", "David Simon", "I will turn it over to Rick.  I mean, the Mills decrease was entirely towards the boxes.  The demand there continues to be decent.  There are more and more tenants.  Like, I happened to be there last week and Potomac Mills, the last call of Neiman Marcus were just about to open an Orange Neiman Marcus as well. So, the demand is good, but as you know we have had lots of boxes in those properties.  It will take some time, but the in-line tenancy really didn\u2019t have much variability.  It is all associated with the boxes.", "Rick Sokolov  ", "And the only other thing, we have another Neiman Marcus last call opening at Gurnee and we also have a number of H&Ms opening in these boxes.  The other thing that\u2019s going on is, as David pointed out because of the stable sales performance there we are seeing an increasing migration to the Mills platform of not only outlet tenants that we are cross-fertilizing from Chelsea, but also our full price mall tenants that we\u2019ve started to open in the Mills.  So, our demand for small shop space in the Mills is maintaining relatively stable.", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan      ", "Okay and I think on the last call, David, you mentioned an expectation that obviously you can\u2019t just look at any one quarter in terms of spreads, but you said maybe the spreads come into the teens.  Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing post Q1 and into the spring leasing season.  Do they still look pretty sticky?", "David Simon", "Yes, I have been inelegant in my articulation of our leases and the fact that they are under market.  But, generally, good retail has been around for a long time and given the fact that good retail real estate the leases tend to roll over 7% to 10% per annum, it just takes a long time to bring that good retail up to market.  ", "The good retail we are still feeling reasonably confident that we can deliver rental growth out of.", "In certain properties you are going to have struggle to do that, but given the majority of our incomes is coming from better properties, we still think it\u2019s sticky and we would expect to continue to do it.   The nature of it may come in somewhat, but we still believe strongly that our leases are under market. ", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan      ", "Okay, I appreciate it.  Thanks.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Habermann with Goldman Sachs.      ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "I thought I would start off with NOI growth.  David your comments certainly sound a little bit more positive than the last call, but 2.7% is certainly positive versus your +1% forecast.  How do you see NOI growth trending through out the balance of the year?", "David Simon", "We are not going to move away from the slats of 1% growth.  It is a tough retail environment.  We are just trying to execute to deliver that to the best of our abilities.  You can over react on one quarter, but we still feel like we are going to deliver the flat to 1% NOI growth.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "", "Do you think it will dip negative more towards the middle of the year as these bankruptcies close?", "David Simon", "I think the real issue at the end of the day is; what are very hard to predict is overage rents.  Now that is not a lot but that does have some variability associated with it and that is why we are probably a little bit more cautious.  Obviously we are reserving, you see the bad debt expense. It is still very high compared to historical standards.  That is the variability that is just really hard to pin point.  ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "", " The other part of it too is the financing market.  It sounds like you are more optimistic there as well?  I know you issued the unsecureds, but have you seen the market improve even since in the last month or so?", "David Simon", "I think the corporate market is dramatically improved.  It is good to see the industry begin to re-equalize, it is good to see the unsecured debt markets come back. Our spreads have tightened dramatically.  That is all good news.  The life companies are providing the capital to the borrowers and the best properties.  ", "The one unknown in our industry is obviously the CMBS market and what happens there.  I am not one of these guys sitting around assuming the government is going to help the real estate industry.  That is the big unknown and that is the market that lacks the most clarity on.", " ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "", "Referring to the Life companies for a minute, you did mention that it\u2019s improved.  Do you see that as a very deep option at this point or do you think that this is a flurry of activity from the lack of activity from late last year?", "David Simon", "No, I think it is dependent on the insurance companies, but there is other capital out there that wants safe mortgages with good borrowers on good real estate.  They now have the ability to kind of pick and choose and in fact drive pretty good bargains.  I think that market is not extremely deep, but it is there.  It is not just life insurance companies, I think we are starting to see debt funds and the like that are going to provide capital to good borrowers and good real estate at pretty good rates.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "", "Last on GGP, any thoughts in terms of how that is impacting your leasing, or even in terms of Cap rates and transactions that you might see?", "David Simon", "I think it is too early to tell.  I don\u2019t sense it is going to have any impact on our operational aspects, leasing.  It is very interesting, as big as general growth is and obviously as big as we are, we rarely have competed in markets.  We may have three, four, or five centers that had some overlap.  We have always competed kind of on a national basis.  So, I don\u2019t think it is going to have any impact on the operational side, other than as we said last quarter, I do think the landlord from a retailer perspective is really important, and to the extent we do think we\u2019ll get some residual benefit just because of the position the company is in as well at the quality of our assets.", "I don\u2019t think at this point Cap rates impact on financing.  I have not seen any and I don\u2019t expect it to really play out for some time. ", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs ", "", "", "Okay, thank you. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. ", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup", "This is Quentin Velleley here with Michael.  All of your peers have been saying that a lot of the lease renewals have so far this year have been very short in term of one or two years.  I am just wondering if that is something that you\u2019re experiencing in your leasing?", "Rick Sokolov  ", "We have been interested to see the focus on this.  Our leasing strategies haven\u2019t changed at all.  Frankly, you can look at our termination schedule in the AK quarter-to-quarter and track it.  For whatever it is worth our number of leases less than two years is a dramatically lower percentage than anything that we\u2019ve heard publicly discussed in the other calls.  But, you also need to be reminded that there are a lot of very good reasons for having a shorter term.  We want to have our retail spaces have the same expirations; if we can put together a new room that is more marketable, we want to generate more rent, we want to change the mix.  There are a lot of factors and I don\u2019t think that the implication that there is something negative in that trend is appropriate, but in fact, for us, there is no material change historically in our terms.

I am wondering where that ratio is moving to.  I know you said that you think the majority of your portfolio is still under rented.  Are there any particular tenants or types of tenants where the occupancy cost ratio is moving up and you\u2019ve got some concern?", "Rick Sokolov  ", "First of all, historically we have always tried to ensure that we were getting full rents, but we have always run this business with a view towards ensuring that we can work with our tenants.  In fact our occupancy costs within the malls is 14%, which is still very much within the traditional bounds where tenants can remain profitable even at these decreased sales levels.", "I would also point out, and this was a point that was referenced by David, that in our Premium Outlet portfolio our occupancy cost ratio is only 8.7%, so in both platforms, in Chelsea, we know we have a substantial opportunity to bring leases to market and that is reflected with the significant rent spreads we are reporting on renewals.  ", "On the Mall portfolio our occupancy cost is stuff that we\u2019re still having constructive conversations with our tenants.", "David Simon", "Quentin, I would just say look sales are obviously having an impact on how retailers are thinking about their business and what they can afford to pay and that is one of the reasons why our NOI assumptions are not growing 3% or 4% like they have historically, and that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re going to be flat to up 1%%.", "There is sensitivity that we have to our retailers given the current sales environment, so it is somewhat of a governor on growth right now, but I think our under market, under valued leases allow us to kind of maintain the flatness of what we\u2019re projecting.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "", "This is Michael, clearly it sounds like other landlords are moving down that path of shorter duration.  Do you think that is more so from a retailer perspective of them pushing it and saying look, I don\u2019t know where things are going to be.  I would like to stay here, but cut me a break and I\u2019ll stay for another year or two and then we\u2019ll see where things are, rather than them leaving.  Or, how much then is it the landlord saying you know what I don\u2019t want to sign a long-term lease at massively down in rents if I know in two or three years things will be better.  I am just trying to understand that dynamic.", "David Simon", "Without question it is both, but the important thing is when we deal with a major tenant we\u2019re dealing with our entire portfolio and if they are uncertain about sales at a particular center our goal is to shorten everything up, as an example, because one thing we don\u2019t want to do is just have not such great stores expire and then do the longer term leases on the great stores.  So, we try to balance that.  In some cases it is a short-term band-aid.  It could be from our perspective.  It could be from theirs.  Sometimes we are waiting on the right tenant for the space.  As Rick mentioned earlier, we think so four is going to come in next year, not this year, so let\u2019s hold it over for a year.  We had a situation at Dadeland Mall where we did that, as an example.  It is all part of the equation.  ", "I will tell you it is not that dramatically different than what we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years.  Now, is rental expense a higher priority for tenants?  Absolutely, but, the give and take, the duration of the leases and when you do it, when you don\u2019t do it, when you have a hold over tenant, when you don\u2019t has been pretty consistent over the last several years.

When you are having these portfolio discussions, if you were to bracket it into different classes are you finding that, at least on the lower sales productivity assets is that hurting more; is that where retailers are becoming more concerned about at all?", "David Simon", "I think it depends on the retailer really.  I mean some of the higher end tenants have had more dramatic sales decreases in, what I\u2019ll call, the moderate to better.  So, it is really a function of the retailer in the marketplace.  Clearly though, if the real estate is not that good you are going to be in a match to maintain the cash flow of that asset.

We have a 25% carried interest in that property behind significant preference for what I will call the true economic owner; there are two other partners in that deal.  We have no invested capital in that project.  We were working toward a refinance kind of as the property manager of that asset.

So, we are actually trying to be an honest happy broker to figure out how to make and give both of those lender and the borrower the ability to maintain the status quo for a better environment down the road.  So, that is the source.", "Now let me turn to Palm Beach.  Just to give you a little bit of history, Palm Beach, for those of you who don\u2019t know, Simon Property Group acquired the asset both when we acquired DeBartolo and Corporate Property Investors more than ten years ago.  Those ownership interests were owned 50-50.   They were very small in connection with the overall deal of DeBartolo and CPI.  Since that time we invested millions of dollars renovating.  We actually brought in Dillard\u2019s during that process.  We re-tenanted the mall.  I think we did as good a job as anybody to maintain that center as an enclosed mall, but ultimately we knew that maintaining it as an enclosed mall was going to be very difficult.  So, we began to develop a significant redevelopment plan which unfortunately, because of the state of the retail environment, in fact we were working with Ikea as an example,  we were working toward maybe potentially demolishing the mall and the like.  But, when we lost Ikea that kind of put that whole development on hold.", "Additionally, during that period of time we lost Dillard\u2019s and then subsequently we lost Macys.  So, we were trying to and have attempted to reach an acceptable resolution with the representative of the lender; I will point out, this is a non-recourse loan.  But, those attempts, the servicer really was not interested in having a dialogue on this and those attempts have not currently reached an acceptable resolution.", "With all that said, that is Palm Beach and again we have worked very hard to maintain it and to try and redevelop it, but the environment is such that that\u2019s going to make it very difficult.  This has been a cash flow drain for the Company, on this non-recourse loan.  I think our decision is obviously in the best interest of our bondholders and our equity holders and the like.  That is the status with that.  ", "I will turn it over to Steve to answer the last part of your question.  Other than to say the good news in both our secured and our secured indebtedness coming up in \u201809 and \u201910, and our JV, and a lot of that is with life companies that were well down the road.  If you look at our consolidated nines the vast majority of that is with insurance companies that we have a wonderful relationship with that we have made very good progress on.  The same thing can be said for our tens as well.  But, I will turn it over to Steve to add more color, it you would like.", "Steve Sterrett", "Yes, Michael, just to echo David\u2019s point as and example 75% of our \u201909 maturities are non-CMBfs.  The other thing that I would point out is in the 9s, 10s and even going out to 11 our current debt yields based on current EBITDA is in the 15% range, so these are loans that in the aggregate are appropriately sized even given the current market conditions, which is why we have made the statement that we expect to be able on a net-net basis to refinance our security indebtedness in whole.  Not to say we won\u2019t have to necrotize certain assets.  As David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we actually got excess proceeds from a couple of the loans that we have done already, but net-net we think we are in pretty good shape.", "You asked about forum shops specifically, I suspect because of its size and it is a large loan, but I will also tell you it does well north of $80 million of NOIs.  So again, when you look at it from a debt yield perspective it is certainly not over levered.  One of the great advantages of our company compared to many others is we have a big unencumbered portfolio and so the ability to mix and match our financing sources we are not dependent on rolling over every mortgage maturity that comes due.  As David mentioned earlier, we certainly believe the bond market is substantially improved from where we saw it a month or so ago.", "I feel very good about the ability to continue to roll over our mortgage debt and to finance the Company [interposing].", "David Simon", "Just to give you a perspective on that, that is what our line is there for essentially.  Take the Oklahoma assets that we refinanced, we actually paid off the mortgages, one in January and so we paid one at the end of the year actually and then one in January.

We obviously have been very conservative on capital.  I think that the steps that we have taken, although painful in some respects and not something we wanted to do, I would we are feeling better about the market.

One of the things that we have clearly seen over the last six months is the move of capital towards the higher quality sponsors.  I think at the height of this EMS market who actually owned the mall or who the partner in the mall was maybe less important then I had ever seen it in the 20 years I have been doing this.  I think we are at the other end of the spectrum right now and money, and there is still a ton of money sitting on the sidelines, has gravitated towards the better sponsors.  So, I think when you couple what we have done already from a capital rate standpoint, plus the enquiries we have gotten about people wanting to put money to work side-by-side with us, I think David is right in that we\u2019re feeling a little better about the opportunities that we are inevitably going to see come down the road, because there is obviously still a lot of distress in the market and we are going to see opportunities.", "Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley", "", "You have been pursuing some of those outside the U.S., is there a bias now for anything incremental being domestic or foreign?", "David Simon", "I think the primary focus currently will be domestic, Paul, without question.", "Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley", "My last question is on visibility from a leasing perspective.  In my experience ICSC comes and you talk about a lot of deals for, this year it will be 2010.  How much are retailers sort of willing to think about sort of fall 2010 openings, or does everybody have a much shorter time horizon right now?", "Rick Sokolov  ", "We\u2019ve had in the last three weeks an anticipation of ICSC probably five to eight tenants a week coming in here, because with our portfolio and across the platforms we get a lot more done and we are talking to them about 2010 deals.

There was a period of time in January and February where they didn\u2019t really know what was ahead of them.  Now I think they are a little more comfortable as to that, but they still want to get some firmer feel for how this is going to unfold over the next few months.", "David Simon", "I would just say I think their mood is better, from the guys I talked to.  No one knows for sure where we are going to be the next six months in terms of the broader economy, but I will tell you that given the dramatic fall off from September to December and the slowing down of the sales rate of deceleration, that sounds right:  I would tell you that their mood is more stable and more forward thinking without question.

It is hard to know whether we would be where we are today, but we knew that that cost was expensive.  We thought that by doing it ultimately we would be able to access markets more cost effective and so far it looks like we are moving in that direction.

We picked up half an interest in this mall when we bought CPI.  This was a joint venture between Rouse and CPI.  General Growth picked up their interest when they bought CPI and they have been the property manager, or I am sorry Rouse, they and Rouse have been the property manager since we\u2019ve ever been involved in it and they have taken the lead on it and they had been leading the charge on the litigation.  We are a partner, but we have no day-to-day involvement in the managing of the asset.", "General Growth, we know Adam the guy that runs it now.  I would say our relationship with them is fine.

Given the litigation we will leave it at that.

Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "Welcome to the Simon Property Group's second quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.  Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.  Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these terms.", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe that it is important to note that today's call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, August 4, 2009. ", "The company's supplemental information package was filed earlier today as Form 8-K. The filing is available via mail or email and is posted on the Simon Website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information Quarterly Supplemental Packages.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning.  Thank you for joining us today.  I'll take a few minutes to review financial and operational highlights for the quarter and then we'll open it up for Q&A.  ", "SPG sound business fundamentals as well as our stability of our high quality regional mall and premium outlet platforms continue to drive results in the second quarter.  We reported diluted FFO per share before an impairment charge of $1.38 for the quarter ended in line with expectations.  FFO per share including the impact of the impairment charge was $0.96. ", "In the second quarter, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million or $0.42 per share representing the decline in the value of the company's investment in Liberty International.  As of June 30, 2009, we own 35.4 million shares of Liberty at a weighted average price of 574 pence.", "Liberty's quoted market price was 397 pence at quarter end June 30 although now it is traded up closing yesterday at 436 pence.  It recorded today the impairment charge would be $30 million less given the improvement in the stock price and the current exchange rate. ", "Until this quarter we marked Liberty investment to market through our comprehensive income on the balance sheet.  We concluded this quarter that the decline in value is no longer temporary and therefore, recognized a loss in our income statement.  We continue to have confidence in the longer term value of our investment in Liberty.  ", "FFO for the quarter also reflected dilution of $0.14 per share as a result of our 17.25 million shares of common stock that was issued in March and an additional 23 million shares in May.  The issuance of the 40.25 million common shares in March and May offering as well as the 8 million shares issued through our common stock dividends served to strengthen our industry's leading balance sheet.  We also recorded 13 million or $0.04 per share less in straight line rent and fair market value of lease income in the second quarter of 2009 as compared to 2008.  ", "Now I'll comment on some operating performances measures.  Occupancy across all platforms continues to be affected by the weak retail environment as compared to last year and has been impacted by store closing of retailers who filed bankruptcy in 2008 and 2009.  Across all of our platforms, we've lost over 2 million square feet year-to-date from bankruptcy-related store closings.  ", "Regional malls' occupancy was 90.9 at quarter-end which was a decrease of 90 basis points for the second quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of the aforementioned bankruptcies.  Premium Outlets was occupancy at quarter end was 97% a decrease of a 130 basis points from the second quarter of 2008, again primarily due to negotiated store closings where we wanted to recapture the space and again, more bankruptcy related closings.  ", "Comparable retail sales continue to decline due to the overall economic environment.  Our mall comparable sales were $442 per square foot at June 30, impacted by the performance of higher end retailers that have been more significantly impacted in today's economic environment.  Those retailers had higher productivity to begin with and decreases in their sales had a greater impact on portfolio.  ", "Comp store sales, we've also been impacted given our company's important position in Florida, California, and the Las Vegas markets.  As of June 30, Premium Outlet comparable sales were $493 per square foot.  The sales decrease year-over-year was less significant in this platform as the consumer continues to seek value in these economic times. ", "Our mall re-leasing spread was 17% as of June 30 in line with historical levels.  Our Premium Outlet re-leasing spread continued to maintain its strong position at 34.6%.  Regional mall comp NOI for the quarter was flat.  It's slightly up actually and for the six months year-to-date was up 1%. ", "Premium Outlet top NOI was 6.1% for the quarter and 7.1% for the first six months.  During the quarter we completed the transition of the Chelsea back office operations through ending Indianapolis, a move that will generate annualized cost savings of approximately $10 million, and we continue to be laser focused on all aspects of our operation.  Our operating margin actually increased by 100 basis points in the mall portfolio to 68% for the quarter.  ", "Now let me turn to capital markets.  We returned to the capital markets in May raising an additional $1.75 billion through two offerings.  On May 12, the company completed the sale of 23 million shares of common stock at $50 for total proceeds of $1.15 billion. ", "On May 15, the company issued $600 million of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2014.  On the second quarter capital activities included the following.  We redeemed $ 85 million of our operating partnerships, 8% cumulative redeemable preferred units at par.  Two secured debt closings were completed during the quarter aggregating $230 million.  In addition, on July 30, just a few days ago, we closed an additional $400 million of new mortgage financing.  ", "These transactions that I just described generated an additional net cash to the company of $350 million.  In 2009, we also exercised or completed extensions of more than $1.1 billion of mortgages.  Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.36 times and SPG's prudent balance sheet management strong franchise value was again acknowledged in May when the company's ratings were reaffirmed by three major rating agencies including S&P, reaffirmed it at A minus, corporate credit on unsecured senior debt ratings with a stable outlook. ", "On May 11, Moody's Investor Service affirmed the A-3 unsecured debt rating with a stable outlook.  On May 29 Fitch Ratings affirmed the A minus unsecured senior debt rating with a stable outlook.  All three rating agencies cited the company's high quality portfolio including the magnitude of its unencumbered funds from operations, diversified asset base, stable income stream, conservative capital structure, strong access to a variety of funding sources and an accomplished management team as the primary reasons for these affirmations.", "Now, as of June 30 our balance sheet includes, including our share of joint venture cash, $2.9 billion of cash and our availability on our corporate credit facility of over $3 billion for a total current liquidity position, including the recent mortgages I talked about of $6.3 billion.", "And I think the most important thing I can tell you about that is that includes $9.50 a share in cash.  Now development, redevelopment on April 23 we opened The Promenade at Camarillo.  This 220,000 square foot expansion expected to generate a 13% first year return.  ", "On April 17 a new Nordstrom opened at the recently developed and expanded Northshore Mall in Peabody, Massachusetts.  And actually Thursday we'll be opening Cincinnati Premium Outlet and we expect that to be a very exciting development that will add to the country's best collection of outlets generating the highest sales per square foot, the strongest comp property NOI and the highest development returns.", "Construction continues on two other projects in the U.S., second phase The Domain in Austin, Texas, redevelopment and expansion of the South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Massachusetts, and both are scheduled on time and on budget to open in early 2010.  We have no other significant projects scheduled to begin.", "International on July 7 we have opened Ami Premium Outlets, the eighth Premium Outlet center in Japan.  The 225,000 square foot first phase opened fully leased to over 100 merchants.  We own 40% of this project.  Construction continues on five other fully funded projects, two in Italy, which will open in 2010 and three in China scheduled to open in the fall of 2009.", "Today we also reaffirmed the guidance provided on May 1, 2009, after giving effect to the impact of the May 12 equity offering, the May 15 senior notes offering and the second quarter non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in Liberty's common stock, the FFO guidance range is $5.35 to $5.50 per share.  Our outlook on core operations is unchanged.", "And let me just conclude and we'll be ready for Q&A, while the economic and retail environments remain difficult we believe we have maintained our leadership, industry leadership position due to our high quality and diverse portfolio and our willingness and ability to access various forms of capital.  With that said, we'll turn it over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 BAS-ML", "", "I just wondered is there any increased activity regarding store closing of the mall anchors?", "David Simon", "", "Not dramatically from over the last couple of years. I think there might be a couple that we're at risk for, but I would tell you nothing that hasn't been consistent over the last few years.  Rick, you can add to it.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing I would add is to give you a sense of where we are today.  We've got 766 department stores in the mall portfolio, of those only 19 are vacant.  Of the 19, 12 are owned by others and of the 19 we're actively discussing replacements in 12 of the boxes.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 BAS-ML", "And so I mean you're actually doing better on the anchor front than the in line.  ", "Richard S. Sokolov", "", "That is more stable.  Their occupancy costs are obviously much lower or they own their stores to begin with.", "David Simon", "", "Look, Craig, I don't think it would surprise us if we had some department store closings over the next year or two depending on the economic retail environment, but it's really nothing out of the ordinary that we haven't seen over the last couple of years.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 BAS-ML", "And what's the current occupancy or leasing on the Cincinnati Premium Outlet?", "David Simon", "", "It should be about 85% by year-end.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 BAS-ML", "And obviously you left the Mills project, what was the fatal flaw in that?  Was it the location or just the layout of the center?", "David Simon", "", "The location got better but the layout was an old \u2013 it was an actually old, original regional mall that was built so it had two levels.  It just didn't fit the Mills one-level, value oriented proposition and we were very happy to sell it.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "David, on your comments with the environment I know you mentioned it's still challenging.  But as we're starting to see signs of improvement and obviously to date you have to be somewhat pleasantly surprised just given that your occupancies holding up well and leasing spreads have held firmly and same store NOI is positive year-to-date.  Can you give us some sense for maybe leasing toward the back half of the year or even 2010?  What you are seeing at this point?", "David Simon", "", "Well look I think the holiday season is going to be important in terms of the psyche of the retailer for 2010.  And I think retail, even though the economy, and a lot seems to be shifting in the right direction, I think it's safe to say that retail is somewhat lagging in that.  We haven't seen that pick up but it is moving in the right direction.  ", "I do think that the second half of the year is going to be important and will have some important implications for 2010.  But we're still doing business.  We're still opening stores.  There are still retailers that are growing.  I don't think 2010 will have in one way or another, be really dramatic when it comes to NOI.  But, Jay, we're battling it out.  I mean it's not easy but we're figuring a way to get it done.", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "I guess maybe to better ask, I mean, do you expect to see another leg down in rents because the beauty of your business is you've got a predictable fees roll-over schedule in rents that are 10 years old.  But if you've got \u2013 are you anticipating sort of another step down in rents over the next six months or so?", "David Simon", "", "I think it's too early to tell.  We still feel very comfortable that we've got leases under market, but it's important ultimately for sales to stabilize.  And I think that's why, see, looking at the second half will be important especially as we get to October, November because the dramatic downturn in retail really occurred in that period of time.  ", "So if we can see some stabilization in that in that and the comps aren't as down as what we've seen the first nine months since September then I think we'll be \u2013 our leases will continue to show those rent spreads.  And that's what we're anticipating, but we're got to see the retail performance.", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And my second question is, would you look to co-invest with any REIT seeking to sell portions of assets or seeking to sell assets?  And any sense of this point of updated pricing of where you look to deploy capital?", "David Simon", "", "Well I'm not sure I understand?  Can you just restate the first part because I didn't pick that up?", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Would you seek to co-invest with any REITs at this point, whether seeking to sell portions of assets or would you  really like to just buy assets altogether from those seeking to sell?", "David Simon", "", "Well I don't think we'd co-invest with another REIT.  We may buy another REIT but I don't think we'd co-invest in another REIT or with another REIT.  The answer is we're feeling better about the pulling capital opportunistically, but beyond that there's not a lot I can add there.  I mean there's nothing imminent in what we're planning to do.  ", "But I don't think we'd partner with another REIT to buy assets.  I think we would certainly buy assets or if we felt it was appropriate opportunity to deploy capital and get the appropriate return that we want to see from that, we would certainly consider that.", "I mean, the one thing I said and I hope it's important, we do have $9.50 of cash on the balance sheet.  So there are very few real estate companies that have it.  That's almost 20% of our market cap.  Or so I mean, that's not an insignificant asset in today's world.", "Jonathan Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So what would be the pricing level that would push you toward deploying that capital?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't want to give it away because it may hurt my negotiation.  So I think we would \u2013 look, we understand our cost to capital very well, even though it's volatile and the cost of equity has been volatile.  ", "We have a better handle of our cost of debt.  And so I think anything we would do, we would be \u2013 we'd feel comfortable that it would have an accretive and be above our weighted average cost to capital.  So it's a function of the going in yield, what we can do with it and the potential growth in that asset.", "So we'll see.  Beyond that it's hard for me to comment.  I will say to you from our standpoint, I mean, we've had a lot of capital approach us to joint venture our existing assets and/or joint venture new opportunities.  ", "Given our capital position, we have felt we have positioned that capital to look at, and this is institutional capital, Jay, and we would look for that capital to position for new opportunities.  And we are really reluctant to sell our best assets even at what we thought we would be able to get those at, say, a seven cap rate.  ", "Even today, even in today's uncertain environment, we've kind of said, look, selling our best assets, wholly owned best assets at a seven cap rate, given the long-term growth of those is probably not in the best interest of our shareholders.\"", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "David or Rick, if you break down the portfolio either geographically or if I segment the malls into sort of sales stratas, what are you seeing in terms of trends both on rent and occupancy?  Is it weakness on the high end and low end and the middle of the portfolio is sort of the sweet spot?", "David Simon", "Well, I'll let Rick add.  I'll just say sales clearly have been most impacted by the better the property, which gives me a lot of confidence that as the better consumer gains their economic footing that that will rebound quicker and faster.  And the sales at the kind of the middle market mall have been relatively stable and kind of benign in terms of this downturn.", "Now the occupancy, it's interesting, the occupancy is really not that affected by the higher quality properties and our occupancy down turn, that's only 90 Bps from last year, is more impacted by the properties that don't have the higher sales productivity, which is not uncommon, and that's been going on for years and years.", "That would be, if I articulated that right, that would be the easiest way to see that.  And in sales regionally, I mean it's look, Las Vegas, California, Florida, our markets that continue to be under more duress than, say, even the New York metropolitan area or the Midwest.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay.  And if I think about your occupancy line, am I remembering correctly that you're not including tenants with lease terms under one year in that number?", "David Simon", "Correct.  ", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "So what percentage of your mall square footage right now is occupied by those short-term leases?  And how has that changed over the last year or two?", "David Simon", "Well, I would say that it's probably \u2013 if you walk our mall, you would see a lot less vacancy than 91%, which we're at.  And if you weighted averaged that in and out you'd probably add another 200 to 300 basis points.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay.  And then \u2013", "David Simon", "Again, a lot of these are temporary tenants that come in for six months, go out.  But if you walk the mall, you would see that if you did add kind of a weighted average, Ross, I'd add at least 250 to 200 basis points.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay.  And then on the cart and kiosk business, how should we be thinking about that?  Obviously there's not a lot of disclosure on that business across the entire mall industry.  Do you look at it from a standpoint of your effective occupancy rate is X versus the number of spots you can put these things in?  ", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "And what's happened to the rents in that business?", "David Simon", "That business is under pressure, but it's not dramatic.  And we're still shooting for the cart business to be relatively flat from last year and we look at rent and occupancy.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Okay.  Holding up better than I would have thought, given the \u2013", "David Simon", "Yes.  I mean, it's muddling along is the best way to describe it.  It's not killing our numbers.  It's not making our numbers.  It is what it is and it's kind of muddling along.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "And then last question, I was a little surprised to see the dividend announcement today with primarily or a majority of it being stock given your strong cash and liquidity position.  What was the thinking behind the board's decision there?", "David Simon", "Well, I think we signaled to you last quarter that that's what we're going to do for the balance of this year.  So you may have not been working then, so you missed the signal, which is okay.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "No, I got the signal.  I guess I'm asking if market conditions have strengthened?", "David Simon", "Look, I think our view and our goal is to return to paying cash dividends in 2010, cash, and that's our goal and that's essentially what we've signaled to the market.  And we've just felt like we might as well be extra conservative and prudent for the balance of the year, and a lot of discussions with a lot of shareholders that supported that view.  ", "And so I think we're just going to ride our decision in the balance of this year and then hopefully as we signal for the market for 2010, obviously subject to board improvement or board involvement and board \u2013 the guidance to be shooting for a taxable income as a dividend and doing that in cash.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Good morning.  Just continuing on with that, David, I mean, if you guys can, when you look at the debt maturities that you have coming up and the amount of cash that you have.  I mean, is your intent to keep your leverage level at the current levels?  Or could you use some of that cash to pay off some of those maturities as they arise?", "David Simon", "We will definitely use it, not really so much for the balance of this year, but our plans next year is to take a couple of our better secured properties that are currently secured and unencumber those with our cash.  ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Remember we've also got $1.1 million of bonds coming due \u2013", "David Simon", "Billion.", "David Simon", "$1.1 billion, excuse me, of bonds coming due next year, which we could use the cash to pay off as well.  Or obviously depending on market conditions, can go back to the market.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay.  And then on the $400 million of mortgage financing that you did, what was the average cost to bid on that?", "David Simon", "It was 8%. ", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And then in terms of lease termination, how come I noticed that fell considerably in the quarter?  What's your expectations into the second half of the year in terms of lease term income?", "David Simon", "", "You know, there might be some.  We've had some discussions with some retailers.  It's very lumpy.  I think our total budget for the year will be met and  probably not exceeded.  But somewhere in that \u2013 I don't remember that number off the top of my head.  ", "", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "", "It's about 15 million for the year. ", "David Simon", "", "Yes.  It should be in line with that.  I mean, again, it's a tough number to both budget and to see what ultimately comes up.  ", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay.  Lastly, just related to leasing spreads, I noticed the mall portfolio leasing spreads came down a bit to 17 from 25.  I'm just wondering into the second half of the year, do you expect to hold at that 17% long-term rate or do you think that will come under more pressure as we head into the second half?  ", "David Simon", "", "I think it should.  We should finish the year pretty consistent with that.  I mean, it's still about six bucks, maybe under a little pressure.  I mean getting the historical rent spreads that we've had over the last three or four years is obviously harder to do today than it was in, you know, the first half of '08 and '07, etc. ", "But we still feel confident that we've got leases under market, and our goal is to get that five, six bucks.  We've actually outperformed over the last three or four years.  Our goal is to perform kind of where we thought.  ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "", "Yeah, me Mark, I, this is Steve again.  I'd say if you'd go back and look at our history over the last, you know, seven or eight years, we've kind of always said 15% to 25%.  David is right.  Over the last couple of years, we've been at the higher end of that range.  But given the economic climate that's out there for us to be at the lower level of that historical range, it's not surprising.", "Mark Biffert \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And then with the Elwood Centers, I mean, do you expect to stay at that elevated level or because of reduced tourism or other pressures, do you expect that to compress as well?", "David Simon", "", "Well, I \u2013 look \u2013 I think the number was really outstanding for the quarter.  So it will probably have some reduction on that.  But that we still feel very \u2013 as we said to you at the beginning of the year, we felt like we could deliver the mall business at less than up to 1%.  We're at the 1%.  We'll see how the \u2013 we still have some things out our control, including percentage rents, what the sales are, bad debt expense associated with bankruptcy and the like.", "Still feel like, hey, we're going to be able to deliver it within that range.

But it's \u2013 look, I think a lot of retailers jumped on that bandwagon very early and some have jumped off but not everyone has jumped off.

Now obviously, lease expirations, that's free game for everybody involved.

I think maybe Jay had asked this but just to try and follow up, as you said here today, it's probably fair to say that most of the '09 leasing is done at this point but can you tell us what percentage of the '10 leasing might be completed and how would that compare to a year ago when we were sitting in '08 looking at the '09 leasing?", "David Simon", "", "So far, through June 30, we're about 30% through '10.

One, and I think we mentioned this in our last call, we are not aggressively looking at renewals in the back half of '10 because as David has indicated, that's over a year away and we're waiting to see, hopefully, some stabilization in sales trends and more optimistic and constructive outlook for more retailers.

That's not to say we won't use it and be a participant in it, but at this point we're not active.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, and then thank you, and then same sort of thing on General Growth, are you still mostly monitoring that would you say, or is there anything new to report on what you are doing with General Growth?", "David Simon", "Nothing currently to report, new.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, and last thing for me guys, is Domain, could you give us an update on the progress there with regard to the various pieces you expect to come on line with in the next six or eight months?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "", "Absolutely, in October of this year the expansion Dix is opening.  Then in February of '10 Dillard's Village Road Show opens.   We have an apartment complex and a joint venture with Columbus Realty in GE pension fund.  That's opening in the fourth quarter of this year, and then in February along with the anchors we anticipate opening about 85% leased and we'll have those tenants open over the next month or two months in the first and second quarter of next year.", "And then in March of '10, we're opening our Westin Hotel at Domain in a venture with White development.  So it's coming together.  We've got a nice line up of tenants primarily focused on the juniors category and food because we pretty much did not put a lot of juniors in the initial section of Domain, so they were anxious to show off in this section, so it's coming together.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan \u2013 Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "", "Thanks.  David I respect your reluctance to talk about some of the opportunities as it relates to Liberty and what you might do or might not do, but I was hoping you could talk about relative value as you think about deploying some of your large cash pile in the U.S. versus perhaps other parts of the world including the U.K.? ", "When I look at Liberty I see a company trading at an implied cap rate after making all the adjustments you need to make to compare U.K. with U.S., an implied cap rate that starts with a five and then I look at Simon and I see a stock that trades at an implied cap rate starting with an eight.", "We saw a recent deal announced that suggests the cap rates for some of the best models in the United States are probably in the cap rate range in the sevens.  And as I think about you protecting a position in Liberty, considering perhaps expanding that position, how should I think about relative value?", "I get it that there's scarcity value for the Liberty portfolio, but it's the company that certainly has challenges ahead with 10% of its tenants in bankruptcy, a bunch of high loan devalued maturities about to mature over the next couple of years, and then finally seeing property NOI dropping even faster than expected pace.  Why should I be excited about that kind of company and implied cap rate in the fives versus what you might be able to do with your cash in the U.S?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think, Jim, you articulated right on why we are where we are as opposed to doing more than what we've done, and there's no question in our mind that as we look at external opportunities, we do like the long-term prospects potentially of the U.K. market, but our primarily focus will be in the U.S. and it won't be in Asia and it won't be in Europe.  It'll be here.  ", "We do think we can all most value here with our platform.  We do think the opportunities are \u2013 there are more opportunities that exist there and I think there are \u2013 our view would be that that's the primary focus.", "Now Liberty, we think we will recoup our investment and beyond that there's not a lot that I can say.  We do think there are elements of what we can do that might add to what they do there, but that's \u2013 that is what it is and we'll see how that shakes out.", "But our intentions if we do look to deploy external capital we do think there are great opportunities in the U.S.   And certainly on a risk adjusted basis of what we can add value to it's hard to argue that point, so, nothing that you've said isn't what we've grappled with, and we're not pleased that we're currently under water, but the worst thing we could do is try to recoup that in a not so intelligent way.", "Jim Sullivan \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "That's very helpful.  Thank you for that, and then Steve, a follow up on the current mortgage environment.  You mentioned that the current rates are in the low sevens to eight.  You know what we've seen over the many months is that capital is available for malls but only the highest quality, only for the best sponsors, underwritten at fairly low loan-to-values and very conservative underwriting with respect to NOI.  ", "Is that still the case as you look at the deals you're looking at today?  Could you get financing, mortgage financing on a, say, B plus mall or lower if you didn't provide corporate recourse?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I would say this, Jim.  I would say the sponsor matters a lot.  So for us I would say yes, and in fact we are in the market now with what I would describe as a couple of middle market malls, and there is money out there available, yes.  ", "Now in terms of the leverage, and the underwriting, I think it's still relatively conservative.  You are seeing debt yields in kind of the mid-teens, going to translate into about 50% LTV, but I think as the \u2013 especially the insurance companies that are doing on-balance sheet lending, I think the quality of the sponsor is very, very important these days.  And as a result of that we're seeing very good interest even in assets other than our top tier assets.", "Jim Sullivan \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "And just to clarify that, the sponsorship is important because these insurance companies are asking you for recourse or their non-recourse deals where they want to know that you're behind it versus somebody else? ", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "The latter; non-recourse deals where they want to know that a quality operator with a stable balance sheet and a long contract record is behind it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Rick, retailers and retail developers arguably got into trouble expanding into markets where I guess all the opportunity was predicated on household growth, which obviously isn't happening today.  What's your sense, and I guess what are you hearing from retailers about their longer term plans beyond 2009 or 2010 as they think about unit counts a few years down the road?", "Do you think they retreat from those types of markets over time?  Is this just a blip or do you think there's maybe there's been an overreaction where they actually look \u2013 I'll call it concentrate in the more infill markets in this next up cycle, if you will, for retail?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "", "Based on the conversations that David and I have been having with these retailers, they are viewing their new store, new development program very guardedly.  They are going to be very cautious deploying capital, and where they're going to deploy that capital they're going to do it where there is high degree of certainty as to results and the highest degree of certainty as to results is deploying that capital to open new stores in proven assets and proven markets.  ", "And we're seeing that, that there's still demand for our proven assets and proven markets.  And I think that the retailers' attitude is reflected by the fact that when you look at the new development pipeline it's non-existent.  It's almost \u2013 it's the lowest it's been in 20 years.  And I believe that is a silver lining to our current situation as retailers do get more comfortable with allocating capital for new stores that is going to benefit the existing supply because there are going to be virtually no new supply available to them.", "", "Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "And David, I know you've got to take the acquisition opportunities that sort of come to you because the mall industry is not exceptionally large I guess in the number of opportunities available, but given what Rick was just saying, do you have a unique view I guess about the markets you'd like to see your marginal dollar go into here in the U.S.?  I mean if put differently if some malls come to market in metros that are out there, has your appetite changed to the better or worse than maybe two years ago because your view on those metros has changed markedly?", "David Simon", "", "Absolutely.  There are certainly markets that are \u2013 you would have to factor in and underwrite their current situation because though they may be good long term markets, they're going to be dislocated for a reasonable period of time.  And I think a lot of those were the kind of the typical markets where you had a lot of new retail development that has not stuck.  ", "And I absolutely think you've got to factor that in because those are markets that are a little bit dislocated.  And again they're great long term markets I think eventually, but you've going to have to be really smart in terms of how you would underwrite those.  ", "And how you underwrite any deal, I mean today underwriting potential NOI is going to be a challenge for anybody that wants to make an external investment.  Thankfully we're equipped to do that, but I do think that the markets themselves are very important ultimately in where you want to deploy capital.", "Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "What are examples maybe of the larger metro markets where you think it could take longer for them to recover?", "David Simon", "", "Well if I say I might offend some people so I'll, again I'll defer but I mean I'm sure you have a sense of where.  A lot of them are where there's a lot of new retail development plopped into the market.  Or in fact there's new development going on right now that's got to be leased up.  I'll let you draw the appropriate conclusions.", "Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "", "I guess just a last question, too, before I let you, I guess, get your lunch.  What are capital partners telling you about their geographic preferences?  And I guess are they holes that have emerged or deepened given where they want capital to flow?  And I guess related to that have you heard any private equity funds trying to assemble funds to pursue mall assets?", "David Simon", "", "Well, there's definitely an interest to deploy capital in good retail.  I don't think they, I think they look at just like we would.  I think they're looking at the individual asset and its position in the market place.  They have not redlined any particular market as far as we know.  It's more asset by asset review.", "Jeffrey Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Any private equity guys do you think gearing up you think to go after mall business assets?", "David Simons", "", "Well, some of them have a lot of capital.  The good news is the mall business is always been operational intensive so it's been harder for them to justify a lot of significant bets.  I mean they've always wanted to partner with an operator.  I don't see that, certainly in today's environment where retail relationship is critical, I don't see that changing at all.", "Operator", "", "That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call.  I now would like to turn the call over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "", "Listen, I think the questions today were very good and we appreciate you asking them to us, and we appreciate your interest.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation at which time you may participate for pressing star one (Operator Instructions)", "I will turn the presentation over to your host for today, Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Shelly Doran", "Thank you. Welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical maybe deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to variety of risks and uncertainty.", "Please refer to our filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these terms. Acknowledging the fact that this call maybe webcast for some time to come, we believe it\u2019s important to note that the call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date October 30, 2009. ", "The company\u2019s supplemental information package was filed earlier today as Form 8-K. This filing is available via mail or email and it is posted on the Simon website in the Investor Section under financial information, quarterly supplemental packages.", "Participating in today\u2019s call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; ", "Rich Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning everybody. We reported diluted FFO per share of $1.38 for the quarter, which was $0.05 higher than the first call, and once again, we\u2019re pleased with our financial and operational performance. Occupancy in all of our domestic platforms is up sequentially from 6/30/09, Mills was up a 150 basis points and Regional Mall and Premium Outlet Centers increased 50 basis point and Community, Center, Lifestyle platforms increased 40 basis points.", "We saw a decline in the Regional Mall retail sales in the third quarter as compared to third quarter of \u201808 with comparable sales as of September 30 were $430, the decline in sales for September over September was much lower than any month year-to-date. Preliminary reports from retailers regarding October have been encouraging. We believe our retailers will have a decent holiday season.", "Premium Outlet comparable sales were relatively stable in the third quarter at $492 per square foot, down only $1 from 6/30/09, and we actually were up in September on a comparable sales per square foot, Mall leasing spreads were $4.04 for the first nine months of 2009, average base rent was at 9/30/09 was $40.05, up 2% for the year earlier period.", "Premium outlet releasing spread continues to be strong at $9.25 per square foot for the first nine months of \u201809. Average base rent for the outlets at 9/30/09 was $32.95 per square foot up from the year earlier period. Comp property NOI growth for the first nine months of 2009, was up six tenths of a percent for the Malls and NOI growth has been impacted by higher bad debt expense resulting from tenant bankruptcies, as well as overdraft due to lower tenant sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 yet we are still up over the year and our Premium Outlet portfolio comp property NOI was 6.5% for the first nine months.", "Let me just turn to capital markets and reflect a touch SPG returned capital markets in August with $500 million principal amount of five year senior unsecured notes they were priced to yield 5.46% the maturity. Our third quarter capital activities also included $400 million mortgage financing for three malls, additionally redeemed 40 million of preferred units the weighted average rate of just under 8%.", "Beginning of \u201809 there was an incredible amount of uncertainty over the ability of capital and either the secured and unsecured markets during our call late January when we discussed environment which was unlikely that we would initial in the bond market and we might need to be paid insuring bonds with our credit facility and the secured debt financing would be difficult.", "Markets have significantly improved from the first quarter and we worked very intelligently in the execution of capital markets activity in 2009. The volume of completed and in process transactions is considerable put the equity that we have raised aside we have thus for issued three unsecured bond offerings totaling $1.75 billion. We have completed or expect to complete before year end approximately $3.3 billion of secured financing comprised of new loans as well as refinancing.", "Our share of those financing and secured financing is approximately $2 billion. First a few details on these new loans. We have completed 18 loans, totaling $1.5 billion and $1.25 billion of that was from life companies. Our share of the completed new loans was $1.1 billion, weighed average interest rate on the loans was 7.2% and the weighted average life was seven years. By year end we expect to close an additional seven new refinancing tolling $450 million of which our shares a 150 million.", "Eight new lenders on these new financings are new secured capital providers to SPG. In addition, we had the contractual rate or renegotiated loan extensions of 1.3 billion in 2009 our share of that was $750 million. Our spreads of continued to rally, CDS spreads are quoted currently at 150 beds which is rally from 550 basis points from the highs in early March in fact was the highest of which was in December of \u201808 at least 750 basis points. ", "As of September 30, 2009 we had $4 billion of cash on hand, including our share of joint venture cash, which is approximately $11.50 per share. Availability and our corporate credit facility is $3 billion, generating illiquidity of position of $7 billion.", "Now let me talk generally about retail, retailers have started to gain their footing and certain retailers are growing store counts including Aeropostale, Gachi, Apple, the Buckle, California Pizza Kitchen, Fresh, Forever 21, H&M Michael Korda and Red Robin, to name a few in a number of predominantly outlet tenants are also increasing their store counts. We have a significant amount of leasing volume in our pipeline over 500 deals and 8 million square feet of leases in process across all of our domestic platforms.", "In particular, it is good to note the volume of big box activity has significantly increased in the second half of the year. Since mid July we have completed 20 big box deals across the four platforms and discussions are underway on 20 to 30 more retailers will include Forever 21, H&M Dave & Buster\u2019s, Bed Bath & Beyond. We are seeing a slight quality of the big box retailers they want to be in malls, outlets, mills or strip centers where they benefit from shopper quality and traffic.", "Now let me turn the turn to guidance we increased the low end and maintained the high end of our 2009 FFO guidance taking into account the $0.03 diluted impact of our $500 million note issuance, which was not included in our previous guidance that we issued at the end of this second quarter. The current FFO guidance therefore is $5.40, $5.50 and of course you\u2019ll recall that includes 42% impairment from our holdings in Liberty non-cash.", "We have a solid in financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I\u2019m proud of that. Our year-to-date activity has produced good results in a very, very challenging difficult market. We remain focused on operations and we continue to believe that we are well positioned for growth, given our balance sheet and access for capital.", "With that said, we\u2019re ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from [Kunal] - Morgan Stanley. ", "Kunal - Morgan Stanley", "Could you provide color on where you are currently with respect to your 2010 lease expirations and on that basis how you feel about an expert next year?", "Rich Sokolov", "This is Rick. So far through September 30, 2009 to 2010 we\u2019re about 44% through our renewals and either excluded, we\u2019re in progress. We\u2019re making very good progress there. Compared that to September 30, 2008 we were about 53% through our \u201809 renewals and so we\u2019re a little bit behind, but part of that is the deliberate strategy on our part to delayed renewals that are coming up in the second half of 2010, because we believe we will have a more advantageous environment to negotiate those renewals.", "Kunal - Morgan Stanley", "Also, although there haven\u2019t been many transactions, it appears as a cap rates for B malls have moved, higher relative to A malls. Have you reconsider the possibility of stepping into the market acquire B quality malls either on your own or possibility in an institutional JV? ", "David Simon", "I guess the answer is, we look at everything that\u2019s available and if we like the property and we like the price and we like the growth characteristics, we\u2019ll take a hard look at it. ", "Kunal - Morgan Stanley", "Also do you have in the outlook for lease termination fees in Q4, whether they will be materially higher or lower, which is the current run rate? ", "Steve Sterrett", "Year-to-date, \u201809 compared to year-to-date \u201808 is generally almost right on top of each other. There maybe a little bit more activity at the fourth quarter, but nothing that\u2019s going to move the needle in any significant way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christy McElroy - UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "Just looking at your mall releasing spreads, which forward from 17% in the first half to about 11% year-to-date, which could imply the spreads were flat to negative in Q3. Somewhat I understand your spreads are calculated based on store openings rather than leases sign.", "So what I\u2019m looking at is effectively a lagging spread number that reflect of leases signed three to six months ago, if I understand right. So what I\u2019m wondering is, given that you know where leases are being signed today. Was that flat to down number sort of an anomaly based on the mix of leases you were signing any time or is this a new run rate, such that you\u2019re no longer signing leases at a positive spread? ", "Rich Sokolov", "I mean it is positive $4 and it\u2019s all performing just about so far every one that I have seen. We\u2019ve always said its $5 to $6. We were going to be impacted. We\u2019re not immune to the economy, but we are proud of our for dollar spread. We still think that we have leases that are under market and I mean obviously negotiating REIT in a tough economic environment is more challenging, but the fact is it\u2019s a positive spread. I haven\u2019t seen that anywhere else and we\u2019re proud of that. ", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "Absolutely, but if you\u2019re backing into sort of a Q3 number, should we just not read into anything and just look at the nine month numbers?", "David Simon", "I think there is always a reaction to quarterly performance and real estate is better viewed over a longer period of time, but that\u2019s your job so I\u2019ll let you do that, but the fundamentals of our business have not changed. We are dealing with tough economic environment. It\u2019s realistic to assume that when you\u2019re in the process of negotiating leases in the tough economic environment, you\u2019re going to have to be sensitive to that it, but the fact of the matter is over a longer period of time, we think our leases are under market and will continue to prove that.", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "We saw that you took the management contract at the Galleria in Dallas from general growth are there any of their opportunities there? Can you speak generally about your strategies as it relates to third-party management?", "David Simon", "I guess, I would not say that we took it. We were asked, if we were interested and given it\u2019s a good market and a very good center, we decided, we also have a relationship with the owner and that was our primary focus. I do not think our strategy is to change. We will occasionally do it for people that we know and we have a relationship with, but beyond that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change. We are not out soliciting third-party management contracts. Occasionally, they\u2019ll come to us and given the relationship we have with certain institutional investors we\u2019ll consider it.", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "Lastly on the recovery ratio, I notice that it was a little bit above average in the quarter. In your efforts to reduce overall CAM on what percentage of your tenants are on fixed CAM? Is that helping your recovery ratio? So expenses were down, but you\u2019re still getting the recoveries from a portion of your tenants?", "Steve Sterrett", "We\u2019re about 80% converted to fixed CAM right now, so you are exactly right as we have done a good job in managing the costs, 80% of that benefit fall into our bottom.", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "Just a follow-up on that, I mean to what extent are you reducing CAM expenditures that you typically capitalize? Could that potentially reduce your recovery ratios? Is the recoveries that you\u2019re getting from tenants that not that it\u2019s a huge percentage with 20%, but the tenants that are not on fixed CAM that recovery declines.", "Steve Sterrett", "It\u2019s not meaningful, I\u2019m we\u2019re managing the capital expenditures at the Mall it seem where we\u2019ve always been.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "I was wondering if you could comment on the credit provisions that you took we saw that they decline substantially. Is there anything behind that or you\u2019re just assuming that you\u2019re not going to see as much increase in bad debt or if you can maybe provide a color on that?", "Steve Sterrett", "We look at the different categories of receivables and put a reserve them that bidding of what category that they fall in? Interestingly, enough our receivables were actually down third quarter of \u201809 compared to third quarter of \u201808, so you see that in the small bad debt expense\u2026", "David Simon", "I would say, we collected more cash than we had already expensed probably in the first couple of quarters and that\u2019s because, we\u2019ve been aggressive in collecting rent. That\u2019s the business and I think that\u2019s partly because, there were a handful of tenants that were really uncertain about the world. They feel a little bit better and they\u2019re starting to pay their bills in a more timely manner, which really excites me.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "So it\u2019s your expectation that line will stay at a fairly low number for the next few quarters at least?", "Steve Sterrett", "All it takes is one unknown bankruptcy, it\u2019s part of our guidance, we\u2019re still anticipating kind of the difficult environment that exists and it can move up and down a little bit, but it\u2019s really a function of the first couple of quarters, we reserved a lot of expenses because they were slow in paying bills and I made sure, they paid as much as what we were entitled to.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "I was going through your top 10 list and notice that you asked about 23 stores quarter-over-quarter and from your remarks earlier in the call you did obviously mentioned that there was some tenants replacing that I am just wondering what part of your portfolio, is it the bottom third that you are seeing a lot of these top tenants pullout of and just maybe give some color around that?", "David Simon", "Well, leasing the challenge, but we are up from the second quarter we\u2019re down from last year and it could be a function of the sales performance of a certain retailer and certain part of the market. It could be a function that they\u2019re in eight property and they cannot afford to free.", "So, again I think you have got a drill down to the specific retail asset to do that, but it has been a combination of regional issues and/or not been able to afford the rent or the fact is that we would rather have this space back empty then to keep the renters that we could probably kept the tenant for so.", "There is a handful of reasons why that happens. We cannot rely on to just one tenant to drive our occupancy. We\u2019re hitting the streets were scaling the country and we\u2019re looking for growth tenants and we\u2019re doing okay given the environment.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "Then lastly, just of trying to get an update on the acquisition front in terms of what opportunities are seeing, is pressing adjusted and the opportunities if you looking at both domestically and internationally and do you think that you could potentially be able to close anything before the year end or is this more likely a 2010 story?", "David Simon", "Well, where the years, I am thinking about ten right now frankly we are evaluating a number of opportunities, we\u2019ll see what happens but we can be very patient. In addition, I will say that I do not think on our plate on the acquisition side is any international activity at this point. We\u2019re focused domestically we\u2019re looking at a few opportunities, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that, nine to do anything in nine would is probably not going to occur.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Just a question on the average base rent and I think it\u2019s effectively may bring the full circle on the lease spreads. The average base rents sequentially went down by about 60 basis points and I know it\u2019s up 2% year-over-year. Did that reflect sort of this at least potential negative of these spreads that were lease in the quarter or rent concessions or what else maybe impacting that average base rent number. Which and I know it small, but it went from 4029 sequentially down 4005.", "Steve Sterrett", "Michael, it is Steve. I mean there are a lot of things that are going to impact that as David talked about in his prepared remarks on our occupancy is up year-over-year in a little bit and the mix of stores that close that\u2019s an example and what those tenants were pain coming out of the mix would be another factor. So, you cannot look at it only in the context and try to impute what it might lease in square perspectives.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "I would just point out, I mean that quarter analysis it can be impacted by mixed more than, a year amount would be. So, I know it\u2019s a year-to-date number, but you just can not overreact in terms of that at this point like I said I think the longer picture is, yet it\u2019s getting tougher and has been tougher, to maintain our historical lease spreads. There is no denying that and yet we\u2019re still able to Eka deposit of spread and positive NOI growth but is it a challenge.", "Yes. Do I see it turning negative? The answer is no, but it\u2019s a volatile market and sales, and the mood of the tenant is important and we\u2019ve been in a very tough retail environment. The good news on all of that is that, this is no guarantee, but the mood from our clients is better and they\u2019re thinking more about \u201810 and hopefully, they\u2019ll have a positive holiday season and the store count will grow in 2010, but there\u2019s a level of uncertainty out there. ", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "I think you mentioned that your peers have done this quarter and giving with the effective was 4% rent relief off of the total NOI. You do not have that going on? ", "Steve Sterrett", "Michael, at the margin there could be a little bit of impact there. Our 2009 rent relief in total will be under $10 million and into $7 million to $8 million range. As I think we said on the call last quarter, we haven\u2019t seen much of it year-to-date, so it\u2019s a little bit back and weighted as you look at the impact on the average fees rent. It could have a nominal impact, but it\u2019s a small number in the context of the size of our income statements.", "David Simon", "Let\u2019s talk about rent relief just philosophically for a second if we could. Our view on rent relief is that, if you\u2019re in national tenant and you have a lease you have to abide by it and occasionally be modified that statement if we think that the tenant is on the verge of a bankruptcy or something along those lines and we think our help, obviously this is not just us. It takes essentially the landlord community as well as their suppliers. We work together to try and keep the retailer out of bankruptcy.", "We have done that with one national tenant of any size this year. Now, look when the lease expires, all bets are off, right. They\u2019re going to try and get the lowest rent they can and we\u2019re going to try and get the highest rent and in some cases we win, in some cases they win. Most of the time to tried to figure it out, so that it works to both parties advantage.", "Now, let\u2019s talk about local retailers. Local retailers, frankly if they\u2019re screaming and we don\u2019t have an immediate use, we may grand rent relief of a little bit more generously on the local tenant, but again that would be driving the number more than in the national regional tenet. ", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Just in terms of the $4 billion of cash. I know that you obviously looking for opportunities, but if nothing came up that was suitable to you, what\u2019s sort of the Tom timeframe were you would start to pay down debt or maybe buyback debt and the reason I ask, because obviously the FFO impact can be quite significant on what assumption that you will make? ", "David Simon", "We\u2019ve already earmarked in our own mind next year a lot of that capital payback debt, but right now as some going into the market and paining a premium for our debt, which we\u2019re not overly excited about doing. We will do a couple things, obviously we have some unsecured bonds, which will payoff with cash and then we will unencumbered assets next year as either of those mature and/or come out to their window, where we would incur a prepayment penalty.", "Now, most of that, if you look at the schedules a little more backend weighted, but we are suffering through read somewhere that someone is getting 50 basis points on their cash. We\u2019re getting less than that. So I\u2019m going to call that person and find out, why they\u2019re getting 50 versus our 30 to 40.", "They maybe buying auction very preferred to all, but I hope to got we\u2019re not. So we will earmark that, but it\u2019s going to be for wholly-owned assets, where we don\u2019t incur prepayment penalty in our unsecured bonds, but unfortunately most of that stuff is coming out made to the end of next year. ", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Just one last one, I think you maybe comment before with international acquisition of change, it really have anything on the tender at the moment, is that a function of, like US dollar or are there other things going on there? Is it is the lack of opportunities you\u2019re seeing? ", "David Simon", "It\u2019s a function of number of things. I do think the weakness in the dollar makes obviously a much challenging proposition. It\u2019s a function of we think there are going to be or there are better opportunities in the U.S. Also, we have created a value in our absent unfortunately liberty, but we created value and our international activities.", "We\u2019re accepting our competitive advantages there and until we have that assessment done, I think we\u2019re better off focusing here on the domestic opportunities, which are a little more powerful at better values. If you bet wrong on the dollar right now, you could get destroyed and we don\u2019t want to see that and I just think ultimately, there\u2019s going to be more. I feel more comfortable with the pricing here versus elsewhere that the opportunities are better in the U.S. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa - ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Couple of questions, David, could you just go back to your early comments about the sales trend. You mentioned that September was much lower, but I don\u2019t think you quantify that? Could you give us some monthly progression of these higher sales\u2026?", "David Simon", "The outlet business was up $1.5 million and the mall business was down $5 million. I think the next question is why we\u2019re down a little bit more than some of our peer groups? We do have more exposure to Florida and California than probably a lot of people to understand and then I think that\u2019s a great long term position to be in, because those are clearly greet long term economies and great population migration and all sorts of those demographic items.", "They have been hit the hardest and Florida, has suffered more than people realize and I believe we\u2019ve also obviously had some exposure to Las Vegas, which has been hit recently hard. So I think when you look at those areas that I probably why we\u2019re just a little bit higher sales decline and then in other top mall companies. ", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Then you mentioned that October was encouraging. I guess it was your expectation or do you believe that you could be in the positive camp in Q4 here?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s very interesting and I\u2019ll let Rick comment on this. We\u2019ve had a well known retail analyst. I don\u2019t know if she wants a plug or not, but we probably should asked here. She came and presented to our Board yesterday. We also had a major CEO come and see us. Other major retailers come to see us, Monday I guess. They\u2019re feeling better now. A lot of it depends on how they plan their inventory", "The fact of the matter is that comps compared to last year still could be down just because they have a lot less inventory, but with that results to be very, very pleased because their margins are going to stay intact and I will tell you just what I know and what we\u2019ve asked. There are some that are planning up. There are some that are planning down, but they all feel good about the business. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026?", "Rich Sokolov", "Just a little more specific, the people that we\u2019ve been talking to, their inventories are down anywhere from 15% to 22% from last year. So while that is not going to drive top line sales, they are much more optimistic because they have less inventory they have to push out the door, they\u2019re going to be able to be much more disciplined on their pricing and drive a lot more margin improvement and most importantly, cash flow.", "One of the areas that this is really in every size they\u2019re caring less of the same size and every one feels very well positioned and if in fact there\u2019s a slight up tick in consumer demand. You\u2019re going to see substantially better price performance, margin performance and cash flow performance. ", "David Simon", "I guess, what I would say to you is, it\u2019s a little bit what\u2019s happening in sales year-to-date. I mean it may come in with less comps, but they maybe tickled pink by its and unless costs are down 20% that\u2019s not going to be good, but if they\u2019re down and again it depends on the retailer. If they\u2019re down 5% to 6% they maybe really happy with that and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve just to be careful on how we look at that number. ", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "I guess to that point, Rick, you said your renewals, I guess kind of 44% done for the business or kind of your \u201810 and that\u2019s a little bit behind kind of where you were last year. I guess what level of sales would get you kind of excited or maybe even disappointed about kind of the continued leasing velocity, is there sort of a breakpoint that you think about?", "Rich Sokolov", "The retailers that we\u2019re deal with are certainly focused on sales, but they are for more focus today on profitability and cash flow, which leads to capital allocation for new stores or remodeled stores upon renewal. What we face in 2009 was most retailers saying, \u201cWe\u2019re preserving our cash, because we\u2019re unsure about our line and we\u2019re unsecured about our ability to finance.\u201d", "Now that they have better cash margins than better cash on deposit, we\u2019re now hearing that they are allocating money for new open to buys and I think David gave you a list in his comments of those stores that are looking at that. So I think it is going to be less correlated with sales and more correlated with profitability and cash flow generation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from of Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "David, you mentioned using cash to pay down unsecured and pay down additional debt. Just two parts of the questions, I guess one is do you have a deleveraging goal and you already at six times I guess net debt to EBITDA, but do you see that trending lower and obviously you mentioned the positive impact that\u2019s had on your cost of capital thus far this year? The second question, I guess can you speak to the dividend. What you think about reinstating at some point the cash dividend?", "David Simon", "I think obviously that we have always fell for even with kind of the market correction that we are in good strong financial shape, but you can never be too conservative in today\u2019s fall to world. So the answer to that is that I do think we will continue to deleverage. Other than, Jay, I think that if we see an opportunity that could add value to our shareholders. We could see a temporary spike up and then obviously towards trying to get down to where we are. So we feel really very good where we are. I don\u2019t think we would need to go lower, but I think we want to be as stable as we can.", "Now, with respect to the dividend, I\u2019ll tell you right clear and unequivocally where we\u2019re headed, obviously I say this subject to Board and discussed with the Board and it\u2019s obviously subject to market conditions, but we plan on paying cash next year and that\u2019s our goal. We do not see anything right now that would dexterous from that goal.", "It will be around are taxable income, which is kind of around where we are this year, if you add it all up, maybe it depends on the transactions and if we can accelerate certain tax depreciation and it gives a little complicated, but our goal would be going for next year to clear the dividend $0.60. I think we would look to start paying cash at that level or near that level next year with no common equity. ", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Then just a second question, can you give us some sense of just the dollar volume. What you\u2019re considering for acquisition to this point? Is it $1 billion dollar range, you\u2019re talking about $5 billion and also can you give us some sense of the returns? I know returns clearly you\u2019re looking at higher returns six months ago, but how you\u2019re thinking is today?", "David Simon", "We\u2019ve got to have higher returns. There\u2019s no question about that. We are in a riskier world and we would expect to achieve those if we deploy capital. Jay, I really can\u2019t do that, because if I gave you, it just tough for us to really go. We just have to see obviously if we do anything, we\u2019ll lead it out, we\u2019ll have a chance to discuss it, but at this point I cannot shed much light on that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill. ", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "I just want to take a look at the temporary tenants for this holiday season. Is it pretty much on par with the amount of tenants that you had last year and what percent of NOI comes from the temporary tenants that setup for the holidays?", "Steve Sterrett", "I will just comment on the velocity of that business and we\u2019ve been able to maintain that business pretty constant with last year. We have been aggressively canvassing all of the properties in our markets as David mentioned, because we think this is about market share and we believe there are many compromised properties operating in the same markets as our malls and we want to bring in the tenants into our properties. So they can see if they can do business and just increase our market share, which will in turn increase our pricing power. ", "David Simon", "I just would add that the cart business, we\u2019re looking at business in two areas. We have the cart business and we have temporarily income, when we lose inline store and we put a temporary tenant in that inline store. You walk a thousand miles and you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.", "I will say this the cart business, we\u2019re making the deals, but rent is a little under pressure there and we\u2019re having to do a little more volume to makeup for the last rent, because it kind of obviously Christmas last year was disappointing for that tenant and so we\u2019re turning and burning a little bit more than we\u2019ve had to do in the past.", "We think we can bring it in and totality kind of where we were last year. This is a business, a lot of it\u2019s a cash business in the sense that you cannot really base a lot of it, and there are a number of national tenants that claim that business as well. We\u2019ve made of some of it by bringing a new uses like, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read about the toys\u2026", "Steve Sterrett", "We\u2019ve about 25, toys are up seasonal stores that seem to be initially performing very well for them and we hope to be able to grow that into permanent stores and have them comeback into the malls in a long term basis. ", "David Simon", "As long as, Vornado doesn\u2019t negotiate the rent with them will be fine. So that business is challenging. We\u2019re doing a lot more volume to makeup for the softness in rent, but there is an unknown. Again, this is all on the margin for us, but there\u2019s a little bit of an unknown in terms of how we deliver for year end.", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "In terms of which part is more challenging filling, vacant inline or filling the carts and also just looks kind of NOI, comes from? ", "David Simon", "It\u2019s really per cart rental.", "Rich Sokolov", "It\u2019s not even so much getting the carts least. It\u2019s getting the pushback on the rents there. ", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "What about success in filling the inline, is that pretty much on par with last year?", "David Simon", "Yes, that\u2019s right. ", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Then just a final question is probably more for Steve. You talked about unsecured, you talked about secured, what are your thoughts on converts and is that an area that you\u2019d look at or you guys with stick with more traditional sort of five, seven, tenure unsecured debt. ", "Steve Sterrett", "We have had and actually still do have converts in the capital structure. We did in a public deal. They typically have been issued as a bridge security as part of an acquisition. The market is very attractive right now, but as we talked about with a couple earlier calls we\u2019ve got $4 billion in cash that we\u2019re sitting on today. So it\u2019s not like we have a ready use for the proceeds, but it is a market that\u2019s a very open, very attractive right now and something that we\u2019re clearly paying attention to it. ", "Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Can you give us a sense of pricing? ", "Steve Sterrett", "Yes, our coupon would be today sub three with a premium of probably 30 percentages. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt - Banc of America. ", "Craig Schmidt - Banc of America", "Looking over the last four quarters, you\u2019re same store NOI has been more resilient than your mall peers. I\u2019m wondering if there was one fact that you might attribute that to? ", "David Simon", "It\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one factor. I just think, Craig, we\u2019re focused individuals.", "Craig Schmidt - Banc of America", "It looks like you picked up about 250,000 in occupancy in the mills. I\u2019m wonder if that\u2019s related to the big box comments and if could name some of boxes that came in? ", "Steve Sterrett", "In fact we have and there have been a lot of activity in mills, in the big boxes. As you know when that platform the box square footage and the small shop was included in their occupancy. We have brought in the last nine months two Neiman Marcus last calls. The outlet Christmas Tree Shops, Bed, Bath & Beyond, H&M, Best Buy, I mean these properties are very well located in our Forever 21. I think that the point that David made in his comments about the flight to quality.", "What we\u2019re seeing is that these big box users now understand that they are going to be advantaged by getting the incremental traffic that they get in a mills environment, while still having their own entering in their own parking field and visibility as opposed to being in a smaller math strips center. So we\u2019re finding a lot more interest in the boxes that become available. We\u2019re also in the process of making deals with [Swede Lake] 10, 3:15 and Legoland that are part of Maryland and that will also just add market share to the properties. ", "Craig Schmidt - Banc of America", "Also if I take the bed debt fourth quarter same store sales are positive? ", "Steve Sterrett", "Craig, there are a number of retailers that feel that way, but the world is volatile, so we will moves better from them for sure. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller - JP Morgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan", "Just going back to acquisitions for a second, your comments a couple minutes ago about, if you do something you\u2019ll see leverage stickup a little bit, but you would certainly laid out, it doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like a pipeline of smaller one off deals and it sounds like something bigger in scale. Am I reading a little too much into that or is that to think about\u2026? ", "David Simon", "The answer is, we\u2019ve identified roughly 30-ish recent new lifestyle centers that are in distress. It\u2019s interesting because we thought maybe that would be a great opportunity. Rick and I have gone over and there\u2019s maybe one or two that we would pursue and I think historically, we have done our staff. Over the last few years it\u2019s been on the bigger scale. So I guess if there are those opportunities, it\u2019s logical to conclude that it will probably be more of that than the individual ones.", "There\u2019s not a lot of individual stuff out there and distressed retail, I mean it\u2019s distressed for a reason and in some of it will be good long term. We\u2019re evaluating that, but we were one very surprised to know, there are at least thirty something in trouble that\u2019s a lot, because lot of these were high land values, high construction costs, but even more surprising is that at the end of the day, that 30 plus is only two or three that would let our whistle.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan", "Going back to the core for a second and I think you answered this in some prior questions, but when you were talking about the leasing spreads and I guess the comments were coming up about Q3. Is it fair if we\u2019re thinking about the 44% or 43% of leases that have been addressed for 2010, that if we look at a year-to-date basis for \u201809, the spreads of that what\u2019s coming upper in the vicinity of that year-to-date number, even if it\u2019s a little bit lower, but some were in the ballpark? ", "Rich Sokolov", "I think it\u2019s hard to generalize. As David said, every lease is its own story. Every property is its own story and while it\u2019s a significant amount of square footage that we are dealing with, there\u2019s no trend if we have rolled over is coming over in the weaker property that going to impact the spread, when the rollovers are coming over in a better property that\u2019s going to move it up. I think we have a large enough base and a large enough sample that as David said, we\u2019re still going to generate positive spreads and we\u2019re just very focused on running the business, making the best deal we can for each of these renewals.", "David Simon", "I think again, any moment point in time you\u2019ve got to be careful with it. I guess at any point in time you\u2019ve got to be careful to draw too much from. Partly, the reason we\u2019re below \u201809 versus \u201808 is that we want to wait.", "We\u2019re hopeful that a better Christmas season, holiday season will give more confidence to the retailer and we can negotiate a better deal, that\u2019s part of it. Some of it is, the retailer saying, \u201cListen, I want to see, how they are?\u201d We wouldn\u2019t be accurate saying that, it\u2019s all part of that strategy.", "Part of it is, they want to wait and see how they shakeout and the trend maybe working in our favor. Remember, \u201808 was different than \u201809 in terms of the mood for the retailer even though it certainly was not robust, but the retail world didn\u2019t end until kind of mid September.", "So we have those commitments they were pretty much done by the time that we reported the September 30 numbers. So it\u2019s tougher right now. We\u2019re confident that we still have the spread. The spread will come under pressure because we\u2019re dealing with a tough economic environment. There will be pressure on occupancy like we have seen in \u201809.", "Even with that said, because of where we are in the industry, we will continue to outperform our peer group, but we\u2019re not immune to the bigger picture right now and our results indicate it. I mean we are 60 basis points up, which some would feel good about. We want to be 300 basis points up. So we\u2019re feeling it, we\u2019re doing the best that we can in that tough environment, but certainly these numbers will feel pressure and you\u2019re seen it.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan", "Lastly, for Steve, if I look out in terms of secured debt coming to over the next couple of years, it seems like the malls that are almost certain to be unencumbered, you have Georgia, Forum Shops, Copley, any others that are on that list as well?", "David Simon", "That\u2019s the majority was, Michael, there could be another one or two in Nikon there, but for 2010 those are certainly the ones that we focused on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus.", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus", "When you look at the GDP same store leasing numbers that are running negative 20%, they have commented that they don\u2019t believe your numbers and I don\u2019t want to beat this force to debt on the leasing spreads this quarter and I understand your hesitancy on a single quarter number, but the third quarter denominator is the biggest quarter in terms of how you report leasing spread?", "Given that you were up 17% year-to-date at the end of June and now about of 10%, it would appear that you mathematically have to have a negative number in the third quarter, so you\u2019re saying you have a high confidence level in the $4 spread, we\u2019ll see how that works going forward and all we have at this point is a one quarter trend line. What are we to make GDP overlay against to you, simply that they are not a good counterparty to the tenants anymore or having to give up rent compared to\u2026?", "David Simon", "David, you can ask them. I have no comment on that other than I think we\u2019ve answered that we asked and answered frankly other than what the spread has come under pressure. We\u2019re not denying that. We\u2019re still got a spread and we told you that the spread has always been kind of $5 to $6, we\u2019ve outperformed in a better economy.", "We\u2019re not quite getting the $5 spread in a tougher economy, it\u2019s still positive. We\u2019re not done with \u201810. We\u2019ll see how \u201810 shakes out. The good news is that the environment is getting better. So the pressure may subside to some extent, but I have no comments on somebody accusing us of that. I won\u2019t give that\u2026", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus", "You\u2019re obviously looking at GDP. Can you give us any comment on why you think there rent spreads are so negative?", "David Simon", "No, absolutely not.", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus", "With respect to mills, are there any remaining significant cleanup items with respect to that acquisition? Can you give us a status for example of the Class Action Suit that was filed a couple years ago?", "David Simon", "It is in a process of being dealt with according to our plan, but there\u2019s some technicalities associated with it, but it\u2019s pretty much in the rearview mirror for us.", "David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus", "Lastly, you had a couple of assets that went back to lenders this year appropriately, so as you look forward, how does your watch list look in terms of non-recourse givebacks?", "David Simon", "I think if it gets to that point it will be extremely, very much on the margin for us. Our preference would be to figure out, how to work with the lender, but it can\u2019t happen in all of the cases. So if in fact, it happens again, it will very much to be on the margin and there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "Rick, I want to follow-up on your point about strategy did the renewals for late 2010, is that premise on your expectation for a strong holiday and I guess particular economic outlook for 2010? I\u2019m just curious, what your assumptions are? Do you think that decision one way or the other?", "Rich Sokolov", "I think that it is lesser a function of the strong holiday with respect to sales, but there\u2019s an assumption that it\u2019s not really the assumption, it\u2019s based on talking to the retailers, which David and I are doing a whole lot of every date that they\u2019re feeling better and we have absolutely seen several instances of retailers that were in here in the second quarter asking for rent relief and modifications and then came back in the third quarter and said, \u201cLooks like, we\u2019re okay.\u201d We don\u2019t need anything. We\u2019re going to make it.", "Obviously, we believe that with their inventory policies with the cash flow generation with where we believe they will be on profitability in the fourth quarter. We will have a more welcoming environment to have those discussions with the retailers for the renewals in the back half of \u201810. I mean we\u2019re very focused on the 1/31/10 renewals. We\u2019re getting those done that.", "Tomorrow, we\u2019re putting that in place, but we\u2019re hopeful that these retailers will be in a better position and frankly, as I read all of the retail analysts and all of their ratings and their movements virtually all of the retailers are getting upgrades and more positive outlooks based on the expectation that there\u2019s going to be a more profitable Christmas, which may or may not be related to more sales.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "I guess then set our expectations for early 2010, do you think we\u2019ll see fewer store closers this time around post holiday season?", "Rich Sokolov", "While we certainly had had a significant number of bankruptcies in year-to-date in 2009 and I would certainly hope that we would be below that level in 2010.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "Then switch gears, David, there are a handful with outlet property portfolios in the market. Are those in interest you guys and does your experience tell you that Chelsea can be successful improving sales and profitability in outlets and I guess on the secondary markets?", "David Simon", "We\u2019re trying to negotiate with the team there now. So I don\u2019t want to give them any compliments. The outlet business has been a good business for us. I mean the outlet team has performed exceptionally well. So if we grow our business, we\u2019re going to look for quality retail real estate and it could be in outlets. It could be in malls.", "As I mentioned to you before, it could be in some of these lifestyle centers and we look at anything and everything. We don\u2019t have anyone desired to do malls ahead of outlets or outlets ahead of mall, it\u2019s really a function of where we think the best return as what we can do to that cash flow if we bought a center. So we haven\u2019t done a lot of acquisitions in the outlet business. We\u2019ve done in a little bit here and there, but it\u2019s really been mostly organic growth.", "Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo", "I could just ask one last question admittedly, it\u2019s probably a softball for you on the outlet business, but I\u2019ve covered you guys in Chelsea independently for a long time, I really can\u2019t recall a time when sales in that area were weak or even down. What do you think is driving that secular growth? I guess recall in outlet, because it seems deeper than just consumers signing value in recession right now. It\u2019s a mix to higher price point or do you see it in full traffic or do you think it just taking share from full price retail?", "David Simon", "The fact is, I think that it all boils down to the consumer and I just find it, they find the value of there. The value is more than just price. Its how the center looks, how the center field, what tenants to have, what merchandize they have, and I think we\u2019ve also change the paradigm a little bit with the outlet business by bringing it closer in.", "As an example, I was just in Cincinnati over the weekend and I visited our outlet center that we just opened and it was an old mall site, right. Now I remember, but I won\u2019t say which developer was trying to build a fashion center there, but anyway and it\u2019s well done, it\u2019s on the highway, it look beautiful. We still got some lease up to do there, but the stores had great merchandise, had great prices and I think the consumers just recognize that.", "What\u2019s interesting with what I have seen year-to-date and the Chelsea portfolio, we\u2019ve always had over the last three, four, five years wonderful growth in sales from the tourist centers. In fact, what we\u2019ve seen year-to-date is that tourist centers have taken a hit and if there\u2019s any reason why Chelsea, even though September, we\u2019ve reported down sales was because the tourist centers were taking a little bit more of a hit.", "The Florida of the world, Vegas and even something like Woodbury, but what was interested in the sales that kind of the Cincinnati, do you know that\u2019s on in the comp number, but we have Northern Indiana even between Indianapolis, I mean in those kind of that Chicago of the world. We\u2019re actually very, very strong for the outlet business. So I think it\u2019s long winded by saying, I think the consumer just, they\u2019d likes the plan, they like the value, they like the selection, they like the price.", "Rich Sokolov", "If I could just, one other thing if you look historically the other thing that I\u2019d like to think that we brought to the outlet industry is building a bigger impact centers in a race track configuration. So the square footage is larger. The absolute number of outlets in the United States is probably substantially reduced from where it was ten years ago.", "So you have more concentrated powerful properties, which is driving the results of those properties and frankly when you look at the capital situation today or the construction in the retail sector is that like a 20 year low and we certainly anticipate it will remain there and the lack of new supply can only hopefully help the demand side for the existing product.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "It\u2019s been with the thoughts that you just expressed on the development front, the Tanger guys are out there, saying that they have found one development to do and maybe some other ones and Rick, you were saying that tenants are getting a little bit more excited about the existing assets. I mean David, do you think the tenure moratorium that you sort of put on new development, maybe it\u2019s a bit too much and are you guys looking to break ground on anything?", "David Simon", "When I said that, I said he didn\u2019t hear me except for outlet. Somebody asked me what I was going to dress up this weekend for Halloween and I said, well I have kind of a ghoulish sense of humor sort of lifestyle developer. What I do think there\u2019s going to be some outlet development. I mean good example was, the besides predevelopment.", "As you know, Rich, we have our land in Merrimack, New Hampshire and we\u2019ll going to have a decision to make in this spring whether to build it. I have start building, I mean we\u2019re going to eventually built it, but whether we want to build this, start the spring of the tenure or wait in another year.", "Right now, I think right now the mood is to start next year, which frankly I would not have included anytime up until the last month or two so. The good news is we\u2019ll have time, we don\u2019t have to rush it, but I still think the amount of outlet development and it\u2019s still going to be very few and far between and that\u2019s okay, because I mean it will drive the demand in our existing centers, but there will be some.", "I think certainly that will come ahead of full price retail. A lot of people suddenly want to turn center they land the ahead into an outlet center and if the world continues to improve, we\u2019ll have to deal with that oncoming rush or desire to build, but the stuff that we will do will make economic sense.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "So, really nothing new from you guys maybe Merrimack obviously but nothing beyond that for 2010?", "Rich Sokolov", "No, the only thing David did allude to, the redevelopment we have built into our new projects with Chelsea, expansion opportunities and they are already laid out, already master plan and in the project self demand comes back and we can get an acceptable return, maybe a couple of those opportunities get move which further consolidates the square foot in our property prevent incremental competition in those market.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "", "The same kind of thing on the domain, we\u2019re are you guys with Domain in the future phase that you envisioned are those getting further down or they coming back lifer.", "David Simon", "Let me just clarify because it can be a little bit confusing. We\u2019ve both in our Domain Phase 1 which is Neiman, Macy\u2019s anchored and it was opened and what thought two years ago right. We\u2019re our Phase II is opening in the early spring and that is anchored by Dillard\u2019s, Dicks Village Road, Maisanos and the number small shop tenant.", "Dicks opening in actually earlier but that\u2019s opening in February of \u201810 and then there is another project that uses the Domain name that another developer is looking to develop, but we have no financial interest in that and I am not sure of the status of that. So we\u2019re going to be pretty much done with Domain and when we opened. I mean, continually lease up and management opportunities, but we\u2019re done in the spring in terms of the new development there.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets", "The last thing, Rick, a year end occupancy what do you think that\u2019s going to be?", "Rich Sokolov", "We are today 91.4 we hope that will tick up a little more into the fourth quarter, but we ends of anything leases but we are hoping that its going to be closer to 91.56. It\u2019s just a function of where we end up with your end getting stores open.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green Street advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street advisors", "There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the call with respect to \u201809 Holiday and \u201810, but I would like to ask you to maybe look at little bit further into \u201811, \u201812, and \u201813 particularly as it relates to tenant sales growth. When we look at the company\u2019s history tenant sales growth following economic downturns is recovered pretty quickly to the solar mid positive single digit range.", "It just seems as we have said here today that the consumer this time around is in a different bottom or negative spot it relates to their balance sheet in the level of debt that carrying which would make that kind of recovery much harder to achieve this time around, again out in the \u201811, \u201812, and \u201813. You agree with that or do you have different point of you?", "David Simon", "I think it the consumers clearly going to be challenge in terms of spending and certainly to the extent that we continue to have such a week picture. I\u2019ll tell you that I think corporate America is on the verge of starting to hire again and to employ capital which will lead to job growth.", "I think in the environment that we are in today, I agree with you. I think there is a reasonable chance that we will be in a much better job picture in \u201810. I think that is going to be corporate led and there are obviously retail lags and so I think you are right that right \u201810 will continue to have a lag impact, but that the CapEx and Corporate America will be significantly up in \u201810 right now other work think about at Tanger announced they are going to build.", "We might build a New Hampshire. There are lots of companies in various sectors that I think are thinking about a growth and in order to achieve growth, I think they need to hire people which will give a certain stability in the job growth, which may make \u201811 and \u201812 a little bit better than what we are feeling today.", "So, I am not as pessimistic on \u201811, \u201812. I think \u201810 will continue to have a and be a tough environment because we have got the lag impact, but if corporate America seems to be positioning to hire a little bit more, put more capital to work we could have a better \u201811,\u201912 then what we might feel like today.", "Operator", "This concludes our Q-and-A session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay, thank you everyone and I appreciate your interest and your questions and we look forward to talking to you in the future.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s presentation.

My name is [Marisol]. I\u2019ll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Miss Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "", "Welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion of these terms. Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date, February 5, 2010.", "The company\u2019s supplemental information package was filed earlier today as Form 8-K. The filing is available via mail or email and it is posted on the Simon website in the Investors section under Financial Information, Quarterly Supplemental Packages.", "Participating in today\u2019s call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David E. Simon", "", "Thank you. Good morning. Thanks everyone for joining. I\u2019d like to take a few minutes just to review financial and operational highlights and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.", "First on FFO for the quarter, we reported as adjusted $1.66 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, which is $0.13 above the first call consensus estimate. We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter results and our full year results delivered during very uncertain times. We are seeing some positive trends in retail conditions and believe that the environment should continue to experience a slow and gradual improvement. Holiday sales met or exceeded the expectations of most of our retailers and coupled with good expense control and inventory management, I would expect fourth quarter earnings for the retailers to be quite good, and yesterday\u2019s January retail sales support that premise.", "Occupancy in all of our platforms was sequentially up from the end of the third quarter. Mall occupancy up 70 basis points, Outlet centers increased 40 basis points, The Mills increased 150 basis points and our Community Lifestyle centers increased 180 basis points. Regional mall comparable sales were $433 per square foot at year end as compared to $470 year end 2008. For the fourth quarter the decline in year-over-year was 2.7%. For the month of December the declined narrowed to 1.8%. Florida experienced an improving trend with sales were flat in December while we continue to see softer sales in California, Nevada and Massachusetts, which was a little worse than the rest of our portfolio in the country.", "Now, the Outlet business had comp sales improved during the fourth quarter with portfolio sales increasing from $492 a foot at 9/30 to $500 a foot at year end. Sales were up 6% year-over-year in Q4. Regional mall releasing spreads was year end $4.18 or an increase of 10.3%. Average base rent at year end was $40.04, which was up 1.4% for the year earlier period. The average base rent for the regional mall leases expiring in 2010 is $37.64 per square foot, which is lower than the rent of the stores that closed or leases expired in 2009 of $40.47 per square foot. In the last half of 2009 we signed new leases at an average rate of $43 per square foot, which again reinforces our premise that we still continue to believe that our leases rolling over or expiring are below market rent. ", "The Outlet releasing spread was $8.82 per square foot or an increase of 29.8% for 2009. The average base rent at year end was $33.45 per square foot, up 21% for the year earlier period. Full year comp NOI growth was three-tenths of 1% for the Malls and 5.6% for the Outlets. ", "During the fourth quarter, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.26 per share. These charges totaled $88.1 million related to adjustments in the carrying value of one wholly owned and one joint venture regional mall, a write-down of five land parcels and two non-retail real estate assets, and the write-off of certain predevelopment costs related to approximately 25 projects. Our land held for development on the balance sheet is now $90 million, comprised of 12 parcels and 688 acres, which is roughly $130,000 an acre. FFO after this impairment was $1.40 for the quarter.", "I\u2019d like to now turn my attention to other matters. Dividends, first of all I\u2019d like to thank our stockholders for their support in 2009 when we made the difficult but we feel appropriate decision to pay a significant portion of our dividend in stock in the face of a massive, national credit crisis. If you held onto your stock for the year and sold it at year end, your dividend for that year, 2009, was $4.23, which thankfully was much higher than any previous dividend we\u2019ve paid since being public. We\u2019re also very pleased today that we announced the return to the payment of our dividend in cash and that for the quarter is $0.60 per share. ", "On the acquisition front, on December 8 we announced our planned acquisition of prime Outlets in a transaction valued at $2.325 billion, including the assumption of prime Outlets existing indebtedness and preferred stock. And we expect this transaction to close in the spring. ", "And let me turn over to some of our sales activity. As was announced in today\u2019s release, SPG and Ivanhoe Cambridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in Simon Ivanhoe to Unibail-Rodamco. Simon Ivanhoe owns a portfolio of two assets in Poland and five in France. The portfolio is valued at 715 million euros and the transaction is subject to customary post closing adjustments. We expect to record a gain of approximately $300 million and the transaction is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010. ", "Keep in mind that in 2000 we recorded gains of approximately $125 million related to this venture, primarily as a result of the sale of five assets in Poland, so after the sale to Unibail closes this European venture, one of two, which we continue to have our interest in GCI, will have generated approximately $425 million of gains for us. We also agreed to a venture with Unibail and Ivanhoe Cambridge in the development of five potential new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline. We will own 25% interest in these projects.", "We\u2019re pleased to have the opportunity to partner with Unibail-Rodamco and continue our venture relationship with Ivanhoe Cambridge in these five new development opportunities in France. We view this as an excellent opportunity to recycle capital, capitalize on the relatively high valuation of the euro and sell our interest in a tax efficient manner.", "At year end we also sold our joint venture interest in the development and operations of our shopping centers in China. The interests were sold to affiliates of our Chinese partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million. We built a good product there but the middle class consumer is just beginning to spend discretionary income. It will take a long time for them to fully emerge to shop and spend at moderate to better stores. Remaining in these joint ventures in China would have required additional SPG time and resources, as well as the need to fund operating losses. We believe that we have better opportunities to deploy that capital elsewhere.", "During the fourth quarter of \u201909 we also sold four non-core assets, one Mall and three Community centers. Notwithstanding the significant amount of work we did in the spring of 2009, we were not content to sit on our capital. And so we were very active in the fourth quarter and again in 2010 on the capital markets front.", "In December we entered into a new unsecured corporate credit facility to replace our existing facility that would have matured in January of 2011. The initial borrowing capacity is $3.565 billion and represents an increase of the $3.5 billion facility that was expiring. And this new facility contains an accordion feature allowing the borrowing capacity to increase to as much as $4 billion and will now mature on March 31, 2013. The base interest rate on the new facility is LIBOR plus 210 basis points. ", "In January of this year, we also commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash outstanding notes in 2011 and \u201912 and the first quarter of 2013. Total amounts of bonds eligible was $3.25 billion and 70% of those bonds were tendered totaling $2.285 billion. The notes tendered had a weighted average duration of two years and a weighted average coupon of 5.76%. A $166 million charge to earnings was recorded as a result of the tendering and purchasing of those securities. Concurrently we sold $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes, our largest notes offering ever. The offering received exceptionally strong interest with the book total orders totaling $10 billion. We were also able to introduce 30 year bonds into our capital structure. The weighted average duration of the notes offering is 14.4 years and the weighted average coupon is 5.69%. As a result of these activities, our credit facility size has increased and the maturity extended until March, 2013. And we significantly extended the duration of our senior unsecured notes portfolio with no overall increase in our weighted average interest rate.", "While we had one of the industry\u2019s strongest balance sheets, we believe these transactions were prudent given the volatility that continues to exist in the world\u2019s capital markets. As of year end December 31, 2009, we had $4.3 billion of cash on hand, which includes our share of our joint venture cash or roughly $12 per share and the availability of our corporate credit facility of $3.1 billion for a total liquidity position of $7.4 billion.", "Now let me turn over to guidance. Today we provided 2010 guidance as adjusted, $5.72 to $5.87 per share. Taking into account the $166 million charge recorded in connection with our January bond tender offer, we expect FFO for 2010 to be $5.25 to $5.40 per share. We have outlined some of the major assumptions in our press release. The guidance assumes both the prime acquisition and the Simon Ivanhoe sale to occur as expected. ", "Let me conclude by saying 2009 was memorable in many respects, very difficult and challenging. However, we accomplished a great deal. We were very pleased to return a total stockholder of 58% in 2009, significantly outperforming the RMS and the S&P 500. We have now outperformed the S&P 500 index and the RMS index in nine of the last ten years. We had solid financial and operational performance throughout the year. We successfully executed several major capital market activities throughout \u201910 and year-to-date in 2010, strengthening our already strong balance sheet. We are growing again with the acquisition of prime. We are paying our dividend in cash and we believe we\u2019re positioned to deliver solid operating results in 2010.", "With that, operator, we\u2019re ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "Wondering if you could give us a sense for the conversations leading up to and the thought process behind the sale of the Simon Ivanhoe assets. Is there a change in strategy at all with regard to your European platform and are you looking to sell any other assets there?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it\u2019s not overly complicated. We\u2019ve created a lot of value there. We got an unsolicited offer and we took that to the next level. We felt comfortable with the value that we\u2019re achieving in the sale. When we looked at the growth opportunities of the assets that we were selling, compare them to the opportunities that we can redeploy that capital, taking into account that we can achieve the sale tax free in a sense. And where the euro is we thought it was in the best interest of our shareholders.", "Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS", "", "What was the IRR of that venture over the life of it, including the assets that you sold previously?", "David E. Simon", "It would have been near 30%.", "Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS", "", "Just trying to estimate your share of the proceeds, net of the property level. I came with about $200 million. Is that close?", "David E. Simon", "It\u2019ll be exactly where the gain is, more or less. We have basically no basis in this venture.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "", "Two questions for you. One is, it looks like after the end of the year you paid off the loans on Mall of Georgia and University Park. What\u2019s going to be the approach on the $0.5 billion loans that you\u2019ve got coming due this year at Forum Shops and the Westchester?", "David E. Simon", "We will be paying off the Forum Shops. Westchester\u2019s a JV so we\u2019ll be refinancing that.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "", "I guess I\u2019m asking it in the broader context of your cash balance and your line availability. In the sense that if for some reason you don\u2019t land what I\u2019ll call a big fish this year, what do you start thinking about from a sense of all this call and line availability? Do you start saying to yourself do I start buying back my stock at mid-7 caps? Do I raise the dividends since my FFO payouts only 50% now? How do you think about it strategically?", "David E. Simon", "Well, you know, look, the fact is we think there\u2019ll be investment opportunities. We have a lot of optionality with that cash. We\u2019ll be prudent in exploring the options that exist out there. Rest assured that cash certainly will not put us in the position where we will be reckless in how we treat it. And I hope you would agree that we have been extremely thoughtful and conservative in how we\u2019ve managed the business through our M&A and sales activities, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think there\u2019ll be significant opportunities over the years for this company, but to the extent that those don\u2019t come to fruition for whatever reason we\u2019ll de-lever, and I think that will obviously give us a unique opportunity to also return cash to the shareholders, whether that\u2019s better in the form of a buyback or dividend, you know, there\u2019s lots of views on that, but we\u2019ll have to take it a step at a time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citigroup.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup", "", "Just in terms of your I would say strategy and I saw yesterday that Liberty International has decided to split their business in two. How does that move impact firstly your ownership of that company? But also what your strategy might be longer term and whether or not the UK is still a market that you\u2019re interested in.", "David E. Simon", "Well, it still is or otherwise we would have sold the stock. So you know we maintain our interest. That news hit last night so we\u2019re just now assessing that. I think for us it\u2019s a positive move because it narrows the focus, so we think it\u2019s probably there\u2019s industry logic to what the group there is doing. But it still needs a little bit further analysis. I think if we were disenfranchised we would have sold our stock by now. We\u2019re not afraid to sell assets. At this point we\u2019ll continue to monitor and see what happens there. But overall the initial reaction is that it could be a positive benefit for the shareholders at Liberty.", "Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Is a global Mall business something that you would like to be longer term or is there still more opportunity here in the U.S.?", "David E. Simon", "My longer term goal is to make money. It sounds silly but the fact is we\u2019re pleased with what happened in Simon Ivanhoe, that we got what we thought was a good offer and we took advantage of it. We\u2019re still involved in assets there. We still have our interest in our joint venture in Italy. But the fact of the matter is, we like to recycle capital and we like to make money. Our greatest franchise here is in the U.S. and obviously that\u2019s important to maintain and be able to grow that. And that continues to be our number one priority. China, when we went into it, it was an R&D experience. We\u2019ve learned a lot. We would not rule out doing additional developments in China. It\u2019s just that the product that we built is not the product that we want to own long-term. And we\u2019re still very strong in Asia through the Outlet business. We actually are very close to one if not two new developments there, so I think our strategy will continue to take advantage of the ability to recycle capital and build on the successful platforms that we have out there.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Just going back to Liberty for a second, would that in terms of separating the group and I guess disparate parts that didn\u2019t fit together, as in your overtures and your discussions with the company and building your stake, was that something that you were pushing in terms of hey, we\u2019re willing to take the true shopping center, regional mall portfolio, but all this London development and other stuff doesn\u2019t fit us? And that sort of got them down the road of saying well, why don\u2019t we split the company in two, that this effectively almost makes it easier for you to take the piece that you want?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, you can draw that conclusion. It\u2019s not really appropriate for me to comment on that. But I mean certainly what you\u2019re saying is a logical conclusion, but it\u2019s your conclusion. But it certainly, if it happens and the shareholders approve it, certainly a smaller company, it\u2019s certainly more focused and it\u2019s more up what we do as opposed to anything else.

I do think redevelopment, assuming we continue on the recovery of the U.S. economy, I think redevelopment is starting to percolate a little bit more. We\u2019ve done a lot more anchor redeployments, box activity, you saw it in The Mills, you\u2019ve seen it in the Malls in terms of that.

But there probably is going to be opportunities where we can buy something at a decent price and be able to make money through our ability to run it a little bit better.

And I think that\u2019s best demonstrated by what we did in the last couple of months. I mean we extended our line, we didn\u2019t have to. We tendered for bonds and sold bonds to the extent of our duration. We didn\u2019t have to. We sold an asset because we thought it was a good price to recycle capital. We didn\u2019t have to.

I don\u2019t know if this is the best way to do it, but say last year, you know, 70% of retailers were contemplating contraction, 20% were on the fence and 10% were thinking about expanding store count.

Sokolov", "", "Well, I think if you look at our occupancy numbers, we\u2019ve done a good job of having the retailers maintain their footprint within our portfolio so they could be positioned to take advantage of a rebound in retail sales. So we experienced absent bankruptcy as David mentioned, I believe less contraction than perhaps other portfolios. Going forward as the sales have gotten more stable, we\u2019re seeing less pressure on store closings and a larger open to buy. So I would hope that, which is why David indicated we hope that perhaps we\u2019ll have a slight increase in our occupancy level in \u201910 because our leasing activity will enable us to absorb some of that vacant space. We are doing business with a number of tenants across categories and I think it\u2019s notable, although it\u2019s only one store, it\u2019s not insignificant that Microsoft decided the way to sell their new product is by reaching out to consumers and they opened at Mission Viejo and it\u2019s doing very well.

I can tell you that anecdotally what we\u2019re experiencing now are people coming in and saying we want to open new stores and there are a number of new concepts such as PS by Aero and Crazy 8 by Gymboree. Collective brands is expanding Sperry and Stride Rite. Those are relatively new concepts that are growing. Forever 21 is growing.

You know part of what we\u2019ll suffer for in \u201910 is the deals we did in \u20189 that when we did them, they were obviously the retailer was feeling a lot worse about things than they are today. So look, our numbers reflect that in terms of what we think the world will produce in \u201910 but it is a challenge. Retailers are very focused on expenses and rents. They\u2019re still closing stores. We\u2019re doing the best that we can do, but it\u2019s still a challenging environment.

We have been doing, as David mentioned, a good job of redeploying our box space that was available with anchors such as Best Buy, Bed Bath, Neiman Marcus, Last Call, Forever 21, H&M are all filling boxes that we had available in the various portfolios. And we should not underestimate the importance of no new development.

You know our business is retail real estate, so we did venture into one land development deal. It wasn\u2019t. I blame Steve on that, but I\u2019m kidding, I was part of the decision. It\u2019s just a business we don\u2019t like. It\u2019s not our core competency. But that\u2019s not a Ralph\u2019s or general growth statement. That\u2019s a statement for all. And I think its best exhibited as I said, I mean think about the size of our company. We have 12 parcels for $90 million on the books. So that gives you an idea if we have the land it\u2019s to develop it and it\u2019s not to hold it. So with that said, I think when look, the Ralph\u2019s, it\u2019s very interesting to go back in \u201904 and I think it\u2019s very important because obviously there\u2019s lots of speculation about us and General Growth.", "We had the opportunity in \u201904, as I go back and examine that time period, you know we were right at the outset of our Chelsea deal and at the same time Ralph\u2019s came up this was previous to the public obviously knowing, but I knew. We had every opportunity to buy Ralph\u2019s and it would have been frankly at that time probably hard to do both, but we certainly could have not bought the Outlet business, Chelsea, and bought Ralph\u2019s. The fact of the matter is we think Ralph\u2019s was over priced, there was no way to make the numbers work, we probably could have made them work better than General Growth because we would have refinanced it immediately. But we liked the value that Chelsea provided that obviously we continue to reap the rewards for that. ", "And listen, it\u2019s vivid to me in \u201904. I had a dinner with Tony Deering.

Until both close we are not going to give you individual numbers. But when they do, we\u2019re happy to do that. But for the time being, it\u2019s in our numbers and you are right, though.

Or do you expect that to trail off over the next few years?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Let me say this and this goes back to kind of how David and Rick have run the business over the last couple of years. We were very early to recognize the downturn and we\u2019re pretty aggressive in how we reduced operating expenses while at the same time not sacrificing the quality of how we managed the assets. I think most of that cost savings we feel like we\u2019ve wrung out of the business so what you\u2019re going to see is a relatively flat cost environment for 2010.

Simon", "Well, look, we always knew going in it was a significant risk. We\u2019re one of the few, I\u2019m personally now, others aren\u2019t, I mean I\u2019m a little more bearish on that consumer than a lot of people. Every time I talk to a retailer he thinks I\u2019m crazy. But what we built and where we built it, even though we were well executed and well leased, the moderate consumer, i.e., let\u2019s say the suburban mall here as an analogy, they do not spend the way you need to, to support the rental income stream that you need to, to support the yield that you need to support. And the big reason is because in my opinion there\u2019s no social safety net there. You don\u2019t have employee benefits. You don\u2019t have Medicare or you don\u2019t have retirement benefits. And the consumer there in that range is very, very conservative.", "Now when you go to the fancy cities with the [xpads] and the well compensated Chinese, you do get good retail production. In addition, I mean there\u2019s so much that was built there in so short a time, that it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really great. I mean aside from the obvious places in Beijing and Shanghai and some of the other major cities. It\u2019s not obvious what\u2019s really great real estate and if you\u2019re going to do it, you\u2019ve got to be there for a long time and you\u2019ve got to sort it out. And so much is being built that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it a bubble, but there\u2019s going to be winners and losers and you know what? We were okay, we lost a little, we\u2019re ready to. Again, in \u201909 what we learned, David, is its good for us to be really a little bit more focused. So China was a distraction. Let\u2019s move it aside. It wasn\u2019t obvious. The platform that we had in Europe, we didn\u2019t see a way to get really bigger, really more meaningful, so that became a distraction. We got a really good offer. We made a lot of money. We believe euros\u2019 headed down, pretty much right on that. ", "And these are decisions that we make all the time. We\u2019d rather be bigger and bolder elsewhere. Being little and insignificant is a distraction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "David, your company already owns about 20% of the malls in the U.S. Your comments on the call suggested that your capital deployment over the next couple of years is going to be focused on U.S. retail acquisitions and presumably mall acquisitions will be a primary focus for you. And I\u2019m curious, as you think about playing an additional role as consolidator of U.S. mall business, where if anywhere antitrust considerations come into play? And I\u2019m particularly interested as I speculate on a Simon GDP combination which would result in a company that would own 50% of the higher quality malls in the country and really result in a monopoly position in a couple of markets. Can you provide your comments on how antitrust may or may not impede your ability to play that consolidator role?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I certainly can\u2019t comment on behalf of the FTC. I would suggest that some of your statements I disagree with in terms of market share and monopoly. We certainly would argue strenuously that neither of those occur with or without GDP or anybody else. Retail real estate is very diverse. There\u2019s a lot of it out here. Let\u2019s face it, the average consumer has 22 per square foot per capita and the retailers have lots of options. So I guess, Jim, I really can\u2019t comment on FTC or anybody else for that matter in terms of antitrust implications.", "But I don\u2019t agree with your statement on monopoly or market share. And I think, as you know, there\u2019s a lot of retail real estate out there and it\u2019s very diverse. And retailers go in and out of product all the time. And I don\u2019t think you can look at one particular segment or one particular market. You know we have a great challenge in physical real estate with the Internet. You know we are giving the advantage to Internet retailers because they don\u2019t collect sales tax from the consumer, which is a great disservice to the local Mom and Pops that are out there paying employee taxes and sales taxes and trying to make ends meet. That\u2019s a tremendous travesty that exists here that we\u2019ve got as an industry focus on. Beyond that, there\u2019s really not much I can add to your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "As you look at the 2010 expiring rents, it\u2019s 37 to 74, which is about 70% below \u201909. Would you say that that\u2019s a function that these rents are just farther below market than you had in \u201909 or is there a qualitative difference in the space that\u2019s expiring?", "David E. Simon", "No. Our portfolio is so diverse that there\u2019s not a qualitative difference. It\u2019s just that\u2019s what happens to be expiring. So it\u2019s pretty consistent year in and year out in terms of the quality.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "", "That\u2019s 6 million square feet of space so it\u2019s a very broad sampling. So it wouldn\u2019t be a qualitative slice that would impact that.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "", "So based on the $43 bucks that you\u2019re signing in the second part of \u201909 it\u2019s pretty safe to say you would expect a significant ramp back up to where your historical rent spreads are?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I don\u2019t think we can get to historical numbers just yet until there\u2019s a stronger economy and stronger demand from retailers. But I think it does reinforce as I said our premise that we still think our leases are under market. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to generate higher rents. It\u2019s just that the productivity that we\u2019re able to generate would indicate we still have room there. But it\u2019s obviously the ability to generate higher rents is impacted by the current state of the economy. So a good insurance policy to have and we think we\u2019ll be positive. That\u2019s what our budget is. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in an environment where that we go back to quite the historical numbers we\u2019ve produced over the years.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "", "You had spoken on the last call that you had made a calculated decision with a few retailers to push off signing leases, taking a wait and see attitude for the holiday season. Just with the benefit of hindsight here, was the holiday season strong enough to get you those higher rents?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "", "Yes. Absolutely. We are I think going to benefit as we go into \u201910 and negotiations. As we commented earlier not just sales strengths but more importantly cash flow and profitability have been substantially better for these retailers. And when you read all the retail analysts, they are now saying to the retailers how are you going to grow your top line? 2009 was are you going to maintain? 2010 is hopefully growth but as David said earlier there\u2019s still a difficult environment out there but it is clearly better now than it was.", "David E. Simon", "And I\u2019d say, Nate, we certainly didn\u2019t get hurt you know by that decision. Right now the bet\u2019s still out there. We\u2019ve still get to finish \u201910 deals but we\u2019re certainly in the game.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "", "Where do you stand on \u2018010 expirations?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We are about 63% through our \u201910 and that\u2019s about where we were this time last year.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session for today\u2019s program. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "All right. Thanks everybody for your time and questions and have a great Super Bowl weekend. And obviously we\u2019re expecting you to root for the Colts.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "", "Thank you. Welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion of these terms. ", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date, April 30, 2010.", "", "The company\u2019s supplemental information package was filed earlier today as Form 8-K.

", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "", "David Simon", "", "Good morning everybody. Thanks everyone for joining us. We will give you the highlights and then open it up for questions. ", "First of all we reported FFO as adjusted for the first quarter of $1.41. FFO after the loss on extinguishment of debt related to our January tender offer was $0.94 per share, $0.09 above First Call estimates. Per share amounts reflect the impact of the issuance of 52.1 million shares of common stock through public offerings and dividends in 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the impact to FFO per share of that activity was $0.17 per share. ", "It was a good quarter operationally and financially with consumers spending more in our centers. Our retailers are feeling better about their business and the debt markets are strengthening. We are clearly seeing the impact of an economic recovery that is beginning to surface in our results. However, we continue to believe the recovery may be slow and there will be challenges in the weeks and months ahead. ", "I will walk you through some of our key operating statistics. Beginning with this quarter we modified the reporting of statistics of our U.S. business by combining our malls and our outlets. We made this change for several reasons including it is more representative of our enter enterprise performance. Combined together these assets represent over 86% of our net operating income. ", "The historically bright line between malls and outlets is becoming more blurred every day. Many tenants are leasing space in both property types. Tenants that have historically operated in outlet centers are now leasing space in malls as well as other venues including strips and street level shops and traditional mall tenants are now opening concepts in the outlets. We also consolidated the back office of the premium outlet business into our Indianapolis infrastructure last year. ", "We believe this is an improved methodology but understand it may take time for you to adjust your models. Therefore, to assist in that process we have provided historical data for occupancy, sales, rent and leasing activity on a combined basis for 2005 through 2009 in the 8-K we filed this morning. ", "We continue to lead our peer group in comparable property net operating income growth generating 2.5% growth in the first quarter. The drivers of that increase in comparable NOI include much improved bad debt expense as well as a reduction in the bankruptcies in 2010, higher overage rent due to sales growth as well as our continued focus on cost control in home office and field. ", "As of 03/31 comparable sales on a rolling 12 month basis was $467 per  square foot. Sales growth accelerated in the first quarter with tenants reporting sales 6.6 higher during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009. We also saw a very strong improvement in the month of March with sales growth of 10.6% compared to March 2009 partially aided by the shift of Easter.", "Sequential quarterly occupancy changes from 12/31/09 were in line with historical trends and were consistent with our budget. As of 03/31 occupancy was 92.2%, ten basis points higher than a year ago. Now beginning with the first quarter of 2010 the releasing spread is being reported on a rolling 12 month basis. This spread was $2.11 per square foot or 5.2% and we are seeing improvement in leasing activity in 2010. The first quarter spread under our old reporting method for the first three months of 2010 was at $2.69 per square foot or 7.2%. Demand for space continues to improve as the economy recovers and tenants continue to experience positive sales trends. ", "In January we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash outstanding notes maturing in 2011, 2012 and 2013. $2.285 billion of the bonds we tendered at a weighted average interest cost of 5.76% and our duration of two years. We reported a loss on this of $166 million which is what was recorded in our first quarter with this transaction and obviously we told you about that as soon as the transaction was done in January. ", "Concurrently we sold $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes. Our largest ever notes offering. We had a great book. Our orders totaled $10 billion. The average duration was 14.4 years and the weighted average coupon was 5.69%. As a result of this activity we extended the duration of our senior unsecured notes with no overall increase in our weighted average interest rate. ", "During the quarter we paid off $300 million of senior unsecured notes that matured on 03/18 and unencumbered two malls totaling $282 million of mortgages as well as paid our cash loss on the extinguishment of debt of $166 million. ", "Subsequent to the completion of the company\u2019s new unsecured corporate facility in December of 2009 five additional banks have added a total of $280 million increasing our borrowing capacity to $3.845 billion. The facility has an accordion feature allowing borrowing capacity increase to as much as $4 billion. As of March 31, 2010 we had $3.6 billion of cash on hand including our share of joint venture cash. Approximately $10 per share, the availability of our corporate credit facility of $3.2 billion for a total liquidity position of $6.8 billion. Additionally, we anticipate generating over $750 million of free flow after the payment of our dividend. We also declared an all cash dividend of $0.60 per share. ", "At this time I would like to make a statement regarding our acquisition of Prime Outlets. First let me say we expect to close this transaction per our definitive agreement. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the transaction. We have met with the FTC and are fully cooperating in that review. As you may know the U.S. anti-trust authorities have consistently recognized the retail real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented and is one of the only industries exempted from Hart-Scott-Rodino filing requirements. ", "Tenants whether they are discount retailers, manufacturers or otherwise can and do lease retail space in a variety of locations. According to recent estimates there is approximately 14 billion square feet of retail space in the U.S. approximately half of which is space in shopping centers of all kinds. Our assets comprise only 3.5% of the total shopping center space. In addition to the wide variety of physical sites, e-commerce websites and mail order catalogs have become established as powerful retail outlets and only a small percentage of U.S. off-price retail sales are conducted through retail outlets located in the properties owned by SPG and Prime. ", "This will be my only comment today regarding this transaction. ", "Let me conclude, as I stated in the morning release the year is off to a positive start for the company. We reported solid results and are encouraged by the trend of the retailer sales. Our retailers are exhibiting more confidence in their business. We are seeing increased inventory in the stores. The environment for new store openings is slowly improving. The tone in the secured debt market has significantly and positively changed in the last two quarters with the re-emergence of structured secured lending and the continued activity from life companies. Strong sponsorship remains a critical component for lenders. ", "With that in mind during the first quarter we have circled two tenure transactions totaling $515 million at an average interest rate of 5.95%. We expect to lock rate within the next month on two more tenured fixed rate transactions comprising approximately $550 million at even lower rate spreads than in the first quarter. All of our 2010 secured debt maturities are done. ", "While we do not believe demand exists for any new non-outlet development projects we are selectively spending capital dollars on expansions of selected international activities all with expected double digit returns. We are adding 116,000 square feet to Houston Premium Outlets. We are adding anchors and box tenants at more than 20 regional malls, Mills and community centers. We started construction on our second Premium Outlet center in South Korea as well as expansions of two premium outlets in Japan. ", "Once again we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid results in 2010 and as a result we have increased our bottom end of our 2010 FFO guidance by $0.05 per share. So with that operator we are ready for some questions. ", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "I wanted to ask some questions on the general growth. Sort of for perspective what has been the feedback as you have had your discussions as far as the warrants from the board\u2019s perspective? Are they viewing the warrants as something that would disrupt the bid or are they viewing that as an integral part of the alternative proposal for the company? ", "David Simon ", "", "I don\u2019t really know other than to say that there is no reason to issue warrants when we have a better deal economically more certain better sponsorship, a better diverse group of investors. So I don\u2019t know why they would issue any warrants given the current state of play. It doesn\u2019t compute from my perspective. ", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "The second part on the [JTP] is what is the dynamic? I think earlier the unsecured creditor committee came out in support of you guys but given that Fair Home and Pershing own a good chunk of that what is your sense of the dynamics between the unsecured creditors committee and the respective unsecured debt holders themselves? ", "David Simon ", "", "I can\u2019t speak for Fair Home or Pershing Square. I can only tell you we have had positive support from the creditors committee. They view our deal as more certain and we think they will continue to support us. ", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "On the guidance, two line items for your lease term expectations for the year and provision for credit losses, and then as far as Prime goes should we be assuming that in our numbers for this year and is that in your guidance or what is your recommendation to us as far as our estimates? ", "David Simon ", "", "I will let Steve answer the first two. Let me just say on Prime, as we said at the beginning of the year Prime is in our guidance and when we issued our guidance earlier in the year we anticipated an earlier close to Prime. So we are not going to pinpoint exactly for you at this moment when we expect it to close. We do expect it to close but the fact of the matter is we haven\u2019t changed our guidance. In fact we have increased the bottom end even though what we gave you initially we have been delayed from what we thought we would close Prime. ", "Stephen Sterrett ", "", "I will talk a minute about the other two items you asked about. The bad debt expense as you did see we actually had a recovery in the first quarter. I wouldn\u2019t expect that trend to continue although as I look at the landscape right now I do think bad debt expense will be relatively muted throughout the rest of the year but I would expect to see some expense, not necessarily a recovery. On the lease settlement side we did have a spike in activity in the first quarter. ", "Historically we run about $5 million a quarter. $4-5 million of just ordinary course of business and I would expect the run rate for the rest of the year, the remaining three quarters, to kind of fall back to that historical level. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "On the outlets versus the malls I think I understand why you are combining them. For 2009 there was about a 500 basis point difference in same store NOI growth and you are up in the first quarter. Could you talk about the contributing factors and whether that disparity is consistent with when you last broke it out? ", "David Simon ", "The disparity has narrowed and we had positive comparable property growth in the mall business. If you just look at the mall assets for the first quarter. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "The lease spreads, the rent on expirations was much higher than what you reported previously. Obviously your lease terms were way up. I wonder if those are related and whether we might see that number as a blip that comes back down based on maybe some closings of planned stores or if that is not accurate? ", "Stephen Sterrett ", "", "We clearly are seeing some positive momentum in the leasing business. I think David mentioned in his prepared remarks if you look at just the first quarter activity on a standalone basis the spread was actually almost $3 a foot. I would not expect it to be a blip. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "My question was whether that high number on expiring rent is\u2026your average for the year was quite a bit lower than reported in the first quarter of $40.71. Is that indicative of anything specific relative to what closed in the first quarter? ", "Stephen Sterrett ", "", "No. Don\u2019t forget our business is such that a lot of the leases are still geared towards the retailer year-end so we have the largest expirations at January 31 but it is not reflective of anything different. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Maybe you could talk a little bit about where you are seeing open to buys increase and maybe a little bit of clarity on whether you are seeing kind of more activity from some of the bigger footprint type stores? ", "Richard Sokolov ", "", "Let me do first on the specialty store tenants across all of the platforms it is obviously a more constructive leasing environment. We have a number of tenants that are now coming back and wanting to open the stores in 2010 that they otherwise might have opened in 2008. There are a number of new concepts like PS by Aero that are moving ahead. Sperry and Stride Rite from Collective Brands and we are looking at a lot of deals with Microsoft. As you know they opened two stores. One of the two is in our property and it is performing very well and they are excited and we are excited they are looking to grow their footprint. ", "On the box area if you look at the schedule we have in the 8-K you are going to see an increasing amount of activity there as well and the thing to remember is the development today is probably at 40 year lows as David referenced so that is certainly playing into our hands to absorb the existing inventory. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "I wanted to try and continue the line of questioning from Paul. If we look at where you opened leases in the quarter and you kind of look at  the lease expiration schedule I guess what I am trying to really figure out is if [Kelsey] has historically had 30% rent spreads and the malls were sort of slipping last year\u2026", "David Simon ", "", "Let me interrupt you. We also had positive rent spreads in the mall assets. Again, remember there is a lot more activity just given the size of the portfolio malls versus outlets. So if that is what you are headed to we had positive in both. Again, the expirations for the quarter maybe there is some unusual\u2026", "Richard Sokolov ", "", "The mix can change. ", "David Simon ", "Yes, the mix can change. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "My question was really I am trying to think when you were giving guidance and talking about the business I thought late last year and the beginning part of this year you thought that the mall spreads would be down and maybe closer towards the single digit range or very low double digits versus the spreads that had been closer to 20%. Now that you are kind of merging these together we have to think of them as kind of one number, what do you think spreads collectively for both the malls and outlets will be this year? ", "David Simon ", "", "I think it is going to be consistent with our guidance. The specific number I think we would have to get back to you on. We don\u2019t see a big change in the business. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "Rick, talking about open to buy, is it fair to assume then that maybe the leasing put in place here in the first quarter was done under an environment that was pretty stressful? Is it fair to assume this is reflective of really tough situation in the last six months? When would you expect to see maybe those numbers start to trend higher? Is that a 3 quarter event out or might we see the spreads start to rebound in the second quarter? ", "Richard Sokolov ", "", "I think it is going to be further out. You have to understand leasing we are doing today is not going to open until the fourth quarter at the earliest and we are starting to talk about 2011 leasing. Obviously the stores that are opening new in the portfolio were done last year with a little less constructive sales and profit dynamics and so that is going to reflect slightly lower rents. ", "David Simon ", "", "I will just say we continue to have a lot of pressure put on us by the retailers on the rent. It is a challenge and we are doing the best we can. There is a lot of leverage and pressure the tenants are putting on us in terms of rent. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "You did mention I guess you are looking at some select development opportunities on the outlet side. ", "David Simon ", "", "Yes. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "Can you talk about how return expectations for that business have changed, if any? ", "David Simon ", "", "I think it is not just us. I think generally the outlet properties are attracting a lot of new entrants into the outlet business. There are lifestyles that are being converted to outlet. There are malls that are being converted to outlets. Part of the morphing we see going on in the industry so that is one of the things that we are dealing with. It was not just us. I would say generally the returns are under pressure. Not dramatically so. ", "The returns historically as you know have been really, really positive. They are still double digits but it is probably off a couple hundred basis points if not more just because the rent pressure in that business even though the demand is good the retailers are just generally cautious and able to negotiate pretty good deals. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "So low teens might be down towards 10? ", "David Simon ", "", "I think it will be a little bit better but I would say 10-12. I guess you want to pin me down with a number. ", "Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group ", "If you could go out to [three] decimal points that would be great. ", "David Simon ", "", "Probably went from the 14-15 range to probably 10-12. I think the other thing is the outlet development pipeline, not just us but generally, is different than it was 5-8 years ago. The idea of being next to a full price is kind of  out the door. The land costs are much higher. In regional mall locations essentially. Construction costs have kind of stabilized but I think land costs, tenant improvement costs have certainly gone up.

I think as Rick just said they have very good locations so it would be a win/win for both of us. We downsize and get back decent space and go from there. That is not to say there aren\u2019t tenants here or there with a store here or there that wants to get smaller but I would say that is the biggest one out there that wants to do it on a broader basis. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS. ", "Christy McElroy - UBS", "In your conversations with national retailers as they shift to more definitive plans for taking new space would you say there is more of a quality in location buys today than in the last 2-10 years rather than just focusing on blanket square footage growth? This sort of touches on a previous question, but generally speaking what do you think is the ultimate fate of some of the classy, secondary tertiary market malls out there that stand today with above-average small shop vacancy and maybe an anchor or two gone? Do those malls eventually become obsolete or do they get recycled? ", "David Simon ", "", "Let me answer the last part. I would say to you that depending on what is happening in that market if it is a dwindling, dying market those malls are going to go away. If it is good real estate and the market could be a small market but it has good employment and it has good prospects then I think it can be recycled. We have seen both frankly where we have been able to, Rick mentioned Richardson Square as a decent in-fill place. Oak Mall that we basically tore down and redid it. ", "On the other hand we had a mall in Indiana and we actually sold a couple in Indiana and I won\u2019t mention names where it was an old manufacturing town that the employment base was shrinking and the age of the customer was increasing. It wasn\u2019t well located and we had no shot at it. Thankfully we sold it and we went on. I think you will see a little bit of both. ", "On your first question I would say it really depends on the retailer. What they are really focused on is what sales productivity they can achieve from the space. That is the focus. From there results in the deal or the rent negotiation. There are certain tenants that love moderate scenarios. They have their idea of what they can afford to pay and depending upon that asset that may be a perfectly fine deal for that asset. I do think though there is clearly a much greater focus on what the sales productivity is. ", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "In reference to the combination of the operational information on the malls and the outlets, just to comment on that I understand your rationale but I do think the investment community would prefer to be able to see how those two distinct formats are performing individually particularly after the Prime transaction closes. On the Mills portfolio I am curious, you don\u2019t disclose the same store NOI growth for community lifestyle centers or the Mills assets. I am curious what is the cash flow there and how would that influence the 2.5% number you reported for the quarter? ", "Stephen Sterrett ", "", "They are not major components of the overall enterprise so they are not going to move the needle much in any event. I will say that the cash flow for both the strips and the Mills is positive. ", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "David, about a month or six weeks ago I think I asked you a question at the NYU REIT conference about what you thought about real estate valuations and re-chair prices. You had made a comment along the lines you were a little cautious about things might have gotten a little ahead of themselves and here we sit 10% higher and cap rates have come down a bit. I am curious where you sit today on your overall evaluation of REIT valuations and commercial real estate valuations looking at what has happened in the world over the last 30-60 days? ", "David Simon ", "", "Certainly other than our company being undervalued, I think generally we just have to be very careful. What I don\u2019t want to see our industry, and I think it is broader for all equity markets, I don\u2019t want to see us go from one bubble to the next bubble. There is certainly a sense that we created just another little false sense of euphoria. I have been surprised. Obviously we think we are in a little different position than a lot of companies but it is a great surprise to me. I think we have to be careful as an industry we don\u2019t go from one bubble to the next. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Following up on that line of questions can you talk a little bit about the sales trends you are seeing across your portfolio? Maybe the A\u2019s versus the B\u2019s and some of the geographies where you are seeing some strength or some weakness? ", "David Simon ", "", "Let me just say on the regional thing we are just starting to see a little pick up in Florida. California not so much. The outlets are producing a little bit better sales growth than the mall assets. As I have said repeatedly the Midwest is just the Midwest. God love us. The good news is we are starting to see a little bit better trend in Florida. Rick I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that maybe. ", "Richard Sokolov ", "", "A couple of more color, in the outlets the one area that has gotten substantially better is the international tourist is back. So those are doing significantly better. In terms of categories, home furniture, family apparel, women\u2019s shoes, specialty and family shoes are better. Not surprising books, music and kids shoes and women\u2019s popular were a little softer. As things got better people have moved up a little bit on their price points and I think you are seeing that in the results that are being reported by our retailers. ", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Looking at the Prime portfolio are you expecting to sell any of those assets? Any Prime redevelopment opportunities in there? ", "David Simon ", "", "We don\u2019t have any plans to sell any assets. No. ", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Are any of them Prime opportunities where you could invest some serious dollars? ", "David Simon ", "", "The good news with Prime is it also comes with a couple of development sites we are anxious to be able to build when the deal closes. That will be a big focus for us. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Do you have a transaction expense number in your guidance? ", "David Simon ", "", "Not really. The 3.7?  We didn\u2019t really have that in our initial guidance but that is [where we expect it]. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "So it is likely you will continue to have those? ", "David Simon ", "", "It is likely we will continue to have those at least for the time being. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "So we should think of that as kind of a down side component or do you think you are sort of comfortable given you will have those that your range is still okay?", "David Simon ", "", "I think we are baking it into our range more or less. It doesn\u2019t seem like it is going away any time soon but it could. ", "Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "On tenant allowances they were high in the first quarter relative to the prior year or even the full-year last year. Is there any color about that and how are tenants thinking about capital apart from rent? ", "Richard Sokolov ", "", "There has really not been any change in the negotiating dynamics on the TA. I think slight increases again if you look at the 34 we have had increased box activity. So that is a little more of the dollars but in terms of specialty stores same trends we have experienced. ", "Operator", "", "That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks. ", "David Simon ", "", "Thank you everyone.

Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Stephen Sterrett", "Christy, it's Steve. We are seeing an improvement not only in deal flow as Dave and Rick have talked about, but also in a strengthening of the quality of the deals. So I do think the trends are positive. I also think one of the things to think about, and I know those other people have talked about it on their calls, but one of the things that's impacting spreads is we have had a disproportionate amount of jewelry store closings which are high-rent areas. Dave had mentioned this in his call, but to the extent that that has run its course, that drag on our spreads will cease to be there. And because the rest of the activity is getting better, you should see a natural pick up in the spreads.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "And then Steve, just following up on Prime, thinking about the timing, can you remind us was expected accretion in the Prime deal in your current guidance range, and how much did that contribute?", "David Simon", "This is David. I'll take the Prime question, if I could. I think the important point at this point is, we're going to update our guidance once we know the precise timing of the closing of the transaction. The fact that when we gave guidance originally, we had Prime in it from March 31. We have not backed off our guidance even though we have not had Prime since March 31. And we have reaffirmed our guidance and we will upgrade it and update it once we know the precise timing. So beyond that, Christy, I can't really shed any more light on it other than again, we had budgeted that. We told the world that, that was in our guidance for the end of the -- April 1 essentially in the second quarter. So we produced the results. We beat our own internal budget even though we had Prime in it for the whole quarter.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Rick, you've talked in the past about things looking up for that department stores. Performance is better, balance sheets are better, but they're still sort of working on making their existing product more productive. Could that include more department store closings, or maybe even downsizings on the horizon? And would you be willing to modify REAs and other agreements to allow us to allow certain underperforming anchors to maybe sublease a portion of their box?", "Richard Sokolov", "That covers a lot of ground. First, David and I literally last week were with three of our major department store companies and none of them were talking about store closings. In fact, the emphasis now is looking for new opportunities and primarily, in our existing product. So we expect that to be the trend rather than store closings. Secondly, in terms of the modification of subleases, we are in -- we're always trying to make our properties better. I think David has pointed out on past calls that we've been very active with replacing underperforming anchors with better anchors, and we're going to continue to do that. So if there are things that we can do working with existing department stores that we believe will make the properties stronger, we're going to be open to have that conversation.", "David Simon", "And Christy, this is David. Let me just say -- and again I think we're still in an uncertain economic macro environment. But one of the things -- and we have a, I'd say, roughly 20 potential transformational redevelopments that we've been working on. We essentially put them on hold, obviously, last year. And we have reinvigorated the company to pursue those. And I think they're very exciting. It'll add a lot of opportunity for our company, and we're going to accelerate that process. And they go from South Hills in Pittsburgh; to Plaza Carolina in Puerto Rico; to La Plaza in McAllen, Texas; Dadeland; Del Amo; Nanuet; Roswell Field; the Walt Whitman. So there's a lot that we are excited about internally that we've kind of said, let's get started on.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of David Harris, Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Lehman Brothers", "I have two quick questions for you. One is a point of detail and then another big picture question for you, David. Real estate taxes were down notably in the quarter. Is that just a sort of a timing issue or are you doing something wonderful to keep your tax liabilities down?", "Richard Sokolov", "I think it is more of the latter, but I wouldn't categorize it as wonderful. We have an ongoing sophisticated process to make sure we believe we're being fairly assessed, reflecting the value of the properties. And that there's a whole group of people that are focused on that, and we're yielding some results by engaging with the taxing authorities on the real estate taxes.", "David Harris - Lehman Brothers", "So the second quarter number is a reasonable run rate, Rick?", "David Simon", "I believe it is. David, here's my detailed response: At times, there are recoveries. It's a little bit lumpy because at some point, you get recoveries. And obviously, if we do have those, I don't know in the top of my head if we had some recoveries in the second quarter. So sometimes, it's a little bit lumpy because you do get recoveries that you're allowed to offset against the expenses. And obviously though, Rick's point is right on, we are extremely focused that our properties are appropriately assessed.", "David Harris - Lehman Brothers", "I think about your company which has been public, what, for 16, 17 years. You've been through two recessions now. Can you demonstrate that your management and ownership of the underlying property performance is demonstrably better than the market? And if so, how do you use that in your discussions in terms of forming potential joint ventures or potentially talking to pension funds about transfer of assets that have perhaps underperformed under direct ownership and that could do so much better under your own ownership?", "David Simon", "Well, that sounds like I need a white paper to respond. But look, I think our results over the years have clearly spoken for themselves. We've transformed properties, we've upgraded our portfolio, we've produced terrific operating results in all sorts of different environments. We've made appropriate strategic decisions like the outlet business and the like. From an operating point of view, David, we get to listen to it all the time to be partners with Institutional Investors. There's not a deal that we couldn't have done with an institutional investor, and I think they look and welcome our ability to partner with us. And I'm sure we could probably back all these statements up with numbers if you give us some time. And maybe, that's a good assignment for us but there's no question in my mind that over the years, our performance and our results have certainly indicated that we're better than just what the general economic environment could produce. I don't know if you guys want to add anything to it.", "David Harris - Lehman Brothers", "My thinking is along these lines, David, is that clearly your focus has been from beginning of the year, let's look at the opportunities in the U.S. And clearly, your pursuit of general growth ended when it did. And I'm thinking, where does Simon go in terms of potentially buying assets in what is obviously a -- there aren't that many assets to buy in the marketplace and some of those have been held for a long time. But probably with people that have perhaps underperformed in the performance of those assets relative to what you could do, is there a line of conversation you can have with those folks and say, \"Look, over an extended period of time, we could do much better with this.\" I'm not talking about FFO or earnings per share from the corporate level. I'm talk about underlying property performance.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think the evidence of our ability to do that is in a couple of cases. I mean, first of all, if you look at what we built in Asia on the Outlet side, we basically exported our talent there, and we're going to have a portfolio of 11 outlet centers that are producing close to $1,000 a foot in sales. So also, even though we just recently sold our properties, the two in Poland and the five in France, the fact of the matter is: We built them, we develop them, we lease them. We brought an institutional-quality product to those marketplaces with our guidance and our leasing expertise and the like. So I mean I think there's plenty of evidence of our ability to export our know-how. Now you don't want to do it in a way that suggests hubris because there's been plenty, plenty, certainly plenty of developers that have tried to do that and have not been able to produce the results that are necessary to be profitable overseas. I'd also point out that a number of our customer or retail tenants, have been successful on exporting their brand. So even though we have sold seven assets in Europe, the fact of the matter is, we are not foreclosing the opportunity to grow our company globally. And I think we've been successful in our efforts thus far there. And I think the ability to demonstrate that is readily apparent.", "David Harris - Lehman Brothers", "Is this one way to summarize what you're saying, is that you see limited opportunities to buy domestically?", "David Simon", "I didn't say that and I don't necessarily believe that. And look, you could say that in a point in time but I do think circumstances change and the environment that exists today, in my opinion, is not necessarily going to be the environment that exists tomorrow, the next day, and you've got to be a position to deal with that.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann, Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "David, you're still sitting on a pretty strong balance sheet with, as you mentioned, lots of cash and current liquidity. I'm wondering of the various options you have today, how you would rank either development, acquisitions or even looking at further paying down debt.", "David Simon", "Well, we're going to continue to delver if there's not the acquisition opportunities to pursue. But like I said, Jay, is that I do think I've given Rick and the team the greenlight to go re-energize our redevelopment program. And again, we have 15, 20, really transformational assets that I think are going to require meaningful capital and produce wonderful results. So there's plenty to do. Obviously, we're working in some interesting opportunities today. But look, our focus clearly has been to -- we'll pursue general growth, we work successful there. I'll leave that for you to judge that whole process. But our focus obviously has been on Prime, and we've been working very hard to get that transaction closed. And so I think, once we can get some of that done, then I think there'll be plenty of opportunities for this company.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And just going back to leasing spreads and I guess sales, I mean the trend has clearly been positive this year in terms of sales productivity. I guess when you start to see that trend translate into some pickup in asking rents? And I guess just balancing that against retailers that continue to be pretty sensitive to occupancy cost.", "David Simon", "I think we're on a recovery mode. The mood is much better. I mentioned we've increased our occupancy but we're not -- it's not in the period that we were in the '06, '07 period. So I think that's still, Jay, going to still take some time to max out on lease spreads. But look, the mood's better, the demand is better and sales are increasing. So there's a lag in all of that but we feel we'll get back to kind of the spreads that we would like to see going forward. It may take a little more time but it's moving in that direction.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Quentin Velleley, Citi.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "I'm just curious whether given the demand for mall assets at the moment, is there some kind of opportunity to start sort of recycling capital and potentially, looking at selling some of your middle-market malls?", "David Simon", "I think at some point, there is still a -- we like our middle-market malls that dominate a good trade area, because they have shown, historically, growth. The stuff that we'd like to sell really, is what I'll call a gum on the shoe. That market is still slow to develop, Quentin. So hopefully, maybe that comes along, there's not that many that have been earmarked for that. But to the extent that, that market starts generate, we'll move forward. Now we do have certain nonstrategic assets on the market that have some redevelopment opportunity, and they're getting more and more interest. So I think we demonstrated -- we probably sold 50 assets over the years. We certainly have recycled some of the European capital. So I think we've shown a pretty good discipline that we're prepared to recycle capital through asset sales.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "I think I saw that your joint venture partner [indiscernible] (46:15) New England portfolio is potentially selling their stake. Is that something that you would have any interest in? And if so, is there a rather first offer, or anything that you have on that?", "David Simon", "Well, there are contractual restrictions, Quentin, it's not appropriate to get into that. But we're working with our partner in a way, it's been a very good investment, it's been a very good partnership. And obviously, institutional investors to some extent, need to recycle capital. So there's a lot of different ways that can go, but it's been a good transaction for all of the folks involved, and we would expect that to continue whether they stay a partner or whether they exit.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And maybe one for Steve, I just noticed in the second quarter that interest and dividend income jumped quite a lot. I'm just wondering why that was and whether that's likely or running to the third quarter?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, couple of things, Quentin, one -- and I don't know if you're comparing it to last year or to the first quarter -- but Liberty or now Capital & Counties and Capital Shopping Centres does pay at semi-annual dividend that came in the second quarter. So if you were comparing it to the first quarter, that would be part of the explanation. And we have seen rates on our short-term invested cash get marginally better, so we're investing the cash at a little bit higher rates than we've seen. Those would be the two major.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And just the other one for the modeling, in terms of transaction costs, I know you closed the Simon Ivanhoe sale to Unibail effective July. Are they going to be any costs that come in, in the third quarter?", "David Simon", "Yes, I mean it's likely given that obviously, some of the transaction costs associated with Prime will continue in parts of the third quarter, so yes, hard to pinpoint that number down right now. As you know, you have the accounting change normally that would be capitalized, but Quentin, it will continue. But again, it's hard to pinpoint that number at this point.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And then just lastly, Liz Claiborne in the Chelsea outlets, they've obviously announced that they'll be closing some of their outlets. Just wondering if you've had any discussions with them yet, and what your exposure is?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, we have had ongoing discussions with them. We've got 16 outlets that are exclusively Liz, and it's about 190,000 square feet. We've got another 12 outlets that are hybrid where there is a Liz component, along with other brands from Liz Claiborne like Lucky, Kate Spade or Juicy Couture. That's about another 46,000 feet. We list our top tenants and they're not in our top tenants, so they're rental contribution to us is substantially below 1% of our minimum rent, and we're going to approach this like we approach everything else. They have their business objectives, we have ours, and we're going to work with them to hopefully come up with a mutually acceptable conclusion.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And Rick, do you think that those license account [ph] like paying rents sort of at market, or are they below what you'd expect market rents to be?", "Richard Sokolov", "We think that there could be opportunity for both of us if we can come up with a thing that allows them to satisfy their objective and as ours.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Thinking about the short-term leases that you're signing, I know you didn't do, maybe quite as many as some of the peers. But over the past couple of years -- and what's your experience been as those have started to expire, and are tenants more interested in doing longer-term renewals now? Or are you still kind of rolling over a year at a time?", "David Simon", "It's a combination of both. I mean -- and again, a lot of it is retailer-specific. There is still a level of uncertainty out there. And again, a lot of it's tactical in our side, too, in terms of what we're trying to accomplish with the properties. So I'd say it's marginally better, there's marginally, probably the ability to get a little longer-term lease, but it's not dramatically different than the beginning of the year, Paul.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And then going to the redevelopments that you mentioned, I mean that you've characterize as transformational. I mean a few years ago, transformational often included some mixed-use component or opening it up partially? I mean are these more conservative, do you think? Or is it the same type of project that you were thinking of doing four years ago?", "David Simon", "I mean the good news about our mixed-use stuff, it's been highly, highly successful, like domain and the residential market, has been terrific. And so we haven't had -- net-net the mixed-use elements that we brought in, the Western Hotel there has been very well received. So I think we've done a pretty good job in bringing that. But to us, the number one priority in any retail development is make it a better retail project. And I think generally speaking, now there may be certain elements that maybe there's a hotel opportunity here or there, or a residential opportunity here or there, the primary focus is on the retail aspect of it. And yes, I would say, generally, the scope may have been narrowed to some extent. So we're trying to figure out how to do it, a little bit less grandiose but not wildly different.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And the return hurdles kind of now that we're seeing it again?", "David Simon", "I think the return hurdles, given the cost to construction and the demand out there for construction jobs is actually going to be pretty good, pretty consistent. Otherwise -- look, at the end of the day, if it's not, we're going to the next deal.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Rick, you said TIs were kind of no real change there, but at least in your supplemental, what you report is about $75 billion year-to-date, which is quite a bit higher than kind of past year's run rates. And I was wondering if maybe, if some of this is just catch-up from having such a low year last year, or whether really it is certain economics of the deal environment right now or what? But it is higher than what you've reported at least over the past few years.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Paul, this is Steve. I think Rick's comment was more to the point that on a deal-by-deal basis -- per square foot, we haven't really seen any change in the bid in the ask on the TI side. Clearly, we've had more leasing volume this year. Our leasing volume is up about 1.5 million square feet year-over-year and that's driving the size of that number. But the composition of the deals and what deals get TAs and how much all that really hasn't changed.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Michael Gorman, Cowen and Company.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "If I could just follow up on that TI question for a second, can you just walk through in this environment how you think about the allocation of TAs and the potential return on those as you sit down with tenants, especially given the strong position on your balance sheet and the cash that you have to invest. So the trade-off between potentially earning a higher rent from a tenant versus having to commit the capital?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't think you want to -- I don't think you want to -- I don't know, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but I don't think you want to get in the point where you're giving more TA and buying up rent. I think that creates an unholy alliance. And frankly, the retailers from their standpoint, they're in good capital position as well. So they want to pay market rents and market rents determined by sales productivity. So I think that the traditional way that we've done leasing still holds. We've never been -- as a company, we've always been reluctant to do some of the new, fancy, undercapitalized retailers that have a history, not to say that we've been perfect in this area, but we certainly have been, I think, at least, from what I see, externally and internally, we've always been relatively conservative in terms of putting capital at risk for tenants that are undercapitalized. But I'd say, generally, if you have a healthy retailer, you just don't get in that scenario. It's not a win-win for either side.", "Stephen Sterrett", "And the only thing I would add is, we, when we're doing our lease approvals, we analyze each lease based on net rent that takes into account the allowance. And we also have a very stringent credit process as our leasing agents will attest. So both of those things and to limit the allowance in relation to rent.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "And David if I could turn for a second to the Outlet business. Obviously, with Prime going on -- there's been a lot of discussion about consolidation in the space. But looking at it from another perspective, you guys had great success with that property types since 2004. How do you think about the potential risk as the regional mall property tightens up, that you see more entrants into the outlets in our space, more competition for land, more competition for deals and potentially lower return hurdles going forward?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I do think you put on a -- you do make an excellent point, forget consolidation, there are a number of new entrants in the outlet sector. Obviously, we all saw the Taubman announcement, we think there are other mall companies out there that are looking for it and the product is in favor and we expect to see more and more developments. Tanger has announced a number of sites and they have a large pipeline. It is competitive and will remain really competitive, if not more competitive, given the new entrants and the possibilities. So I mean that's the fact of life. We're -- retail, real estate is wildly competitive. It's competitive on a local basis all the time, and so we'll just have to -- I mean we'll have to deal with it. It doesn't force us to do bad developments at low returns but obviously, there's going to be a number of new opportunities out there for the retailers to assess and participate in.", "Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse", "And then just one last one, maybe for Rick, can you just talk for a little bit about the performance of sort of, maybe what you would call non-traditional anchors as they've come onto your malls? Maybe some of the new releases, if it's too soon to tell, but on the other atypical anchors, how they've been performing and maybe even more so, how the wings that there on have been performing as well?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, if you look in the 8-K, we are accelerating that activity and our approach is, there's nothing sacred about our 100 acres and we want to bring as much quality retailing as we can to our properties, and they have helped drive traffic. They have helped to create additional internal traffic and to the extent that they are adding users that are not otherwise available in the property, it's all very positive. So it's something that we have been very good at for a long time, and we're going to continue to do it because we think it adds an additional dimension to our properties.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly, Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "David, I think you guys are fairly successful winding down development and other activities ahead of this most recent downturn. And how's the specter of a slowing economy that we continue to hear about, lead you to think you differently about the tactics you're employing now in leasing, or leverage your capital allocation?", "David Simon", "Well, certainly capital allocation and not getting over your skis [ph] (1:00:52), there's no question about it. And I'd say to you that the -- now the redevelopment -- I'll call the transformational properties that we'd like to kickstart, is all really led by retail demand. So it's not an issue that we're forcing. I think, if anything, we don't want to force the issue on redevelopment or new development. We want the demand to be there. And if you can -- if the demand is there today, then still uncertain environment, that obviously, these centers have been around a long time and have proven to withstand a lot of different cycles and it's -- in-fill core real estate. So the answer is, we think we can make some of those work. And again, not all but will work, but there's no question about -- the last cycle here has taught us a lot, taught us that we had to have access to a lot of different forms of capital. It taught us never to over promise, to have a good relationships with our shareholders and our institutional partners. And I think we've always been -- we've done a lot of M&A stuff over the years, but we've always financed it conservatively. And certainly, as that develops, we certainly understand that going forward.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And since you mentioned the redevelopment and development -- I mean, on New England, do you think the Merrimack property as you're looking is starting will pencil to the, I guess, 12% to 14% yield you've traditionally get out of the ground up -- development and outlets? And I guess, how do you underwrite cannibalizing the other properties like such us the [indiscernible] (1:02:48) your rent them outlets?", "David Simon", "Well, we think its it's own separate market. And look, I think you bring up a good point. I mean the numbers that we're pro forma-ing now are less rents than we would have thought two years ago, because I think we have to be more conservative in underwriting. But we still see it as an 11% return on cost and yet, lower than what it was. . .", "Stephen Sterrett", "But we also carry the land for three years.", "David Simon", "Yes, and I think Steve is right. The land has been there for a while. Like I said, the demand is there. If the demand weren't there, we wouldn't force the issue.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And just one last question, if I could, I guess to revisit with Quentin's line of questioning on the New England assets. Is it fair to say though, that your chance -- that there's a chance that you could increase your ownership stake in some of your New England assets? And I guess as a follow-up, can you give us a little color on the Atrium? Do you think that property ceases to be a mall in the future?", "David Simon", "Well, there is a possibility we could increase our ownership in our Mayflower joint venture. So it could play on a lot of different ways, but that's certainly a possibility. Atrium, in our opinion, probably needs to be redeveloped, and there's a great opportunity in doing that. We think we just have other better uses of our energy in terms of what we're trying to accomplish. So that's why us and our partners have decided to put that on the market. Obviously, we're price sensitive in terms of it is a very good real estate. But ultimately, it's less of a retail development and it's more of an alternative use, which is just -- not that we couldn't do it, but just not our core competency and we'd rather focus on retail.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Nathan Isbee, Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just going back to the same-store NOIs, your original guidance is 1% to 1.5% positive for the total portfolio, you're tracking 2.3% through the first six months. Where would you peg that now for the full year?", "David Simon", "Well, can I just say, Nate, before I answer, I just want to say, I saw Dave [David Fick] is retiring. I want obviously, everybody from our side, wish him well. He's been a -- and I'm going to miss his barbs.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "He gave me a long lessons before he left on how to do it.", "David Simon", "I get that scent some of that may have rubbed off. But hopefully, we can handle it. But he's been obviously, a very well thought of analyst and we just want to pass on our best wishes to Dave and we will miss his barbs, but I'm sure you'll pick up on that front.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'll do my best.", "David Simon", "In any event, your question on top NOI, there's still uncertainty with it. But if we can maintain that, I will be very, very pleased given where we originally projected.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you're not willing to change that yet?", "David Simon", "I'm not willing to change it at this point. But look, I do think the fact that we've reaffirmed our guidance given what I described about Prime, indicates to you that what we're doing -- I'm pleased with how we're performing at this point.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then just moving to Prime for a minute in the papers here, a few weeks ago, there was a little blurb about Prime giving notice to the state of Maryland by September 5, they plan to dial back their home office significantly. Is there anything to read into that, Dave?", "David Simon", "No, other than what I've described to you, there's nothing more than I can add.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then just going back to the outlets in general, you had mentioned Tanger's pipeline, they've mentioned looking at 17 sites currently in addition to three that are more live. When you look at the landscape, I mean over the last 15, 20 years, it's there's been a net decline in outlet centers in the U.S. How much can this country -- how many more centers can this country absorb in your mind as you look at it?", "David Simon", "Well, the answer is we're going to find out. I do think there's going to be number of centers built, so we'll find out. But there are a number of centers planned. There's very confident developers that are going to do that, obviously Tanger's successful in their developments, Taubman's a very good developer. They'll be very successful. There's a number of potential conversions that are taking place like what Vornado did with Bergen. Even though I really like to know his returns, he won't tell me, but -- no, I'm just kidding -- I think he's done a very good job on Bergen Town Center. There's a number of malls that are looking to conversions. So it's clear that consumer wants value and it's clear that there's going to be a lot more new and redeveloped centers focused on value for the benefit of the consumers and for the benefit of the retailers. And whether we'll do it too much or not, remains to be seen. I think our industry always pushes the envelope. I would think if you saw some of the developments that occurred and that have stopped over the years, over the last couple of years, you could see that we pushed the envelope. I would not be surprised that if we didn't push the envelope here. But there's a lot of new opportunities out there, and they're being pursued by very competent developers, both on new and redeveloped formats for the outlets sector.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So how many sites is Simon/Chelsea looking at today?", "David Simon", "Our focus obviously has just been on Prime, but we -- besides Merrimack we probably have two or three in the U.S. that we're looking at. And I will tell you this though, we're very focused on our Asian outlets, Nate. We've been very successful there. We're very excited about Singapore market, Malaysia. We're very excited about what's going on in Korea and Japan, despite all of the macro stuff there, our centers are performing very well there. So our ability in brand might grow reasonably well in the outlet side in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And I will mention -- Rick's pointing to me -- I do think it's important to note that we're also expanding a few of our outlet centers here in the U.S. and that will also happen, I think, in our industry.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Carol Kemple, Hilliard, Lyons.", "Carol Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "David, earlier on the call, I think you said something that Prime was going to retain interest in three of their centers?", "David Simon", "That is correct.", "Carol Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "And what is the reason for that? Is that they sold better capital-wise? Or is that something the FTC wanting them to do?", "David Simon", "I really can't add more, Carol, than I've already told you.", "Carol Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "Can you add or can you say if it's going to change the purchase price?", "David Simon", "There has been a modification to the transaction and I can't say that the capital that Prime would receive as part of the transaction will allow Prime to go develop. I guess I should have mentioned this to Nate's call or question, it will allow them to go develop their deal in Livermore and Grande Prairie and that's their intention to do so.", "Carol Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "And in the quarter, were the leasing spreads positive both malls and the outlet centers or just the outlet centers?", "David Simon", "We put those statistics together. Obviously, the malls have a significant impact on the results given that they're in the 75%, 80% range of our domestic NOI in that number, so -- but we don't break that out now, Carol.", "Carol Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC", "Okay, I did know. I need it break it out percentage, but I didn't know if you could comment in general.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Ben Yang, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I'm just curious how much of the occupancy gain was attributable to you converting your month-to-month tenant into longer-term deals. Because it looks like you have about 200 fewer tenants compared to last quarter. I mean did you just convert most of this 900,000 square feet into longer-term deals? Or did these guys just end up closing their stores?", "Richard Sokolov", "Interestingly, for the most part, we have been transitioning to more national tenant as opposed to the month-to-month. And a lot of times, the month-to-month is because we don't want to go longer-term because we want to have a room to split. We want to combine rooms for a different tenant who will pay more rent. So this was not really a process of a lot of month-to-month conversions.", "Stephen Sterrett", "And Ben, this is Steve, I would just add one more thing and Rick and David talk a lot on our calls over the last four or five quarters about consciously slowing down the leasing activity because of the difficulty in the environment. So that month-to-month number was to some degree, the result of a lease expiring where we chose and the tenant chose not to a year ago, or nine months ago, enter into a permanent deal. We are now, if you will, addressing that given the recovery in the economy.", "David Simon", "And Steve's right, I mean, I don't know what the exact number is, but it's -- certainly some of those month-to-month is going to longer-term leases.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "So it sounds like most of them ended up just closing their stores and maybe just -- is that fair?", "David Simon", "Yes, we suffered a lot of store closings. That's for sure.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And then you mentioned some actually converting some Prime leases. When you do make those conversions, does that number show up in your re-leasing spread?", "Richard Sokolov", "It does. If a temporary tenant converts to a permanent deal, then we treat it as a new lease, that's correct.", "Operator", "And the question will come from the line of Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the development JVs in France, can you give us a sense as to how much Simon capital could potentially go into that, for what time frame it'll begin to play out?", "David Simon", "We're only laughing because the build perhaps is a long, frustrating process. Mike, right now, to pursue the development is not going to be a lot of money for us. And as an example, the Toulouse development itself could be north of a couple of hundred million euros. But again, this timing and the approvals is really uncertain. So I would hate to venture, but for us to keep our optionality alive, it will be -- not a very big number.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So it's longer-term stuff and...", "David Simon", "Yes, it is. I mean the biggest one of which is on the potential front burners, the development in Toulouse that all of us are Unibail, us, as well as Ivanhoe Cambridge are excited about pursuing. But again, that needs to go through a certain process. Don't ever ask me to explain it.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Steve, going back to the TI question, I previously had down -- looking through notes -- in 2010, maybe $75 million on the low end, the $100 million on the high end. I mean, what's the full year expectation now for TIs?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Michael, I mean we've had an increase in velocity. So wouldn't necessarily expect it to be 2x on what it was in the first six months. But I think it will clearly be at that $100 million or a little bit north range. And I think that's just an increase in the lease and the losses.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then, I mean when we look at debt maturities over the next year or so, a lot less bonds maturing in 2011 than we saw in '10 and '09. I mean how should we think -- are you thinking differently about what a more normalized cash position is?", "David Simon", "Well, that's a very good question, I mean the answer is yes. Eventually, we're going to have kind of a normalized number. I can't -- it'd be hard for me to pinpoint exactly today what that is as we still try to sort through the uncertain economic environment. But today, we're over capitalized, not wildly over capitalized but we have reduced our debt by $2 billion. We're generating positive cash flow. Our dividend is obviously very safe and sound. So at the end of the day, we want to kind of just still be a little more thoughtful and more cautious as to where the economic environment comes out. Obviously, there's the deflation specter out there. There's a lot to weigh in to that, that we've got to continue to be just really extra conservative in our thought process for the time being.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of David Wigginton, Macquarie.", "David Wigginton - Macquarie Research", "Just had a couple of quick follow ups on lease term fees in the quarter, was that -- I mean, kind of spiked up in the quarter, I wasn't sure that, that was a result of the jewelry store closings you had mentioned? Or that there is something else that at play into that?", "David Simon", "There were a couple of those and another. We don't like to name the tenant, but there were a couple of deals that where store closings were negotiated. And again, that's not in our comparable NOI numbers. But I just prefer not to name the tenants, but there was one aspect of jewelry retailer that exited the business, so that did spike up because of that.", "David Wigginton - Macquarie Research", "So in just staying with the jewelers, where would you say we are sort of in the shakeout process among operators at this point of the cycle or whatnot? I mean, have we worked our way to the majority of jewelers that needed to just shut down and go out of business? Or are there more to come?", "David Simon", "I would think that a lot has taken place. So I think we're past for a lot of that, but there's still probably excess capacity in the jewelry retail space overall. So I mean it's like the restaurants in the sense the restaurants given the demand of -- I don't know, close 1% of the restaurant spaces in America. So I still think there's probably a little bit more to go, but I would say, we've gone through a lot of it.", "David Wigginton - Macquarie Research", "And I recognize that the split amongst foreclosings just probably pretty evenly crush your portfolio, but have you noticed any like excessive closings, say, in one segment of your portfolio versus another, meaning like maybe the higher end or the lower end?", "David Simon", "Not really. I mean I think the regional economies have a lot to impact, but not necessarily a particular property type.", "David Wigginton - Macquarie Research", "With respect to sales increases leading to rent increases, I mean, historically, what has been the timeline, I've been observing your portfolio, if anything you guys -- is it different from what you would expect to see in general in a regular mall portfolio? Or do you feel like you were able to capture pricing power quicker than maybe most mall operators?", "David Simon", "No, I think we're no different than -- there's a lag and there's also a certain level of certainty that the retailer wants as they see their sales increase. I mean if they have a good quarter, it doesn't necessarily mean -- they are open to buys might increase, but they're still going to be pretty conservative on the rent and to the sales ratio. So there's a lag and it's a macro impact and we're no better than anybody else in that category in terms of being able to accelerate that gap.", "David Wigginton - Macquarie Research", "I mean is just a matter of them seeing several quarters, consecutive quarters of sales increases that gets them going?", "David Simon", "I think it's also very specific on the retailer and the position that they're in and what they're trying to do. Are they trying to gain market share? Are they trying to penetrate a regional market further? So there's a lot that goes into it. But generally, the retailers are taking a reasonably conservative stance, and rightfully so, just like we are in a lot of respects.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Rich Moore, RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "On the dividend, David, where do you guys stand on that? It seems to me that you're at some sort of a minimum payout ratio at this point and you got to raise the dividend? Does that sound right?", "David Simon", "You're warm.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "So not yet, but getting there?", "David Simon", "Look, I think we're going to have to assess. Obviously, our taxable income is going to be affected by the Simon Ivanhoe sale. So we have to factor that in and obviously, we're going to spend the next four or five months doing that. But in addition to that, Rich, I think as a look at '11, our taxable income, there's a lot of stuff that is going on with us in terms of our taxable income, we have the share issuance, we had more shares outstanding, we had the taxable write-off associated with the bond premium that we paid. Assuming all of that kind of just normalized, we spend this year normalizing all of that, then I look at '11 and again, it's obviously, we're projecting an economic environment, but '11. But let's assume it's consistent with what we have, I mean we are -- I would venture to say at the bare, bare minimum of what we need to pay given where we are today. So that will definitely have to be addressed on a more permanent basis in '11, as a lot of the extraordinary events of the last year have played themselves out.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And then Steve, on the straight-line rent item, that seem to jump pretty high the quarter. Is there anything special in there? And that, does it go back down from here?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Nothing really special, Rich. And again, we talked about leasing velocity being higher, that tends to be driven by strictly [ph] (1:25:16) of deals you're doing so...", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And then same kind of thing on the preferred dividends for I and that was actually negative. I assume that some sort of accounting treatment for the retirement of the I, is that right?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Yes, it's just a cleanup and a true up for the redemption of the item we did in the first quarter.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And then on the recoveries, the recovery ratio, that was also a bit higher than usual? Is that going to continue you think?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, I mean we're in an environment now, Rich, where we're 80% converted to fixed TM [ph] (1:25:49), most of those have contractual annual increases in the recovery. So to the extent that we're able to manage our expenses at a rate below that, you should see the recovery continue to get better.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And then last thing, Rick, the list of retailers that are hot today, or that are getting hotter in the second quarter, have you got that?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, we always hesitate to do that because everybody else then starts to call them. But we are doing deals in '10, PS by Aero is rolling out,  Sperry and Stride Rite from Collective Brands, Michael Kors, Rue 21, Francesca. We're doing Microsoft deals, we're doing Pandora deals, LEGO Crazy 8 with Gymboree and Forever 21, as David has alluded to. There is a little bit higher velocity of tenant interest, and we're hopefully taking advantage of that.", "David Simon", "And on the box side, Rich, we have Target, Kohl's, I mean they're looking for moral opportunities so that bodes well for us as well.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Ian Wiseman, ISI.", "Ian Wiseman - Merrill Lynch", "Just a housekeeping question for Steve, the $13 million of transaction costs that you had this quarter, is that related to Prime? And if so, can we expect similar expenses for the balance of the year?", "Stephen Sterrett", "No, it's not just Prime, Ian. It's a combination of all, multiple transactions that we were working on. So some of which will occur, some of which didn't occur.", "David Simon", "Yes, I mean, I said, Ian, earlier that we'll continue to have Prime expenses in the third quarter, but that's a higher run rate and then obviously, upon the that transaction closing, as we expect that, that number ought to, obviously come down.", "Operator", "And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay. Thank you, everybody for participating. We look forward to talking to you in the future. Take care.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 Simon Property Group Earnings Conference Call. My name is Diana and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "Thank you. Welcome to Simon Property Group's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.", "Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date, July 30, 2010. During today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures which defined with the SEC's Regulation G. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section under Financial Information, Quarterly Supplemental Packages.", "Participating in today\u2019s call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'll just give a few minutes of overview, and then we'll open it up for some Q&A.", "First, on the financial and operational front, we reported FFO of $1.38 per diluted share for the quarter, which was $0.04 above first call consensus estimates, and which was also burdened by over $0.03 of nonrecurring transaction expenses for the quarter. In addition, we continue to lead our peer group in comparable property net operating income generating 1.9% growth in the second quarter of 2010, and 2.3% for the six-month period. Drivers in this leading comparable NOI include: Revenue and rent growth, increases in occupancy, higher percentage rents as a result of increasing sales in our continued and effective cost control on management, as well as reduction in bad debt compared to the previous period given the lower bankruptcies.", "As of 6/30, comparable sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $474 per square foot, as compared to $456 per square foot last year. Tenant reported sales, 4.9% higher during the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2009. And on a year-to-date basis, reported sales for six months ended June 30, were 6.2% higher as compared to the same period in 2009.", "As of 6/30, our occupancy was 93.1%, 90 basis points higher than 3/31, and 80 basis points higher than one year ago. At June 30, the re-leasing spread for our trailing 12 months was $0.50 per square foot, or 1.2%. Leasing spreads have been impacted by a number of jewelry store closings. But I also want you to keep in mind that this is just base rent. We've had an increase in our CAM of at least that number, if not more. And we'd also like you to keep in mind that our increase in occupancy of 90 basis points, or 700,000 square feet includes some leasing and some tougher locations that we were able to accomplish in the second quarter.", "Demand for space continues to improve. The ICSC convention was positive. Leasing activity has increased, and we fully executed 6.3 million square feet in new leases and renewals in the first six months of 2010 in malls and outlets as compared to 4.7 million square feet in the first six months of 2009.", "Finally, in Operational, I just want to say, the important point is that our year-to-date comparable NOI is up 2.3%, with higher sales, higher occupancy and positive leasing spreads.  Dispositions, let me move to that and acquisition activity. As we disclosed in our earnings release, we sold one asset in our GCI joint venture property, Porta di Roma, where we had a 19.6% interest, and our gain in that was $20 million. Of course, this is not included in FFO. And on July 15, we completed the previously announced sale of Simon Ivanhoe, our 50/50 European joint venture with Ivanhoe Cambridge. We received EUR 750 million, and Simon property group expects to record a gain of approximately $280 million on the transaction in the third quarter. We also entered into a JV with Unibail and Ivanhoe Cambridge to pursue the development of four new retail projects in France. We'll have a 25% interest in this venture and have the ability to determine on a project-by-project basis whether to retain our ownership interest.", "On May 13, we acquired the 345,000 square-foot outlet center from Prime, the Puerto Rico asset. In addition, on May 28, we increased our ownership interest of approximately 19% in Houston, which culminates in over a 50% interest in this terrific asset. The combined cost of these acquisitions was approximately $385 million and including the assumption of the existing indebtedness.", "Let me turn to the Capital Markets. In the first six months of the year, we paid off $700 million of senior unsecured notes. We've also unencumbered three malls, paying off approximately $800 million of mortgages in maturity. In July, we unencumbered two additional malls with $282 million of mortgages. The net result is we reduced our leverage by over $2 billion in the last seven months. ", "The secured markets continue to improve both on the life insurance market, as well as the CMBS. The other day, we've closed seven new loans totaling $900 million, $515 million was from life companies, $330 million from CMBS placements and $55 million from bank loan.  We've also locked rate in the third quarter of another $500 million of loans, $375 million coming from insurance companies, $125 million from CMBS originations. These three loans will have a weighted average of 5.3% and a term of 10 years. ", "At the end of the quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on hand, including our share of JVs, and the availability on our corporate credit facility, including the Simon Ivanhoe sale that occurred in July, which we used the partial proceeds to pay down our euro tranche of our revolver. We'll have $3.5 billion, so a total capital availability of over $6.1 billion.", "Development activity, we are higher than our budget given improving economic conditions. We originally budget around $100 million. We think we'll end up spending close to $200 million, and we expect to have double-digit returns on this capital. We're also excited to announce that we'll start the construction of Merrimack premium outlets in Merrimack, New Hampshire this fall with our projected opening in 2012. And we have two outlet centers undergoing significant expansions, Houston Premium Outlets and Las Vegas Outlet Centers.", "Also, we've done a very good job in our tactical projects, redevelopment opportunities as we've re-claimed certain departments locations and big boxes. During the first six month of 2010, we opened 14 new anchors for big boxes, including Nordstrom, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, H.H. Gregg. In addition, we have 15 additional stores under construction and schedule to open in 2010 and again, they include Forever 21, Whole Foods, Crate & Barrel and Target.", "On the international front, there are two new Premium Outlet Centers projected to open in 2010: Paju Premium in South Korea commenced construction in late March, that's in the northern part of Seoul; and Johor Premium Outlets is going to break ground in August, that will serve the Singaporean market. We're partnering with the Genting Group, a well-known and well-respected company in Malaysia and throughout the world. And on completion in 2011, we will have 11 premium outlet centers in Asia. ", "Now let me turn to Prime and then we're prepared to open up for questions. Our acquisition of Prime Retail is to be reviewed by the FTC, and we are fully cooperating in that review. I wanted to give you a couple of updates on the specifics of the deal. As I mentioned, we closed on the Puerto Rican asset of the outlet, of Prime's outlet center, and we're currently in the process of negotiating leases for all of the vacant space and once those with leases are executed, we'll be 100% occupied. We subsequently amended our agreement with Prime so that they will retain its Saint Augustine center, as well as its Livermore and Grand Prairie development projects.  ", "And as we noted in our May conference call, U.S. antitrust authorities have consistently recognized that the retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Retailers have many options to choose from when deciding where to sell their merchandise, including both a variety of brick-and-mortar locations. And of course, the Internet, where sales growth has exploded in recent years. ", "We have received an overwhelming show of support from this deal from our retailer tenants. They recognized the highly competitive nature of this business and our acquisition will provide a significant amount of new capital to a company currently in financial distress, and put that capital to work to improve the operations of Prime assets and therefore, improve the retailers' performance in those centers.", "We remain confident that we will close the remainder of the transaction. And as noted in our release, we have reaffirmed our 2010 guidance and once precise timing of the closing of Prime transaction is known, we will provide an upgrade to our guidance upon that inclusion.", "So finally, let me just say, I am proud of our organization and the quarter that we produced given all of the continuing uncertainty in the economic environment, and we're ready for questions.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Just going back to Prime. Just want to get a little more color here. I mean, United and Continental only announced the deal a few months ago, with EU has already approved that. What are your advisers and what is the FTC saying that's just taking so long on this?", "David Simon", "Alexander, I'd love to be able to comment further on it but you'll just have to rely on the statements that I've made. And again, we remain confident, but I really don't have much to add beyond what I've mentioned.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And then switching to leasing. I just want to get sort of an update on where you think TIs are going to end up this year? And then if we look at the re-leasing spreads over the next -- or the rent roll over the next few years, if we think about $38 being the sort of market and sort of $34 rent rolls, should we expect sort of 12% re-leasing spreads over the next few years?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think a lot's been -- we've read some of the analytic research today about the rent spreads and I think we need to park in back on a couple of things. One is last year was a tough, tough year. And as you know, we did a number of things to help our retailers survive last year. And as those leases have been executed, has put undeniably so pressure on our leasing spreads. So what we're seeing in our results is exactly what we expected. And in fact, I think the guidance that we gave to you early in this year actually, we thought we would have comparable NOI down, and we're actually performing much better than we anticipated. I think as the market stabilizes, we're convinced that we've got the ability to continue to generate positive leasing spreads that we have done historically as a public company for the last 17 years. So we are not immune to the economic environment that's occurred over the last 18 months. I'm proud of what we've done. The fact that we still have positive leasing spreads is a testament to the quality of our portfolio, testament to our positive relationships with our tenants and a testament to the organization. And I'd also say we leased -- we increased our occupancy and in this market, that's something to be proud of. So bottom line, long winded, this is -- sales increases, certainly rents are related to the ability to deal with, to rent increases given that we've seen rent stabilized and sales are moving in the right direction. We feel good that we'll continue to generate positive leasing spreads.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And then the TI expectation for the year?", "Stephen Sterrett", "TIs have not shown any appreciable change. We're still basically seeing the same amount of TIs that we've had historically.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "So like 75, or so for this year is fine?", "Stephen Sterrett", "I believe that's about where our run rate has been for the TIs.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Jeff Spector Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Actually, its Craig Schmidt here. Actually, I wanted to talk on the -- you had a very strong sequential pickup in occupancy, the 90 bps. And I guess in part, it sounds like you were able to lease some of the tougher locations you were saying. But as we look at the third and Fourth quarter, should the sequential gains slow, or are there still more tough locations you think you can get leased up in the last half of the year?", "Richard Sokolov", "Craig, this is Rick. We are still seeing a good flow of deals. Remains to be seen how much more we can sequentially increase on a 90 bp gain, but we should be able to hold those gains year over year.", "David Simon", "And certainly, historically, there is a pickup in occupancy as we go into the third and fourth quarter, so I would hope that we continue to do that. Obviously, there was one reasonable-sized bankruptcy, Premier Salon. We don't think there's a lot more but that's always the unknown. But we think that will move in the right direction.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And do you have a sense of where the occupancy might actually end up end of the year?", "David Simon", "Again, I think it will be positive. I wouldn't want to pinpoint the number at this point. But we were, again, looking for flat occupancy compared to last year but I think in our guidance, we'll be able to do better than that.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Christy McElroy, UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "I know how much you guys love questions on re-leasing spreads. I've realized that the stores, they're opening now, are reflective of some of the tough releases that were signed last year or over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a sense for what kind of spreads you're seeing on the small-shop leasing that you're doing today and is that sort of giving you the confidence in the forward-looking comments?", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Michele, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "Welcome to Simon Property Group's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that today's call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, November 1, 2010.", "During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section under Financial Information, quarterly supplemental packages.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "All right. I'll go through some financial and operations. Good morning. I'll go over some financial and operational results. First of all, we reported funds from operations of $0.90 per diluted share for the quarter, which was first call consensus estimate. This was accomplished despite the recording of transaction expenses of $47.6 million in the quarter or $0.14 per share. As you may know, GAAP now changed at the beginning of 2010 to require the expensing rather than the capitalizing of transaction expenses. FFO as adjusted, which excludes the impact of the debt extinguishment charge related to our August unsecured debt tender was $1.43 per diluted share, very importantly, an increase of $0.05 from $1.38 in the third quarter of 2009. It was another quarter of industry-leading operational performance. We continue to see improvement in our business conditions.", "And let me talk -- the next few comments will focus on our Mall and Outlet business, which contributes over 90% of our domestic NOI. Top sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $483 per square foot, up 7.6% as compared to $449 per square foot as of 9/30 '09. Tenant-reported sales were 10.6 higher during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to the third quarter of 2009. We're pleased to see this increase in our tenant sales, however, were more focused on growing our own revenues, and I'm pleased to report that our third quarter consolidated revenues grew $54 million or 5.9% over the prior-year period. Comparable property NOI growth was 3.6% for the quarter, 2.8% for the nine months. Drivers of the increase in comparable NOI continue to be rent growth from higher occupancy, higher overage rent, and lower bad debt expense. During the quarter, growth in base rents contributed 210 basis points to our comp NOI growth number. Overage was 80 basis points, and lower bad debt expense was roughly 60 basis points.", "As of 9/30, occupancy was 93.6%, sequentially 50 basis points higher than 6/30 and 80 basis points higher than one year ago. As of September 30, the releasing spread for the trailing 12 months was $1.13 per square foot, and we're seeing gradual improvement in deal flow in the pricing of our space.", "Acquisitions, let me just give you an update on that. And disposition activity on August 30, we completed the acquisition of Prime at a value of approximately $2.3 billion. The transaction added 21 outlet centers, outlet properties comprising 8 million square feet to our portfolio as of September 30. The properties were 94.7% occupied, with average base rents of $24.52 per square foot. And they generated sales of $406 per square foot. This portfolio is an excellent fit for us. It presents a compelling opportunity to benefit from shopper's demand for brand-name merchandise at attractive pricing, and we believe that our strong track record of operational excellence, financial resources, history of successful acquisition position us to meaningfully improve the performance of these assets for the benefit of tenants, retailers and consumers.", "On the disposition front, on July 15, we completed the sale of Simon Ivanhoe, our 50-50 joint venture, Simon and Ivanhoe Cambridge, our JV partner, received consideration of EUR 715 million. We recorded a gain of $281.3 million on the transaction. And as we discussed, we retained a 25% interest in core development properties with Ivanhoe and Unibail.", "Capital markets, again, we were very active in the third quarter. In August, we purchased for cash, outstanding notes maturing in 2013 and 2014. $1.3 billion of the bonds were tendered at a weighted average duration of 3.5 years, the weighted average coupon of 6.06%. We recorded a $185.1 million loss on the extinguishment of debt as was recorded in the quarter in connection with this purchase. And currently, we sold $900 million of 4 3/8 senior unsecured notes due 2021. The notes were priced to yield 4.42%. The lowest coupon of a 10-year REIT bond in history, net proceeds from the offering were used to partially fund the purchase of the senior unsecured notes tendered.", "As a result of these activities, we've significantly extended the duration of our senior unsecured notes portfolio from 6.8 years to 7.5 years and slightly decreased the weighted average interest rate on that portfolio. In the third quarter, we also closed five new loans totaling $700 million. Our share of that was approximately $300 million. The weighted average interest rate on the loans was 5.3% with a weighted term of 9.8 years.", "Noteworthy, we recently locked rate at Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego on a 10-year basis at 4.3%. Beginning of year, many of you are interested on how we planned on using our significant cash on hand. And at 12/31/'09, we had $4 billion. This gives you a sense of kind of how we deployed the cash in primarily three ways. The reduction of our unsecured debt including the net use of cash in connection with the tenders of $1.5 billion, retirement of secured debt and the unencumbering of assets of $1.1 billion, cash investment in prime and other acquisitions of roughly $550 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.3 billion of cash on hand, which includes our share of joint venture cash and our availability on our corporate facility of over $3 billion for a total liquidity position of $4.3 billion.", "Capital expenditures, if I could turn to that, is a little bit higher than we originally planned, approximately $200 million, which reflects an increase in the redevelopment activity as a result of the improving economic conditions and demand. This capital spend in 2010 includes the completion of our expansion to South Shore Plaza in Boston, The Domain in Austin and the expansion of the Houston Premium Outlets, which will open this month. The expansion and renovation of the Las Vegas Outlet Center, which is projected to open in March 2011 and more than 35 anchor and big box replacements in 2010. You'll be happy to know, I will not read them. You can find them in our 8-K.", "And during the third quarter, we started construction on two Premium Outlet Centers, Merrimack Premium Outlets in Merrimack, New Hampshire, which is a 380,000-square-foot center projected to open in June of 2012. There are 1.7 million residents living within 30 miles of the site with an average household income of $87,000. And the center is located one north of metropolitan Boston and sales tax-free New Hampshire. Johor Premium Outlets in Johor, Malaysia, which is 175-square-foot center projected to open in November of 2011, is located one hour's drive from Singapore, and Johor Premium Outlets is being developed in a joint venture with Genting Group. Our interest in that is 50%. By the end of 2011, we will have 11 Premium Outlet Centers open and operating in Asia, generating total NOI at the property level of well over $200 million.", "We continue to look at opportunities to upgrade existing department store. Our representation are working to identify future department store availability based on existing performance. We have been very successful on our efforts to re-tenant department store and other big-box space and have another 25 deals approved with openings expected in 2011. And again, you'll be happy to note, I won't read those.", "As part of our renewed redevelopment push, we've identified 16 Regional Mall assets as potential transformational properties. The scope of these project ranges from adding department stores, restaurants, specialty store tenants to the redevelopment of the entire asset, and we expect work to commence on some of these in 2011.", "Finally, let me conclude by saying that we are extremely pleased to announce an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.80, an increase of 33%. This number will -- this getting to $2.60 for the year, which will approximate our taxable income, and it also position us on a trajectory to pay at least $3.20 per share in 2011. Based upon our results in the quarter and the expectations for the balance of the year, we're also pleased today to increase our 2010 FFO guidance as adjusted by $0.13 on the low end and $0.08 on the high end. And again, we are pleased to re-affirm to you that we expect to be sector-leading growth in 2011 and beyond and we're ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "I've got Ross [Nussbaum] on the line with me as well. Dave, just following up on your comments on redevelopment, can you give us some of the economics behind expected redevelopment starts over the next couple of years relating to those 16 malls? Like total spend, timing of starts, that type of thing?", "David Simon", "Well, redevelopment is an art, not a science. But I think our projected spend on these 16, depending on the scope, will be approximately $1.5 billion. And we would certainly, of the 16, hope to get a couple of them started in 2011. We're making some good progress on securities and commitments. And then with those commitments, I think we'll begin to actually start the projects. So I would hope that we would have two to four next year, and then at least get to 16 going by 2013.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "And as you were looking at those opportunities, what kind of returns are you targeting?", "David Simon", "I would say to you that they're consistent with what we've done historically. And in the redevelopment, we're still striving to get double digits around 10% at some will average a little bit lower than that, but some will be above that. So I would hope that we would be able to generate about 10% on the total investment over that three- or four-year period of time.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "What's your occupancy today including temp tenants? Can you give us a sense for how temp leasing has trended so far in the second half relative to past years? And can you discuss some of the economics of the Toys \"R\" Us pop-ups as compared to normal temp leasing?", "David Simon", "Well, let me just say, as you know, we don't include seasonal or temporary tenants in our occupancy. Unless a tenant, unless a retailer is in there for over a year, it is not included in our occupancy. So the seasonal tenants, if you've been -- and as you know, you've walked through plenty of our malls, our malls look 100% occupied even though there may be some temporary tenants, or handful of temporary tenants in the malls. So it does not include that number. So with that said, I think the demand is reasonably better this year than last year. And the rents, I don't talk specifically about particular tenants, but I think Toys record are doing more deals this year than last year substantially. But we don't talk specific rents about tenants. But I assume they had a successful Christmas last year, otherwise they wouldn't commit to more this year.", "Richard Sokolov", "And the only other thing I would add is that of the temporary tenants that Toys opened with us last year, we were able to convert a significant number than in the long-term permanent deals. This gives them an opportunity to see how a given property is going to react to their offering. And if it is encouraging, they are prepared to commit long term, and we're anticipating to have a number of those convert this year as well.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "And then Ross has a question or two as well.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Are you looking to monetize that investment anytime soon?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't comment on stuff like that, I try not to, I'm not perfect in that area. Actually, it's really gallery commercial, GCI as we call it. So I really have no comment on that, I'm sorry to say.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "The other question I have is can you break out the same-store NOI growth on the malls versus the Premium Outlets to get a sense of whether those numbers are consistent or was one number driving it?", "David Simon", "The answer is given the fact that they're both material contributors, they both contributed significantly to our growth. And I will just say this, that based upon what I have seen, the mall top NOI growth is still industry-leading if that helps you in any way, but we don't break those out as you know.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And I would assume fair to say that outlets are perhaps leading, the industry-leading mall number?", "David Simon", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, just in terms of the dividend, I think you said that this would be at least to start off, and it sounds like maybe some of the gain offset by some of the charges pushing the taxable for this year. How are you thinking about the dividend heading into 2011 as to where you would want to set it? And is it going to be a few quarters for an increase? Or you would think about it relative to when you provide the '11 guidance in January to what level the board is comfortable moving that $3.22?", "David Simon", "Well, let me just say this. You may not have caught this in my last remarks. We expect, obviously, it's subject to board discussion, but I think it's safe for you to assume that we're going to be paying out $0.80 per quarter next year. And there is a possibility. Obviously, we're going to have to pay out or we want to pay 100% of our taxable income. As we look at '11, even though we haven't finalized our budget process for '11 and there's a lot of things that go in and out in taxable income, and there are obviously government has some involvement in that. For instance extending bonus depreciation, there's certain states that have an input on that. But I would say that we expect to pay out at least $3.20. And to the extent that our taxable income is higher then we would pay out more, and that would be determined in the fourth quarter of next year.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And then in terms of the steps, in your supplemental, you broke out Prime, it's on Page 24, in terms of the occupancy and the sales per foot, but you still kept in the Premium Outlets in with the malls. I'm just curious why you did that.", "David Simon", "Just because we wanted to make them scrub all the numbers, make sure it's all -- we wanted to give the market a sense of what the Prime portfolio was by itself. And then next quarter, we intend to meld those into our numbers, but we felt since it was just a month old, there hasn't been a lot of data out there. We wanted to give the market a chance to see the portfolio, but it will be melded in next quarter.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Rather than melded out and split all?", "David Simon", "Well, we understand your opinion on that, and I have an opinion on certain things as well, and we'll continue to welcome those opinions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Harris from Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I have a question on credit quality, tenant credit quality. Many of us saw Gymboree taken out by private equity interest as recently. And obviously, we've seen the JCPenney move. Tell me, is there anything in your leases that sort of protects your position from a deterioration credit? I mean many of these private equity deals seem to involve, will seem to involve additional debt on the balance sheet. So you got a less credit-worthy tenant theoretically than you have before?", "Richard Sokolov", "David, it's Rick. In certain of our leases, we do have those constraints. And we have requirements for annual certifications and minimum net worth requirement. In the large public companies, typically that would not be present. What we are focused on going forward, and what they're going to focus on going forward is the ability to convince us that they're going to be able to pay their rent as it comes due. And I would tell you that we very give you an example, Golden Gate acquired Express. That was acquired all cash, now went public. The fact that something goes private is not synonymous with a significant lease up, adding of debt and a decrease of the result in EBITDA. We monitor that, literally on a biweekly basis for all of our tenants. And if we see a tenant that is going the wrong way, we will reach out to them and tell them we're not going to be able to do more business with you until you get that more in line.", "David Simon", "Yes, I'll just say, this is David, that I still call them LBOs, but the model has changed somewhat with respect to leverage buyouts. And first of all, there's been enough historical bad deals done where leverage was pushed too high, and I assume that a number of the sponsors understand that. Second, and it gets back to Rick's point, with express and others, the model today, frankly, is to grow the business. And what we're seeing is when there are companies thinking private, the growth plans in a lot of cases actually accelerate as opposed to decelerate. So we don't expect much of a change from Gymboree. They had a pretty good growth trajectory. We expect that to continue, if not increase. So the model's a little bit different, and we can only hope that some of the past mistakes have been thoroughly reviewed about too much leverage. But let's face it, it is a reasonable concern for us to be focused on.", "Richard Sokolov", "And I would say generally, the credit profile of our tenants has frankly never been better in terms of their free cash flow and their multiples of EBITDA to debt. So in that regard, it's a macro consideration. Things are more favorable today by a significant margin than they've been in the past.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "David, I've got a question for you in the global. Obviously, this is an environment where there's a great deal of volatility in FX and particularly the expectation that the dollar may be a weak counter against a number of leading currencies. As that includes to your thinking about where you want to take the company as a global entity over the next, over recent times?", "David Simon", "Well, I guess in a sense if you had a really negative view on the dollar and we felt like we could put our capital to work outside of the U.S., and add value to that real estate, then we would be somewhat motivated to do that. But it's very tough to have a kind of a permanent view on the dollar or where it's going. I mean obviously, the last couple of months are wonderful indications of that where we thought we're going to have parity, not we but the world thought we were going to have parity with the euro. And now we're headed it back in the other direction. So it's certainly much factor in now. The factor matters. We could still, aside from a number of emerging markets, we still hedge a pretty good chunk of your investment if you wanted to. But if you did have the view that the dollar was going to be in a permanent decline, then as a steward of capital, would make potentially more sense to have assets outside of U.S. than it does more assets outside of U.S. than we currently have. But at the end of the day, we've got to make real estate decisions. We're real estate people, and we've got to believe that whatever we buy, we're buying at the right value. We could add value to it. Steve, I don't know if you look at anything to it?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, I think David's right. I will just say one thing, David, that one of the things that we do is because we finance our existing JV in the local currency. As you know, we do have a bit of a natural hedge anyway and that we're collecting rent as an example in Italy in euros, but the entity is also financed primarily with euro-denominated debt.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "If we just set aside then the currency issue for the moment, David, if you look at the world as a sort of range of opportunities, do you still see the U.S. as offering you predominantly the most attractive area to allocate your capital?", "David Simon", "Well, David, I would say that the activity in the U.S. and our sector has considerably slowed. But that doesn't mean that there aren't going to be opportunities. I mean sometimes, they arise when you don't expect them and sometimes, you have to be patient. And that's been our mantra for quite some time. If you look at the history of our company, we've been -- the consistent history of it is we've been criticized every step of the way, but the good news is I think we've made a lot of right decisions. So when we bought CPI, nobody was expecting malls to really trade, and everybody thought we overpaid. But obviously, the history is that we did a hell of a deal. When we got into the outlet sector and after a few years of experience understanding the business, in 2000, we built a couple. We bought it in '04, we've grown that business. We brought it out of the kind of the dark ages into respectability both in terms of the returns it could generate, but also in terms of what retailers thought about it. And we brought more retailers into the marketplace. So my view of it is we've just got to be ready. You don't necessarily know when it might happen. We don't do deals just to do deals. Occasionally, our discipline has not been perfect. So every once in a while, we've done that, but we've done it on a basis that obviously financially, we could handle that. And so I'm not -- even though there's nothing eminent in the U.S., I'm certainly not thinking that, that won't have opportunities for us. But I also think internationally and in Asia, it kind of gets lost in the sauce here because of the size. But as I said in my opening remarks, we're going to have 11 centers in Asia. This is a portfolio. So our share in Japan is 40%, in Korea, it's 50% and so on. But that's going to generate over $220 million of NOI next year with the other growth prospects. In fact, tonight in New York, I have dinner with our Japanese partner. There's other areas in Asia that we're going to examine, so we've got lots of ways to grow the company. I'm not discouraged in the U.S. at this moment, but it's not like it was a year ago. Good news is we made a deal in '09 when others didn't, and we've also made the right decisions like in 2004. We didn't buy Rouse where others did. So I'm cool about everything.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "So if I look at your lease metrics, you've done 9 million, 10 million square feet of deals this year at $41 a foot, and lease expiration has been around $40. Could you help me kind of connect the dots between that? And next year or the year after, you've got 18 million square feet expiring between $33 and $34? And how much of that is just not really comparable, or I mean what we expect to see I think in terms of lease spreads, lease opening rates to go down significantly? Basically, what you've done so far or your spreads are going to widen out significantly?", "Richard Sokolov", "Paul, it's Rick. First of all, when you're dealing with our numbers, when you say 8 million or 9 million, that's a whole lot of activity that is going to transcend any specific for the most part qualitative skewing in the Mall business. What we are seeing is increasing activity from our tenants as the sales have gone up, our occupancy costs have come in. And we're hopeful that we're going to be able to improve upon our spread next year over this year. That's the anticipation. We've been able to hold our numbers, and one of the things that has obviously helped, we're in a benign bankruptcy market. And so as we are getting more demand, we have less spaces that are going out whether we have to replace them when we weren't anticipating. So all those factors will hopefully give us a little better pricing.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add two things. We talked a little bit about it on the last call, but in 2010, we did lose higher renting tenants like the jewelry stores. And so the dollar of the square footage that was the denominator in the equation is certainly higher than what you'd see in the lease expiration schedule going forward. So absent that, in 2010, we had much fewer square footage lost, certainly the last couple of quarters. I didn't expect our closures to be closer to our lease expiration. I think that's one. And so that does suggest that you could see an increase in spreads next year. Another indicator that I would offer you that I think supports that is our calculation is an apple and an orange. We add up all the leases that we do, and we compare it to all the leases that closed, but they're not necessarily the same leases. But we do track internally a same-space leasing spread, and that number on a rolling 12-month basis is about $2.30. So it's a fair bit higher than what you'd see in the publicly reported spread. And I think that goes to Rick's point and just seeing an improved quality of the yield, and I think again, as we go into 2011, knock on wood, I would think you would start to see acceleration in our spread.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "That $2.30 same-space number, does the pattern of it over time look similar to the number you reported here, the apples-and-oranges number? I mean was that in the order of kind of $8 or $10 a couple years ago?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It was higher a couple of years ago, for sure. Yes.", "David Simon", "I would say it masks pretty much the openings and closings until. Obviously, that number is depressed from where we reported in '08, '07 and '06 given the economic conditions that exist. And I would underline Steve's point in that, what drove our closings was unanticipated jewelry stores and what not. But if we get back to kind of the natural expirations, then our spreads ought to migrate toward where they have been historically.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And then on the occupancy side, how do you include Chelsea in there, I have a little bit harder time figuring out where you were in terms of occupancy versus your -- and how far in the malls do you think you are off your 2007-or-so peak? And do you think you can, what's the timing for you to get back to that type of level?", "Richard Sokolov", "This is Rick. I think we're going to continue to make progress towards getting back towards that peak. We have our 80 bps spread that we had through 9/30. We should hopefully hold that through the remainder of the year end. We're anticipating continued progress on top of that going into '11. And so we should be creeping up on that 2007 occupancy, assuming that we don't have unanticipated bankruptcies and other things going out that we don't see today.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Paul, just to fill in the dots or the blank, if you will, we're between 100 and 150 basis points below the peak occupancy in the Mall business.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Last question on the outlet side, obviously, there have been people who've been talking about new projects as well, have you done any analysis? I mean how much opportunity do you think there is for new outlet centers in the U.S.?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I don't have a specific number that I can tell you. There's a lot being talked about and we know what we want to build, which is the Premium Outlets. So we think there's some of those to be built, but I can't give you a specific number, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Rick, you mentioned occupancy cost has trended down a bit as the sales have come back and clearly bad debts trending in a much better direction. I guess two questions. One, how widespread is the sales increase, I guess if you strip out Apple and other stores, how widespread is it? And even looking at Class A malls versus Class B? And number two, as you think about the leasing, just following on Paul's question, what is your target for occupancy cost I guess as you look out to 2011?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, let me do the first. In the Mall business, it is pretty broad across project types and across the various categories. Obviously, in junior, some are going to be doing better than others because that's a highly quarter-to-quarter and fashion-driven business. But we've seem very good stability across those. In terms of our occupancy cost, I think we've always said that we'd like to be in the 13% to 14% range in the Mall business and outlets have been operating less than that. And so long as we can stay in that range, we've seen historically that our retailers can make very good profit. And we can make an acceptable return on our assets, and that's pretty much where we are trying to drive the business.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe for David, I guess even with the dividend increase, you guys are still going to have a fair amount of free cash flow per year. And you've got $1 billion of cash, the line is free and clear. Are you looking to build cash on the balance sheet? Or do you think you look to pay down debt? Because it looks that you're going to have $500 million to $600 million of free cash flow even after the dividend as well as the investment and redevelopment?", "David Simon", "Well, we'll continue to delever. It's a nice spot to be in. And absent specific investment opportunities, we'll continue to delever, which will obviously add to our growth rate and hopefully our multiple, even though it's not clear that, that's the case like at this particular point. But let me go back to Rick's earlier point. The thing that excites me is, yes, I loved tenant sales growth, but I get more excited about our own revenue growth. And there's a lot to the mall and to the outlet center that -- now I understand the correlation between tenant sales and potentially what our revenue is, but the fact of the matter is what's most important to me is our revenue growth and because part of our job is to merchandise the center where if our retailers aren't producing the revenues that are commensurate with that center, we ought to replace it. And that doesn't get picked up in the comp sales numbers. So that's our -- I don't want anybody mistaken about our focus, is to increase our revenues, which obviously, given the high operating margins we have in our business, that tends to drop disproportionately to the bottom line. That's our focus.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And lastly, any quick comments on Florida? How trends are there?", "David Simon", "Better.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "Better than the average?", "David Simon", "Yes. Better than the average.", "Richard Sokolov", "Particularly in the tourist-driven properties, there have been a substantial increase in tours coming in from South America and Europe for that matter. And that's a significant number of properties we have in the state. And they are outperforming.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "The 21 Prime properties, they are currently doing I guess $406 a foot and $24.52 at an average rent, is there any reason why those metrics after they've been managed through the Chelsea team they can't reach Chelsea's level? Or is there some geography or something constraints that they may not allow them to reach that sort of level?", "David Simon", "Well, we expect to enhance the properties like we would hope in anything that we've done, and Prime has done a good job over the years. But we would hopefully build upon that and continue to increase the productivity and the cash flow from those centers.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then in terms of Orlando, you already have about 550 square feet of outlet space, and you're adding almost another 1 million. Is there anything you need to do to adapt that space? Or given Rick's comments about the stronger tourist markets, that may not be necessary?", "David Simon", "Well, Orlando is an interesting market because it's really so many different markets by themselves. And they operate kind of independently because the tourism is such that they're different markets. So the answer is not really. They all serve their current market well, and the good news is that Orlando market is unique in terms of driving visitor traffic, there's nothing in the horizon that would, suggest that they can't continue to drive the 40-plus million visitors a year. And we're the beneficiary as long as we continue to maintain high-quality properties catering to those individual submarkets appealing to the tourists that go to each individual tourist destination.", "Richard Sokolov", "And to David's point that there are separate markets, substantial number of tenants are operating in both properties, because there are a lot of people that are going to Universal and staying on International Drive that are not going down to Disney and staying on the Disney compound. So there are two distinct properties and two distinct markets.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then finally, I noticed there has been a sales square foot improvement in The Mills as well as an occupancy pickup. Are you introducing more outlet conference than that? Or is that just a standard business as usual and it's...", "David Simon", "We aren't introducing more outlets, tenants. And additionally, some that we're changing, we're changing kind of what that center is going to be. For instance in Gurnee, we were actually expecting to modify a big chunk of that center to the full priced but the rest is a lot of just bringing in the better merchants, a number of which are brand-name outlet operators. Plus, Rick and -- I don't want to bore you with the details, he's got his list, he's dying to read it, but we won't let him. Is that we're adding, we're doing a good job of re-tenanting the boxes that we lost with Steve & Barry's, Linens 'n Things, Circuit City's, et cetera. We've got a couple of Bloomingdale outlets that we've brought in to the center, so just better leasing management and taking advantage of a better economic scenario. And Rick is available later to read you all of what he's done recently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Just quickly on the capital side, and this is probably more for your JV properties. Just given where the portfolio lenders are, and it seems like they're a little behind. Maybe they caught up, but it seems like they're behind in allocating for the year. Has any of that caused you guys or your JV partners to reconsider refinancing plans? Or is it more that the thought of refinancing a property is a much bigger decision than just simply where you can get a rate and a sizable loan on a project?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Alex, this is Steve. I think it's the latter. Our refinancing decision is above and beyond just what your capital spend is. But having said that, it's a high-class problem to have because we do have many properties, JV properties where we've got substantial capital to spend. Rick whispered to me that we're in the midst of doing a renovation of Fashion Valley where we just refinanced. We have some other properties that are in that list of 16 assets that David mentioned that could potentially be transformational. And a couple of them that I can think of right off hand, it's very low leverage. So the opportunity to roll the source of capital for that transformation into a single financing is certainly there. So we'll look at it on a case-by-case basis.", "David Simon", "Look. If a mortgage does not subject to a prepayment penalty or yield maintenance penalty, we are actively talking to our partners about refinancing it. A traditional secured debt usually has something along those lines. But we don't have a lot of floating rate debt on our JV at all, period. But to the extent that it's not locked out or the yield maintenance is de minimis or there is none, then we're talking about a partner about refinancing, which is exactly what happened in Fashion Valley. Fashion Valley is a great scenario historically, thinking about kind of what happened, I think we had -- can't remember all the details other than it came to in '08. Both of us had to put capital in to pay off the mortgage, which I believe was a couple hundred million bucks. Then we got a $50 million loan. And then we got that $50 million went to $100 million, then that $100 million went to $200 million. And now the $200 million went $475 million, all in a span of 18 months. So maybe that's a pretty good recollection. So I mean that's kind of what happened. We actually had to put in equity, and thankfully, our partner and us had the equity do it. But we had to unencumber that asset for a while at the end of '08.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And then moving to the Prime, now that the books have been closed, can you give us a split of -- originally, I think on the cash yields, you were talking about an 8% of what you think the gap yield will be.", "David Simon", "Well, no, but we'll do better.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And then just finally, wrapping up on Prime, there was the item in their press release about the consent agreement. Is this just something that sort of just an ordinary document processing thing? Or is this anything that could linger for a while?", "David Simon", "We don't believe so. In other words, we do think it's ordinary course.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Going back to the debt paydowns, not a lot coming due in terms of secured and unsecured notes next year. Should we expect anything in terms of maybe a pool of assets like we saw in 2010 get unencumbered?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Michael, we don't actually have a lot of opportunity to unencumber assets in 2011. But as David has already mentioned, we're looking at the balance sheet everyday. We're certainly working it. Absent of transaction opportunities, we will delever. It was interesting you said not a lot to do, but we still got $1 billion plus of mortgages to redo in 2011. There's sliver interest of bond figures about $400 million less than '11 that wasn't tendered. You could certainly see us pay that down. But we'll just pay attention to where the market is.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "First, Rick, can you just talk about what percentage of leasing you might have already done for 2011 at this point in the year and compare it to, say, a year ago? And how much leasing you had done in 2010?", "Richard Sokolov", "We're through probably about 39%, 38%, 39% of our '11, and that's pretty much where we were this time last year.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "So even though you're feeling better about the world, I guess I'm just trying to figure out if may be that 39% got committed to a lower rate, now the world's better?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, one of the things that were doing, and we said this last year, we're not in as much of a hurry because the world is getting better. And renewals in '11, some renewals are literally still 13 months out. So there is certainly no hurry to have to address those renewals that are in the fourth quarter where we think we're going to be in a much better shape. We could look. We can control that by deciding how we price our space, and so we're going to be very deliberate in how we price our space, and that's going to impact the pace of our renewals.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "And then I was wondering if you could maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about Prime, and as you kind of look at that portfolio today and maybe hearken back to when you bought Chelsea, I didn't see an occupancy cost David  disclosed for that portfolio, but just what sort of upside do you see? I mean obviously a portfolio is not as productive as the Chelsea assets, but as you kind of look here today, you've owned it for a month, what kind of opportunities do you see embedded in that portfolio?", "David Simon", "Well, let's just say, there's no way to replicate what we got out of the Chelsea portfolio, other than a few individual centers here or there. As you know, that's the highest portfolio out there. Look, I think, Steve, it's relatively straightforward stuff. It's better marketing, and it is better leasing through better merchandise management. And when you do the two together, they kind of fuel off each other, and you get the desired impact that you're looking to. And there's also going to be the ability to reclaim, re-demolish certain space that we think we can make more productive. Little developments, we had our board at Queenstown last week as an example, and there's a little corner of the center, good center, good leasing, but there's a corner that's effectively not part of the nice atmosphere that was created there. So trying to figure out how to anchor that and re-tenant it and make it part of the center. It's going to be the kind of things that we do. And we've already identified a number of the better merchants that we think we'll be able to add to the portfolio. There's less and less of opportunities to better merchandise to the centers.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "Well, David, if you don't want to disclose the occupancy cost, can you just tell us if it's above or below where I guess the Chelsea portfolio or the Premium Outlet portfolio is?", "David Simon", "It's below.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "And Steve, I know it's sort of a technical question, but the $47 million in charges this quarter, any way to sort of just break out some of that amongst the different buckets of things you pursued?", "Stephen Sterrett", "No, Steve, it's just a composition and a compilation related to everything.", "David Simon", "The important point is that you don't expect to see that going forward.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "Are there any lingering charges that might occur in Q4 as a result of many of the activities you pursued this year?", "David Simon", "De minimis.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Yes, I wouldn't expect it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just returning to the rent spread issue, can you just please provide some detail on the rent spread, just breaking out malls versus outlets?", "David Simon", "We put those together, Nate, if you hadn't noticed.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, I know but you gave out a little bit of detail on the fixed NOI before in terms of saying that it was above the -- it was still industry-leading. Would you say that malls were positive this quarter or the trailing 12?", "David Simon", "Yes, I'd say malls are relatively flat.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quentin of Credit Suisse.", "Andrew Fenton - Cliffwood Partners", "If you remove the Apple from your sales number, do you know how much of the percent growth that attributes?", "David Simon", "Very, very, very little. Remember, we have 65 million square feet, then we had the outlet stores. So it's 80 million, you had like 40 Apple stores so I don't have it off the top of my head, but it would be de minimis in terms of the growth. I mean obviously, we think they're a great retailer and a great company, and we want to do more and more stores with them. But in terms of having a major impact, it's just not there for us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Cedric Lachance of Glenn (sic) [Green] Street Advisors.", "Cedric Lachance - Green Street", "Do you have a small stake in value retail in Europe. What's your appetite for doing more on the outlet side on the European continent?", "David Simon", "Well, I would say that, put value retail aside, I would say that we have obviously a nice U.S. Outlet business. We have a nice Asian Outlet business. And strategically, given there is a commonality of the product and retailers, it would be nice to have a European presence in that business. But I won't talk specifically about value retail or anybody else, but it would make strategic sense for us to be represented in Europe with good quality outlet centers.", "Cedric Lachance - Green Street", "And what's the best way to approach that? Is it development primarily? Or do you think there are interesting acquisition targets over time?", "David Simon", "Well, I'd say both are tough, frankly, Cedric. Development is clearly the hardest to do, but we have looked at certain things in the past. And I would say on the acquisition side, there could be opportunities for us down the road. So I would lean more toward acquisitions than ground-up development just because of the length required to develop there and all of the uncertainties and all the stops and starts, but we look at both. We look at both.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a few quick follow-up points. Could you tell us what occupancy costs actually were at the end of third quarter?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, for the end of the third quarter, for combining malls and outlets, it was 12.1%.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then the reversal of the provisioning during the quarter, could you talk a little bit about the reasoning behind that and what we can kind of expect", "in regards to provisioning on a going-forward basis?", "Stephen Sterrett", "What happened in the third quarter, quite frankly is we just collected some receivables that we had fully reserved for. And when you collect something in cash and there's no longer anything to offset it with on the balance sheet, you have to flow through income. I mean historically, Tayo, our bad debt expense runs about 50 basis points for 0.5% of revenue. I would tell you, it looks like 2010 is a year where we're going to end up with literally close to zero bad debt expense. But if you're looking on a go-forward basis, I think it would be difficult to replicate that experience in 2011. So I'd expect to see some return to a more normal level of bad debt.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And last question, as we start to head into the holiday season, just could you give us a general sense of what you're hearing from your tenants about what sales look like and what their expectations are going to be?", "David Simon", "Look, I will tell you that the good news is Christmas, the holiday season, is no longer make or break for our retailers the way it's been 20 years ago. It's all you heard about was they had to have a good Christmas season to survive. Our retailers are much better operators, so it's not make or break the holiday season any longer. I can tell you that generally, the holiday season never meets expectations too. I think one out of the last 10 years, it's met expectations. So much has to do with the mood and psyche here of consumer, and there's obviously a lot out there to sway it one way or the another. I'll leave my political views to the side for the time being. So the long-winded answer is my own personal view is it won't meet expectations, but it's just because I'm betting on history that it never seems to. And when I say expectations probably more of what the media and our efforts and some of these other people put out. But I don't get overly excited one way or another what it meets or beats or doesn't, just because I think from a retailer's point of view, they've learned how to manage it appropriately. They do seem poised to have a better season because inventories have been built up. That's good and bad, right? That's good in the sense that if there is demand, they could drive sales. On the other hand, it is looking like the season could be a touch more promotional than it has been in the past. But again, I don't get caught up in -- it's almost like the politics is going to win and who's not going to win. Lots of pundits out there. The good news is from our retailers, they seem to be able to manage it either way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Keefe Bruyette and Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "David, you mentioned the occupancy cost is currently lower for Prime versus your other outlets. I'm curious if you have the same occupancy cost target for both outlet portfolios when you sign new leases? And if you don't, I'm wondering if there's any reason why you can't get to that same level for Prime?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think we have enough experience that we know what market rents ought to be and given that, we feel good that there's growth in the Prime portfolio and not only because of where rents are versus were market rents are, but also because we're going to make the centers better. And by making them better, retailers are going to want to be there, and Ben, that's potentially -- I wish it were more complicated than that, but that's basically what our guys are charged to do.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I mean but will there come a day when you can maybe narrow that occupancy cost gap? Or do maybe less-productive outlet centers just naturally get a lower occupancy cost?", "David Simon", "Well, there's certainly part of that. There's no question there's part of that. Typically, what we've had in the Outlet business is even though rents have been increased, sales have increased even to the higher rates. So the occupancy costs still can't catch up to the number that make sense. But clearly, there are going to be centers that have lower productivity. You're not going to be able to charge the kind of rent that you could at higher productivity. So there's certainly part of that element with Prime and even existing outlets that we have today. And that's the same thing for malls as well.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Did you guys revise your same-store NOI guidance for the year? Because I think it currently stands at about 1% to 1.5%?", "David Simon", "I'm looking at '11, so the answer is no, but I think we'll do better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "On percentage rent, we're looking at percentage rent as a percentage of sales, and those seem to go higher. Is that the inclusion of Prime, do you think, or is there something else going on there?", "David Simon", "It has nothing to do with Prime at all really. We only had Prime in for a month. It's really just better sales across the portfolio, obviously both in the Mall and in the Outlet side.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "So you think that to continue? You think that's sort of trending higher? Is that what it sounds like?", "David Simon", "Well, it's clearly trending higher as you can see by our growth of our retailers, that's for sure. But it is a variable number and once the retailer's in there, it's out of our control. It's really how they produce. But in audit, assuming it continues on that path, it ought to be certainly higher than last year.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And then in the other income line, Steve, in the joint venture portfolio, that seemed to jump unusually, what was in there again?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It's two things that are primarily driving it, Rich, one is the property that we are a 25% owner of had a large out lot peripheral transaction, that it was about a $20 million gain. Our share of that was about $6 million. So even though you're seeing a large impact in the JV footnote, actually our share of it isn't that significant. The other one is just you see this in the consolidated financials as well. We had a higher level of lease termination activity. I think it was up about $10 million in the JVs, and I think our share of that was about $3 million. So that's the majority of the increase, the rest of it is just normal growth in business that we're seeing across some of the line items that flow through there.", "Operator", "You have a follow up from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "Just in terms of the 16 transformational redevelopment projects you were speaking about earlier on, I think you sort of mentioned that a few of us those projects would be complete redevelopments of the assets. So I'm just curious which assets they were and whether or not we should be thinking about that as sort of defensive CapEx as well as expansion CapEx?", "David Simon", "Well, we have two malls that are basically have been de-malled and produce no income today. And in fact, they have a slight negative. So those certainly would be in that category. But I don't think, given the opportunity ahead of us and given the lack of new space out there, I would say to you that not any of this is really defensive. It's really because there's an opportunity in there, and demand has somewhat increased. When I think of defensive, the way you describe it is may be in connection with something else happening in the marketplace, these are just there to be done to improve upon.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And so of the $1.5 billion, it's a very small proportion?", "David Simon", "Clearly.", "Operator", "You will follow up from Dan (sic) [David] Harris of Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I don't know if I dare ask this question, but general growth comes out of a bankruptcy shortly and it's got some powerful backers and a rebuilt balance sheet. Have you been briefing the troops for a tougher battle ahead?", "David Simon", "I'll let our performance speak for itself. So fact of the matter is, David, we have prospered whether general growth was growing in bankruptcy or emerging from bankruptcy. The bottom line is we've been able to grow our business and do well regardless of what they or anyone else has done. And I look back and say it's very interesting to me, and I know a lot of people are in earnings focused, but we're going to be one of the few -- let's just take First Call as a barometer. Based on '11, we're actually have the potential, if you use First Call as a barometer to actually have the best earnings per share that we've had. So yes, we've been some diluted deals. We've sold common stock, I'm not thrilled about the price that we did, but we felt like in the scheme of things, we had to do it. We're actually our growth is it such that we're going to, if you believe First Call -- and obviously we're going to come out with our guidance, but I wouldn't be talking like this if I didn't think that, that was a possibility. We're going to actually outgrow our dilution and, hopefully next year, do better than what we've ever done, which was an '08 record FFO per share. So our record FFO per share I think was $6.42. You can see that our dividend trajectory is back to where it was. You compare all of the other retail REITs out there and in particular, all the other retail REITs, they're 30%, 40% of their FFO per share and 30% and 40% of their dividend per share, and in some cases even a lot worse than that. So as an example, I won't say it, because I mean it's really -- so the fact of the matter is our troops know what we want them to do regardless of whether what happens with general growth or not. So I think I answered your question.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Let's try to tackle it a slightly different way. Setting aside the public companies, and obviously we've got have had a fairly good handle on that, do you have a sense, David, that you picked up?", "David Simon", "We have an interesting chart, we'd be happy to share with you.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Let me ask my question, maybe you can show me the visuals in a couple of weeks. Do you have a sense over the last couple of years, the stronger companies would obviously include most of the public companies within our group, have picked up substantial market share from some of the other layers in your marketplace?", "David Simon", "Well, certainly. And certainly at a property level, there's some of that, but more importantly, it's really at a company level that you can see that differentiation easiest.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Does the chart show that? It must be bottom left to top right, all charts that I ever look at look go that way don't we?", "David Simon", "Certainly, when we do the charts.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Is that what you're going to show me in a couple of weeks, David?", "David Simon", "We will now.", "Operator", "We have a follow up from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "I just wanted to make sure, Steve, when you're providing that same-store NOI increase in the 8-K, that does include the benefit of lease termination income?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It does not include the benefit of lease termination income. We got a great lease termination income now.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "So I guess really then, the figure for the nine months does include the benefit of basically the reversal of the bad debt this year but not the increase in lease termination income?", "Stephen Sterrett", "That's correct. Bad debt is a component of lease...", "David Simon", "In our earlier comments, we've mentioned how much that was. It was at 3.6.", "Stephen Sterrett", "For the quarter, bad debt has added about 50 basis, points. So then 3% of bad debts would've been the same as last year.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "And Steve, do you know what it was for the year, the nine months number?", "Stephen Sterrett", "The bad debt is 80 basis points.", "Operator", "If there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Sorry, operator, jumped on you there.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that today's call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, February 4, 2011. During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G. ", "Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section under Financial Information, Quarterly Supplemental Packages. Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay, thanks. Good morning, everybody. We'll go through some highlights and then open it up for Q&A. First of all, FFO as adjusted without the impact of our non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter increased 8.4% from the fourth quarter one year ago, which was $1.66 to $1.80 per share. We reported FFO of $1.78 per diluted share for the quarter, which exceeded the first call consensus estimate by $0.04, and I'm pleased with this performance, which was accomplished despite the following fourth quarter items. ", "We recognized transaction expenses of $6.4 million or $0.02 per share. We recorded an impairment charge of $8.2 million or $0.02 per share for an investment and a development project in Italy that opened in November of '07. And Opry Mills remains closed after the flood in 2010. The negative impact to FFO for the quarter from Opry Mills was approximately $6.4 million or $0.02 per share and this loss will continue for the balance of 2011 for a loss of approximately $0.05 for the total of the year until we rebuild the center. ", "FFO, as adjusted for the year, was $6.03 per share as compared to $6.01 in 2009. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.80 per share, which was 33% higher than the dividend at this time last year. ", "I'll talk about NOI now. Malls and Premium together which contribute approximately 90% of our domestic NOI, comparable sales, and I should say that these statistics do not include Prime Outlets to give you a sense of comparability. Comparable sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $494 per square foot, up 9.3% as it compared to $452 per square foot at '09 year end. Occupancy at year-end 12/31/10 was 94.2%, which sequentially was 60 basis points higher than 9/30 and 80 basis points higher than a year ago. At year end, the releasing spread for 12 months was a positive $1.15 per square foot. We continue to see gradual improvement in deal flow and in the pricing of our space. ", "On a same-space basis, our 2010 releasing spread was a positive $2.71 per square foot. Comparable property net operating income growth was 3.4% for the quarter, 2.9% for the year. And recall last year, we had a positive roughly 1% growth. So we had growth on top of comparable NOI growth. Drivers of the increase in the NOI for the fourth quarter were higher occupancy and higher sales. Our operating profit margin is 150 basis points improvement to 70.6%, which we continue to believe is the top of the industry. ", "Just want to give you a quick update on Prime. We closed on August 30. Operations in back-office functions have been successfully integrated. The rebranding of the centers to Prime Outlet's name is complete, and the portfolio has continued to perform better than we expected. ", "Occupancy for the properties was 95.4% at year end versus 94.7% at 9/30. Sales were $423 per square foot at 12/31 versus $406 per square foot at 9/30. Capital markets, quickly, we closed in the fourth quarter four new mortgages totaling $662 million at a weighted average rate of 4.47% and a weighted average term of 9 1/2 years. ", "December 31, we had approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand including our share of joint venture cash. Our availability on our corporate credit facility was $3 billion for a total liquidity position of approximately $4.1 billion. We successfully and profitably deployed $3.2 billion of cash in 2010 to grow our business through acquisitions, redevelopment and new development, and strengthen our balance sheet by deleveraging and lengthening maturities.", "Development, quickly, again, we completed expansions at South Shore Plaza, the domain Houston Premium Outlets. And Toki Premium Outlets started construction on new Premium Outlets in Merrimack, New Hampshire, South Korea and Malaysia, and opened two shopping centers in Italy. In addition, we completed more than 35 anchor/big-box replacements, all in 2010. And we have been very successful on our efforts to re-tenant department store and big-box spaces and have 30 new approved anchor or big-box stores with openings scheduled in 2011 and 2012. Construction has or will commence in 2011 on six significant redevelopment projects, including Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis; Las Vegas Premium Outlets, South Pheasant Lane Mall, Southdale Center, Southridge Mall and the University Mall in Pensacola. ", "We have also reinstated our modernization program and have projects planned at up to 18 malls over the next two years. During 2011, projects will be completed at Coddingtown Mall, Fashion Valley, Great Lakes Mall, Orland Square and Plaza Carolina. ", "Our 2011 budgeted capital spend on new development, redevelopment and modernization projects in the U.S. and abroad is approximately $500 million. Details on cost returns and timing of the projects, of course, are provided thoroughly in our 8-K reporting package. ", "Guidance. Let me just talk about that for a second. We provided 2011 FFO guidance of $6.45 to $6.60 per share. At the midpoint of the range, this would represent growth of approximately $0.50 per share or over $175 million of additional FFO in 2011 as compared to 2010 FFO as adjusted. I know we are characterized as being conservative from time to time, but to put that number in perspective, well over half of the public REITs in the U.S. generate less than $175 million of FFO on an annual basis. So one year of growth, and we are beating that number. ", "So I'd also like to point out we expect 2011 to result in an all-time high for SPG in terms of its earnings. And given all the capital raising and balance sheet activity that was completed in our industry over the last couple years, I believe that we are one of the few REITs that can make that statement. ", "Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to just add a few concluding comments and just give you the following thoughts. First of all, some of you have mentioned concern about our ability to continue to grow in light of our current size and certain transactional outcomes. Let me emphasize, we are not concerned. No one in our industry has done a better job of growing their business than we have through good and bad economic cycles. And I don't expect that to change. We are aggressive in our pursuit of opportunities to profitably grow our business. Our financial strength affords us the luxury of pursuing transactions that most of our competitors cannot even contemplate. ", "And we will continue to pursue opportunities that could enhance our franchise. We've also demonstrated discipline. When the opportunity ceases to make sense for us, we can and will walk away. We have been excellent stewards of shareholders' capital, having successfully completed $28 billion of acquisitions since our IPO in 1993. And during that period of time, we've delivered, on average, an 18.4% return to our shareholders. In addition, let us not forget that we did close on a $2.3 billion acquisition of an Outlet portfolio just five months ago, the largest real estate transaction completed in 2009 and '10. ", "Speaking of the Outlet business, there's been some market chatter that we should spin this business off or somehow break up the company. And let me just give you these following thoughts. The multiple platforms of our business are very synergistic, as they enhance tenant relationships, result in cross-fertilization of tenants and lead to the best use of development land among other things. I think this is best illustrated by sharing some numbers from our Outlet business pre and post the Chelsea transaction acquisition. ", "In 2004, as we will recall, as a stand-alone public company, Chelsea was very well regarded by the Street and considered a best-in-class performer. In the five years prior to our acquisition, Chelsea delivered an average comp NOI growth of 5% per year, average growth in base rent of 2% per year and positive releasing spreads of 13% per year. All of this was done with a corporate overhead spend of approximately over $50 million. We have now owned the portfolio for six years. And during that period of time, comp NOI growth has accelerated to 7 1/2% annually. Average base rent growth has grown 8% annually, and releasing spreads have averaged a positive 32% annually. ", "We've developed 11 new Premium Outlets in the U.S. and abroad and expanded several more. We have introduced many new retailers to the outlet sector. We have increased sales at the center by enhancing the actual product, physical product and the tenant mix. Gross EBITDA of the portfolio has grown a factor of 2.7x since the acquisition, frankly, a remarkable feat in the real estate industry. And our Outlet business overhead, about half of what it was six years ago. The value creation from Chelsea acquisition speaks for itself. And this is attributable to the management expertise we brought to the business, as well as the resultant synergies in income and cost savings that we brought to the platform. ", "And let us not forget that our regional malls delivered sector-leading NOI growth during this period of time. With the addition of Prime, we expect our Outlet business to continue to grow and be synergistic with our other platforms. As we have said in the past, we consider ourselves a retail real estate company and not just a mall company. We have articulated a well-developed and thoughtful strategy 17 years ago, when we went public, to own highly productive, high quality assets all along the retail real estate spectrum. We have stayed true to that strategy, and it's continued to serve us and it will continue to serve us well. ", "And finally, I'd just like to say we are more than happy to stack our record up as a public company against anyone, and we're very excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond. And with that said, we'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "It's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, I want to go on just on those comments about being a retail real estate company. I can remember back to that initial merger call that you had on the Chelsea deal, and I think you billed yourself at that point that was the first time, of saying, we're a retail real estate company. And I think it came up on that call of how do you view the Shopping Center business, which you have a few billion dollars in the company today. But how do you sort of see that fitting in with more limited opportunities on the Mall side, at least domestically, and already fully consolidated in the Outlet business, how does that next leg either grow or contract within the overall scheme?", "David Simon", "Well, interesting question in that -- it has not been a growth business for us. But there is benefits to being in that business, because there's still a significant amount of cross-fertilization with the retail community. So in that sense, it's important to have a leg in that business. Additionally, the vast majority of those centers are in right near malls, adjacent to the malls that we own and/or in markets that we have a strong presence in, like Orlando or Austin or down on the border of Texas. So we still consider it to be synergistic. We've never been that excited about growing it through acquisition. I don't think that's going to change other than there maybe a couple here and there, because of our -- the regional fit with a center might make sense. And we also view ultimately it does provide us some optionality if we ever wanted to grow that business beyond what it is today. Rick, I think you can add anything, if you'd like?", "Richard Sokolov", "The only thing that I would add is that we have certainly been opportunistic in that business and built a number of shopping centers that were incorporated into other projects we've done. And that's another important reason to keep that expertise within our platform, so we can take advantage of whatever development opportunities present themselves.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And I think David, the comments about the spinning off the Outlet business. I think when people look at your multiple and your multiple is below that of shopping centers and the lone outlet company that's there, and you're trading in line with the regional mall peers, there seems to be a sum-of-the-parts value that was not being captured in your valuation?", "David Simon", "Well, look, all we can do is continue to do what we do. I think if anybody should be given the benefit of the doubt, it's us. I mean, the numbers that we were able to produce with the Outlet business as part of our franchise are unprecedented in real estate. And what can I tell you, we'll continue to do what we do. But I don't see that business stand alone being able to produce the results that it can as part of our company.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Just one last thing on Capital Shopping Centres; after the vote, I think CEO David Fischel was quoted in the press as saying he was glad that the distraction is over, referring to Simon. So I guess even though he got a better deal for his shareholders, it didn't matter. As you, as a shareholder now or still, can you just comment about what you're going to do with your stake?", "David Simon", "One of my friends in the industry sent me a bunny -- have you ever seen these bunny movies? They're basically done by a little animated bunnies, but they take a movie and do it in 30 seconds. So I wrote some notes about CSC that I thought I would just share, because it was the lot of press, and with the takeover panel rules, you can't really talk to the press and the analytic community about it. So if I could, I'd like to just address it in totality. And this will be, hopefully, I can do it in 30 seconds. But you can go on YouTube and do Bunny movies and pick your favorite movie and you could probably watch it in 30 seconds. In any event, and that's not paid advertising, by the way. I have no idea who does Bunny movies. But let me give you my 30-second summary of CSC. First of all, we've been a supportive passive shareholder for three years, despite their underperformance. We always considered our stake as an option, if and when they decided to sell. The Trafford sale, we thought, had two problems, price and structure, in terms of issuing shares at a discount, which handed control to Whittaker. We asked them to restructure the deal. They wouldn't, despite the market's poor reaction to the deal. Based on our view that they were handing control to Whittaker, we decided to make an indicative offer that was subject to due diligence. We would have never bought the company without due diligence. Management refused to provide due diligence regardless of whatever take-out price we would have come up with, which reinforced our view that they were completely entrenched. They responded with a restructure of the Trafford deal, which we forced, put out a ridiculous, indicative value range, further demonstrating management's focus on entrenchment. The CEO and the press said that we were a nuisance, even though our presence forced a better deal with Trafford and benefited their shareholders. The Chairman said that the shareholders are one of many things they consider as fiduciaries, but not at the top of the list. We never made a firm bid. The company relied on South Africa's shareholder base, which has many different agendas, given they're wanting exposure outside of South Africa. And we're looking forward to them reaching their indicative value of 625p. It sounded like more than 30 seconds. But in a nutshell, that's our view of CSC.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "So you sold your share or you kept your share?", "David Simon", "We continue to own our shares, at this point.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just in terms of occupancy cost ratios, obviously, some of your peers have had a big focus on where their occupancy cost ratio is and how much upside or otherwise is in their portfolios. So can you give us, and breakout the Mall and the Outlet occupancy cost ratios for the year-end December 2010?", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "We have them, but we don't break out those statistics. And Rick is pointing to me the number for the combined portfolio is 12.9% at year-end 2010. And year-end '09, it was 14.1%.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "On the guidance, I mean, can you give any more kind of details because I'm thinking about kind of where you might think same store NOI or lease spreads and occupancy evolving over the course of the year?", "David Simon", "Well, I think it's our nature to, obviously, the Milton Cooper view of the world is certainly our view. I would say that. Second, the comp NOI growth that we are looking toward this year is comparable to what we had in '10. We do have this $0.05 problem with Opry Mills. So it's not a huge thing. It's a temporary thing. We do expect to rebuild that center and get it, not for '11 though, we hope to get it done by early '12. Look, in '10, we had some benefits of bad debt expense and so on. But I think we're looking for a similar number.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Because on the lease spreads, if I look at your, I guess, with Mall and kind of Chelsea expiring ramps at $33 this year versus what looked like kind of $38.50 last year. Is there anything that, or not -- is there any reason I shouldn't believe that your spreads are going to go up? Or is there some non-comparability of kind of the type of space that is expiring in '11 versus '10?", "David Simon", "No, I think we're moving in trajectory for '11, I think, in the right direction above spreads. So I don't think there's anything unusual there.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Paul, this is Steve. I just have a couple of comments. David mentioned bad debt. We had literally no bad debt experience or bad debt expense in '10 for a company with $4 billion of consolidated revenue. I wouldn't expect that to recur in '11. I also think we have, David had mentioned in the call text, we improved our margin 150 basis points this year on top of an improvement last year. Some of that was done at the operating expense line for sure. And I don't think that level of savings at the operating expense line is going to recur in '11. And then the last thing I\u2019d mention, while it's not part of the comp NOI, if you look at the other income schedule in the 8-K, we had a lot of lease settlement income in 2010. And we're just not planning for that to recur in '11. We're looking at a more historical level.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "My other question is just maybe for Rick. As you're talking to retailers about 2011, I mean, how often and to what extent is their concerns about margin compression coming up in rent negotiations? I mean, do you see this being -- how much of a headwind do you see this being, as that starts to bite later in the year?", "Richard Sokolov", "The rent negotiations with retailers haven't changed in 30 years. They're going to seize upon whatever facts are currently out there to argue for lower rent, and we're going to seize on whatever facts we can to argue for higher rents. And right now, we're still seeing firming demand. There is very little new development to the extent that the retailers are looking to grow, and an increasing number of them are. Given their cash flow generation and the profits, we're going to hopefully have an ability to increase our rents as our occupancy moves up. But that is certainly something they are focused on and, legitimately so, it\u2019s out there.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "So you think it's just kind of too early to get a feel for how it might play out.", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, I believe that they're going to have to deal with that on their cost of goods sold side of their margin, and we're going to be looking to increase our rents in line with how our sales have gone up.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "I'm on the line with Ross [Nussbaum] as well. We've seen a few more department store closings and floor plate reductions in the last six months or so. And then with the changes at JCPenney and Dillard's, you have investors speculating about monetization of real estate in the department store space again. What would you say your appetite is for getting space back today, just sort of generally speaking? I know every situation is different. And can you provide sort of your general thoughts about department store consolidation and expansion over the next few years?", "Richard Sokolov", "Let me unpack it. One, as David mentioned in his comments, the demand for our anchor and big-box spaces is accelerating. If you look in our 8-K, we've listed all that we've added. We had a very robust program in '10. We've shown you in the 8-K those that are currently totally nailed down for '11. We have almost double that amount in the pipeline. And when we\u2019re -- if we get spaces back, we're going to be in a position to bring in a number of retailers, and we've demonstrated a pretty broad array, including Bed Bath, Best Buy, Target, Kohl\u2019s, theaters, health clubs. There's a lot of demand for space. Again, there's not a lot of new development. I don't know that I would agree with your categorization of growing department store closures, because if you look at the announcements, Macy's, on their entire fleet, I think, announced three; Penney announced six, and these are minimal closures and very much reduced from the percentages of store fleet that we were looking at several years ago. So we really don't see that coming down the pike. And the last thing I would tell you is historically, we have done a very good job of redeploying the department store space that we've gotten back from companies like Mervyns and the May-Macy's consolidation, Lord & Taylor, Parisian and we make them better.", "David Simon", "I just would add that I don't think there's any market at all that -- where a self-managed -- I have no inside knowledge of this, obviously, but I don't think there's any market at all about a self-managed, one-tenant REIT that's going to go access the public markets. I don't see that happening.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "And then, just Rick, following up in your comments with regard to the $500 million of spending that you're projecting in 2011 on development and redevelopment expansions, what kind of returns are you underwriting?", "Richard Sokolov", "We're hoping that we're going to get in the low double-digit, high-single digit over all that.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "David, when you think about external growth opportunities, how much more closer are you going to be looking at the JVs within your existing portfolio and buying out potential partners? That would seem like a easy potential avenue of growth for you.", "David Simon", "It can and has been historically. And it's a function of price and value, and we did some of that last year. Ross, as you know, Houston and, unfortunately, Opry, it's a little unlucky with Opry. And the Great Mall of Bay Area, which is a very good asset. So I do think there's opportunities there with time and it wouldn't surprise me.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Why, if I understood this correctly, why isn't there business interruption insurance at Opry?", "David Simon", "There is, but we're in the middle of a dispute with the insurance company, but we took a conservative approach to it.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And then finally your Italy JV debt is coming due later this year. What's the game plan there?", "David Simon", "Well, we've got enough equity value in coverages; we'll likely just simply refinance it.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "David or Rick, could you touch on the leasing spreads again? I know you've seen the rebound in tenant sales. But do we need to see the retailers expanding again to really drive the spreads? Or can you comment a bit on it? Do you think it's sales alone that can drive higher rents?", "David Simon", "It should, ultimately. I think, again, it gets to a little bit of the property type where the demand is. But certainly, sales moving in the right direction help; the demand at the better properties is, obviously, fueling that. And hopefully, with the economic stability that seems to be in the system, I think the more moderate centers will have the ability to flatten the rent. And when we did, there's no question we had a handful of centers that actually had negative rollovers due to the economic scenario. And we're starting to see a little bit more stability in that lower group of centers. And that will be important because that does have some impact on our spreads.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And then you mentioned, obviously, the firming economy, but if you think about external growth, do you rethink U.S. strategy versus looking internationally?", "David Simon", "Well, I think we've got a lot to do in the U.S. this year. We're very excited about all that's going on with the properties in terms of redeveloping them, transforming a number of them. We are really busting hump on that effort. So I'm very pleased with that effort, and we're making tremendous inroads. I mean, a couple that, frankly, a year ago, I didn't think we had a shot at doing, we're going to start this year. A couple of them are The Mills malls, which includes Southdale and Southridge. So I think the effort is, really, I've been really happy that we're really humping on that front. So we've got plenty of to do there. And Jay, and the bottom line is we'll always look both domestically and internationally. Externally, we don't need to do anything to do a deal for a deal's sake. There's no one that's done more deals than us. Yes, we haven't always gotten the deal, but sometimes we didn't get it because we didn't want to pay more, and sometimes, we didn't get it because we were dealing with entrenched team, and we didn't think it was worth a scorched-earth tactic to try and get it. We felt, well, fine, if that's what you want, we'll move on. There's nothing that can keep us from growing. We don't have to do deals. We've got plenty of properties here to make better, and we're very focused on doing that.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And then just in terms of dispositions, I know it was asked earlier about shopping centers, but as you think about some of your B malls, do you see pricing as attractive and, I guess, given the capital that's out there today?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't think it's come yet, but it seems to be maybe around the corner that some of those assets, some of that market might be there. So I think '11 will be a developing year in that area. I think, like many of our peer, I'm sure there's going to be a focus on narrowing the focus a little bit by culling the property portfolio. We'll participate in that, but we want to see a little bit more firming of values in that category. And not yet, but it seems to be headed in that direction.", "Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs", "And just finally, on The Gap, I know there's a new executive. Do you see any shift in strategy? And, I guess, what sort of conversations have you had thus far?", "Richard Sokolov", "We have constantly monitored their performance for a very long period of time. They have been a net loser of square footage in closing underperforming stores. It's obviously a big relationship, one that we are incredibly focused on, at David and my level, and spend a great deal of time on it. We obviously hope for them to be as productive and as good a retailer as they can be, because that only helps our properties.", "David Simon", "And look, all I can tell you is that their outlet business has been extremely strong. So with the new executive running The Gap, I think that's obviously a positive, at least based on what we've seen out of the Outlet business.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "In your supplemental, it mentioned that two centers are being de-malled, could you describe those efforts?", "David Simon", "Sure, one is University Mall in Pensacola. We're basically going to create a box environment with Sears and Penney as our lead anchors, continuing to be our lead anchors there. The other one is in Nanuet, where again, we will be de-malling that and bringing in more the -- kind of the higher-end retailers. Still, we'll be anchored by Macy's and Sears. We would hope to bring a high-end food provider, a supermarket, essentially, and some of the better specialty tenants.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And do you have a sense of what the returns might be on that de-malling process?", "David Simon", "They'll both be double-digits. I mean, both of these are basically producing negative or de minimis cash flow right now. So if we look at the incremental investment based upon and the return now, I think they'll both be double digits.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then I had a question, if you had any feedback from your Blackberry and iPhone apps for the malls and where you might be going with that program?", "Stephen Sterrett", "The feedback has been encouraging. Obviously, they're relatively new. But that certainly is a very significant focus and highlights one of the remarks David made in his initial comment. We are a uniquely positioned to be able to dedicate both the human and the financial resources to be sector-leading in this. But I think we have done so historically and we are committed to do so in the future. It\u2019s a highly important component of how we manage, market and maintain our properties, and we're going to be devoting increasing time and money to introducing even more programs in that regard.", "David Simon", "And I would just say the people that do follow us on the social media side are our best customers. They really like the fact that we're able to talk to them about promotions and offerings from the retailers, and it's really influencing some behavior. So this whole area, basically, our vision here, just like we had the vision of being a retail real estate company, our envision with the mall, is to really turn it into a smart box. One where technology can enhance the shopping experience, create more efficiency out of it. And I think we're just on the cusp of that. We're working with a number of retailers that see the same vision that we do, obviously, trying to put all of the retailers on the same platform. If you think about the mall, in a sense, what makes the mall great; it's all the retailers together in one platform. In that case, it's the physical. We really want to move the mall environment, from a technology point of view, on that same platform, as customers interface with what's going on in the mall. And it's going to take time, but I think if we can show that value to the retailer, then by creating that platform, it's going to enhance the shopping experience for the consumer. And that's what we're after, for sure.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Yes, I guess I was also interested, because I read that 6x the amount of Internet sales were purchases that were influenced by the Internet, but still done at bricks and mortar.", "David Simon", "There's an undeniable link, I think the movement toward from your desktop to mobile is a great opportunity for the physical-based environment to take that mobile and enhance when they're walking the physical or adjacent or near the physical environment. So the fact that they've gone mobile and move toward mobile, if we can bridge that to the physical world, I think it's got a lot of benefits for us. As an industry, it's not just us, but we're going to be pushing it hard.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Just circling back to capital for a minute. Just to help us, sort of domestic folks here, can you give us a sense of what the British and the South African shareholders were saying? Were they more, like as you would talk to them, were they more NAV-focused or the equivalent rent that mark-to-market focus? Or was it more a sense of if we sell this, we're not sure where were going to reinvest the proceeds, and therefore, we'd rather just hang on to capital rather than having to deal with trying reinvesting? What were the big pieces?", "David Simon", "Well, I think you got to really -- the U.K. shareholders were very similar to what that I would say the U.S. shareholders look to. So there wasn't a great difference there. And we, again, I mean, our feedback from the U.K. shareholders was they were disappointed that the company wouldn't give us due diligence to decide whether or not we wanted to make a firm offer. And I think the U.K. shareholders have a very similar mindset to the U.S. shareholders. And they viewed the Trafford deal, in many respects, as a change of control, and they wanted to look at their financial options. The South African shareholders essentially started that way, but they were also highly influenced that there is a exemption that they get by owning Capital Shopping Centres. It's exempted from the limitation that they have in terms of being able to make investments outside of South Africa. So there was some of that. On the other hand, some were more clinical. Their mood ebbed and flowed. But clearly, having exposure outside of South Africa was important to a number of them.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And then just moving to the Great White North. If you guys were --", "David Simon", "You mean Indianapolis?", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Exactly, well, we certainly have our fair share of snow here. As far as Canada, obviously, Kimco entered there a while back, and obviously, there's been another announcement more recently. What do you think the challenges of entering that market? Or why you think we haven't seen more U.S. retail REITs head up there? Is it just the returns? Is it trying to get land? Is it maybe something in the leasing environment that it's a little bit different than here? What are the challenges for up there?", "David Simon", "Look, I think, frankly, a number of retail REITs were just focused, the last couple of years have not been easy, right? So I think it's more of that. I think the Canadian market certainly has developed more. It's more of an interest to our U.S. -based retailers than it's used to be, but it's not huge. I mean, it's not pervasive. It's not every U.S. retailer\u2019s up there, but it's growing and growing. And so I think it's just other priorities, Alex, primarily. I think demand has improved. And then ultimately, I would just say, just from our perspective, because we reviewed the market for on and off for a number of years, finding the right site at the right value is not overly easy. And you want to start, if you're going to do it, you want to start in Toronto, essentially, would be the best place to start. It's just not a lot of great sites at appropriate values to justify it. But it's, long term, I think it's a good market for potentially future retail development, including outlets.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "So as far as returns though, would you underwrite Canada to be the, is it the same returns as U.S. ? Is it lower returns? Is it higher returns that you would want to see?", "David Simon", "I think land value there will be more expensive than land value here in the cities that you would want to build outlets in, and rents may be able to offset that. So you may end up with similar returns.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research Equities", "So I just had a couple of questions regarding your leasing strategy. So in light of pending sales per square foot increasing towards 500 and in conjunction, had low occupancy costs, can you give us a sense of how quickly can the occupancy cost go back to historical levels? And when you're sitting down with a tenant and during leasing negotiations, do you typically sign or have in the mindset to sign a rent that is like 15% occupancy costs? Or do you actually embed any future growth in tenant sales?", "Richard Sokolov", "Let me just answer the first question. Obviously, we would very much hope that they are going to continue to move up, but we have a very nice problem in that our sales are growing at 9.4% a year. Don't forget, we only roll a certain percentage of space every year. So it takes some time to make up that ground when you have good sales growth. In terms of our negotiation. Every negotiation we have is driven by what's the quality of the mall? What's the type of tenant use? And what is the quality of the space within that mall? And those three things drive how we price our space, and we are constantly trying to get the appropriate market rent. When tenants complain to us that our rents are too high, we point out that we don't set the market, the tenants do. And if you look at our occupancy, obviously, there are people that still believe they can make a lot of money at the rents we're charging, or we're going to constantly keep pushing that rent. And the other point I want to make because David emphasized it, all the capital we're spending in our portfolio, renovating properties, modernizing them, adding anchors, adding department stores, expanding them, are only making our properties more valuable to the retailer, because they're increasing the total sales we have and the productivity of all the other tenants. So not only do we get the returns that David talked about, but we get the incremental benefit of having a much better shopping environment going forward, as we go to re-lease space rolling over there.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "And if I can follow up still, in your same store leasing stats, you mentioned that the uptick in leasing rent per square foot is $2.71 in the same space. What is that in a percentage term? And last question, is your guidance for 2011 lowered by the impairment charges you\u2019re -- that you expect in Opry?", "David Simon", "It is lowered. It's not impairment. It\u2019s basically we\u2019re -- it's really we're incurring interest expense with no income. So we have no cash flow right now at Opry Mills. So it's not an impairment charge. It's actually a negative cash flow drain until we rebuild it. I'm not sure how much of the same -- what percent of our leasing spread or leasing data is just same space. Is that what you're asking?", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that the leasing spreads on the positive, it was positive $2.71 or so. It's all for the same space. I was just wondering what that means in a percentage term.", "David Simon", "Same space is actually literally this space. A lot happens in malls, where you, our spreads, as we traditionally have done, it is just ending versus new in totality. We try to narrow it down. I don't know if we have the exact percent of what same space is, but we certainly can get that to you, as I don't have that in front of me.", "Alexander Goldfarb - UBS", "Can you disclose what the tenant sales per square foot was in the quarter, not in 2010? Not the average for the year, but for the quarter.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Quarter-over-quarter, the sequential growth in the fourth quarter; it was 9%.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "$500,000,000 of redevelopment is a pretty small beer on a company with a $60 billion gross asset base. Any comment there as to where you're going in the next few years?", "David Simon", "Well, that's what makes us unique, is we still care about $500,000,000. Look, again, remember just take it a step back, having lived through '08, '09 and a good chunk of '10. We just have geared up on this. And so to create the deals that we're actually going to be able to spend that money, when it takes some time to get that going, is not a small feat. And as Rick said, it is going to produce incremental NOI growth. It's not insignificant. So in the scheme of things, it may not seem like a big percent of our total asset base, but it is extremely cash flow positive, plus all the other residual benefits of making a property better in the long run is very, very important. And I would hope that with time, we could crank this up. But it's a very, very good, solid start to having essentially just rejuvenated this program in kind of mid to -- really in the early spring of '10. So it's a good start. What the number is, I think it's going to be up to how creative we'll be. And I can't pinpoint it, other than we've got a lot on the drawing board that we're hopeful about, and I think we'll just see where it takes us.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Is it typically a sort of 12-month lead in for this sort of stuff?", "David Simon", "It does, especially if you're trying to secure anchor involvement in it. And entitlements are not, they're not easy to get, even in today's environment.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I've got a question for Rick. I looked at the TIs, Rick, in the 8-K and compared them to where they were for the 12 months ending December '09. It looked like there was a pretty sharp increase. Is there something going on in terms of the leasing or where we\u2019re at today? It's had a fairly good run rate.", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, we, frankly, the most important happy fact is that we've leased dramatically more square footage. And as we are doing more and more deals, we're spending a little more and more allowance. But when you look at that number, it is, on a per-square-foot basis, pretty consistent.", "Stephen Sterrett", "This is Steve. The only thing I'd say that might tweak that a little bit, and Rick and David both alluded to it earlier, we're doing a ton of box activity, where over the last couple years, there had not been as much. So that may influence it some, as well. But I think Rick's right. If you just think about the ordinary regular seven- to 10-year lease, the economics of that in terms of what the tenant allowance is hasn't really changed.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "And the boxes, Steve, is it higher or lower?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It's probably lower on a per-square-foot basis. But dollar amounts, because they're bigger spaces, it's more money.", "David Simon", "And if you look, I think Steve's 100% on. If you look at probably '09 box activities and '10, you'll see the dramatic uptick.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "One final question for you, Steve. A nice bond trade in '10, any chances of replicating that, as we look in to '11 and the refinancing market?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, I think, David, I would say this, I hope so. But if you recall, by virtue of the two tenders that we did in '10, we significantly cleaned out our bond maturities in '11 and '12. And in fact, we've got under $400 million a year coming in each of those two years. So we can be very opportunistic. We certainly are looking at the market. We're paying attention to it. But the activity that we'll do in the bond market in 2011, if any, will be opportunistic.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Run a slide rule over converts at all?", "David Simon", "I don\u2019t see it right now.", "Stephen Sterrett", "I confess it may be the single largest file I have in my office, because of all the banking brethren sending us proposals, but I don't see it right now.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "I was just curious, why did other income fall year-over-year?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, you had a couple of things. You're talking about it looking at '10 as opposed to '09? And are you looking at '09 to '10, are you looking it on a full-year basis?", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "Quarterly on the income statement.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Quarterly on the income statement, it was lease termination income in the fourth quarter of '09.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "And then what retailers are wanting more space at this point?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, the ones that are particularly active now are like Love Culture, Gymboree is rolling out, Crazy 8, ENCORE Shoes, Pandora. We're doing a lot of business with Sperry and Stride Rite that are divisions of Collective Brands, rue21 and Forever 21 remain very active. And happily, we're also spending a lot of time with the restaurants. So we've got a number of California Pizza Kitchens opening in the portfolio and Red Robins. And we've also been active with Ann Taylor Loft. So there's a very good core group of retailers that are still looking to aggressively grow.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Nathan Isbee with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee", "Just going back to Prime. You had a full quarter under your belt here. Can you just talk about how much NOI growth potential you see out of the portfolio, both in '11 and maybe over the next few years?", "David Simon", "Well, I can tell you that what we -- we're going to exceed our underwriting.", "Nathan Isbee", "And what was that?", "David Simon", "These are tough questions.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, Nate, we told you it was a, going in, eight cap.", "David Simon", "We're going to exceed our underwriting, and I think the re-merchandising success that we\u2019ve had with our other outlets will take some time. But we would hope to get it on with our other outlets. So we see that opportunity for sure.", "Nathan Isbee", "Steve, I mean, you're looking at 5%, 7%, 10% growth in '11 from that?", "David Simon", "Well, certainly from our underwriting, we're above 5% and probably close to your other number.", "Nathan Isbee", "And then just looking back to the recent holiday season, a lot of talk was about the strength coming out of the luxury in the higher-end retailers? Can you talk about how that's playing out in your portfolio?", "Richard Sokolov", "We've seen the same trends. Obviously, some of that was just a function of rebounding off of depressed levels in '09. But clearly, I just saw Est\u00e9e Lauder reported yesterday, and their better brands had better performance than their more moderate brands. And I think you can see that across the landscape that the better consumer has come back stronger, and we're seeing that as well in our properties. The other thing that's really been very apparent in our properties is that the centers that benefit from tourism are being incrementally benefited with above-portfolio sales growth, because the tourist is back substantially. And that obviously is also helping.", "Nathan Isbee", "And then just quickly, when you talked about Canada, having reviewed it, I'm sure you've been focusing on it for a while, how many centers do you see the country being able to support in terms of the quality of a Chelsea type of center?", "David Simon", "On the outlet side?", "Nathan Isbee", "Yes.", "David Simon", "It's hard to stay. I think the Vaughan Mills has been successful, so I do there, as an example. Obviously, I think getting one or two built in kind of the major markets. They\u2019re not many, but they're there. That's got an option. I mean, It's hard to say, but certainly, more than a few. And it really -- a lot of that just depends on how the early couple go, and whether they produce the results that they do. Now the fact is, the Canadians with the strong dollar love to come to the U.S. to shop. And I do think that's still is an opportunity for them that may limit some of the potential growth, just because they do have that advantage vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Cowen Group.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "I have two questions for you. First of all, on the same store NOI outlook. When we looked back at the prior cycle, and I'm talking about a cyclical rebound in the economy post 2002, and it was pre- the premium acquisition and the converging all the reporting data, but when we looked at the mall sector on a multiyear basis, '02 to '07, same store NOI growth averaged about 5% and sales productivity was fairly comparable over that period of time, the sales productivity growth. I know there was a significant contribution from the growth of specialty leasing, the RMU phenomenon. But looking at where you are now, historically, if we think about the cyclical rebound in the economy and retail sales, is there any secular reason why the growth rate would not match that kind of level going forward?", "David Simon", "Well, I think the answer to that is yes, and it's primarily because the shock to the system this time around has been dramatic, and it's impacted the consumer, probably, psyche more than the last downturn. And I think it's just going to take, it's going to be a very gradual ramp-up. And the employment side is probably more tenuous here, though the better income side, the difference here though, the better income participant in the economy is more employed than maybe the last time around. But I just think the shock to the system\u2019s a little bit, there's more uncertainty coming out of it, clearly, than there was last time. So I would be a little more cautious. I don't think there's anything fundamental in the supply-and-demand scenario or anything else out there that could keep that from happening, but I just think the size of the economic dislocation here has been so great. And there's still a lot of uncertainty. You've got state budget issues, you got the municipal markets, you still got unemployment, you got inflation may or may not be here. So there's just a lot of noise here that I think may keep the recovery more muted than it might otherwise be.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And the second question really revolves around a lot of the commentary about department stores and underutilization of department store pads. You addressed the one solution to that, which is the spin-off leaseback alternative. Other people have talked about monetizing the square footage by converting the use to something else. Now the question I have, and it really is, I guess this is partly a legal question, but with the presence of operating covenants and reciprocal easements, doesn't that mean that any monetization of those pads that involves a conversion of use has to go through you guys?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Have you had any discussions with any of the department stores on some of those underutilized, underproductive spaces?", "Richard Sokolov", "The company that has been making certain efforts in that regard has been Sears, where they've done a couple of areas where they've been able to do a partial use in part of their space. But again, as David alluded to earlier, the single best, most profitable use for these boxes is as a performing department store in a chain. If you put the multiple of EBITDA on stock price, it usually dwarfs the real estate value of that box for any other use. And I think that's why you've seen historically over time relatively few closures, and why you see stores working now that the environment is more stable, working to find new opportunities to build stores. And we are going to, hopefully, have a number of announcements over the next six months of department stores being added to our properties, because they're looking to grow. And that's a very productive way to growth their top line and their bottom line.", "David Simon", "And I would just say, Jim, the biggest discussion we have with them is what price we're willing to buy it and what price they want to sell it. They don't want to be -- very few of the, certainly, the department stores want, ultimately, be in the development business. And that's where most of their boxes, if they're connected to a mall, they end up being in the development business. And that's not a core competency. And in many of those, most of those cases, they're selling it to us or some other developer. And the landscape, frankly, is littered with some bad deals where they sold and the developers tried to buy it at certain prices, and they didn't get the right value. We have not had that experience. We've actually been pretty good at what we bought and being able to recapitalize on it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "David, I have a question on the domestic outlook strategy. Clearly, the space is getting a bit crowded. And it's kind of interesting to see what's happening in the Houston submarket with you, Tanger and even maybe Taubman competing to get an outlet center built there. And since we could see this happen going forward, can you talk about how retailers evaluate the different opportunities that they have? Is it based on rents and location only? Or is there anything else that might differentiate your site from, say, Tanger's?", "David Simon", "I don't want to speak for the retailers. But let's assume, I think they, I'll say it very generically, they tend to go where they think the best site and/or development\u2019s going to take place. And I'll leave it at that.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I mean, is it going to be similar to what we saw with the Lifestyle centers where they tend to move as a group? And once you or Tanger has some of the key tenants, then it's pretty much a done deal on which site basically wins that market? Is that your expectation?", "David Simon", "Yes, I think you'll see some of that, Ben. You'll also -- sometimes, sensitivity plays a role into it. Certainly, in the outlet side with respect to where their full priced stores are located. So it's kind of location development, and they're certainly part of that. When you get the momentum in a deal, the retailers see that, and they tend to go where they think the development's going to get done. But a lot of it\u2019s the site. But I will say this: I don't think you'll see, I think we're all very experienced developers. Houston is a good example with Taubman and Tanger and us, we're all looking in kind of a submarket. I think we're all very competent developers. And my guess is whoever's successful, there's not going to be two of these. There\u2019ll ultimately be one. So I don't see it so much like the Lifestyle group, where you had a bunch built because there was so much money. I think the guys that are in this business understand they may win some and lose some and go on to the next opportunity, as opposed to two going up at the same time. I don't see that happening.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And then at what point do you guys potentially bail on a project? I mean, is a high single-digit return still satisfactory for you guys, like a Galveston project? Or is that too low, given what you've gotten in the past?", "David Simon", "I think it would be too low for us from a development point of view. If we're not in the double digits, we would not build.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Is it fair to say that's lower than like the mid-teens that you used to get just a few years ago?", "David Simon", "Well, it might be lower. We tend to look at most of our new stuff in phases. So the initial phase could be the low double-digits and then, ultimately, if we build phase, we're in the mid-range. I don't think that's changed that much, but there is more competition. So it may have some impact on that. But again, if we felt like we're building below low double-digits, we would not build.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the six major redevelopments you're talking about kicking off this year, what's a rough dollar cost of that?", "David Simon", "Well, I think, altogether, we're in the $500 million range. Those will be, again, a lot of this is going to be spread over '11 and '12. But if you were just to look at -- I don't have those six right in front of me. We can certainly give that to you. But overall when you look at everything, it's around $500 million, our share.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And is that the spend or is that the total expected cost?", "David Simon", "That's just for spend this year. And a couple of those, clearly, will have carryover in '11, but we could get you those exact numbers. And obviously, those will be in our 8-K when they start construction.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Secondly, on guidance, I may have missed it. Did you mention what the occupancy assumption was to get to your same store guidance?", "David Simon", "We did not. We decided to be less granular on our guidance this year than the last several years. You should not be worried about that. That doesn't mean that we don't have, obviously, all the confidence in the world at delivering that guidance, but we just felt like it was more important to look at the totality of it than any one particular statistic. But I think, in generally speaking, occupancy is up marginally in our model.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then last question, I'm sure this isn\u2019t in guidance, but are you expecting to put capital to work in terms of acquisitions this year?", "David Simon", "It's not in our guidance.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Yes, sure, it's not in guidance, but is it the expectation that you're going to be able to find some acquisitions this year?", "David Simon", "You never know. I just would say you never know. I'm sure there will be opportunities, but we'll just see how the year transpires.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Cedric Lachance with Green Street Advisors.", "Cedric Lachance - Green Street", "David, I think about a year ago, you talked about Lifestyle centers that you had looked at, probably, about three dozen, and you couldn't find, at the time, any that were worthy of an investment. With the environment having changed the way it has, do you think that any of those or any Lifestyle centers might turn out to be a decent investment going forward?", "David Simon", "We continue to scour that land, that mine field of broken Lifestyle centers. And frankly, we still are having a hard time finding a couple of crown jewels. It's not to say there might not be one or two, but, Rick, I mean, we just haven't seen it. We just haven't seen it. The demand there to go, you've got, Cedric, most of those are the ones that we look at are all in co-tenancy, all have kick outs, and they all need lease-up, and they're just not performing. And some may be good long-term real estate. But the demand, frankly, for those kind of centers has not, as far as we can see, has really not really picked up. Rick, you. . .", "Richard Sokolov", "I think that's right, the ones we've looked at, frankly, we've been seeing NOIs that are in the offering brochures. So when we underwrite it based on potential decreases of that NOI, because of sales levels and co-tenancy, we're coming up with fractions of the NOI even in the offering book. Now maybe we're conservative, but we've got so much we can do at better returns in our portfolio. It's very difficult to take a reach and try and buy somebody else's problem.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "In regards to 2011 guidance, could you give us a sense of how much in regards to using excess cash to pay down debt is built into those numbers, whether it's any outstanding debt in 2011 or any debt, any payoff early from 2012 or 2013?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Tayo, this is Steve. There really isn't any of that. There, as I said, we have very little bonds coming due, and even our mortgage maturities we\u2019re just essentially assuming that we're going to roll them over.", "Operator", "And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of David Harris of Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Early days yet, but new management at GGP out of bankruptcy. Are you coming across them more as a competitive force in the marketplace? Or is it really just maintenance of the status quo?", "David Simon", "Nothing, really. Nothing that I've seen. Rick, what do you think?", "Richard Sokolov", "Look, they're now actively leasing and they have direction. But candidly, last year and the year before, they were trying to actively lease as well. So we've competed with them for a very long time, and we'll be competing with them going forward. And we intend to, hopefully, continue outperforming them.", "David Simon", "We're happy to help them, too, if they need any help.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Rick, if you look back over the last couple of years, now, obviously, we\u2019re in the new chapter for general growth. Is there any sense that you have that they really did get distracted and lost some competitive status in the marketplace? Or is that something we kind of view from 30,000 feet that we wonder about, operationally, it really didn\u2019t make much of a difference?", "Richard Sokolov", "I couldn't really tell you that. Look, the last couple of years, we were all very focused on a lot of exterior forces. We're just focused on trying to grow our business and really didn't spend a lot of time focusing on that.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Is it in the new concept area that you kind of more act, not only just for general growth, but also with the other big competitors in the space? Is it really on the new leasing side? It's not obviously on renewing existing leases in established centers that you're really going head-to-head with them.", "David Simon", "Well, actually, with general growth, we have very, very little property overlap. And I think we mostly, frankly, compete with our peer group in the eyes of the analysts and investors. The competition at the property level is overblown for any of us. We certainly, I mean, we're all trying to get the fair share of retailers open to buys, but I'd say the biggest competition is frankly in the eyes of investors. Not so much day-to-day warfare at the property level. Sure, there's some malls that we overlapped with, a few of our peer group, but it's mostly at the corporate level, not so much on the retail day-to-day level.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Fenton with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Andrew Fenton - Cliffwood Partners", "I just had a global question for you. It's interesting on Simon calls, it always seems like the questions lead to acquisitions. And two, in your kind of two large-cap global peers, both Unibail and Westfield, actually shrank their balance sheets through two different transactions, and it kind of, in a view to increase their ROE. Have you ever thought of doing something like that?", "David Simon", "Well, I think there was some reference to it about maybe we should spin this off or that off. We actually like what we've built here. We've had better growth. So I think part of the response that you may be seeing is that the growth profile of those companies may be different than ours. We haven't had that issue. And we're also primarily focused in the U.S., whereas certainly Westfield has a couple of different footprints. So we think we're different. We're in a little different boat than those are. I do think, as we've said, we'll certainly look to sell assets over time, if the market gets better, that don't fit our long-term view. But beyond that, we don't see any real change or need to, given our growth profile.", "Andrew Fenton - Cliffwood Partners", "I guess their pitch is you get some assets that eventually get mature, and then you can get a much better return on the stuff that have some remaining redevelopment or potentially, as NOI upside, do you have any part of your portfolio where you feel like Simon\u2019s kind of worked it and the upside isn't as big?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, look, certainly, with the vast portfolio we have, we have a handful of centers like that. And like I said, I think if the market stabilized for those kind of centers from a value point of view, it's conceivable that we could sell more assets than we have. We've actually, over the years, been a very -- we've never been afraid to sell assets. So we've sold a couple of billion dollars, if not more, assets over our period of time. So I think if the market gets better, we'd certainly look to do that. I don't think that, that necessarily needs to take the form of some kind of corporate restructuring. But it's always good to prune your portfolio, if you can.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Simon, CEO, for any closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay, thank you for your interest. Obviously, 2010 was a really good year for the company, and we expect 2011 to be more of the same, and our passion for the business continues.

My name is Kathy, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's call, Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Shelly Doran", "Hello. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC for a detailed discussion.", "Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that our call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, April 29, 2011.", "During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section under Financial Information, Quarterly Supplemental Packages.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay, good morning, everybody. Welcome. We're glad you took time away from watching the royal wedding, and we're pleased to report FFO of $1.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 14.2% over the first quarter of 2010. And in comparing that, that takes into account the loss on extinguishment of debt that we had into the -- in the first quarter of 2010. Our quarterly results exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.07 per share. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $500 per square foot, up 8.2%, as compared to $462 per square foot as of 3/31/2010. Please note that this $500 per square foot is on more than 52 million square feet of GLA. As of 3/31, occupancy was 92.9%, 70 basis points higher than the year-earlier period, and the releasing spread for the rolling 12 months was a positive $5.11 per foot. ", "Beginning in 2011, we changed our reporting of spreads, comparing opening and closing rents on a same space basis. The statistic is now also based on total base rent, which is minimal rent plus the common area maintenance charge, or CAM, and we believe this new methodology will help give investors a better economic picture of certain of our leasing activity. Our releasing spreads always have been and will be under the new methodology will include all in-line space, including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet. So it's all in-line space that that's compared to.", "Comparable property NOI growth was 2.3%. We believe, just to highlight a few things, first of all, the growth in the quarter was virtually 100%. Increase was driven by rents. In addition to just compare the Q, not to get overly worried too much from one quarter to the next, but when you compare Q1 2010 to Q1 2011, I would just keep in mind that in '11, we had the significantly higher snow removal expense in the first quarter of this year, as well as we -- as you recall, last year, we had a -- our credit loss was actually recovery, and this year we actually had bad debt expense. When you put the 2 together and normalize those, our comp NOI growth would be over 100 basis points higher than the 2.3% that was reported.", "Capital markets, we've been busy as always. We closed a lock rate on 9 new mortgages, totaling $962 million. Our share of that was $543 million. The weighted average rate on the loans is 5.3%, and the term -- weighted average term is 9.4 years. During the quarter, we also paid off $282 million of unsecured debt with our cash, and we end the quarter with $937 million of cash on hand, including our share of JV cash, and our credit availability on our facility is $3 billion for a total liquidity position of nearly $4 billion. And as you know, in '11, we expect to generate more than $1 billion of cash after dividends. ", "Development activity. We're pleased with this on a number of fronts. First of all, we opened our second Premium Outlet in South Korea, Paju Premium Outlets, located approximately 50 minutes northwest of downtown Seoul. Early reports have been extremely favorable, and the center is 99% leased at opening. And just to put it in perspective, our Yeoju Premium Outlet in South Korea continues to perform exceedingly well. It is 100% leased and generates sales of $875 per square foot in U.S. dollars. We also completed the expansion renovation of Las Vegas Outlet Center. And in conjunction with that, we rebranded it Las Vegas Premium Outlets South and is located on Las Vegas Strip near McCarran International Airport. We have 2 new developments under construction, both Premium Outlets: Johor in Malaysia, which will open in November of this year; and Merrimack in New Hampshire, which will open in the summer of 2012, but I'm really pushing for the spring of 2012, but that's another story. ", "During the first quarter, we started construction on 9 renovation projects and now have a total of 10 under construction. And in 2011, we've been, obviously, very busy. We plan to open 32 new anchors and big boxes, including Herberger's, Kohls, Carson Pirie Scott, Target, Dick's, Opry and Marshall's and H.H. Gregg, just to name a few, which I did. And we currently have 8 anchor or box deals scheduled to open in 2012. Details on cost, returns and timing for these projects are provided in our supplemental reporting package.", "Now let me turn to Japan for moment. Obviously, we're very concerned about the people and what's happening there. But to give you some perspective, our portfolio is comprised of 8 properties, 4 in the south, 3 in the Tokyo market and one in the north. You will recall that we own a 40% interest in these assets with our well-known and esteemed colleague and partner, Mitsubishi Estates. Sendai, the smallest of our Japanese assets, was damaged by the earthquake and has been closed since the earthquake. Fortunately, repairs are currently underway, and we expect a reopening in mid-June of this year. Costs to repair the center after the payment of our deductible are covered by insurance. Since the earthquake, 3 of our properties outside of Tokyo, Gatemo, Sano and Ami, have been allowed to operate only 8 hours per day due to rationing of electricity. This ended yesterday, and the centers have reverted to their regular 10-hour operating schedule. However, given the environment there, this could be subject to change.", "It is too early to gauge the short-term impact of the earthquake, tsunami and damaged nuclear facilities to our business. Sales of the centers near Tokyo have been below year-ago levels since the quake. As things settle down in Japan, we expect these highly productive, high-quality Premium Outlets to revert back to historical trends. However, we anticipate that softness will continue for the remainder of 2011. Not to be undone by that earthquake, the good news, I will talk a minute about Opry Mills. As you know, we had a historical flood that ravaged Nashville and submerged Opry Mills and flooded it with several feet of water in the mall. The good news is we've reached an agreement with our lenders to finance the restoration of the mall. Opry Mills and its lenders will continue the litigation to have our insurance -- insurers comply with their obligation to pay all the amounts they agreed to in the event of a flood loss. Repairs and rebuilding of the landmark property have begun and is expected to open in the spring of 2012. Most of the previous anchor tenants have committed to be part of the reopening, and many of the previous in-line stores have committed to the restored Opry Mills. In addition, many new tenants have agreed to come to open stores at the property. We expect, on a stabilized basis, to exceed the NOI that was in place prior to the flood.", "Based upon our results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year, today, we increased the low end of our 2011 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share and raised the top end by $0.05. These increases in guidance reflects the improving business conditions we are seeing in the U.S., our ability to execute our game plan. However, it is partially offset by the uncertainty in Japan and the continued closure of Opry Mills. ", "Finally, let me just mention some management additions. We have recognized that we are very focused in maintaining our leadership position and our desire to execute on many fronts. So that we can continue to deliver sector-leading growth, we can and should add to our executive team. So accordingly, we welcome 2 new additions to the ranks of executives: David Contis, Steve Fivel. David will lead our regional mall platform, working with me and Rick and assisted by John Rulli. His first day on the job is next Monday. I'll be out of town, by the way, just to -- so -- Steve Fivel has been here since March, and he's assisting Jim Barkley, our General Counsel, on all the areas he oversees. We've all known David and Steve for many years, and we're very happy to add them to our team to continue our contributions that we expect them to do.", "So summary. We had a very good quarter, another one in our long string of successful quarters, and we're ready for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "A couple of things. First of all, looking at the leasing spreads, they picked up considerably from the year-end mark, up from about 4% to 10%. If we're thinking about that, is that more driven by, say, the fourth quarter of '09, just the dropping out of the mix of low rent openings? Or is it more driven by you had a good second half of year 2010 in terms of sales, good 2011 so far, so really, the opening rent levels are kind of picking up there more?", "David Simon", "I would say it's more of that. It's a 12-month period of time, so it's representative of what's going on. But look, demand is better, we're able to generate better rents. It's still a very difficult process in doing that, but we've got a good group of people and a very good portfolio. And when you put the 2 together, we're able to drive rents.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got it. Okay. Over the last couple of quarters, you put some money to work in terms of mortgage investments. Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that more investments that we should think of as short term, putting capital to work and you're getting a nice return on it and at some point, you get the money back? Or is it more along the lines of there's a shot at getting to the real estate?", "David Simon", "Well, given -- we did it initially with both in mind, but the odds are, based upon what's happening in the capital markets, that we'll probably just get paid in par.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then last question, I mean, sales growth has obviously been pretty good over the past year or so. I mean, how far away do you think we are from new development on the traditional mall side? You've been active, obviously, on the outlet side, but is that something that you're thinking about more these days?", "David Simon", "I don't see it. In my -- I think it was in '07, maybe it was early '08, I had said a decade away back then. So I may have been a little over dramatic. But we -- Rick, you can comment on this. We just don't see new full-price retail being built any time in the near future.", "Richard Sokolov", "And I think that one of the other companion trends to that is that the retailers, as their demand for space picks up, are being accommodated by redevelopments and expansions of the existing square footage and properties. So the existing properties are getting a lot stronger and that, in turn, is going to make it even more problematic to institute new development going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "David, one of your peers in this quarter talked about buying anchor boxes. And I'm just curious if that's something -- I'm sure you're been doing it all along, but I'm just curious if you're seeing more opportunity to do that now or if you're being more aggressive if the opportunities arise?", "David Simon", "I will tell you, Jim, that it's standard operating procedure here to reclaim the boxes, that anchors that some of our tenants might have owned that closed. So the strategy is not all that different. We like to have tenants kind of secured. We like to drive a tough bargain on it. So it's not -- we don't call it kind of newsworthy events, it's just kind of standard operating procedure that if we have the ability to buy and retenant it, we will, if it makes economic sense. Rick, you can add to that, but we've done a lot of it over the years.", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, just to that point, the -- if you think about our portfolio in the industry, over the years, we've had the May, Macy merger, we had Lord & Taylor abandoning substantial stores, we have Montgomery Mall abandoning many stores, Parisian. Over the years, we've redone about 75 department stores, and you can go back in all of our 8-Ks, and all that activity is tracked. And in virtually every instance, we have ended up with a replacement that is stronger. But David's point, we'd like to know what we're going to do with the box before we acquire the box, and we want to make sure that we're getting an appropriate return on that capital investment.", "David Simon", "And some of the -- Jim, just to -- and you can see this in our 8-Ks over the period of time, but we're doing 32 box deals in '11. Some of those were purchased boxes, some were lease expirations, some were lease buyouts. So that's just standard operating procedure here.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And kind of a related follow-up question on this point. You have talked on several calls now for a long time about the double-digit returns you get from this kind of box redevelopment activity that you've done. And Rick, you've talked about it in detail over the years. And then if I connect that -- trying to connect the dots, if you will, to the culling of the portfolio issue that -- this was talked about in the last call in reference to cap rate movement. I think you, David, indicated that you saw cap rates becoming attractive on potential sales opportunities, and of course, you're in the market with a couple of assets today. Is there much opportunity, or do you ever connect the 2, i.e., you look at doing a big-box renovation with the intention of and generating a double-digit yield with the intention of selling that asset when completed to a buyer that likes that type of property. Is this...", "David Simon", "Well, all the time. I mean, let's just talk an example. I mean, if we have a -- take a, in theory, a mall that you could sell at an 8 cap rate and we redevelop the box at a 6, we've lost value. If we redevelop that box at a 10, and we think it's an 8-cap asset, then we've created value. So we always take a difficult economic review of the redevelopment opportunity. So the answer -- simple answer is absolutely. And sometimes, you want the ability to redevelop the box to sell the assets. So again, that just factors in to what we're trying to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Macquarie.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "So lately, there's been a lot of talk about big-box retailers downsizing their square footage. And I think you guys have a great perspective on this because you own both type of retail properties. On the margin, do you see some of that coming into the malls going forward, minus the Best Buy mobile retailer?", "David Simon", "Well, certainly, there are some that are playing around with the size of their store. Old Navy is a good example of that. They went through a pretty significant period where they started at one size, grew to another size, and I think they're reverting back to kind of their original roots. I think that some of the bigger category-killer types, the Best Buy's of the world, are all looking at their footprint. We expect that some of the bigger stores ultimately will try to increase their efficiency. So we're very aware of that. And I'd say, sure, there are a number of retailers that are looking at the size of their box and what it needs to be going forward. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, I would just say on the specialty store side, there's no consistent pattern for every one tenant that says, \"Well, I was 8,000, I think I want to be 6,500 in my new prototype.\" We have others that are saying, \"We were at 6,000, we need to be 10,000.\" It's really a function of the momentum in that particular business, the number of lines that they're introducing, that they want to incorporate into their stores and the way they want to configure their stores. So I don't think that it is a broad-based trend across the retail space.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And second question, as you're sitting down with tenants during these negotiations, have tenants started already -- started to show some level of concern regarding commodity price increases? Not just gas prices from the retail sales standpoint but maybe on the commodity input front, like cotton prices, which have doubled in the past year? Was that putting pressure on margins and maybe your ability to keep occupancy costs up?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think their attitude right now is they believe they can pass that on. And I think this year we'll get a good sense of whether they're capable of doing that. And if that's the case, then I think it's business as usual. If they're unable to pass that on, they're going to naturally look at other areas that -- to reduce their operating expenses, and it may come after -- they may come after the landlord community. But up to this point, we have not seen it. And our defense to that is that we have great assets and good people, and we can hold our own in that kind of discussion. But at this point, they seem to think -- not universal, but they seem to think that they can pass it on and the consumer is willing to pay for the good as long as the consumer sees value in that good.", "Richard Sokolov", "And I would just add that historically, the tenants will bring forth any fact that they can put on the table to try and argue for lower rent, and we will -- as David said, we'll do what we can to argue for what we think is fair rent, and this is nothing new. Today, it could be raw materials. Three years ago, it could have been healthcare, could have been gas prices. Whatever the external circumstances that can broaden the discussion, they will do. And I think our results show, as David has said, we can hold our own in those conversations.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "And last quick question. Your lease spreads, that increased pretty significantly. I was wondering if you could give just the first quarter 2011 lease spread itself without doing 2012 month?", "David Simon", "Order, no. We look at it on a yearly basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "With sales up as much as they are now year-over-year and, obviously, occupancy trending up 70 basis points, where do you think you are now in terms of your ability to push rent versus retailers? And I guess, how are they responding just given your sort of focus on top assets?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I don't like to talk about our negotiations with our clients in the public domain. We're trying to create a fair deal for us and for them. And as I said earlier, it is still a challenge. The retailers are very focused. The impact of the great recession is not that far from their mind. And so we've got a -- that we've got a -- we've got to deal with that fact. And you got to try and create a win-win. So the good news is the environment's better, we're able to increase our rents, and we're trying to find that right deal. And the good news is our occupancy cost for the outlets and malls together is at 12.2% for the first quarter, and that's pretty good. So we're in good shape. In a lot of cases we're under rented. And in those cases, we think we can still be able to increase rents and create profitability for the tenants.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then obviously, with David Contis joining next week, any sort of changes you anticipate in strategy or just really continue to focus on your platform?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think we have so much to do that we wanted another aggressive, thoughtful, energetic real estate guy on the team to do what we want to do. So we look at it as another experienced set of hands to get the job done. And beyond that, no, he'll be a great fit. He'll work a lot with Rick. Between the way those 2 talk, hopefully I'll be able to get a word in edgewise. That's why I'm leaving the first couple of days next week. So -- but no, he'll be great. And other than that, I just think we got a lot to do. The other thing for David, he's had a good experience internationally. So that's like a gift with purchase in terms of him coming on board. Wouldn't surprise me if he or we find an opportunity internationally because of his involvement. And he just loves this business. And you want to have guys that love this business on the team.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And actually, just on that point, I mean, your stock's up now almost 20% since mid-January, obviously outpacing the RMC [ph] but how are you guys thinking about external growth apart from the redevelopment that you've announced. I mean, sort of is M&A still on the table?", "David Simon", "Well, right now, M&A, is always something that we look at. But, Jay, at this point, we don't see much out there in terms of big M&A. But we're active and we continue to look at a lot of different things.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy of UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Just a follow-up on a prior comment. I see what you're saying about expansions, redevelopment creating more space and better performing malls to accommodate retailer growth, but if you're a retailer like Abercrombie or Ann Taylor and you're already in all the better malls in the country and you're actually closing stores in underperforming malls, how do you grow from here? Is it new concepts? Is it straight retail?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think for Abercrombie, it's obviously international. But, I mean, we're doing a lot of business with Ann Taylor, so they obviously feel like there's places for them to go in existing portfolios. A number of these retailers are also looking to get in the outlet sector to grow. I mean, Bloomingdale's is a great example of that. I think we have 3 out of the first 7 or 8, right, Rick?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes.", "David Simon", "So some are looking at international. It's interesting, when we first invested internationally, we did it in '98. And the theory was our U.S. retailers would go abroad. We didn't realize it would take them 12 years to do it. But thankfully, even though it took them 12 years to get there, we made a lot of money in our pursuit of international expansion. So they're finding avenues to grow. I still don't think, though -- Christy, I still don't think the demand is so great that it will foster new, full-price, ground-up redevelopment. When I say it won't, I mean, there's always going to be maybe a deal here or there that get done. But in order to get that done, you're going to have to have economics -- from our standpoint, those economics probably to motivate the retailers to take a risk would be something for us that would be very hard for us to underwrite, vis-\u00e0-vis the other areas that we can invest our capital. But that could change. And I expect it to change, but I don't think it'll change in the next year or 2.", "Richard Sokolov", "And just in response to that question in terms of how they grow, and David alluded to this, most of our retailers are now very engaged in brand extensions. So Gymboree is growing with Crazy 8. J.Crew is growing with Madewell and Crewcuts. We've got American Eagle that is working with us on 77kids. And those are just a couple of examples. And when they are rolling out brand extensions, they are using the metric of their existing stores performance. So they are going to want to open their new brands where their existing brands are already successful, and that is obviously playing right into our strength.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then just a follow up on your outlet comments. Aside from Merrimack, have you guys announced any other projects in the U.S. in the pipeline? And can you just generally comment on sort of the uptick in potential supply growth for outlets in the U.S. as more developers are targeting sites and starting new projects?", "David Simon", "Well, look, we have not announced the construction of any new outlet. I know it's mostly public knowledge. We are looking and working in Galveston, Texas, and we think, ultimately, there'll probably be -- the market there can only really support one outlet, and you've got that in process. We'll see what happens there. But we're working on other sites, but we really don't have anything at this point. And when I say other markets, but we really don't have anything at this point to announce. But we're confident that we'll be able to find some other avenues to build ground-up. And I think in that market, in that sector, there is more demand to build some. But it's not -- there's not going to be a lot of these built because even with outlets in mind, the retailers are very disciplined in where they want to go and on what basis they want to go. And you've got competent developers like us and Tanger and others that understand that dynamic.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just lastly, can you talk about how you're approaching shorter-term 1- to 3-year leasing versus a couple years ago? So what percentage of your leasing in the quarter was 3 years or less, excluding temp tenants?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, what we have in our -- the leases that were signed in the first quarter, we had -- the 2 years or less was 19%, which is the same percentage that we've been reporting historically. We are doing it, so it hasn't really changed. What we are doing is when we determine our term in our negotiations with our tenants, we're looking at whether we think it's the right use, the right rent, the right tenant in that space. Do we have space sitting next to it that's maturing in the next year or so? There are a lot of factors that go into that term discussion, and it's something that we're very focused on. But there has not been a material increase in our short-term leasing in the last several years, and so we're pretty much normalized going into this part of the cycle.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisor", "Just looking at The Mills portfolio, as you look back to that transaction, can you give us effectively a report card of how progress has been made? And what would you want to do or what do you want to do with The Mills portfolio going forward?", "David Simon", "Well, I would tell you that I think The Mills -- there are 17 Mills. We only show 16 because one doesn't -- is under construction, that being Opry. And it's exactly -- the underwriting is exactly what we thought it would be. There's a couple that we knew going into that deal that were very difficult. But the way, as you remember, Cedrik, Mills didn't have much equity, if at all, in those, a couple that were tough. And we're making progress on those couple that are tough. But the fact is they contribute very little cash flow to us, and they're on our books for essentially nothing. The others have gone very well, and we've done a great job of improving them, and we feel very good about the concept. We've added full price. We've added outlets. We've added boxes. We're close to announcing a full-line department store in 1 or 2 or 3 of them. Sawgrass Mills, we've done a great job of executing the outdoor, high-end outlets there. We've also -- you'll notice a decrease in the occupancy. That's really associated with getting back the one anchor there, the Wannado in Sawgrass, which we've got great development plans that will increase the cash flow, we think, at that center by $4 million to $5 million just on redeveloping that box. So aside from the 2 that we always felt were tough, that were not great, great locations, we've actually been pleased with it. Fairlon's [ph]  been a very good partner with it, and it's gone according -- essentially according to plan. The good news on the mall side is that we have -- I guess I can -- we have a big redevelopment that's going to be announced next week, so we can't announce it this week, on one of the malls, and we've also started major work in Southdale. So we are making really good progress on the malls. And we've been pleased with it, and it's gone according to what we thought with the major markets Potomac, Gurnee, all of those kind of going somewhat better than initially expected. And frankly, surviving relatively unscathed a great real estate recession.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisor", "And then so in terms of the 16 Mills themselves, do you want to move even further to Howard's outlets  for those properties over time?", "David Simon", "Yes, we think we're adding more outlets there.", "They're -- usually, they're in such great, dominant, super regional mall locations that we're going to do both full price and outlets in some of them. And others we think we can move even more with outlet concept.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Bilerman of Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Yes, Quentin Vellely is here with me as well. First question on the leasing spreads, and appreciate the new detail. I guess when you look at total leasing, I mean, how much of that was in the quarter because I guess moving now the same space but increasing to above 10,000 reduced the square footage that's being shown on the page. And so I'm just curious, when you look at the totality of it, what sort of the trends were like in openings and closings?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Michael, it's Steve. Part of your question is correct. The premise is correct. We did move the same space, but we have always disclosed all GLA, all small shop GLA in our leasing statistics. But to answer your question, the $5.8 million that we included on a same-space basis is about 75% of our total leasing activity over the trailing 12 months.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And I guess when you look at the totality, so that 8 million square feet opening and closing, would the spread increase or decrease from that up 10,000 just to get a perspective of -- same space is very important but I'm wondering if we can get perhaps both of them so that we can really understand the impact it is to the bottom line on the totality of the portfolio.", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, Michael, if we had included a, cut at, 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet, the smaller space as you -- I thought it was the...", "Kevin Beeston", "The question is if you include it all together.", "Richard Sokolov", "That still would be substantially higher spread.", "Kevin Beeston", "It would still be higher spread.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Can I assume that if it was higher than 10,000 or how much meaningful if you include all the leasing that you had completed?", "Kevin Beeston", "Well, it's 75% of the total population. So it's not going to move it a ton, but it would be higher.", "David Simon", "Look, I think you see that in where the average base rent is going to, right? So that gives you -- that's why that number is still out there because we want people to see what's happening with our average base rent. That takes everything into account: renewals, extensions, new deals, et al. And that's why that number's still out there to be shown.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And then when you think about The Mills platform and the benefits you've been able to do since you bought it, you do have a partner, and any time you have a partner rather than owning it, and a partner who's not going to be long-term owner of real estate, retail real estate like you are, it does set it up for -- you eventually have to pay for all the improvements that you did. And obviously, in a fair and negotiated way, I guess how does -- how will that venture eventually be resolved and sort of the timing of doing that? Do you envision buying it? Do you envision bringing in another partner for a very [ph]  long stake? And how should we expect that to go?", "David Simon", "We'll, all fair questions, all good questions, but very difficult for me to answer, obviously, because of the confidential nature of our partnership. But I will say this. They've been a very good partner. They've been very supportive. They've been very excited about what we've done with the portfolio. They've been more than willing to reinvest in the assets. So the partnership couldn't be better. Are they a natural, long-term owner like we are? No, clearly. Will that resolve itself in a win-win at the right time? Very, very highly likely, but beyond that, Michael, is very, very tough for me to venture further.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "When you say the right time, is that next 12 months or should we be thinking 2 -- 3 to 5 years?", "David Simon", "I'd like your advice. What would you like? Tell me.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "I want the lowest possible price possible for the most accretion.", "David Simon", "Me, too.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "As soon as possible. Curious, last quarter, you gave me the bunny movie version of the Capital Shopping Centres and how that ended. Why don't you give me the same thing on the outlet center and all the other guys who are out there trying to develop, and how you think that's going to end at the end of the day with so much increased competition in the space?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I don't have a bunny reference today, but I will say this. There's a lot that can be spilt between the cup and the lip, right? So my view of it is this. Until somebody starts construction on whatever project that is full price redevelopment outlet, all we are is yammering. So we try to keep our yammering. We're not perfect. We yammer with the best of them. We try to have the lower yammering quotient. We try to be leaders in yammering. But in the meantime, until it starts construction, to me it's just a lot of talk.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "Hi, it's Quentin here. Just a question in terms of currency. You commented on additional potential offshore expansion. And just with the move in the U.S. dollar, I'm just curious how you think about investing offshore and whether you might change the way that you structure some of your potential offshore acquisitions?", "David Simon", "Well, look. I mean, the interesting thing is you've got a couple -- it's twofold. One is very tough to complicate or consider a major outside of the U.S. investment right now if you have to use your currency to buy something, right? So on the other hand, you could argue, \"Well, if we're in a further decline, are we not better off having some of our assets outside the U.S.?\" Now we have about 5% of our assets outside the U.S., so naturally, we get some marginal benefit on it. But for us to do a major thing outside of the U.S., unless there was the ability to use currency-dominated financing, and in some markets you're able to, in some you're not, it's a tall order right now given how weak the dollar is. So naturally, I think at the end of the day, when you factor it all in, it probably curtails our investment. I mean, our greatest advantage right now should be our cost of capital, but if we can't use that -- I mean, besides all the ability to make assets better and all that stuff. That's true. But if we can't export our cost of capital because the dollar is so weak, it's a challenge to do further major international expansions. Yes, we can build. We're building in Korea. We're building in Malaysia. We're looking at other Asian markets and actually building stuff, and making things happen there. But to do a major deal, we don't -- and if we can't finance it where we don't get the benefit of our cost of capital here and have to convert dollar investment into that currency, I mean -- and so you could make a real estate deal, but if the dollar does strengthen down the road, you could get whacked and lose your value. So it's a natural constraint that we've got to deal with.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "And I guess on the flip side with the currency, are you seeing more interest from offshore investors into some of your assets, maybe some of the weaker assets or potential for joint ventures? And does that give you some kind of opportunity to maybe sell more U.S. assets?", "David Simon", "Well, look. I definitely think there is a -- I wouldn't call them weaker assets, but there's clearly the trend from a number of the international institutional investors who have a tendency to gravitate toward the highest quality and the major metropolitan markets is clearly moving away from that, looking to want to be in the U.S. for all sorts of reasons, yield, one, maybe their view of the dollar ultimately, all sorts, safety, whatever it is that they factor in. And they are going down the quality spectrum to find investment opportunities. So I do think that seems to be a trend that will continue at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Just want to go to the topic of B malls. You guys are marketing some stuff. And it seems like every other retail company out there is marketing whether they'd call it Bs or non-core. How much of the stuff do you actually think will trade? And for the buyers, do you think the buyers will predominantly be financial buyers, or do you think that we'll see like real, real estate buyers.", "David Simon", "Well, I think it's too early to tell on what's going to happen out there that will trade and at what pricing. But I think, actually, you're going to see probably an entrepreneur with equity, either from opportunity funds or from other kind of institutional investors that are going to see the yield opportunity, one, maybe the ability to make the property better, two. And when they put it all together, compared to kind of where they are on buying A plus, they see that risk adjusted return worthy of taking that investment. I would say to you, though, if the market's better, the financing market's better -- the fact that we're selling 4 malls is not a big deal. I mean, we have sold 100 assets as we've been public. So this is kind of a normal strategy, Alex. We clearly stopped that effort in '08 and '09, and '10, certainly for a period of time, even though we did sell something in '10 at a huge gain for us in Europe. So we're always looking to recycle capital. It's not a transformational deal for like some of the others that might be out there. But long story short is we'll have to wait and see. It's going to be a combination of operators, maybe even others, some other real estate, major real estate companies. We're just going to have to wait and see how it shakes out.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay, so if I understand what you're saying, it sounds like you're a little less optimistic that there's going to be a lot trading. There'll be some trading, but it doesn't sound like you're expecting a huge amount. Is that fair?", "David Simon", "Well, I think the market's better, and I think trades will happen. I'm just not going to quote what I think cap rates are going to be because I honestly don't know yet. But I do think there's going to be more velocity in, you use the term, the B assets. I do think there'll be more velocity. I think it's too early to speculate from our standpoint where cap rates will be.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "And my second question is for Steve. I think it was last call, you commented on the pile of pitch books for converts that's in your office. Sort of curious what the latest pile is, and what are your thoughts on doing some more 30-year or if you have a view of the 30 non-call 5 [ph] if that's attractive to you?", "Kevin Beeston", "The piles are growing, Alex. The convert pile -- obviously, the capital markets are very robust right now. So unsecured debt markets are very attractive. And one of the things that we need to take into consideration is one of the things David said in his opening comment, we're sitting here with $4 billion of liquidity right now. So we certainly don't have the need to go to the capital markets. But having said that, given the attractiveness of the all in rate now, certainly on the bond side, it is something that we monitor and we will continue to monitor. Right now, I would tell you we are not as enthralled with the convert market, and I think it's not something that we would look at to put in the capitals back right now.", "David Simon", "And look, I would just say that -- just to add what Steve said, I mean, one of the bigger decisions we'll have to make this year is whether we want to warehouse capital, given that capital -- we don't need it necessarily, but it is relatively cheap. And we do think -- I mean, I think -- I may be completely wrong, but I do think rates are going to up at some point. And so one of the bigger decisions we'll have to make at some point this year is whether we go ahead and warehouse capital, not equity capital, but whether we warehouse other forms of capital on the theory that rates are going to go up at some point here. And that's a decision that we think about all the time. But it's tough because we haven't seen it, but usually you don't want to be in the case where we react. Real estate guys tend to react while rates are going up as opposed to when rates are low, and we'd like to be a little -- at least -- we don't have to be perfectly smart, but we'd like to be less stupid .", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Sounds like a good strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee", "Just focusing on prime for a second. Clearly, you've had some good success leasing up some of the vacancy. Can you talk about some of your success there in terms of driving rents and perhaps put a number to that?", "David Simon", "Well, I know we won't put a number to it. But look, I think we feel really good about the deal we did obviously going in. We're glad to have David as an OP holder. He's been a great OP holder as well. And it's just been a good win-win deal for everybody involved. It's a good portfolio. We expect to do some good stuff with it. Nate, it's tough for me to give you numbers. I probably won't. I know I won't. But what, Rick, you want to add anything to it?", "Richard Sokolov", "The only thing I would say to you, Nate, is that what we've been able to do is as the new tenants enter the outlet sphere, we now have an additional portfolio of properties that they can immediately open stores in, and we're getting the benefit of that. And we see it with tenants that we've had relationships with, or like Coach is opening Coach Men. Bare Essentials, Vera Bradley. I mean, we're just taking these tenants now across a broader portfolio of properties, and that's really providing incremental momentum, both in rents, but also in sales. Because we're bringing in higher productivity tenants into the portfolio.", "Kevin Beeston", "And I -- just to reinforce what Rick said. I mean, the greatest opportunity there is to increase the mix, which drive sales. And obviously, that's the focus.", "Nathan Isbee", "What's the occupancy costs currently?", "David Simon", "We don't separate that out. But it wouldn't -- it's not all that different than what you'd see from the outlet sector.", "Nathan Isbee", "And then just quickly, in terms of your increased guidance. Can you just quantify the change in your same-store NOI assumption?", "David Simon", "Well, we didn't do it this year. We didn't give a NOI -- comp NOI in our original guidance, but right now, we expect to beat our own internal budget. It didn't answer your question.", "Nathan Isbee", "No.", "David Simon", "We didn't -- I'm sorry, I'm not purposely frustrating you, but...", "Nathan Isbee", "I was thinking the wedding was going to put you in a good mood.", "David Simon", "But we -- the fact is, we didn't give specific guidance there. We have our own internal budget, and we hope to beat our own internal budget.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Harris of Gleacher & Company.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Listen, I was listening -- reading your annual review, and on the international, I know you fielded a couple of questions on this today, but you make a reference to \"We are proven to be valuable exporters of our know-how.\" I kind of read that and thought it was sort of a little imbalanced in the sense that I would've thought you would've learned a lot or could learn a lot from operating in overseas markets and taking best practices and exporting them around the globe. I'm thinking in particular to overseas tenants have really sort of enlivened the U.S. retail scene in the last few years as well. Any comments around that?", "David Simon", "Well, look, our know-how, if you look at what we built, I mean, the outlets that we build in Asia are essentially our outlets here in the U.S., and they didn't exist prior to that. I think if you saw the product that we built in Poland and the product that we built in France, were actually highly U.S. influenced. So we certainly -- we learn every day here, abroad and everything else. But I think that the fact of the matter is we've had a profound and positive impact on what we've done, and that's really what my comment was meant to be. If you look at Gotemba in Japan, it's really modeled after what we did in Woodberry. If you look at what we did in Yeoju in South Korea, it's very similar to what we did in other parts of the U.S. So I think we've -- in fact, if you go to Dubai and you look at what they built, I mean, they've taken the best of foreign shops and other malls in the U.S., and replicated that. So again, that's not to denigrate the international marketplace. And we've certainly seen a lot of wow stuff over there, but we certainly contributed to all of the activities we've done overseas.", "Richard Sokolov", "I think touching on the other side of your point, in terms of the international tenants coming in to our domestic portfolios, we've done a very good job of implementing them into our portfolio. We just opened the flagship H&M store forum shop. We're doing a lot of business with them and have a very close relationship with them. But it's not just them, it's Pampolina from Spain, Inglot from Poland, Diva from Australia, Aurecia [ph] from Canada. I mean, there is a lot of international tenants that we're doing business with across all 3 of our platforms. The Mills, the outlet centers and the malls.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I'm curious, Rick, actually -- I'm curious, are there any ideas coming out of Asia? Because all of the international stuff seems to -- the fresh international ideas seem to be coming out of Europe. Is there anything out of Eurasian context?", "Richard Sokolov", "What we're anticipating is the UNIQLO is going to be a major player here, and they're building their flagship right on Fifth Avenue, and then we expect that we're going to have a similar type of expansion that we've seen with H&M. They started in the major cities and now they're throughout the country and growing very rapidly and doing very well in their stores.", "David Simon", "And you know, the thing that we understand about the Asians is that they love to come to the U.S. and shop. And so one of the great things that we provide them in their travels is the fact that we have great places to shop, so marketing to them is really, really important.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Just on Asia and thinking a bit more on Japan. I know you made your comments there. As we sit here today, would you be inclined to try and step up your investments in Japan notwithstanding those comments you had to make about currency?", "David Simon", "We have always -- we're actually expanding Ami right now, which is right now somewhat affected by what's going on in the -- with the nuclear facilities. But we have not looked at the full price market there. We've had great success in the outlet market. Cracking the code on full price in Asia has been a struggle for us. Values, the cost to develop full price there, the size of the deals, the ability to get the land in the right location. So that's been the tougher one -- that's been the tougher code for us to crack. We do think, though, our Outlet business in Asia can grow, and we're excited about that. Ultimately, can we crack the full price thing in Asia? I don't know yet, David. It's tough because first of all, it's not devoid of a lot of full price to begin with. And second, where you want the locations, the land cost, the infrastructure cost, and the competition are all challenges that we have to deal with.", "David Harris - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Well, you may not want to respond to this but, I mean, surely your relationship with Mitsubishi Estates would be -- open a few doors for you on the full price, wouldn't it?", "David Simon", "They are good partners.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Merrill Lynch.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just want to follow-up on the comments about rates going up here at some time. I guess can you be a little bit more specific on your thoughts when you say \"some time?\"", "David Simon", "Well, I wish I knew.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "At least what you're thinking.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think our -- I think it's conceivable that -- how am I -- look, anything that we can refinance today, we're refinancing. We have certain mortgages that are obviously locked out to prepayment penalties, so we don't think it's cost -- you're trading dollars essentially, and it's not cost-effective to do that. But the big issue for us, if we do think rates are going to go up is whether or not we would do some kind of bond deal and warehouse the capital, because right now, we don't have -- if you remember what we did in '09 and '10 -- or in '10, I'm sorry, '10 essentially, is we bought -- we refinanced bonds and we bought them back and it ended up being, at least in today's world, an okay trade. So the question is whether we want to do something like that. Or we just hold on to the capital and wait for maturing debt to come do.", "Kevin Beeston", "Jeff, this Steve. Just to kind of amplify on David's comments. If you look at, as a gamble, where the benchmark 10-year treasury is today and you track it back over any length of time, whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, it's clearly at historically low levels and at levels where over a long period of time they have not been for a very large percentage of that measurement period. So I think any time you're in an environment where rates are at historically low levels, it does give you pause to reflect about do you want to go get more capital because history would tell you that the probability is those rates aren't going to be at that level forever. And I think David framed it pretty well. We've got a lot of liquidity. We don't have an immediate use for the capital. But if your view is that it may be more expensive down the road, it may make sense to go after that capital now.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I'm not sure if you'll answer this question then. Do you think that the market is properly pricing in higher rates when we think about today's current stock prices, thoughts on cap rates, the implied cap rate on the group?", "David Simon", "Well, I think the market's probably anticipating a recovery and a stable interest rate environment.", "Kevin Beeston", "Lack of yield in the rest of the world and there's a lot of...", "David Simon", "And I think -- look, I mean, I think the fact of the matter is  that's been the reality. So our view is recovery, you're seeing a recovery, we've been at it for a few quarters now. Clearly interest-rate market's been very stable. At some point, that might change. I'm not so much worried about the recovery as opposed to the interest rate environment.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And turning to leasing, I know you said earlier today, on a public call, it's tough to answer questions. I guess can I just ask on -- in general, in your negotiations, are you focusing on sales the next 12 months or are you still negotiating on trailing 12?", "Richard Sokolov", "When we're negotiating with the tenants, it is a very individualized negotiation. We're looking at their growth in the last 6 months, but we're looking at the use, the space, the size of the space, the quality of the mall, the space in the mall. There's a lot of factors that go into how we price our rent and certainly sales growth is one of them, but it is not the only one.", "David Simon", "Yes, and I'd just say it's -- really, the biggest focus is the market value of that space, right? You could have a retailer in that space that's not performing, and I wouldn't want to tie the rent to that sales performance when in fact, the market value is higher or would indicate a higher rent. That -- leasing is an art like -- and certainly we try to make it as scientific as we can. We're leaders in data generation here in terms of all of the tools available to us to assess that. We assign market value for each space. We use it sometimes. We ignore it others. At the of the day, we have relationships to factor into it. So at the end of the day, we kind of all put it together, and the best thing going for us is our judgment. It's an art. It's not a science. It's not order taking. It's what does it do for the center, merchandise mix, where we want to take the center and all those factor in, certainly having positive sales history which is positive traffic all go into the blender and all make the job somewhat easier than it was a year or 2 ago. But it's all those things that factor into what's the right -- what we're trying to accomplish and what the right rent is.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then turning to international. We know David Contis has experience in Brazil. We just did a tour there. I mean, do you think that it's too late at this point? Do you think you missed the opportunity on full price in Brazil?", "David Simon", "Not necessarily. David, the research we've done, the biggest constraint that I see in Brazil is that -- the currency issue as opposed to the real estate issue and the cost of the financing there. So you don't get -- we wouldn't get any much if any advantage on our lower cost of capital here to put money to work. But I think that story on the real estate front doesn't seem to have changed at all. The problem is you really do have a dollar currency issue that makes it a little more challenging to conceptualize a transaction there.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question, where do you stand on '11 leasing? And what are some of your goals heading into ICSC?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, '11 leasing is, for all intents and purposes, on our renewal is done. We're well into 2012. For us, frankly, ICSC is much less important. In fact, the month of April and the month of May prior to ICSC are our peak periods of tenants coming to Indianapolis to meet with us because the volume of activity we have, they'll come for 2 days in order to go over all the opportunities in the portfolio, whereas at ICSC, you're really limited to half an hour or hour sound bites. So we're doing a lot of leasing. We're focusing on our '12 renewals and leasing up the vacant space. And so far, we're seeing good momentum.", "David Simon", "And I'd say this, Jeff. The biggest focus that we'll have is on some of our major redevelopments. So included in that are like Nanuet Mall is a -- we are finally at the point now where we're going to start demolishing that center. We have Quaker Bridge, Del Amo, Dadeland, La Plaza, Plaza Carolina, Southdale, Southridge, Copley, what we're doing on the island, Laguna Hills, Stamford, we hope to push along a potential expansion of that center. So -- and then we've got some things in the outlet side as well, potential new projects that we could start talking about there. So that would be -- of the -- and Rick's right. I mean, '11 is essentially done, '12 lease renewals. But I'd say the focus really for us is going to be on the major redos that we've got, we're on the cusp of doing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "What led to the decline in other income from the year-ago period?", "Kevin Beeston", "Yes, we had big lease settlement income in the first quarter of 2010, Carol.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "Okay. And then this question's probably for Rick. Are you seeing any and new and exciting retail concepts coming to the malls?", "David Simon", "Okay, hold your breath.", "Richard Sokolov", "Thank you for asking. We are. And what's interesting is that they're coming from all different places. For example, we're doing deals with Fiat dealers because they're not opening their new dealerships. They're reintroducing the concept to the United States, and they want to be where the people are. We're signing leases with Tesla Motors, the new electric car maker, because they want to have their demonstrations where the people are. We're doing deals with Microsoft, the biggest Internet-based company. They need to open stores where the people are, and that's our malls. I could go on, but David will give me the hook. I'll stop when David gives me the hook. Well, Love Culture is growing very substantially. Francesca's has filed for a public offering, relatively new concept. Charming Charlie's, Pandora just went public. There is just a lot of activity going on in our portfolio, and happily, throughout the portfolio. These are not just concepts that want to be in the top hundred malls. These are concepts that have broader price points and want to have 400 to 800 stores in their ultimate build-out. So it's very exciting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Yang of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Just one quick one for me. Maybe David, do you have any thoughts on potentially teaming up with a partner to do outlet center development in Canada? Maybe starting in Toronto, just a few miles away from another potential site? Just curious if you had any discussions with Callaway to potentially start a partnership there?", "David Simon", "Well, we are looking into Canada, Ben. I can't say other -- I can't really put any more meat on the bones there. We do think it's a pretty good market for a handful of centers, but I can't really say anything more than that. But we are looking into that marketplace.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I mean, hypothetically, if you were to form some type of partnership, do you envision yourself as just maybe like a capital partner or would there be some type of development, management leasing that you would share with your hypothetical partner?", "David Simon", "Well, if we did a venture in the -- I mean, this goes for any outlet venture, whether it's U.S., Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, China, we would definitely add operational expertise. We would not just -- it just wouldn't be our capital. So that's kind of a -- that's it. That clearly would be the case.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Quick question, when I look closely at results for the quarter, I mean, you guys beat consensus roughly by about $0.08. The midpoint of your new guidance is up about $0.08 versus your old guidance. But it sounds like operationally, things are getting better, leasing spreads are getting better, leasing velocity is getting better. I'm just surprised guidance wasn't up more. Is there anything unique in the first quarter in regards to the $0.08 beat that you expect will not be repeated in the back half of the year?", "David Simon", "Not really. You know what, we're a little cautious on Japan. We have a very robust international Outlet business. Some people forget about it, but it's not inconsequential. It's a great business. So we're being somewhat conservative on what the outcome of that is. It's sales dependent. And we just don't have enough history yet on what's happening there. The south is actually pretty good at Japan. Sales have bounced back pretty reasonably. But we just don't know, and we like to be generally conservative in setting expectations. So you put that together, we still have to execute our game plan. We're good, but we're not infallible. So you put it all together, and it's where guidance came out.", "Operator", "With no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay, thanks, everybody, for your time and your interest, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

My name is Pam, and I will be your conference operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the presentation over to your host for today's call, Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relation.", "Shelly Doran", "Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. ", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We reported FFO of $1.65 per share for the quarter, which represents an increase of 19.6% over the prior-year period. These results exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.07, and we now have met or exceeded expectations for 28 of the past 30 quarters, which we believe is one of the best records in the REIT industry. Of course, I would like to talk about 2 of the quarters, the 2 quarters that we did not do that. One was an impairment charge which we took on liberty, which is now fully recovered, and the other was just the timing issue, which we made up in the subsequent quarter, and in fact, in that year, we exceeded our -- both consensus in our initial guidance. So 28 of the past 30 quarters, we have met or exceeded our First Call consensus estimates.", "Let's talk about the portfolio. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $513 per square foot, up 9.4% from $469 as of June 30, 2010. Occupancy was 93.5%, an increase of 40 basis points higher than the year-earlier period, and 60 basis points higher than the first quarter. The releasing spread for 12 months was $4 -- positive $4.60 per square foot. Our releasing spread continues to include all in-line space, including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet. Comparable property NOI growth for the quarter was 3.5%. And I want to put that in context, that in 2010, our second quarter comp NOI growth was a positive 1.9%. So it was not off a low base, given the fact that 2010 was still in recovery mode.", "Let me turn to development activity. We have 2 new developments under construction, both the Premium Outlets. Johor, Malaysia, which will open in November of this year and Merrimack, New Hampshire, which will open next summer. Leasing activity is strong for both projects. We have 18 renovation and expansion projects under construction, with completion dates in 2011 and '12, and the restoration of Opry mills continues, with the completion expected in the spring of 2012.", "We currently plan to invest approximately $650 million in domestic and international development and redevelopment activities in 2011. And our number, though still in process, is approximately $800 million in 2012. As always, details on costs, returns and timing of these projects are provided in our supplemental reporting package.", "In June of this year, we sold the Jefferson Premium Outlet, our Prime Outlets, I should say, for $300 -- oh, I'm sorry, $134 million. We used $86 million of those proceeds in a 10/31 exchange last week to acquire ABQ Uptown, a 222,000 square foot lifestyle center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the center which generates sales of approximately $650 per square foot, adds to our presence in a growing Albuquerque market area where we're also on Cottonwood Mall. ", "Let me switch to capital markets, during the first 6 months of 2011, we close our lock rate on 50 new mortgages, totaling approximately $1.6 billion, of which our share was $1 billion, the weighted average interest rate on the loans is 5.1%, and the weighted average term is 9 years. As of June 30, 2011, we have $1.1 billion of cash on hand, including our share of JV cash and our availability on our corporate credit facility at $3 billion, for a total liquidity position of $4.1 billion. And as we said before, we still expect to generate $1 billion, more than $1 billion of cash from operations after dividends. ", "Japan, let me just tell you that we've reopened Sendai Premium Outlet, which was damaged by the earthquake and closed on June 17. The center reopened, and the response of the shoppers has been very positive. Costs of the repair of the center other than the deductible is covered by insurance. For our other 7 centers in Japan, things are returning to normal, and we continue to like the prospects in our Japanese business and admire the will of the people in Japan as they rebuild and grow their country after some of their tragedies.", "Now let me turn to guidance. Based upon our results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year, we increased the low-end of our 2011 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share and raised the top-end by $0.08. The midpoint of the range of our current guidance is $0.165, above the midpoint of our original 2011 guidance that I provided in February. ", "Let me just mention in Main Street Fairness Act, you've seen some editorials. In fact, in The Journal today, there is an article in The Journal. You saw the Indianapolis Star wrote an editorial on it. And let me just say that we've been very vocal about the unfair advantage that Internet retailers have and not being required to collect sales tax. We are urging Congress to introduce and pass the Main Street Fairness Act, which will allow states to end the subsidy being provided to retailers such as Amazon.com.  Let me be clear, this is not a new tax, but would merely require Internet retailers to collect sales tax on behalf of the states where they do business, something that brick-and-mortar retailers and even those who sell on the Internet have done for years. And this is required by law.  The economy is helped by having a level playing field, allowing an open market to determine consumer behavior without government subsidies, which we believe, is occurring for the online retailers.", "Now just a few concluding remarks before Q&A. We are certainly proud of the size and scale of the portfolio we have at SPG. As we have said it many times, our businesses where scale can be truly an advantage. And I believe that our industry-leading operating results, growth and profit margins are absolute testament to that. I do think, however, that sometimes, the quality of our portfolio is not fully appreciated. Our portfolio is second to none in our industry. We own more of the countries' iconic shopping destinations and centers by far.  And to help illustrate this fact, I will point out a few facts.", "First of all, in the mall sector. The 20 malls from which we get the most EBITDA, provide approximately $800 million of EBITDA annually, and this is our share. As of June 30, these 20 properties generated sales of $777 per square foot.", "Now let me turn to our top 20 value centers from which we get the most EBITDA, provide over $600 million of annual EBITDA, again, this is our share. And as of June 30, these 20 properties generate sales of $721 per square foot. And just as a reminder, given the focus on the value in outlet sector that seems to be occurring in the marketplace, our share from projected this year from that platform will generate approximately $1.5 billion, that's $1.5 billion of EBITDA from our value-oriented centers, both mills and the outlets.", "So with that, operator, we're prepared to answer any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "David, since you left off with the outlet center, I guess I'll start there. First, here at home, there's been a growing push to recast busted malls or retail projects as outlet properties. Are you concerned that supply of new product could exceed demand in some markets and segments? And how do you think about differentiation in that sector to a sure success? Is it location, size, price point, what you do you think?", "David Simon", "You broke up the first part, could you -- I didn't hear it at all. Could you...", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Yes, that's fine. I was saying that there's been a push here at home in the U.S. to recast retail properties as outlet-focused property. Do you think there's some risk that the supply of assets could surpass the demand in the next few years?", "David Simon", "Look, my own view is that, I think it's going to be a challenge to build many of the new outlet centers that are being bandied about. There has been a list of 50 outlet centers out there that are in pre-development stage for several years. We think, obviously, demand is good but the retailers and manufacturers are very sensitive to where outlets can be put. And so we think the market should be circumspect to the amount of new outlet development that's being talked about. There will be some, I think it'll be more challenging than what people believe. I do think there'll be some mistakes made, but I don't see a redux of the lifestyle center development. Never put it past real estate developers to overbuild, but I'm hopeful that year after year, experience will lead to a better judgment. In this case, I do think the retailers and the manufacturers are very sensitive to their full price operations. And I think that's a governor here that probably will not be a redux of what we saw in the lifestyle center area. And I think the redevelopment of existing enclosed malls to do this again will be in that same category, and more challenging than people lead on.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And sticking with outlets, where do you see the development yields on Johor, compared to, say, the projects in Japan and Korea? And I'm just curious, thinking down the road, ultimately, how big of an opportunity do you think there is across Asia for outlet properties in your portfolio?", "David Simon", "Well, the yields there are actually -- we think they're going to be fantastic. The yields in Japan have been very high, I mean higher than in the U.S. Malaysia, we're projecting to be higher than the new development yields here. And we think all of the -- everything that's lined up to build there is -- the consumer is there, the growth in income is there. They love the American European brands. So it's all lined up to continue to grow that. We've been successful in everything that we've built from Korea to Japan. We see the same thing in Malaysia. As you know, we're back to really seriously thinking about China for outlets. So we think there is an opportunity, continue to grow that business in Asia for us. Hard to put firm numbers on it yet, but the good news is, we've got 10 centers, soon-to-be 11, and we've got a good, good solid business already up and running. And we've been at it for several years.", "Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And just one last question on asset sales here at home. You guys have been in the market with some malls recently, and business and transactions on A malls. I'm curious, where do you see pricing on sort of A, B, and I guess I'll say, C assets right now, because we've heard some A malls actually touching 5 caps or lower, and I just love your perspective.", "David Simon", "Well, we have seen some -- again, we've seen some price talk on some, let's call them, A assets, I'm not sure whether they're a mall or an outdoor center or however you want to describe it. A couple of these, we think are more salty than they should be, because we don't see the growth that other people that are buying them see. We could be wrong, they could be right, but we think pricing on some of these individual assets that are out there are still what we see is very aggressive given the lack of growth characteristics in some of these assets. Now on the B and C, Jeff, I would tell you, we're still all in the discovery mode in terms of where the market is. Obviously, we've told you we have nothing to announce in that area, though we do have a very small amount of malls for sale as part of our strategy that we've had for years, to sell assets here and there. We, the B and C assets are more dependent on financing, the financing market in that area continues to be somewhat volatile. And I still think we're in price discovery on those kind of assets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "It's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, let's just start with you. Obviously, during the quarter, you had your employment contract set up under a long-term basis. And I won't just focus just in terms of the length of time that it got to take to that place and, obviously, when the proxy came out in April, it was disclosed that you were working with the board towards something. And then in the disclosure, you talked about the taking -- that you've had negotiations for 18 months. And I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about what transpired over 1.5 years in terms of setting the goals that you wanted achieved and that the board want to achieve, and I guess how you ultimately got it resolved, perhaps back a couple of weeks ago.", "David Simon", "Well, it -- look, I think Michael, it took longer than it should have. And I think part of the length of it is just the care that the comp committee took in deciding what was appropriate. We -- obviously, these kinds of things, are very sensitive, very focused given the -- rightfully, I've no problem with the scrutiny that something like this comes with. And I think, again, I wasn't privy to the comp committee's deliberations, but my guess is, given the -- what was going on, that they took a lot of time to feel comfortable with it. Now -- and also there has been a lot of volatility in the world during this period of time. So -- and obviously, my primary focus over the last 20 months has been running this company, and this has not been the #1 agenda on my plate. I do think, again, I was not part of the comp committee deliberations, but my guess is they studied past performance. I'm sure they looked at some of the recent comp deals that were out there for new and existing chief executives. I'm sure they considered, if, for whatever reason, they had to replace me, what it would cost for a new CEO. And just generally, what are the requirements that the company needs to lead the company from a CEO in the future. With all that said, I think they concluded that the deal they struck with me was in the best interest of the company. And the share amount was generally the same for that long period of time. And so the size of the apparent transaction, so it's an 8-year deal, which I think the market sometimes loses sight of, got bigger because, obviously, the stock performed -- has performed well over that period of time. So I don't know if that answers your question, but they were sure they were very deliberate in their efforts. I was very focused on running the company, and we've been living in a very volatile world. You put all that together and it takes a pretty, pretty long time. From my standpoint, look, I've been doing this for -- I've been running this company for 16 years, and I -- it was appropriate for me to kind of assess where I was, what I wanted to do in the future. And I wanted to work out a deal that recognized what I brought to the table. And over that 16 years, I want you to realize that I've never had an employment agreement. I've never had a deal, and both from my standpoint and I believe the comp committee standpoint, though I can't speak for them, we both felt it was appropriate to negotiate something for a longer period of time that delivered a certainty and that we all felt, myself included, because I'm a shareholder, that was in the best interest of the company.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And you get to do 32 more earnings calls.", "David Simon", "Yes. I can't guarantee the performance we've had in the past 30, but hopefully, we'll have some level of success along those lines.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "That's helpful color. Just diving into the portfolio stats you gave at the end of the comments, the top 20 is the top 20 malls and the top 20 value, the value you are saying are what? Mills and outlets centers? That's how you're combining that?", "David Simon", "Yes, we are now. It included a couple of mills, but generally, we included both.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And so you're looking at, for those top 40 assets or about $1.4 billion of EBITDA on a basis of call it, $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion, so 40 assets, 20% of the asset base is generating 40% of the EBITDA, is that the way we should think about it?", "David Simon", "Correct, Mike. And that's our share as well.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Right. And then, so when you step -- the rest of the portfolio, probably, is mid-400s in terms of productivity?", "David Simon", "Well, look, we gave you some facts today, maybe we'll give you more facts later. But that -- we thought that would be helpful for people to understand. At least, again, people lose sight of kind of the quality that we have embedded because of the size, we understand that. We don't like the tier assets, even though Rick does and it bothers me, but I let him do it. But we want people to know that our top 20 assets in these categories generate a lot of cash flow. And I think over time, we'll be more descriptive to everyone, kind of how we look at it. But that's what we want you to start thinking about at least today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Haberman with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Maybe following up where Michael just left off, on the top 20 on both the malls and the value centers. Can you -- are you willing to share, David, perhaps, some of your near-term outlook? What you think NOI growth could be perhaps for some of this top tier assets relative to the rest of the portfolio?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't have a specific number, but it's safe to say that these are under-rented and they're going to grow faster than our average, and they possess a lot of upside. But I don't have a record. Steve, do you want to add anything? But I don't have anything more to say other than that. They certainly, historically, have generated significant EBITDA growth, better than our average.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And maybe even just stepping back broadly, for the entire portfolio, if you think about this recovery to date combined with sort of where the economy is today and somewhat mixed, what's your general perspective in terms of where we are for rentals going forward in the cycle?", "David Simon", "Well, I would say, we feel pretty good other than -- there are a couple of tenants out there that, again -- I'm not going to name names, because we certainly shouldn't be in that business publicly. But there are -- a couple of tenants there that are sizable mall operators. When I say mall, that could be both outlet and full-priced malls that are still haven't had the benefit of the recovery that are going to put pressure on the industry, and us included, in terms of renewals and potential store closures and the like. And that's the biggest headwind. Now we've had that headwind, hasn't gone away, so we've been managing our way through that headwind. But that, to me, is the biggest headwind that's out there for us in terms of what we have to deal with on a day in, and day out basis. Our leasing people, obviously, understand that. They know that, and they're out humping to find those replacements, either through voluntary or lease expirations or to the extent that even 1 or 2 of these guys could end up in a Chapter 11, so that's the governor right now that we see. The consumer actually -- I feel a little bit better about what we all know. We live in a extreme volatile world, we could witness last night and understand that, what happened on TV last night. But I would say that's the biggest headwind that we've got to deal with.", "Richard Sokolov", "And the only thing I would add, it's Rick, is that our portfolio is not static. So as you look at the potential for NOI growth, we're renovating 20 properties, we're adding a considerable number of additional anchors. We just announced in today's press release, 3 additional department stores, as we continue to lease up our properties with more productive and impactful tenants and restaurants. We're enhancing the market share, and the better we make our properties, the faster our growth is going to comp.", "David Simon", "And we've got some major redos that are in works, that we may take some space out of service, that we're redoing the food court, all sorts of that stuff. That, again, is not overly material, but it might have a somewhat of a governor on our EBITDA growth. But we're performing -- the point is, we are performing better today than we thought we were, and we're bidding our budgets and that's the good news.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And I guess, Rick, sort of took my last question, but if you think about the $650 million of development, redevelopment of this year, and $800 million, I guess you're planning redev for next year. It sounds like that $1.5 billion target you guys had outlined for 3 years, you're perhaps cannot well exceed that. Is that a sign of you just want to reinvest more in the existing portfolio, rather than look for acquisitions at this point in the cycle?", "David Simon", "Well, I think those process, at this point, greater opportunities for us. We've always felt taking what we've got and making it better is a huge priority. One of the reasons why we brought David onboard was to help us do all of it, is there to do with the existing portfolio. And we're -- I'd say from that standpoint, we're very pleased with the amount of activity that our teams are generating. And that's not just the malls, the outlets, I mean, we've got expansions in the outlet side that we feel good about. Like in Seattle and Chicago, potentially in Woodberry, Commons, Allen, just to name a few. So the best thing we can always do is take a good property and make it better. And now that we feel good about capital and feel good about what our teams are doing, that's the #1 priority.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Just on international, I just want to get a feel for how you're thinking about the investment landscape outside the U.S.. I mean, you have your Asian developments, but have you thought more recently about acquisitions? I mean a lot more U.S.-based mall retailers are looking to grow outside the U.S. I don't know if that's having any input into that way you think about international investment, but both kind of from an acquisition perspective, and then, maybe anything that would lead you to accelerate your development pipeline beyond the sort of a couple other time you've got going in Asia.", "David Simon", "Well, the development side internationally, you're talking?", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Yes.", "David Simon", "Look, I think the big frontier there is whether or not we do something in China on the outlet side, and that, and we're spending a lot of time on that front. And we've got, at least, a couple more Japanese outlets to do, and we're looking at another one in Korea. And so the answer in the Asia new development is, I mean, we still want to dot Is, cross the Ts, but there's more to do there. And that could be accelerated to the extent that we do something in China. International, generally, when you talk about acquisitions, we mostly talk about Europe and potentially, what's going on in South America. And I will tell you that we're thinking a lot about it, it's very interesting. When we initially went into Europe in '98, we had this premise that the U.S. retailers were going to come, fact of the matter is, they didn't come, now they're -- but we were still successful. Now they're coming, so there is some industry logic to do it. We have felt comfortable we could add value, but the deal is there to do a sizable dealer. We don't want to just buy a one-off here and there. We think we would really want to try and create or invest in the platform. Those deals are not easy, but it's on our radar screen. We spend a lot of time thinking about it, but it's very hard to predict or -- in fact, whether or not anything will ever transpire there. And the math is always a challenge and -- which we don't feel compelled to plan a big flag there, because we've got lots of stuff to do here and lots of growth opportunities with our existing platforms including Asia.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "But the focus of this, right now, is kind of equally, like develop Europe and South America, say...", "David Simon", "Yes. I mean I think we've studied a lot in both markets. We actually have a trip scheduled, Contis knows Brazil pretty well. He served on the board of BR malls for a long time. That's a market we're not in, who knows? I have my own view. It looks a little toppy [ph], but I mean, long run, long-term, you've got to look at all these things.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Do you think we'll have news about kind of what you're thinking about doing in China, this year sometime, or...", "David Simon", "Potentially.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay. And then my last question, just maybe for Rick. Could you walk through, maybe, some of the -- we're not hearing much about that many new concepts in the malls, compared to maybe other points in the cycle, I mean, could you talk about who sort of your -- you've been doing deals with, and particularly anything that might be a growing concept?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, we've got a lot of going on with a number of our traditional retailers. And -- but in terms of the new ones, Love Culture, Pandora Lego, Sperry, Francesca's, Divona, Cotton On, Made Well, lululemon, Michael Kors, Tilly's, those are all relatively newer concepts, and they're all growing very aggressively in our properties. So from that regard, it's very encouraging, and when you also take into a fact that recently, we had the Fresh Market, Francesca, Pandora, went public, Divona, I think, is going this week. So the equity markets are being very receptive to providing growth capital to our retailers, and that's certainly benefiting us.", "Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Some of the existing concepts have been trying to downsize lately, I mean, are you seeing it kind of work both ways? I mean, are as many concepts looking to grow or is it kind of a general theme of trying to get your space to be more efficient?", "Richard Sokolov", "I think that for the more mature concepts that are saying, our store camp, perhaps, is too large or not as productive, we've got people that are very focused on growing. And the fact that our occupancy keeps going up is a testimony to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisor", "Looking at the activity on the big box side, obviously, you've added a lot of big boxes and -- or you will be adding a lot of big boxes in the near-term. David, do think it prevents some mall development, when you have the likes of Macy's adding a lot of space in existing malls?", "David Simon", "Yes, I think so. Rick, you want to...", "Richard Sokolov", "I think that one of our main strategies is trying to maintain the viability of market share of our properties. So to the extent that there is demand in a given market, to the extent that we can capture that demand by expanding our existing properties, it's a win-win for us. As David pointed out earlier, that's the surest way to get appropriate risk-adjusted returns. And in addition, we're making our property stronger.", "David Simon", "Yes. And I think the demand from the boxes to go into proven retail centers, including the malls, is just greater. So we're taking advantage of that trend. And the pressure out there -- certainly there's pressure on certain malls, but there is a lot of pressure on a lot of strip centers, just because if you lose an anchor or 2 in a strip center, that thing comes under immediate, immediate pressures. So the boxes seem to want to relocate where the action is, and in many cases, that being closed shopping center.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisor", "Okay. And as far as preventing development in the future centers, do you hear from some of the big-box retailers, in particular, department stores, that by committing to so many existing malls, it's probably delaying their interests in committing to future developments?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, it's interesting. I just -- we still -- a little bit, but I would tell you that the biggest issue on new full-priced retailer demand is probably not from the boxes, but more just to make the numbers work, and what the real small shop demand is to make the numbers work. That would be my, Rick, you can add to that, but that would be more of the governors and some of the boxes. That wouldn't you -- don't you think?", "Richard Sokolov", "I agree with that. And just to give you an editorial comment, one of the things that we have heard from our department store and big-box clients that are the retailers, is that 2008, 2009, taught them that who their landlord is matters. And what we're finding is that, there is a higher degree of interest in coming in to properties where they know the landlord has the commitment, has the capital, and has the ability to renovate as needed, bringing new retailers and maintain the market share of those properties. And as David said, there is very little new development out there because there is not enough demand to generate a 300,000 or 400,000 square foot new projects, and so the retailers are looking to come into the established properties.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisor", "Okay, that's helpful. Switching tracks, just talking about outlets for a little bit, you struck a JV with Tanger in Houston last month. Is it some -- is this a partnership you'd like to extend to other markets or was it a one-off event?", "David Simon", "Well, right now, we're focused on Houston. It's been a very positive discussion with Tanger. There -- we made a handshake and got documented quickly thereafter. We're excited about Houston. We're going to start construction, probably, in less than a month, in August. And we would never rule out doing more business with Tanger. But that's the #1 focus right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just staying on the outlet centers for a minute, 2 quick questions. As you look at some of the centers that have been announced or been in the press, and the relation -- the position relative to some of your existing centers, specifically to some of the Mills' assets, can you talk about what you've been able to do with the Mill's leases since you acquired that in terms of building in radius restrictions close to what you have at the Chelsea centers -- or the Premium Centers, sorry about that.", "Richard Sokolov", "From the -- this is Rick. From the Mills perspective, what we have been able to do is really, demonstrate the synergy between our platforms. Because the mills, their motto in their advertising campaign is Mills Means More. We've been able to take the outlet tenants that we have relationships within the premium platform and bring them into the Mills. And we've also taken a number of full price tenants that we have relationships in the mall business and bring them into the Mills. As a result, you've seen very good growth in the Mills, and you have seen substantial increases in the anchors, and the market share in those properties, and this month, the announcement of Macy's building a full-line store Gurnee on a pad that used to be occupied by Circuit City, is the best demonstration of how we're able to really, bring all of those varying tenants under the Mills outlets. In terms of the radiuses, they are less relevant in that property type.", "David Simon", "Yes. And I would say this, that we're not overly worried that any of these new -- if I caught your question right, we're not overly worried about any of the new outlets being developed is going to have a material impact on any of our existing Mills. So I don't -- I'm not worried about that at all.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And just given the success that outlets have had, there's also have been a bit of a move to move the outlets closer into major metro areas and closer for full-priced retail. Do you see the retailers pushing back on that, given the success that they've had at the outlet centers?", "David Simon", "I think that's harder to do than some of the new entrants in the outlet market you're talking about. I think that's a major issue for retailers and manufacturers. And I don't think they're going to jeopardize their full-priced operations. I do think that when you have a tourist market like a Las Vegas one or an Orlando, as an example, you are able to, because you have new customers that come in every week. Essentially, you're able to avoid the traditional rules. I think that it's -- if a lot of the outlet developers think -- these new entrants, so to speak, think they're going to get retailers and manufacturers to ignore kind of the old rules, we don't see it, because frankly, when we've looked at a number of deals, we get pushed back on sensitivity all the time. And we -- I would say, we know the business reasonably well.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just moving to the full price, we've heard anecdotes over the last few months coming out of ICSC, that there's been a willingness on the part of the retailers to move the stores to mall levels that they wouldn't have thought about, 6 to 9 months ago. Can you talk about that you've seen in the Simon portfolio?", "Richard Sokolov", "We certainly have been able to take advantage of the better macro environment to expose our retailers to other market and other properties where they currently don't have stores. So to that degree, yes, we are finding that we are able to bring those retailers that maybe, in the past, would not have looked at a market or a mall that would -- did not have the type of sales potential they thought and try it. And happily, what has happened is that as they have opened these stores, they continued to perform, and that makes them more optimistic and confident about doing additional locations in that type of property.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then I have just one last  question. The mobile web-based marketing system you've been talking about, can you just update us on what progress you've made in there and what direction you think it might go?", "David Simon", "Yes. Happy to, without divulging anything overly material. I mean, we are working with The Boston Consulting Group and our retailers, as we speak, in the design of the product, and we're making very good progress. The retailers that we're in discussions with have been very supportive of what we're trying to accomplish. Those discussions are ongoing. And we are hopeful that by 2012, we will have a product that we will be testing in a few malls, and we'll take it from there. So the goal is to have something of a test nature in '12.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you're more likely to develop something on your own versus purchasing?", "David Simon", "Well, I think you'll see a combination thereof. I mean there is a lot out there that we don't necessarily have to build completely by ourselves, we can partner. It's too early to say. If I had to guess today, it'll be a combination of build and produce ourselves, and partner some of the aspects with others.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So what type of capital are we talking about in terms of investments?", "David Simon", "Too early to tell, but we can handle it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "David, just wanted to follow up on a comment that you made earlier regarding the volatility in the financing markets, and maybe, this is more a question for Steve, as he's on. But can you comment on what you've seen in terms of financing costs and availability for A assets, versus B and C assets in the last month or 2, especially in light of some of the recently weakness in the CMBS markets? And how is demand for some of these lower quality assets in the market being impacted as a result?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, Christy, thanks for asking me a question. I was feeling lonely. Listen, I think you have a couple of things going on. #1, there is still, overall, some more and more financial institutions restarting CMBS platforms. And so I think, overall, the trend line is still good, as what happened in the last of couple of weeks with spreads gapping out, and maybe a couple of deals not getting done quite as well as people had hoped. It's probably just an indication, that it is still an evolving, maturing market, in its reconstituted face. With demand for the different quality of properties, I would echo, I think the comment that Rick or David made earlier. And the fact is, your better properties grow faster, they're higher productivity. There's clearly more demand for lend against that type of assets holding all other variables like loan-to-value constant. But the fact is, we're seeing pretty good demand for products across all the different quality spectrums. And if you've got a good asset and you're reasonable on your loan-to-value, you can get it financed.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then question on outlets. Can you provide some additional color on your Toronto project? I know you have zoning approvals, but are there any hurdles from a construction standpoint that could potentially delay construction? And I'm sure you've had discussions with potential tenants about the project, but what's been the retailer feedback so far as it relates to your project versus Tangers?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think the good news is, we've picked the market where an outlet center wants to be built. And we're competing hard against the alternative. We've got the site. I think it's just going to be a competition. We're hopeful that we'll get the job done. There is no guarantees that we will. Tenant demand is interested for sure, in building an outlet center there, it's a great market. So there's no real roadblocks from ability other than -- we've got to get the leasing, and I'm sure Tanger needs to get the leasing. And we feel like we're doing pretty good, but we're still got a ways to go. We are hopeful that '12, we start construction. I mean, that's our goal, and we're moving fast to accomplish that, no guarantees on that.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "What percentage pre-leased is Texas City given that your breaking ground next month?", "David Simon", "50-ish, but it's -- we're very confident in that deal.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Ross is on line with me as well.", "David Simon", "I'm sorry.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank", "I was just going to say Ross is on line with me as well, I think he has a question.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Just a quick question on Mills, it looks like you've got about $2 billion gross value of debt maturing over the next 18 months. How does that number relate to where Fairlawn is in terms of their potential monetization? And with that $2 billion of debt, do you guys, in the partnership, need to pay down any of that to get the refinancings done?", "David Simon", "Well, the vast majority of that is the senior loans and our mezz loan. And the fact of the matter is, there's no issue on refinancing the senior loan. It's -- coverages are very strong and the same thing with our mezz loan. So it's really not -- the refinancing of that is really not much of an issue in terms of how we look at it. The exit of Fairlawn is a different issue, and I -- it's really -- I'm not at a point where we can really discuss that. They've been a good partner, they're happy with the investment they've made, and we'll see where it goes. But I wouldn't be overly concerned about the ability to refinance the existing debt coming up.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Is it fair to say we should expect a monetization of your partner's interests at some point move sooner rather than later here in the next year or so?", "David Simon", "It's certainly in the realm of possibilities. So it wouldn't surprise us if that happens, but there is obviously, a chance that they stay in the partnership and we continue to do what we do, which is grow the NOIs, invest in the properties for the future.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And can you just remind us, how does the partnership work in terms of that monetization?", "David Simon", "They have a certain ability subject to right of first offer on certain assets, and they have an ability to sell their interest, subject to a first of right -- right of first refusal. They have some ability to sell certain assets subject to a right of first offer. And then, if they want to sell their interests, it's subject to right of first refusal.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I just hope -- I wanted to look at the acquisition, the Lifestyle center. I'm just wondering if -- are you seeing select opportunities in these high productive Lifestyle centers relative to maybe what is aggressive pricing on A malls? I was just, for example, thinking of Plaza Frontenac. When I back out the Yankers, I'm talking about roughly 220,000 square foot of in-line space. I'm guessing the productivity is comparable as is the occupancy, yet you're only paying $86 million, and I'm assuming Plaza Frontenac will go for far greater.", "David Simon", "Well, let me just say, look, we like the deal we did in Albuquerque, it's very well positioned, and consumers love it, retailers love it, and we think there's upside. We saw one, I don't know what it's called, the Lifestyle center in Carlsbad, that went for, based on how we looked at it and underwrote it, very little growth for a much more aggressive price than anywhere near what we did Albuquerque for. And the other asset you mentioned, we just didn't have any interest in it. So I let others whatever happens to that, no idea. But we just didn't have an interest for it.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And is there an opportunity to, let's say, on the cost of occupancy at ABQ?", "David Simon", "Yes...", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Or is there expansion?", "David Simon", "Yes, there is potential expansion, and there is, we think re-tenanting it as well.", "Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And just -- I guess, one last thing other than that. Are you thinking of breaking up the borders or are we leasing it as the box that it is?", "Richard Sokolov", "We're working on both the alternatives. We've already identified 3 or 4 potential users that would take the whole box, but it's very well positioned in the assets. And so there is also the potential to break it up, and bring in a couple more restaurants and a couple other small shops.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Just quickly on the AAA, the depths of talks you have in Washington. If the rating agencies follow through and actually downgraded the U.S., do you think there's any impact to either Simon or any of the retailers as far as financing? Apart from just a general shift in the market, are there any contracts that you -- treasuries as an underlying reference or any of the factoring that goes on that maybe disrupted? Just trying to get a sense of what the impact would be in your world if that should happen.", "David Simon", "I don't think so. I mean, we do lease space to the government. And I will tell you that they -- I'm known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report, and they are always 30 days delinquent, so I'm hopeful that they can rectify that. But it is very interesting to note, they are always 30 days delinquent. I mean, I guess in theory, we'd have some risk that, that would not be paid currently, but beyond that -- I mean, the numbers are immaterial, frankly. But beyond that, we don't see any real risk. I mean, look, spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes, so we'll be a participant in that. But beyond that, we can't see anything as we study that, that's going to be anything material.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. And then just as a second question is on the discussion of the taxing the Internet sales in folks like Amazon. Is this -- I mean, it seems like it's almost something that Amazon-specific, because a lot of the retailers have bricks and mortar presence, and they also sell their goods online. And I'm thinking about like a store like Apple where they've had tremendous success, rolling out physical locations. So it almost seems like Amazon is unique, as far as more retailers would seem to want to have a physical presence, in which case, they have to collect sales tax. So just curious, if the tenants are indicating that it's more than just Amazon that there's a huge amount of sales that they're losing or if this is just something more Amazon and perhaps, books/electronics related.", "David Simon", "Well, there is a number of pure online retailers beyond Amazon, like, guilt.com, I'm just naming, Blue Nile, just to name a couple. So clearly, Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in this area, but there are other pure line -- pure online retailers that are taking great advantage of the government subsidy that's occurring.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "But do the retailers have a sense of how much business they lose?", "David Simon", "Well, they're all very focused on it, so they're feeling the lost -- I mean, what we're hearing is the number of customers go to their store, learn all about it and buy it online, because it's 10% savings, so it's a real issue, and we need a level playing field. There's no reason whatsoever that there should not be. And it's not a new tax, and it levels the playing field. And the fact of the matter is, if a customer wants to buy online over bricks and mortar, and it's a level playing field, then that's the breaks of the game. But if they're doing it merely to avoid an 8% or 10% sales or use tax that they're required to pay, but the Internet retailer ignores it, that's not fair, that's not what this government should be all about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "Could you give us how -- remind me how much NOI you generate from the strip centers that you own? And if you can, give an update on, if there's any momentum in the small shops space.", "Stephen Sterrett", "Ki Bin, this is Steve. The strip centers in the aggregate, contribute about 3% to 4% of our NOI, which is just -- it's in the low hundred million dollar range, like $120 million.", "Richard Sokolov", "On the small shops side, there is a relatively small amount of space allocated to the specialty stores in the strip centers. That business is primarily driven by the big box leasing end. If you look in our supplemental filings, we are seeing momentum there, and adding boxes to that platform.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "So it's more in the box space not on the -- kind of in-line -- under -- the small shops space then?", "Richard Sokolov", "The small shops space is a relatively smaller percentage in that platform than in our other platforms.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And turning to your 2012 lease expirations. Could you give us some color on what is the advantage, on average of what's expiring in 2012? And if you can, what was the, on the apples-to-apples basis, the sales productivity based on the advantage, historically?", "Richard Sokolov", "When you look in our supplemental filing, if you look in 2012, we have 9,700,000 square feet expiring. So you can expect that, that is going to be a very fair cross-section of our entire portfolio. And just as an aside, the rent for that is $30.22, so that gives us substantial room to roll those over at higher rent given our current average rent.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "Right. I mean, that's all leading towards -- so could we expect, reasonably, in the mid double-digit range?", "Richard Sokolov", "It is hard to project. It's really a function of the specific state, it's their role, but we've been showing good momentum in our spread over the last few quarters.", "Ki Kim - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And last question, how do guys calculate when you add new anchors to your existing malls? How do you calculate your expected yields from that? Is that purely from, if they do pay rent, the rent you're expecting? Or is there some kind of formula for the increase that will [indiscernible] that would generate an -- or impact in the mall...", "David Simon", "You know, it's old-fashioned. It's called a cash-on-cash return. And we do not take into account the hope and prayer of -- that it'll mean something to this tenant and that tenant.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "Just a couple of quick questions. Steve, bad debt expenses continued to stay low, is that expectation for the second half for the year or do you think there's a turnaround in that number, back to more normal $4 million to $5 million figure?", "Stephen Sterrett", "You know, Steve, the answer might be somewhere in between to the 2. David mentioned, there are a couple of tenants and actually larger tenants that we have on our watch list, we're paying attention to. But the overall receivable environment right now is pretty good. Receivables are down, really half of what they were a year ago, at this time. And so I -- with the exception of a couple of tenants that we're paying attention to, I think it will be a relatively modest the second half.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then David, I know you said you don't like to characterize the malls, Rick does that, so maybe I'll throw the question to Rick. But could you guys just talk, maybe about regional performance and kind of what you're seeing across the country? And I realize you don't give the breakdowns of sales and rent growth between the malls and the Premium Outlets, but is there anything that you're seeing, I mean that noticeable trends between A, B and C in terms of rent growth, sales growth, and I guess anything by geography will be helpful.", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, but I'll comment on the geography. All of our regions were stronger with good sales growth, but the strongest regions were the mountain, which is Vegas, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Florida, weaker, but still growth where the plains and the Great Lakes. Across all the platforms, those properties that are located in tourist market have been substantially outperforming even the overall portfolio performance that we have talked about.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly, David, just talk about the dividend. I mean, your payout is exceedingly low and I'm just wondering what your thoughts are to maybe bump in the second half or is that something that you just kind of wait till the first quarter of next year?", "David Simon", "No. We're going to -- Steve, we're going to -- as you recall last year, we bumped it up materially in the fourth quarter. So we're going to follow the same procedure in the fourth quarter. It's going to be based upon our taxable income. And based upon taxable income, is certainly -- there is certain amount of volatility with taxable income. But based on what I know today, we're going to have an increase, obviously subject to board approval, but I'm sure our board wants to stay a REIT, okay? We're going to have a meaningful, again, subject to board approval and subject to what our taxable income is, but we're going to have a meaningful fourth quarter dividend increase like we did last year. And then going forward in '12, our annual payout now is $320 million, but my guess is that, as part of that fourth quarter, we'll also set the expectations that what our annual -- our quarterly dividend will be in '12, and again, I would anticipate that there'll be a true-up in the fourth quarter of '12, and that will kind of be the normal routine that we'll get in. Obviously, the true-up will never Hopefully, every be down, but we'll set a number, and then as taxable income gets more clarity, we'll bump it up to the extent that we don't, we're not meeting that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a couple of questions with regards to price discovery. The Albuquerque, New Mexico asset, could you just give us a sense of what cap rates that was on -- at? And then also any update on King of Prussia and what could happen in that end?", "David Simon", "Well, we're not going to disclose it, but with Albuquerque, but I think you'd be pleased. And we're not going to disclose what's going on with King of Prussia other than we're having discussions with our partners.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then, next question, recent article on SNL, just talking about you potentially selling some of your shopping centers. Just curious if you had seen that and if you could make any comments?", "David Simon", "Well, we've got a couple of centers on the market, and we're in that process right now. But we don't -- we won't announce anything till we have a deal that's essentially done, and at this point, we're in the discussions, and still going through that process.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Is there anything thematic about the assets sold? Are they being so weak?", "David Simon", "No. I think the only important thing to point out is just, we do this -- we've been doing this for several years. We did not do it in '09 and '10, because, obviously, the market was in major restructure, recovery mode. And so this is part of our ongoing process that we tend to look at some assets. We try to sell a couple here and there every year. It's consistent with what we've done in '08, '07, '06. You have all that data out there historically. And it's not a dramatic shift like say, and it's not an overly material the deal, like say, what's Westfield is trying to? It's just an ongoing process that we do, essentially, every year assuming the market conditions are acceptable to sell assets.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Great. And then just 2 quick ones to Steve. Steve, can you guess what occupancy costs were as of 2Q?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Yes. They were 12.1%.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And this is a combined number for the malls and the...", "Stephen Sterrett", "It is, yes.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "2Q in the centers, okay. And then in the quarter, other income, there was other within other income of about $30.5 million?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Correct.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Could you just give us a further breakdown of what's in that number?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It is a lot of the miscellaneous stuff at the mall, Tayo, it's everything from stroller rentals, sales of lottery tickets and all that, that various over the last year was, interestingly enough, going back to an acquisition that we did many years ago, we held the key main life insurance for a former director who passed away. And that was a couple of million bucks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And just kind of a quick follow-up, Steve, on that other income line item. As you compute same-store NOIs, as I understand that other income is in there, is that right?", "Stephen Sterrett", "If it's related to the property, Jim, it is. But like, for example, this proceeds from this life insurance policy that I mentioned would not be in there.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, very good. And then second question on same-store NOI, pretty significant increase quarter over quarter, up from the low 2s to 3.5, and I guess, teeing off of what David have to say about feeling better about the outlook for the balance of the year, I guess that's reflected in your guidance, but the 3.5 number this quarter, should we be assuming that, that number of data is achievable in the second half?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, I'll say this, Jim. As David mentioned, it is -- that was off a base that was positive last year as well. And if you look at the second half of last year, our comp NOI growth, as I recall, was in the low- to mid-2s. So we're coming off of higher bases. I think the good news, if you just look at the composition of the 3.5%, 265 basis points of it is percentage -- or excuse me, is minimum rent. I think Rick and David have both mentioned about deal quality continuing to get better, and 50 basis points of it is overage rent. We'll see where sales head, but if sales continue to stay at the percentage increase that we're seeing, it's reasonable to assume that there would be some pop from the overage rent as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "I just had a question. In your press release, it didn't mention anything about the outlet you all announced in May in Phoenix. Is everything still on track for that center to be built?", "David Simon", "Yes, we're still moving on that, correct.", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "Okay. And I know at least 2 of your peers have announced that they're interested in that market. How many outlet centers do you think Phoenix can realistically hold and support?", "David Simon", "Well, if they all get built, somebody will be a loser, how's that?", "Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons", "That works.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "David, in past year, you talked about only buying and owning franchised assets, which I thought included a minimum size requirement as well as anchors. But given that you just bought an unanchored center that was only 220,000 square feet. Is this possibly a signal that you're maybe more open-minded about what you want to buy and own, and maybe in light of the aggressive pricing for high quality assets that you were talking about earlier?", "David Simon", "Well, look, we are -- it's a very good question. The answer is a couple. One, is we really like this asset and we've looked at a lot of assets like this. This was an off market deal, so it wasn't -- they didn't hire Eastfield to create projections that the people bid on and believed in, and put in crazy cap rates, so we think we bought it right. We still would prefer the bigger, better deals, but some of those are -- there's not a lot on the market. And two, the numbers are very, very aggressive. And I think the other important thing on this is a good -- a very good market. We're in this market, so we know it, we cover it. And as I mentioned to you, this was part of a 1031 -- again, we love the real estate, we think it's got a lot of potential, but it was kind of an off-market deal, very good real estate, fair price for the buyer and the seller, upside good market. 1031, we're very happy to buy it. And we have looked at those kind of centers, but even some of those are just being bid up to what we think are very aggressive levels.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I mean, why would the seller necessarily not market the deal and potentially leave some money on the table by selling it off-market to you guys? I mean it's no secret that pricing is pretty frothy overall. So I'm just curious, how you guys step in, and how you present yourself and how you end up winning these types of opportunities?", "David Simon", "Well, believe it or not, we have -- had a history of it. We like those deals the best. That's how we got into the Outlet business. We bought Chelsea. It was  a negotiated deal. I bought the -- but low -- it wasn't an option. We've done most of our work in that way. And that's the way we prefer it, doesn't always work out that way. But in this case, our guys did a good job, and people know that we're going to close. So they know when we have a deal, they know we're going to close. And we're fair on that side of the equation. So they have faith that they just know we're going to get the job done.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great. And just last question. It looks like you meaningfully reduced the small shop tenants that were on month-to-month leases. Over the past quarter, it looks like it's down about 1.4 million square feet. Is this seasonality or were you able to convert the bulk of this to permanent tenants?", "David Simon", "Permanent tenants.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Can you give a breakdown just to give a rough idea of how much demand there might be for those temp to perm?", "David Simon", "Well, in this case, we had a couple larger national retailers that we've been going back and forth. And I think the bulk of it has been the fact that we just finalized those leases, and extended them and redid them or whatever.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And what was the average spread for those temp to perm conversion?", "David Simon", "We don't have that in front of us.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "But it's included in the overall metric?", "Stephen Sterrett", "It was.", "David Simon", "Yes. Of course.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan [ph].", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Real quick, David just on the dividend, again, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Fourth quarter dividend increased slightly, assuming the board approves it. Is there -- were something similar to a special? And then you would give a sense as to what 2012 could be more on a run rate basis. That was the right way, correct?", "David Simon", "Yes. Let me -- yes, let me just restate it because it's obviously important. We pay $0.80 a quarter, times 4, that's $3.20. It's very likely that we'll -- in the fourth quarter, dividend declaration, which will be part of our third quarter earnings announcement in November, payable in November, we'll include a dividend higher than $0.80, that will be driven by what our taxable income is. Remember, if you don't pay your taxable income, you can't be a REIT, that would not be good. We're going to pay our taxable income out, right? That will -- by then, we'll have a good sense of '12's taxable income, and our quarterly run rate for '12 will probably be outlined in that context as well. So obviously, it'll be probably higher than $0.80 per quarter, but at that point, we're still, we'll have a better sense of that by the end of the year.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got it, okay. And then, last question. On Opry, I'm looking in the supplemental share cost for the restoration, it's about $60 million. Is all of that out-of-pocket? Was there insurance proceeds that are coming to play as well, I mean, how do we think about that?", "David Simon", "Well, just -- we've actually worked very diligently and very hard with our lender. They're providing those funds, and we're suing Aon, who's been our broker for a number of years, unfortunately, has withheld the additional coverage that we think, and we know we're entitled to. And that litigation continues.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert McMillan with Standard & Poor's.", "Robert McMillan - S&P Equity Research", "Can you give me what percentage of your 2011, 2012 leasing activity has been completed?", "Richard Sokolov", "2011 is substantially done. 2012, we're probably about 35% completed already.", "Robert McMillan - S&P Equity Research", "And how is that compared with normal?", "Richard Sokolov", "We're a little bit ahead of where we've been historically over the last couple of years.", "Robert McMillan - S&P Equity Research", "And can you comment on what retail sectors are doing particularly well, and which ones are doing particularly poor, and which ones you're more optimistic about?", "Richard Sokolov", "The one that have shown better growth have been the sporting goods, jewelry, women's better apparel and accessories. Weaker areas, obviously, books, women's moderate and junior apparel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I got to say, I like the acquisition of the best asset in Albuquerque, which is my hometown, as it turns out. And I'm curious, beyond the obvious plans for the center itself. Across the street, there is kind of a defunct old regional mall asset. And then, across the other street, there's 1/3 tier general growth asset, that's a regional mall as well. And I'm wondering, if you're thinking beyond the center itself, maybe crossing one of the 2 streets in the future?", "David Simon", "Well, I think it's -- I think the -- it's not -- look, we've have not -- discussions with general growth, so I'm not --  we're not going to speak on that asset. But I think you do point out that there is potential on the other one, and we're cognizant of that asset and what the potential there is. But certainly, not the general growth asset, I mean, I have no comment on that, essentially.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. So you haven't talked, David, to the private guy that owns the old Winrock Center?", "David Simon", "Well, we're aware of what -- that could be an interesting situation, but it's too early at this point.", "Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. Because that's a great area, obviously, for a broader retail place, it seems like. Okay, second thing is, I'm curious, why did you say, you don't like to tier assets? That seems like from your guy's standpoint, obviously, you understand all the assets. From the analyst investor standpoint, it's usually helpful to see the kinds of stats that you threw out at the beginning of the call on a more defined and formal sort of basis. I'm curious why not put that tiering together?", "David Simon", "Look, I just believe that, to me, $1 of cash flow is $1 of cash flow, so and I just don't like, essentially sometimes, what it means internally, but it's not a big issue. I mean, we do it, we look at it, we'll give you data that we think it's important to understand, if we think the market is not appreciating what we've got. And we'll continue to do that, we can cut it 1,000 different ways. Our average is obviously, mean something because of the size of the company. So it's not -- our averages are not insignificant, because it's over a big broad-based. And you know math. You know how math works, right? So it's not just 20 assets that 3 or 4 or 5 could skew the results one way or another. So -- but the important thing is, look, tell us how you'd like it, we'll factor it in. But we've got a business to run internally, and I don't like to characterize assets by tiers, because the fact of the matter is, I want every asset we've got to be better and the best it can be, or we should let somebody else try and achieve that.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. Good. I got you. And then, did you guys look at that Niagara Falls outlet center that apparently Matridge has or is it [indiscernible]", "David Simon", "Yes. We're more focused on Torano [ph] than Buffalo, frankly. We do -- and again, I don't really know what the deal is, but there are reports that it's in the -- we don't see it necessarily as a top 25 outlet center. We've pretty good familiar with the outlets that are out there, but I'm sure they'll do fine with it, but our focus right now is Torano [ph], not Buffalo.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. All right. Great. And then last thing I had, Steve, I wasn't quite sure if you kind of hit on this, you might've, but percentage rent this quarter were up sharply, and certainly, well above what we had anticipated. And what was the reason for that, do you think?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Well, it could have been your anticipation.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "So that could have been the problem. Yes, indeed.", "Stephen Sterrett", "But, no. Rich, I think we're just seeing the benefit. I mean, obviously, percentage rents are tough to predict because you have tenants coming in and out of overage rent all the time. But the fact is, if you have the sales growth that we have now seeing for the last 4 or 5 quarters in a row, it has begun to manifest itself in higher percentage rates. It is as simple as that.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. So the -- what we saw in the second quarter could continue to some extent for the foreseeable future?", "Stephen Sterrett", "Depending on what your assumption is about sales growth going forward, sure.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Credit Suisse.", "Gautam Desai ", "It's Gautam Desai. A couple of questions on the international front. With the recent weakness in U.K. retailers, do you guys think like your dodged a bullet there?", "David Simon", "Well, look, we know what we're doing, whether we dodged a bullet or not, I don't know. We offered what we offered on Capital Shopping Centres, a price that we thought we could make work based upon our industry knowledge and history of past performance. They didn't consider it. I know that the stock.", "Operator", "Please standby, your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please standby.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "David Simon", "Sorry about that. I don't know if you heard the last part of my response but let me just repeat it. In terms of dodging the bullet on CSC, let me just say this, we all heard a price that they weren't interested in. The stock obviously has not gotten that price since we offered it. Our offer was subject to due diligence, but we felt comfortable in offering that, because we have the history of making acquisitions work, and -- but they were not interested. So that's really all I can say on that. I don't necessarily think we dodged the bullet. We're very comfortable in underwriting. We understood the U.K. market, that's why we thought they should have seriously considered our offers subject to due diligence. They chose not to. But had we done due diligence and felt comfortable with it, we would've made the deal work like we have every other deal.", "Gautam Desai ", "Good. Sounds good. And my last question is, what kind of demand are you seeing for international tenant expansion within the U.S.?", "David Simon", "Pretty good. In fact, one of the leaders is here, the last 2 days talking a lot of business with us. Rick and just -- but if -- I'd say, it's very positive.", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes. We're doing a lot of business with H&M, and they're literally, here right now. We're doing business with Desigual, Inglot, Cotton On, Aritzia, AllSaints, those are all international retailers that are looking to expand their footprint in the U.S. and we're getting the benefit of that.", "Operator", "This concludes our Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Thank you, everybody. We are very sorry for that technical glitch. We can blame that on David Contis, because he took our -- my technology room, for those of you who have visited Indianapolis, I gave him by office, so we're in a new room. And we'll, obviously, work this out. But have a great rest of the summer and take care. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for attending today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. The scope and breadth of our company can be best described by a high-level overview of our activities and accomplishments during the first few months of 2012. First of all, financial and operationally, let me just state that FFO was $1.82 per share, up 13% from the first quarter 2011. We exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.14. We have now met or exceeded expectations for 31 of the past 33 quarters. For our malls and Premium Outlets, comp NOI grew 5.7%, and you'll recall that our comp NOI for first quarter 2011 was up 2.3%. Tenant sales were up 11.2%. Both individually the malls and the Outlet portfolio were up double digits. Occupancy was up 60 basis points. Average rent per square foot was increased by 4.4%. Releasing spread was a positive 9.7% or $4.74 per square foot. ", "Now let me turn to transactions. As you know, we invested $2 billion in purchasing shares of Klepierre, the second largest owner of retail real estate in Continental Europe. With assets valued at a portfolio EUR 16.2 billion, we now own nearly 29% of the company. I'm Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and we control 3 of the 9 board seats. Our investment provides opportunity for significant value creation through exchanging operational best practices, creating synergy through our leasing and marketing efforts and the generation of ancillary revenues. We'll be actively involved in the Klepierre capital allocation decisions, including allocation of capital amongst the various assets and the countries in which they do business and we'll be providing guidance on investment and divestiture decisions and balance sheet management. We view this investment as having significant optionality for us given the countries in which Klepierre operates, the large number of assets that it owns and manages and the successful operational platform that it possesses. From a capital point of view, it essentially replaces our previous European investments, which were liquidated at a significant gain to our shareholders over the past couple of years. ", "Now let me turn to Mills. As you know, we acquired the interest of our joint venture partner in 26 of 36 assets of The Mills Limited Partnership for $1.5 billion. Transaction completed at a good cap rate for us and reinforce that this has been a good deal for us and our partner, Farralon. We believe there is upside in the assets with growing NOI, and we'll continue to pursue many of the redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio. At the end of the day, both of these transactions will be immediately accretive to FFO. To fund Klepierre and Mills transaction, we sold unsecured notes and issued common equity. We sold $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes in 3 tranches. Rates on the 3 tranches of notes were the lowest ever achieved by a REIT by an average of 76 basis points. We issued 9.1 million common shares at a price of $137 per share, and our rating of A-, A3 were affirmed by all 3 rating agencies. In addition, we weren't done with that. We acquired another 25% ownership interest in Del Amo Fashion Center where our major redevelopment is in the planning stage, and we sold our interest in Gallerie Commerciali in Italy at a gain to our investment. ", "Development activity, if I may turn to. We successfully reopened the fully restored Opry Mills to a great public reception. Space at the center is approximately 90% leased and committed. In addition, we started construction on 4 new Premium Outlet Centers, all scheduled to open in 2013: Shisui in Japan, our ninth Premium Outlet in Japan; Phoenix, serving the greatest Phoenix and Scottsdale areas; Toronto, which actually the groundbreaking was this week, our first upscale Outlet Center in Canada; and Busan in Korea, our third Premium Outlet in Korea. In addition, we signed agreements to develop Premium Outlet Centers in Brazil with the well-known and well-respected BR Malls, and in China, with the well-known and well-respected Bailian Group. And we're focused on a site adjacent to the Disney Shanghai. Continued construction on 2 new Premium Outlets that will open in the U.S. this year, Merrimack, New Hampshire and south of Houston, Texas. We continued construction on 25 renovation and expansion projects in the U.S. and in Japan with 2012 and 2013 completion dates, and we continue to expect our share of development spend to approximate $1 billion in 2012, '13 and '14, respectively. ", "Let me turn to the dividends. As you now know, we've announced our third consecutive increase in quarterly dividend from $0.95 to $1 per share. Our dividend is now fully 25% higher than it was one year ago at this time. In addition, we are very pleased and honored to be added to the S&P 100 Index in the first quarter, joining the likes of Nike, Starbucks, Honeywell and DuPont, all well-known companies where equity market caps are comparable to ours. ", "Guidance. We increased the top end of our 2012 FFO guidance. Initially, as you know, in February, we had guidance of $7.20 to $7.30. Our range now includes a range from $7.50 per share to $7.60 per share, so we increased both the top end and the bottom end of our guidance. Factors contributing to this increase: essentially stronger operating performance and recent investment activity. ", "Now let me just conclude, and we can talk about any questions you may have. Our portfolio of high-quality irreplaceable assets continues to deliver strong results and is second to none in our industry. Just to illustrate that, I know the size sometimes of our portfolio is somewhat overwhelming, and all of our activity obviously is hard to appreciate sometimes. But let me just put this in perspective. We have in our portfolio of assets 12 that generate over $1,000 per square foot. Our top 30 U.S. average -- assets average over $1,000 per square foot in sales and provide 1/3 of our SPG NOI. Our top 50 U.S. average $886 per square foot in sales and provide 1/2 of our SPG share of NOI. And importantly, our top 100 assets average $700 per square foot and provide 3/4 of our NOI. Needless to say, we're off to a good start and active, and we're ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Given GGP's recent deal with Sears to buy back some boxes and leases, I'm wondering if you're having any discussions with the retailer to do the same? And of the 119 Sears boxes at your malls, are there any that you would specifically point to where you would say we could unlock pretty significant value at that mall if we got the box back?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we're not going to get into discussions that we have with our individual retailers. We have a good relationship with Sears. We expect, over time, for a number of those properties to be reclaimed or redeveloped, but nothing really to report beyond that. And look, we do think there's value there. We'll be conservative in how we value the real estate and how we look at it. But I think, over time, it will provide an opportunity for the company.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "We've heard recently from some specialty retailers that lease negotiations for Class B malls have started to move in favor of the landlords again. Can you discuss your ability to raise rents at B and B- types of assets? And if I think about your rent spreads being 10% across the portfolio, how would that break out between sort of the Class A stuff and the Class B stuff?", "David E. Simon", "One thing we don't like to do is go through Class A and Class B. We're very focused on increasing the cash flow in all of our assets. Obviously, the ones that have higher sales per square foot, we're able to drive a little bit better bargain. We look to win-win for the retailers. We're doing a lot of business with retailers throughout the portfolio. Our rent spreads -- our averages mean a lot because they're not -- with a portfolio of our size, we can't have one particular center rollover or one center doing so much more business that it's driving the statistics of every other at the portfolio. The business has firmed up, and we're pleased with where it's headed and where it's going. Retailers are looking for growth, so I'd say things are all pretty good. Rick, you want to add anything?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I would just underline David's point. If you look in our 8-K and see where our renovations are and where we're adding anchors and department stores, it's throughout the portfolio, and we're increasing market share across the board and that is enabling us to drive that pricing. And to underline -- quantifying David's point on the square footage, when you look at our sales and our statistics, that's on the basis of almost 60 million square feet. So there is no way for outliers to influence that. It's a broad operational trend that we're reflecting.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then just lastly, how much capital do you envision investing in outlets in China and Brazil over the next 5 years? And what kind of projected returns are you forecasting?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, it's safe to say that we would -- every international development that we've done in the Outlet business has had double-digits return in the 15%-on-average range. We would expect that that's kind of the hurdle we're shooting for. In any event, we would expect those to be at least double digits. Brazil, generally, we think the market can support in the 10 to 14 opportunities initially. Cost of those will, on average, be in the $100-million-plus range. As you know, we are partners 50-50 with BR Malls. That gives you the scope of the situation. In China, right now, our focus is on one particular development and that we're going through the numbers on that. It's a little bit early to give you kind of the scope of magnitude of that, but we think it's a great site having visited it personally. It's a great opportunity for the company. The demand from the retailers is very strong. China is -- you got to be extra cautious there. We've had an experience where we learned a lot in China. But generally, I think it will be consistent with the build in what we've done in Korea and what we've done in Japan. Cost of construction, land values are all kind of the same there, but I don't want to pin those numbers down just yet.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Jeff Spector from Merrill Lynch.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-up questions on Brazil. David, did I hear you say you had 10 to 14 potential sites?", "David E. Simon", "Over -- yes, over a period of time, correct.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I'm not as familiar with all of the different markets in Brazil. I mean, is there any change in the site criteria? Or are you saying in your first analysis you feel that there are 10 to 14 sites that really fit that Premium Outlet-type criteria, density-wise?", "David E. Simon", "Correct, that's correct. And we've got currently -- so that's over an extended period of time. We've got one site identified in S\u00e3o Paulo. We're not in the position to disclose that yet. If all goes according to plan, we have the chance of opening that in late '13, but more likely early '14. And then we're currently evaluating another 4 additional sites. So that 10 to 4 (sic) 14 is over an extended period of time, but we've got 1. We're very close to moving forward on and then another 4 of that are further along than that.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And for now in Brazil, just sticking with the outlets or you're still looking at mall opportunities, full price?", "David E. Simon", "This is the primary focus right now.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then switching to your investment in Klepierre, you -- I think you carefully said that, right now, you're actively involved on the balance sheet divestitures. You didn't talk about operations at all.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I did mention that. You may not have picked it up. I mean, we've had some very good beginning discussions with the senior team there. We've owned the stock for 6 weeks, so you have to put it in perspective that their senior management team is actually coming here next week. But we're going to coordinate certain retail leasing at the Shopping Center Convention coming up in May in the U.S. -- Shopping Center Convention. So it's early days on that front, but it's safe to say that there are 3 or 4 areas of focus for us: operational synergies; leasing synergies; cash flow enhancement, all of that in one category; capital allocation in another category. Along with that is what assets should they be involved in? Where should the focus be? What countries our long-term holds, then balance sheet management and then investment divestiture decision. So all of those are kind of the 3 or 4 buckets that where we're focused on, both as directors and as shareholders, and the cooperation has been excellent. There's nothing so far that, in our short involvement, that has caused any concern for us. Look, Europe has got some macro headwinds. We knew that going in. The fact of the matter is, these opportunities surface when the going is tough, but we're in this for the long haul. And we think it's a very good platform that we can help continue to move in the right direction, and actually have bottom line impact improvement on. But that's going to take time.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And are you personally spending a lot of time on that investment?", "David E. Simon", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Going forward? Okay. And then my last -- I'm sorry.", "David E. Simon", "No. Sure. I mean, I'm Chairman of the Board. And like I said, yes, we're very involved, not just me, but my team as well.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question on development. Anything -- any new potential sites on the full-price side, mall side, the Lifestyle center side for you?", "David E. Simon", "No.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "U.S.", "David E. Simon", "I'm looking at Rick and the answer -- we're just making sure we're both saying no. The answer is no, not really. We think the returns, in order to really induce the full-price guys with the cost of development, are just too skinny still. Demand is still not quite there. And the fact of the matter is, with our redevelopment pipeline, we got great stuff going on, I mean, really good stuff going on. And with our development or our Premium Outlet development, we are under construction. Let me just reinforce this. We are under construction in Phoenix. We are under construction in Toronto. We are under construction in Korea and Japan. We're looking at a couple other areas. We're busy, and these are all very good returns that we are building new too. So at this point, why chase full-price retail at lower returns when we got our plate full of assets.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Michael. I'm here with Quentin Velleley. David, I just wanted to start, you think about Klepierre, $2 billion, but you're an $80 billion enterprise today, so its 2.5% of your asset base, and it is taking up a lot of your time. You've been to Europe twice in the last month. How do you sort of balance something that's a smaller part today of the enterprise and driving value for the other 97.5% of assets? And then taking it one step further, you own 30% of the entity today. You're in this for the long haul. You obviously want to see a lot of improvements. The price you're going to have to pay for the other 70% if you do want to consolidate could be meaningfully higher benefiting Klepierre shareholders rather than Simon shareholders. I'm just -- how do you sort of balance all this?", "David E. Simon", "Well, just on the first point, Michael, that's what I do, okay? So the one thing that I think amazes folks given the scope of this company is that, that's what we do. Rick looks at whether we're getting market value on a new Gap lease. I mean, as weird as it sounds, that's just what we do. So I still think a $2 billion investment ought to warrant my serious attention. So that's just what we do. We've got -- we've added a few people to help. We added Contis. We added Fivel so we could leverage a little bit, my time and Rick's time to do it. But that's what we do. We sweat the details. That's all we know how to do, and we don't see changing from that. And I view -- look, the thing about Klepierre, it's got a portfolio. Its share of this is not quite that. It's about EUR 14 billion. But the portfolio that it overseas is EUR 16 billion. That's a big opportunity for us. And Europe is in a state of flux, which is an even better opportunity for us ultimately to reinforce our company's position as a global brand, and there are great benefits to being global. Many of our -- if you look at our peer group in the S&P 100, and I just read you a few names, they're all global. Our retailers are going global. And I think it's great, great opportunity. It's a great potential platform for us to really have a significant presence there and create kind of a sister or fully integrated Simon company over there. We've never had that opportunity. I don't know that this can be that, but it's certainly worth the opportunity. And I think coming in at below NAV, even with all the macro headwinds, I don't see how we'd lose. But it's possible we do, but we don't. But when I go through this list of companies in our similar cap range, News Corp, Nike, Colgate-Palmolive, Lilly, Starbucks, Ford, Disney, Union -- well, Union Pacific isn't because it's all railroad, Boeing, they're all international global companies. And I think it's important for us to be in that spot. And so look, Flowers, one of the great value financial investors there is, is moving to London because of European opportunity. So this is a great platform. We'll see where it develops. It potentially could go -- it could end here. On the other hand, we could take this investment and make it something special. And I have no problem as long as our shareholders are rewarded along that process and sharing the wealth.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Quentin here, just a question on the outlets in Brazil. With U.S. fashion merchandiser sort of 3x to 5x more expensive in Brazil, how do you expect the international retailers that are going into your outlets, how do you expect them to, I guess, compete given the improved U.S. visa process and also the improvements in Brazilians' ability to purchase over the Internet?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, there are more and more international retailers landing in Brazil and dealing with the tariffs. And certainly from a customer point of view, if we can land those tenants and deliver more value to the customer, then -- that's why I think we feel like these outlets will be very successful. It will not have the percentage of international grounds like China, Japan or Korea will because of that particular issue. While we think there's enough there -- and with the Brazilian retailers as well to populate those centers. And there's been one kind of outlet that's been built there and it was successful. I think you're going to have to go small, do this in phases. But I think, over time, you'll have more international penetration.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Just switching to Europe, maybe if you could just comment on the health of the hotter markets in Europe. How do you think they're going to change their business models and evolve to some of the challenges they're facing?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think that -- look, it depends on the retailer. I mean, we were, as you know, partners with Ocean and their business model has been very successful and they continue to do very good business. Carrefour, as you know, is a big partner, so to speak, with Klepierre. And they've gone through some fits and starts in terms of where they want to go. I think they've got new leadership. It sounds like they are back to focusing on being very price competitive and that, we think, will drive traffic, and we think ultimately will help us with the Galleries, which we own. And it's very interesting, Quentin, just you know because you got a funny accent. But the hypermarkets there, they're disappointed when they do EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million, whereas if we have a department store or anybody that did  EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million in our shopping center, we'd be very thrilled. So it's all relative. I have all the confidence in the world with where Carrefour is going that they'll continue to be a very worldwide class retailer.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. So just one follow-up with some funny accent. Just maybe a quick one on The Mills. Just in terms of how you're organizing information right now. A number of The Mills properties were moved into other operating properties. Is there anything we need to read into that?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think what you would read into that is that we're probably not long-term owners of the 3 assets that are still owned by TMLP. One of those, actually we're evaluating that and that is we're hopeful that, over time, we can reposition that asset, but a couple of them were probably not long-term owners.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. In regards to your ability to market to market those assets, is it a -- timing and ability to market those assets, what do you think that would be?", "David E. Simon", "I would think it would certainly be clarified in the not-too-distant future. About 12 months or so.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and thank you also for the sales disclosure. In regards to the decision there on the sales front, it includes the outlets, is that correct?", "David E. Simon", "Yes.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. if we were to exclude outlets from, let's say, the top 100 category, what would happen to the sales productivity there?", "David E. Simon", "It probably wouldn't matter all that much, but I don't have that in front of me. But I'd give you a sense of this. It's probably a 75 to 25 split, roughly, to give you a sense of order of magnitude, out of 100. Next call, we can get really specific, but I don't have it entirely in front of me. But I think that gives you the general nature of it.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So just sticking with that top 100 is 75% of your NOI. Any thoughts given the B mall sales that have taken place by some of your peers that you might be interested in culling the, kind of the other 120 there or 25% of the NOI making any efforts beyond kind of the -- kind of single-asset-type brokers?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think the good news is that, that market seems to be firming up. There's more players in it. And so I think, historically, Paul, we've always wanted to call the portfolio. As you know, that's been a relatively tough exercise. But with now Starwood hasn't closed yet, but assuming it closes, you've got a couple other players out there that are looking to invest. I would expect us to continue to play in that game. We did sell one mall at the end of -- it really actually closed at the very beginning of this year, Gwinnett Mall in Atlanta. So we are -- we would expect to do that. I think there are more players there and that's the good news. We're trying to understand what their strategy is going forward, and I'm sure we'll, over time, continue to cull the portfolio to some extent.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And if I can just go back to Klepierre. As you look at kind of the leasing platforms and you mentioned some kind of the global element to the retailers, I mean, do you think, having the time you had spent with them and then looking at their portfolio of tenants, do you think there's more opportunity to bring their tenants here and your tenants there? Or given your express[ph] strength in Europe, you think you've kind of already been well on top of that and it's not that incremental from here?", "David E. Simon", "I actually -- I think that probably the more likely opportunity is to bring U.S. retailers there. And as you walk the malls in Continental Europe, they're not -- they're okay. They're not greatly merchandised. I think it possesses a great opportunity for a number of our retailers. Again, that takes time, and there are some that are making inroads there. But generally, I would think the opportunity will be more U.S. to Europe. But, and Rick can comment on that, but there are also opportunities, as you know, for retailers there to come here. And they're actually making progress to get U.K. retailers. As an example, Primark, which is a well-known, very good U.K. retailer to add to the European retail mix there. So I think it will be a little bit of everything. But I do feel that our U.S. retailers do think Europe is an opportunity for them. Rick, you want to?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And I would say to you just on the other way, if you like, there's no doubt that the relationships that we've created in dealing with the H&Ms and the ZARAs and the Legos are going to stand up some very good stead because we're just now an incrementally more important part of their global footprint, which is what we have always aspired to be.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And just lastly, sticking with the Europe. I mean, how do you think about other opportunities for investment now on the continent given you have a minority stake and you might have a different capital position, but how would you handle the kind of the conflicts with looking at outlets or looking at other opportunities that come up via Klepierre or independently?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, the outlet business, Klepierre has no involvement in. So I don't view that as any particular conflict. I think it gives us a great opportunity. There are so many options on the table for us now that we've got -- have an investment in a very fine company like Klepierre. Other way, they're very good developers. They build great product. I encourage you to look at some of the stuff that they've built. I mean they're a first-class organization. We think we can respectfully add to that, but they're not -- they're damn good on their own. And I think as we look at opportunities, we'll sit with them and say, okay, what makes sense. So it could be within Klepierre. It could be in a joint venture with Klepierre or it could be completely on our own. But we certainly want to see Klepierre, our investment in Klepierre appreciate. I mean that's the #1 goal. And I just will say, on the outlet side, that we -- they have no presence in that. That's really not something that they're really going to do, and I would view that as kind of a separate path for us to look at what our opportunities there are in that sector.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "It is pretty telling of a French organization to appoint an American to be chairman, so that's a pretty strong statement in and of itself. Question on -- you guys took a major stake in Klepierre and yet when you went to Brazil, you just did a JV with BR Malls. Can you just speak about the opportunity or your thoughts on taking a stake in BR Malls? I mean, speaking to people, there's a lot of respect for BR Malls that the Brazilian market seems to still attract a lot of long-term interest. So sort of curious why you opted for just a more of an asset JV rather than more of a corporate JV the way you did with Klepierre?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we really didn't talk about that too much, and Brazil is -- I think we want to get our feet wet in Brazil, do it a little bit more methodically. The values there, calling up a tremendous amount, and BR Malls is a big company, okay. And then you get into the currency risk, though it seems that their currency seems to only appreciate versus the dollar, but put that aside. So there's lots of issues there, but we really never got into that kind of dialogue. At this point, we're focused just on building out the outlet, the platform with them.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So it sounds like it's more of a learning curve whereas you've had many years of European experience, you want to build that experience in Brazil? Is that...", "David E. Simon", "And I think so, and look, remember we had exposure in Europe. And I almost view this as kind of replacing what we had. Yes, we put a little bit more money in it, but with a better company with better growth, long-term growth prospects even though the world is a little wacky there, a proven organization, lots of optionality on where to take that organization, a way to hedge our currency investment because we can borrow in euros. So there's all sorts of math associated with it that works a little bit easier than in Brazil. Just a quick response. I mean, it's a very complicated question, but just a quick response to your question.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then separate, and along the same lines, your comments, David, were about China were rather tempered about just focusing on one site. Just sort of curious, especially given the recent political scandal over there. Has that made you any more cautious or what is driving your hesitancy about China?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's obviously just a big, big market and a very complicated market, but what's driving us, it's very simple. The international brands are just -- they're kicking ass there. And just -- if we can get an outlet built in the right location, we're very confident we can lease it up. And we have, we think, partnered with a good person to partner with. But we still have to prove the math, prove the ability to make the numbers work and all that. And it's just a big complicated market. And they take -- when they like something, they just build it, as you know, right? So supply and demand sometimes is not as thoughtful there as it might be in other more mature markets. So we just got to make sure that we can make money doing these things. So I think doing 1 or 2, thereabouts, is probably the right way to go for us right now.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Rick, I guess, just first question, as you're talking to kind of the larger tenants, the Targets, the Costcos and the like, I know you guys have done a lot. You've replaced a lot of department stores and anchors and added. I'm just wondering how much more activity do you think there is from them and, I guess, as you look through kind of the top 100, how many more assets can you sort of touch, meaning, how much more sort of inventory do you think you can sort of touch and put -- and are these tenants also looking at kind of the bottom 100 properties or are they really focused on sort of the top 100?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "In fact, it's throughout the portfolio. And if you just keep track of what we've done in the 8-K, this quarter, we've got 51 anchors that are being added throughout the various platforms, and that's up from the 30 that we've listed in the fourth quarter '11. And on top of that, we're on another 38 anchors. Target is still looking for opportunities. We're adding them at Coddingtown. We're adding them at South Hills in Pittsburgh. And we have a number of other opportunities that we're discussing with them, but also with a whole range of other potential users. We've added Arhaus Furniture. We opened a new Lord & Taylor. We're opening Macy's at Gurnee. We're opening Last Call Neiman Marcus at Ontario. So it's across the board. And we're working with supermarkets. We're opening Fresh Market at The Falls. We're opening Wegmans in Montgomery Mall in Montgomery County in Philadelphia, Earth Fare in Hamilton. So we're across the board and there's still a great deal of interest and we have opportunities because in a lot of instances, we're moving out weaker anchors and replacing them with stronger ones.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it does seem like it's kind of permeating down into kind of the B mall product as well?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, it's throughout the portfolio. Again, we don't like to categorize A, Bs and Cs. It's throughout the portfolio. When you look at the scope of what we've been doing and just we've identified every one, you can see it's throughout across the quality spectrum.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Dave, I guess I'll bring up the question because I asked Bobby as well. But just in St. Louis, I mean, I realize the outlet business has been fairly competitive. You've certainly won your fair share of battles in different markets. I'm just wondering kind of what your thoughts are in St. Louis. And is that a situation where only one project gets built, and is it just kind of a race to the -- just kind of the start line here?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'm surprised it took that long to bring up. But look, St. Louis is a good opportunity to build  an outlet center. I'll just say this, when we get approvals, we will build an outlet center in St. Louis. We don't have approvals yet. We expect them in the near future, but we will build there. And we're very confident in our ability to lease it and provide a very good return for our shareholders. So we've got to get approvals. That's the only road block that I see in terms of our building the center.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And if I'm not mistaken, I believe there's something on May 9. Is that correct, when you're supposed to get some final approvals, or is it further out than that?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, let me -- I'll turn that to Rick. He can briefly give you, but we've got -- we're very confident we're going to get approvals, but we still have to finalize that. And then when we do, we're building. So go ahead, Rick, you want to?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "So there is the hearing on the 9th and the final hearing is on May 21. And then we can start the development at the site.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess, David, just lastly, on just kind of other outlets within the U.S. market. I mean, kind of what does the shadow inventory look like or pipeline or potential deals that you might be looking at?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Well, look, just briefly Phoenix, as you know, is under construction where, Rick? 60...", "Richard S. Sokolov", "60% committed.", "David E. Simon", "60% committed, so that's all systems go. Toronto, there's been a lot of discussion. We're wildly excited about that. That's under construction.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "60%.", "David E. Simon", "60% committed.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And announced The Bay.", "David E. Simon", "And announced The Bay, which is a well-known department store there. We think that's important because that will facilitate a lot of the wholesale accounts, so it's all kind of going according to plan. St. Louis and Phoenix both announced a Saks' Off 5th as part of our new development there. We have one site in Florida, which we're finishing approvals there. I'm afraid to didn't mention the city because there'll be 6 guys on sites, so I've got to refrain to do that. But needless to say, we are really excited about that. And that could actually start, Rick, don't you think this year, maybe?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes, yes. That could start in late this year. And we also have Merrimack Middle East over by Dubai. It's opening on June 14 and it's 100% leased. And we have Texas City that's opening in October. And that's substantially leased and what gets lost...", "David E. Simon", "Yes, go ahead, that's where I was going.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "In all the expansions that we're doing in some of the -- that's outlet centers in the world. The outlet -- Premium Outlets is under construction, opening in June of next year. Chicago Premium Outlets, we're expanding. Desert Hills Premium Outlets is starting next month. We are expanding Orlando Premium Outlets, down by Disney to third quarter this year. We're expanding Woodbury. And we're expanding Las Vegas - North Downtown, and that's starting in October of this year. Well, those 6 expansions combined, there are probably 2 or 3 additional new products adding square footage as the most productive outlet centers pretty much in the world.", "David E. Simon", "We've got -- we're working closely with the town, but Woodbury is really -- could be really exciting. It's the best outlet in the world. And what we're thinking about doing there working, obviously, closely with the town. But assuming we make progress and get some approvals there, I think we take that asset up to yet another level.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "This is Ki Bin. Just going back to your acquisition of Klepierre and going back to your comments about corporate level synergies -- not synergies, but sharing best practices and of that sort. I'm guessing the brainpower would shift more from you to them in terms of expertise and best practices. So how do you get compensated for that given that they still technically owning an equity investment and not close to any kind merger [ph]?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me say this, we are never too proud to learn from anyone. And in fact, they're a very accomplished company, so I would expect us to learn a lot from them. And I think that's absolutely part of the order. I mean, part of our investment philosophy is we're going to learn a lot from them in terms of how they run the business and operate. And it's all part of being a global company in that you take a little bit of everything that you learn across the world and you make everything you have across the world a little bit better, and that can drive the needle. So I would hope, and I would expect that they could actually show us a few things here. So that's very important that I say that. And at the end of the day, if we can add value there, that's fine too because our shareholders will benefit from our investment. And I mean, that's just part of -- it is a little bit risky to go into Europe right now, so we had to weigh that in a sense against taking on the whole enchilada and what's the best way for us from a capital allocation point of view. So those are the trade-offs. And I think we're satisfied today kind of where we're at.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "I know at a 30% stake, you're still far from an M&A, but is there any sharing of personnel?", "David E. Simon", "At this point, no, but we do have the ability to add a senior management person to the management board there. And I think that, over time, as we assess what the areas where we could be most beneficial, we'll figure out what that -- who that person might be. And I think that will develop over the next few months. So I do think there will be the opportunity there. We do have our Vice President of International Operations basically coordinating and liaising, I think is the word, right, our activities there. He'll be in the office there, so we would hope to have some input on that kind of basis.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "And just to -- if you clarify one point, I know it's a $2 billion equity investment, but the overall size of the investment is closer to over $4 billion on Klepierre. So could you actually comment on the FFO yield on investment?", "David E. Simon", "I don't know where you get the -- we look at it as a $2 billion investment.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Oh, I'm saying if you include the leverage of the company.", "David E. Simon", "Well, we don't look at it that way. When we're an equity investor, we have $2 billion at risk. We don't have $4 billion at risk, so I'd argue that completely with you. But let's put that aside. Your question, again, I lost it.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "It's back to the FFO yield accretion.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, you can do the math. I mean, it's a public company. But it is accretive, certainly, to lower yield given where we -- what the multiple we bought it at versus our multiple and where our cost of funding was for the deal.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Are you hedging this in anyway, this investment?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, we have hedged. Steve, how much have we hedged?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "David, we left $1 billion U.S. out on our line dominated in euros, so we're 50% hedged on our equity investment.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And does the prospect of President Hollande sit you [ph] with any terror? I mean, you did make references to the uncertainty, but I think the prospect of a socialist President of France is perhaps a little larger in the...", "David E. Simon", "You know what, look, why is that different than the U.S., right? So...", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Well, I have heard specifically, David, that there has been talk around the firm -- the French REIT structure coming under attack?", "David E. Simon", "No, absolutely not. Look, I don't think that, that -- when you look at the properties and how their merchandise is mixed, I'm not -- I don't think that changes the consumer behavior. What's going to change consumer behavior is where the economy goes and whether that's better under Hollande or Sarkozy is up for debate. I'm certainly not in the position to say who's better at what. But what fascinates me about Europe and what they're going through is the one thing that I will say is that with respect to Europe, at least they're tackling their deficit problems. David, you're very familiar with what's going on in the U.K. You can certainly argue it's too much or too soon or however they're doing it, but we're in complete denial here.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "We have the world-reserved currency, which allows politicians to behave as they do here.", "David E. Simon", "Sure. But at some point, that changes. So look, I'm not losing sleep about the French elections, and in fact, nor the U.S. elections in a sense that I think the economies of both can overcome bad politics. Look at the -- we could argue about the level of recovery, but the fact of the matter is you can't keep the American business environment and the American entrepreneur down. We want to grow, we will grow. And look, I don't view that the French economy all that different.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Back on a more, perhaps, mundane, you've raised the dividend 3 consecutive quarters and that's obviously been pretty impressive. I know it's hard to pin down your tax liabilities and such like as we go forward. Is it reasonable to think we're going to get this every quarter now?", "David E. Simon", "Well, at some point, not every quarter. We're still chasing our taxable income. So the answer is, at some point, we'll catch up. But I shouldn't really say more than that, other than at some point it will -- we're still chasing it. At some point, we'll catch up, but we're still chasing it.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "I mean, is it any way possible to characterize the growth in the dividend relative to the FFO? I mean, I know it's probably too nefarious at this point to do that. But if you would degrade your FFO by, say, 10%, growth in the dividend is going to be the order of 12% or 13% in the most general terms?", "David E. Simon", "I mean, there's a lot that goes into it, especially with asset composition changing. But put that aside, I mean the fact is, our earnings are really growing and our dividends really got to grow.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "It's going to grow faster, okay.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It's Steve. There clearly is a correlation between your dividend growth and your FFO growth. It's not a perfect correlation because, as an example, in an acquisition, we may get a step up in assets, which allows more depreciation expense. So you may not have as much taxable income growth as you do FFO growth, but there is a high correlation.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just actually focusing on the core multiple portfolio. Your sales have been growing double digits quarter after quarter, yet the rent spreads, they're strong but still aren't back to where they were a few years ago. And it's still an uncertain world and you have some tenants downsizing. But what point, given the sales productivity, can you say to the tenants, \"Sorry, we're going to demand rents to reflect the sales progress,\" and see that acceleration in the rent spreads?", "David E. Simon", "Rick, you want to?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes. There are a couple of things that are relevant in evaluating the spreads. One, if you look at the growth in our average rent, it has been going up considerably every quarter. Secondly, we are building into our leases annual increases in rent. If you go back historically, before we did that, when a lease expired, you had a much lower base rent because we weren't getting consistent guaranteed bumps in minimum rent over the term of the lease. And that has been a major advantage for us in order to take the risk of tenant performance out of our financial matrix. And when you look at the spreads that we're having, build that in, it's been a considerable benefit.", "David E. Simon", "And I would -- look, Nate, I would also just add that, look, sales are important, but it -- there is also, I mean, let's face it, everything is going well, we're running the business better. You can always get better, but there's still a number of retailers that are having margin pressure or comp sales pressures. And that puts pressure on our business and so that's why the spreads aren't -- not everybody in the retail world is hitting on all cylinders. And they may have margin pressures which puts pressure. We want them in the center or we don't have backups right away. So there's still -- obviously, our average is really important because of the size and they give you a real good indication. But the reason it's not $8 or $10 is because there is a handful of retailers that are important in the portfolio that are under margin pressures or sales pressures. And instead of just telling them, \"Get lost,\" we're still working with them as they try to improve their business.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then just quickly on the Halton Hills. You've only announced one tenant. Can you give us maybe a little more detail on it?", "David E. Simon", "Sure. Rick will list you some tenants.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes. We're basically 60% committed now and leases that are going, Banana, Brooks, Cole Haan, Converse, Gap, Levi, Nike, Puma. We talked about The Bay, Under Armour, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Michael Kors. It's going to be an outstanding selection of retailers and we're going to create what is going to be the unique Premium Outlet environment in that market.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So given that tenant mix, another competing center perhaps a few miles closer to Toronto you think people will be willing to drive past to get to yours?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I'm not going to really comment on this other potential site other than to say there are a lot of merits to our site and, Nate, we're opening next year, okay. We don't have to get any approvals, we're done, we're under construction and we'll lease the center, so I don't know what else I can tell you other than that. And you can draw your own conclusions. We're done, we're moving and we have no worries.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line Ben Yang from KBW.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "David, going back to your comments on the new players making a push into the mall industry. I'm just curious what you think these newcomers might mean to the small industry longer term given that it's an oligopoly that obviously benefits from fewer, rather than more owner-operators?", "David E. Simon", "I missed part of your -- can you just restate it because I just -- the connection wasn't that good.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just obviously private equity trying to make -- increase their presence in the mall space. It's an oligopoly. Fewer owners are better than more owners, and I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what this might mean to the industry longer term?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I certainly don't use oligopoly as any -- by any stretch of imagination. I mean, retail, if you want to hear my -- I'll save you a lot of diatribe here, but retail is really competitive. Malls compete with all sorts of retail, online, strip centers, Lifestyle centers. So that may be your view of the world. It's not mine because we -- it is really a competitive industry across the board and it's tough, very tough. So the more the people want to come into the business and put capital into it, I think the better for us. I'm not sure I answered your question. Look, at the end of the day, operating your real estate is -- the key to success in retail real estate primarily is to contract at the sale [ph] office. Has been operating it better versus buying it, right, and then finding the right time that cap rates are x and waiting for cap rates to move in your favor. That's not always the case. But generally, unlike office where it's really more of a potential timing where it can help. So the answer for a lot of those folks is just how do they operate it? And can they operate it effectively? And if they can, maybe they'll make money, which I think is -- which is good. It attracts more capital. Institutionally, and Steve can comment on it, I mean, institutionally, the level of interest from deep money institutional investors in high-quality retail assets has never been higher and price is secondary because they look at the returns -- I shouldn't say price, going in yield is a secondary consideration. It's really the growth of the NOI. And I mean, it's never been higher, frankly. But again, the need for us to look at that source of capital is not critical, but it's never been higher.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But I guess the difference this time is that unlike a passive attention [indiscernible] that gives you guys money. These guys are trying to actual platforms to run their businesses, but that is helpful. But just moving along, you also made comments that the B malls are firming up. I think Rick mentioned retailers are generally opening up across the board. You're obviously always trying to cull the low end of the portfolio. But does this make you maybe more or less inclined to sell your B malls, maybe taking advantage of mall buyers out there, but maybe at the risk of missing the recovery in the B mall space?", "David E. Simon", "No. Look, I think we're good enough to know what we believe in, in the future and what is better in other people's hands in terms of just a poor allocation of our human resources. And sometimes, it's okay to sell and let somebody redevelop it just because we've got enough to do and we want to allocate our resources elsewhere. So I think we can handle that issue in particular. And I said I like the fact that there's more people coming into that market, might lead to a few more sales from us over a period of time.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "David, on Klepierre, can you buy or build something together in a joint venture given that you guys sit on the board of Klepierre?", "David E. Simon", "Sure. I mean, it would have to be subject to approval of their board without us participating. But certainly, sure. I wouldn't say -- yes, absolutely. I mean, if we had a development or acquisition and we could certainly partner. It would have to be approved by the board without our involvement, but sure.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, all right. Good. And then, on Del Amo, that has always struck me as very good real estate. I used to live out there in that area. And yet nothing has ever -- nothing seems to ever come on that asset.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, we know, we know.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I mean, what are you guys thinking there? I mean, what is the plan? You said you were working on a big redevelopment there. What is the idea?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'll let Rick start. But you're 100% right. It's been a source of frustration for us. I mean, we were working on some plans when we bought Mills in April of '07, right. Those got derailed by the '09 crunch. They're back up and running. We have real confidence in that. Otherwise, we wouldn't have bought. That was ahead of our bigger deal with Farralon. Rick, this is Contis's baby. He's not here to tell you about it because it might take 10 minutes. But Rick can give you the highlights of what we're doing, and we would hope definitively to really start this thing next year. But let Rick, can give you the high level.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Just a couple of bullet points. One, you can change everything about a property other than where it is, and it's in a great, great market that is really underserved by fashion retailing. We've got interest from a couple of fashion anchors. We've got great support from the city and we're looking at a total redevelopment of the property that would substantially change its character by keeping some of the existing anchors, replacing some of the anchors, adding anchors and the best thing is we've got substantial demand from retailers and restaurants. So there's a lot to do. We're spending a great deal of time on it. We have people based out there that are working on it on a constant basis, and we're very optimistic we're going to be able to do it.", "David E. Simon", "And the only thing I'd say, given the size of the property, it's going to be in a couple of phases. But the first phase we would hope to start in '13.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So this is probably a few hundred million dollars in total, something like that?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I think that's probably right.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And do you think we'll get that fashion department store that the previous CEO of Mills promised us about 6 or 7 years ago?", "David E. Simon", "We'll let you know.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, good. And then a couple quick questions for Steve. Were there any acquisition expenses this quarter? I mean, I can't figure out where they might be. I thought they might be in G&A, but I didn't see anything in there.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "They were not, Rich. Under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, when you make an equity investment, you capitalize those expenses, so they've been capitalized as part of the investment in Klepierre line.", "David E. Simon", "And I'd just say we have de minimis cost on that Farallon deal that we just put in other expenses.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the percentage rents in the joint venture jumped pretty significantly, and I'm assuming that's because there's more percentage rents in the Klepierre portfolio. Is that right?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "There were no -- we did not record any results associated with Klepierre in the first quarter, Rich. So that's organic activity related to the portfolio.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So why would those be so high? They seemed abnormally high. Maybe I'm missing something, but they seemed unusually high.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, there's -- we have a number of venture properties in very, very good markets that have been benefiting from the influx in visitors and that's what you're seeing. We've had great sales programs.", "David E. Simon", "And also that includes the Japan -- some of the Japan expansions and all those are -- in Japan, they're all basically, and in Korea, they're all percentage rent deals. So we've had great success there. The one thing on our...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "In fact, that's a good point, David, because part of the results driving the JV line, Rich, are if you remember, last year, was the earthquake in Japan, so we had much better results coming out of Japan first quarter of '12 compared to '11.", "David E. Simon", "And one thing just to keep everybody in perspective, when I mentioned all these assets, our international outlets on average do about 1,000 a foot. And those are not in the numbers that I stated at the end of my prepared remarks.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just one question. You obviously have been very complementary of Klepierre, and you seem like you want to be in Europe longer term. So just thinking, what would cause you not to step up and increase your investment over time once the option period becomes effective? Is it just what's going on with the sovereign issues in Europe or is it something else?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, it's hard to know exactly where we are and what we're doing, but look, I think, as I said to you that what we have done there and what the company, all the assets and intangibles that the company, the company being Klepierre, possess I think just gives us tremendous amount of optionality on the whole of Europe, and we'll see where that goes.", "Operator", "Your final question will be coming from the line of the Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. Brazil and China, did you guys talk about potential yields on those developments, what that could look like?", "David E. Simon", "Not yet because we do that once we start construction, but I would say to you, Brazil -- I said it a little bit earlier, I mean, we would expect them to be consistent with kind of mall yields there, double digits. And China, we would expect that to be consistent with our Asian development, which have all been in the mid-teens. But we'll give more clarity to that once we start construction on something.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Phoenix construction, could you talk about that in relation to Arizona Mills being so nearby, whether that creates any issues in regards to trying to lease up that asset?", "David E. Simon", "Not really. We view them as 2 separate distinct markets. Arizona Mills is more of an infill project. It's actually weathered the Phoenix situation pretty well, the Phoenix economy pretty well. And we think they'll hopefully be a little bit complementary, and we'd expect given the infill location and the fact that the outlet will probably drive more tourism where Arizona Mills is probably more -- considered more of a regional mall in the sense in terms of less tourism that they'll both be able to prosper as the economy continues to improve.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that's despite the fact that Arizona Mills has a whole bunch of outlet-oriented stores in it already?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I think you need to focus. Arizona Mills is almost 1.3 million square feet. It's got a substantial entertainment component with a theater and sea life. It has a number of tenants that are, as David said, regional mall-type tenants. There's a Penney outlet. There's Forever 21, there's H&M. So it really is focused on a much broader market. And while there will be some overlap, it's a relatively small percentage of the square footage in the merchants of Arizona Mills.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it, that's helpful. And then to Klepierre, is the European market dramatically different such that the Simonization process that you guys are so good at in the U.S., is that easily transferable to these assets from generating ancillary income, banner income like all the kind of other things that you kind of established as industry practices here in the U.S. How easy can you really translate that over to their stuff?", "David E. Simon", "It's certainly more of a challenge than it is here, but we have had some success in our previous European investments in doing that. And what's interesting, it's changed a lot in that the retailers are now much more global than the ones that we deal with in the U.S. and in Europe. So I'm hopeful that it won't be as easy as it is here in doing that. I mean, when we buy something that we don't own, it's a pretty easy transition. There, it's going to take more time, but I think the opportunity exists.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just one more last question. In regards to this question about A malls and B malls, I think they've all been pushing, trying to get confirmation from you that there is demand similar to the B malls. But you don't quite seem to want to confirm that. Just kind of curious one way or another why that's so?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think all we said is we don't like to say A or B malls. You know our portfolio. You can decide what you think of it. We like it a lot. And our statistics that we report on each quarter would have to -- given that it's a huge asset base, it would -- the averages are meaningful, and I don't think we could produce these results if only the top end of the assets were producing results. So how does that answer the question?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Well said.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. It's hard for me to -- I appreciate the conflict because that's a real challenge sometimes.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thanks for your time. Hopefully, we didn't take too long, and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Simon", "Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong results for the quarter, and I'll just go through some highlights.", "First of all, funds from operation was $1.89 per share, up 14.5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our FFO exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.08 per share. For the malls and the Premium Outlets, our comparable property NOI grew 5.1%. Comp NOI growth in the second quarter of 2011 was 3.5%, so a very healthy trend.", "Tenant sales were up 9.9% to $554 per foot. Occupancy was up 60 basis points to 94.2%. Average rent per square foot increased by 3.7%, and the releasing spread was a positive 10% or $4.77 per square foot.", "On the capital market side, on June 1, as you know, we completed a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that supplements our existing $4 billion revolver, resulting in $6 billion of total capacity. The facility matures 2016 with a 1-year extension option at the same rate as our other facility, which is LIBOR plus 100 basis points. In the secured market, we've been very active year-to-date. We have closed a lock rate on 17 new mortgages, totaling approximately $1.9 billion, of which our share of that debt is $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the loans is 4.3%, and the term is 7.5 years on the average term. And last Friday, we redeemed 2 million units of our operating partnership owned by an affiliate of JCPenney at $124 per unit or share.", "On the acquisition side, June 4, we acquired a 50% interest in Silver Sands Factory Stores, a large and highly productive upscale outlet centered in Destin, Florida. The 450,000-square foot center generates sales of approximately $500 per square foot. We've assumed leasing and management duties, and in the coming months, it will be re-branded as a Premium Outlet Center.", "Development activity is very strong. First of all, we grand opened Merrimack Premium Outlets, a large outlet center in Merrimack, New Hampshire on June 14. Strong opening. We're 99% leased, great-looking center. Construction continues on 5 additional Premium Outlet Centers, all scheduled to open this fall or in 2013. They're located in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Korea, clearly demonstrating the global nature of our company in our Premium Outlet platform.", "First of all, 2 in the U.S. are in Texas City, suburb of Houston, which opens this fall; and then Chandler, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, which will open next year. We're continuing construction in Toronto, which opens next year. Another outlet center in Japan, which will be our ninth, near the airport outside of Tokyo; and Busan, our third Premium Outlet Center in Korea. We started construction on July 11 at St. Louis Premium Outlet Centers. We announced the strong lineup of tenants and are opening this plant for the fall of 2013.", "Progress is being made under our agreement to develop Premium Outlet Centers in Brazil with BR Malls. And importantly, construction is underway on 25 redevelopment expansion projects at the mall, Premium Outlet and Mills platforms in the U.S. and 2 Premium Outlets in Japan, all with 2012/2013 completion dates. We continue to expect our share of the development and redevelopment spend to approximate $1 billion this year, next year and 2014.", "Let me just turn to Klepierre and give you a quick update. As you know, we bought 54.4 million shares or 29% of the French public company in March. They are the largest -- second largest owner of retail assets in Continental Europe, with assets valued at EUR 16.2 billion. They will be announcing their earnings later today. Their business has been remarkably stable considering the turmoil in Europe. They have made excellent progress in refinancing debt, selling assets and creating additional liquidity. And I have been very involved in the development of their future strategic direction. As they accomplish their goals, there's no doubt in my mind that they will be poised to take advantage of future growth opportunities.", "Turning to dividends. As you now know, we have announced the fourth consecutive increase in our quarterly dividend from $1 per share to $1.05 per share. Our dividend is now 31% higher than it was a year ago and well above our previous all-time high before the onslaught of the great recession. I'm happy to announce that we've increased our 2012 FFO guidance again. Initially, as you'll recall, we were at $7.20 to $7.30 per share. Our new guidance now is $7.60 to $7.70 per share. Primary factors contributing to this are strong operational performance and the impact of our recent investment activity.", "Now just to highlight another important factor in what's happening with the company, we continue to add to our very talented management group. As you know, in 2011, we added Contis to our mall platform, Fivel, to help us in our legal and deal business. And obviously, I'm very pleased to announce the most recent addition many of you know, Matt Lentz. Matt is our Chief Investment Officer, which is a new position in our organization. He brings a great and extensive, broad real estate background both from a bricks-and-mortar point of view but also from a securities point of view, also very been involved in reviewing many international opportunities in his previous roles. He'll focus -- his job will primarily assist myself and others in the management group in pursuing strategic growth opportunities for the company. And Matt's first day on the job was, in fact, yesterday, and as far as I know, he's still here. But actually, his wife is about to give birth, so I hope he's not at the office.", "Concluding, let me just say last second quarter, I addressed the unfair advantage that the Internet retailers have in not being required to collect sales and use tax on remote sales. I believe our efforts and others have made significant progress at the state level, but our tenants need Congress to act to level the playing field on a national level. In the past year, the Marketplace Equity Act was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, and similar legislation has been introduced in the House to address the inequality in today's marketplace and level the playing field between bricks-and-mortars and online retail business. We support these proposals. We'll continue to be very focused on making this happen, and we appreciate all -- everybody's support in showing their strong support of this very important legislation.", "So with that said, we can turn it over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first  question comes from the line of Mr. Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "David, just going to the JCPenney for a second, $1.24 [ph] is certainly below where you guys are trading. Just want to get a little more color on one, who approached who first, and two, just want to try and understand why someone would take $124 versus where your stock is trading in the open market.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, let's just say we have a strong relationship with Penney. They're a very important retail partner of ours. I know -- Rick and I know Mr. Johnson, and we also know very well members of the board. So I'm not going to get into the particulars, but just so you understand, I mean, the unit holders have the ability to convert their units on a one-for-one basis for common shares. And we view it essentially as common stock equivalents because, obviously, they can convert it on a one-for-one basis. When they do that, then they -- we have the option to give them fully diluted stock or cash, and it was through that discussion that we negotiated the deal. And I'm very convinced it's a great opportunity for the company, and I think it met Penney's strategic goals in terms of their focus on what they're trying to do with their business. So we're pleased with the transaction, and beyond that, there's not much to add to it, Alexander.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then on Brazil, Equity International sold their stake in BR Malls. Just curious if you guys took a look at buying their stake or if there's any discussion around that.", "David E. Simon", "Well, we've looked at a lot of things with BR Malls. We've looked at a lot of things in Brazil. The good news is we're very close to approving our first outlet there, which will start construction here potentially within the next 30 to 60 days and open -- it's outside of S\u00e3o Paulo, and open late next year. That's not in this list that I've described to you, but it is moving a pace and I expect that to -- I expect that to happen, and I think we'll get our first outlet center built and open next year. So we're pleased we're making very good progress on that.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And just a final question just with the recent economic data. Has there been any change in the conversations with tenants? Are they still full steam ahead in terms of leasing space in their program this year, next year and further out?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Alex, this is Rick. There really has not been any change. They are still coming in and aggressively looking for new opportunities across all the platforms.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Mr. Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you guys talk about the dynamics that you're seeing in the department store sector as you look ahead to next year? Obviously, you've got one big transformation going on at JCPenney and then you've got another different type of situation over at Sears. At what point do you guys -- or do you believe there's still needs to be some rationalization in terms of the number of boxes that are out there?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I put Penney in a completely -- Rick and I put Penney in a completely different category than Sears. I mean, Penney is very focused on delivering value to their customer. They have a very talented management team. We expect -- obviously, they are going through a transformation. But we expect Penney to be a viable mall anchor in a fashion that they have been historically. Sears is a little bit different. I mean, the fact of the matter is Sears needs less space. I think we've touched on this the last time. Sears needs less space than what they currently have, and I think there'll be ongoing discussions with us and Sears and the other mall people that will rationalize that space, creating opportunities for both the landlord and Sears. I really, really would not lump them in together. They're 2 different companies on 2 different paths. And at the end of the day, look, it's going to be -- Sears will be a lot of work, but we feel confident as they probably reduce some of their space that that will ultimately benefit us in the long run. Rick, anything you want to add?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I would just add if you look at today's landscape in the department store universe, their equity, their balance sheets, their credit profiles are all dramatically better than they were just a few short years ago. You have Lord & Taylor that's been recreated into a very viable and aggressive growth vehicle. Dillard is very well situated. Macy's is well situated. Carson's has a new leadership and great financial upward trajectory. So candidly, we're in a better position now than we have been, and with no new development, these stores are maintaining their existing stores because they want to really enhance their top line.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And the second question is -- and I've gotten this question over the past couple of days from some of your investors. Does the hiring of Matt reflect in any way a signal that you intend to accelerate your international expansion, or is it more of a reflection that you just needed another body or 2 in the door given everything you've got going on?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's really a function of what we've got going on. I mean, we -- believe it or not, this is a big company, and just like -- I am never satisfied with the portfolio and where we've taken the company. I'm always going to try and add talent to the organization. I've known Matt a long time. We talked on and off. We wanted to fill this position, lost probably in late '08 and then the world ended, so we put it on a back burner because we said, well, we're going hunker down. I just think there's so many opportunities for this company. It's very important to continue to add talent, another pair of hands, another deep thinker. He fits in great with the team. So to me, it was a no-brainer. And we'll take it wherever it goes, wherever we think we should invest. Who would have thought we would have bought our stock at $124 3 months ago? But that's -- we saw an opportunity. Who would have thought we would have invested internationally 4 months ago, get paid? I'm getting paid. Most people pay for options. I'm getting paid as I think about that company as optionality. What do I mean by that? If you look at the cash flow that we'll get from their dividend against the cost that it took both in equity and debt, we're going to get paid $55, plus or minus, million a year to decide what we want to do with that stake. That's a good spot to be in. There's not many malls you can build that can generate $55 million of cash flow. So having another guy to think these things with our team, I think, is exciting. I also think it -- with David and Steve, we hired Larry Krema to run our HR group. I think it also demonstrates that this company is a neat place to work and be part of.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The pace of outlet development, it actually seems as high as it's ever been. I'm wondering if that's sustainable going forward in 2014 and 2015?", "David E. Simon", "On the new development or the redevelopment?", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The new development.", "David E. Simon", "I still think the full-price new development still is not -- it's still a ways away, even though there are a couple announced ones here and there. The outlet business still has some pockets, but again, I think we discussed the last time. I mean, I don't -- I know there's all these ones that are being bandied about, but I think it's going to be harder to do. So I think pure new development is still going to be a little bit -- still be less than everybody thinks. The redevelopment, though, has the potential to really pick up, and that's where -- thankfully, between Rick and Contis, that's where a big, big focus is. That has, Craig, a little bit of potential to do more than what we're doing. But Rick, you can add to that thinking.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes. Just on the outlet side, right now, it's being driven by explosive demand among a number of tenants that are not in the business that want to get in the business. And I don't want to lose sight of the fact that this demand is going to help our existing portfolio dramatically and that you're seeing that in our result. There's got to be a finite end to the arc of new development. There's a limited number of new opportunities. On the redevelopment side, when David articulated, I believe it was last year or the year before, our redevelopment program, we identified some for you. Literally, 3 quarters of them are under construction right now, and we're in the process of reloading that pipeline with the next wave of opportunities. So there's a lot going on, and if you look in the 8-K, we're producing low double-digit yields on those, which, on a risk-adjusted basis, are even better than they are on just a return basis, which are terrific in and of themselves.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess when I look at your portfolio, you have between Westbury -- Woodbury, Orlando, San Marcos, centers that are at 700,000 square feet and larger. Is there the capacity in your portfolio to take some as large as that?", "David E. Simon", "I think that it's in the outlet side. That's still going to be few and far between. I mean, we're making Orlando bigger. We're making Vegas bigger. We're making Desert Hills bigger. But these are, I hate using this word, but iconic outlets. Those will all be bigger. Those are all -- Seattle's getting bigger. Chicago will get bigger. So these are all -- that is probably underappreciated opportunity for this company. Just like -- Craig, I mean, people talk they're going to do this, they're going to do that. People are focused on a company having this particular lease here and there. We've got 5 outlets under construction. We just opened one. So people talk about, well, we're about to or hoping to lease the space. Hello, we got 5 under construction, so...", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And you just mentioned expansions of many of the best outlet centers in the United States.", "David E. Simon", "Right. And that coupled. So there is a lot to what we're doing. That's why we have great here.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "We saw a report that Bank of America is not renewing its deals to keep their ATMs in Simon Malls this year. Because of that or for other reasons, do you expect any material changes in your ancillary income?", "David E. Simon", "No. In fact, we've already replaced them with another operator. That's been in the works for, really, a couple of years. No big deal. Yes, I was surprised it got the press, but no big deal.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then also, you reported land sale gains of over $6 million. Could you tell us who you sold that land to?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I don't have it in front of me, but...", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We sold a piece of land in Northwest Houston for a supermarket right next to our Houston Premium Outlets, and that was a pretty substantial gain.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Cedrick Lachance from Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Just going back on outlets, in regards to Silver Sands, you got a loan there from the bank at a rate under 4%. Can you give me a sense of the appetite for mortgage financing in the outlet space at this point?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, Cedrik, most of our portfolio in the outlet business, because it's wholly-owned, is unencumbered. But where we have shown the products to the mortgage market, whether it's the banks or the life companies, I think they recognize the quality and the stability of the cash flow, so I think about Philadelphia Premium Outlets, we had a mortgage on. We just got some financing on the -- we've got a construction/mini firm on Toronto at very attractive pricing. So it's a very attractive, very viable product for that market.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I mean -- and I would just say, Cedrik, throw that in for the Mills projects, too. I mean, we're -- some of these are locked out, but the ones that are open and the ones that we bought out of the TMLP are extremely financeable, and that financing rivals any A mall that there is out there as well.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And just going back a little bit, looking at the big picture, where do you see the most fertile ground for investments today? Is it primarily in publicly traded companies, or is it in malls or outlets that are owned privately?", "David E. Simon", "Well, that's a tough one, Cedrik, to be honest with you. At this point, I would probably say that outside the opportunity that we saw at Klepierre, it's probably the private deals that we see as the most -- the biggest opportunity primarily because the private owners are going to have a much more difficult time to get financing and/or the private individuals that may want to monetize their business for whatever reason or their asset for whatever reason. I would say that's probably the biggest opportunity that we see, though it doesn't rule out that eventually, there may be some more public opportunities. But I would say to you as we think about what we're looking at, they tend to be more private-oriented, and it's either financing issues or state issues or whatever that's driving the need to do it. Now philosophically, we will not -- we don't rarely -- and I don't blackline everything, but we don't participate in bidding when -- if there's a banker or a broker and it says, \"Bids are due at 2:00 p.m. Please send in your letter.\" We don't do that. I mean, I can't remember the last deal that we did where we'll participate in an auction. I mean, we just don't do it. We don't need to do it. We have no interest in doing it. So these are people that want to do business with us, and then we -- it doesn't mean that they're not represented by bankers or whatever, but those bankers know that if there's an auction, they can send it to the next mall guy. We're not going to play.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Harris from Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "On the appointment of Matt Lentz, how much experience has Matt acquired outside of public securities over the years?", "David E. Simon", "He's had -- he used to be a broker. He's been in the bricks-and-mortar business, so I think it's pretty good. I mean, we've got a group here that any -- not that I think there's any holes there, but we've got a lot of guys here that know about bricks-and-mortar that will help him.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Will his compensation details be made public?", "David E. Simon", "I believe it'll be whatever this -- I can't keep track of all the rules, but I think he will be one of the...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "He'll be a named executive officer.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I think he'll be a Form 4, 5 -- I don't know. Whatever the rules are, he'll be part of the rules.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "So that will be in next year's proxy?", "David E. Simon", "Potentially. I'm not going to guarantee it because I really don't know.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Then turning to Klepierre, if I'm doing my numbers right, it sounded like you were down about $200 million on your investment here, about half is the stock depreciation and half is FX. You did put in $1 billion against $2 billion gross investment by way of a hedge, by way of your -- I think it was a credit line facility. Have you expanded that or hedged your position against the currency any more since then? I mean, it looks like all the risks are to the downside, David.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, well, David, look, we don't -- I don't think about -- the good news about -- for the investors is I actually think about the real estate long term, not quarter-to-quarter. So yes, the euro is down a little bit. The stock, we did buy it at a premium to where it was trading. That gap has been closed. In fact, it's been up since -- where we bought it. We kind of look at where we bought it versus the net asset value, and we still think the net asset value is higher than when we bought it. I'm not going to panic about the euro. It's a good portfolio. It's stable. You'll see the results later today. So to me, this isn't -- it's not a quarter-to-quarter gain. So that's of no concern to me, no consequence to me. But we did increase our hedge, and we're about 60-some percent hedged. We did that before even the latest euro depreciation. But I think the other point is that -- and if I could put it in real estate context, the real question is what happens in the principal. But this is not -- we didn't do this based upon short-term trading patterns. But if you look at the dividend and our cost of financing, just a simple -- go back, you know real estate, right?", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "A little, just a little.", "David E. Simon", "Cash on cash returns. We're going to get roughly, and this is even with the lower currency, we're going to get $55 million added cash flow while we decide whether we love this company, we want to maintain our investment, whether -- who knows what we do with this investment. But the fact of the matter is we're getting paid while we help make it a better company, which we're doing today. And I think about what it takes to build $55 million of additional cash flow, and I think it's a good trade. But look, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Another question on Klepierre. Since the election of Hollande, there have been a raft of tax changes, including increases in the dividend tax. Have any of these prompted you to recalculate your pro forma after-tax returns?", "David E. Simon", "No, no. None of those at this point will have an impact on us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On the sales growth trends that have been continuing to impress, I mean, maybe you could answer a little bit of the composition of it. I mean, clearly, they're above what a lot of retailers are reporting on a portfolio-wide basis. So I mean, how much of the increase is a same-tenant basis versus sort of shifts in the mix within the mall? And then maybe on a trend basis, kind of how is the tourist spending side of your portfolio going?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Let me unpack that a little bit. One, the  tourist aspects of the portfolios are still very strong. We're still seeing a lot of activity from a number of the tourism groups, but the only one that's softened at all is Japan. So that is still a major contributor, and we are out-weighted in tourist market. Secondly, when you think about the contributions of any one tenant, our sales base is over 60 million square feet. So when you get a number out of us, it's a broad-based trend. It's not going to be materially influenced by the out-performance of any one or any collection of tenants. Thirdly, I believe this reflects the fact that we're doing a good job making our properties better and hopefully taking market share from other properties operating in our markets. And that comes from adding better tenants, adding additional anchors, adding renovations and making our physical plants better, and all of ose things are feeding into what you're seeing as our bottom line sales growth.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "And Paul, this is Steve. I'd just add one more comment that if you componentize that growth a bit, the rate of sales pace growth that we're seeing in the outlets in the malls is pretty much on top of each other.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And so, I mean, would you say that the kind of the non-same tenant number is maybe -- if your 10% comp year-over-year, is it -- half of that is due to change in mix or...", "David E. Simon", "Let me just say this. Our comp numbers and our rolling 12 are right on top of each other, absolutely right on top of each other, if that's what you're getting at. The comp sales and the rolling 12 are exactly right on top of each other.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on terms of new concepts, I mean, there's been good growth from -- a lot of the public chains have sort of gotten back into growth mode. I haven't as many new concepts at least relative to the kind of '04 to '06 period. Maybe that's sort of what spurred a lot of development that you're not seeing now. But maybe, Rick, are you seeing signs that we're about to see an acceleration of new concepts?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, there's a couple of things that are happening. One, a number of retailers that were new concepts, say, x years ago are now public, and they are substantially accelerating their growth because they have a very firm capital plan. Francesca, Teavana, Tumi, Five Below, Fresh Market. We also are seeing a number of concepts that were, again, relatively new a while ago that are being aggressively grown by their companies, Crazy 8, PS by Aero. But we're also seeing a number of new concepts, Versona by Cato, Dry Goods by Von Maur, Vince by Kellwood, C. Wonder, Hearts on Fire, Tesla. Hot Topic is doing Blackheart.", "David E. Simon", "We get it. We get it.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "So I'm going to wear you out. But there's a lot of stuff that's going on in that sector still.", "David E. Simon", "Paul, we all cringed because this gives Rick the opportunity to list all these tenents. Okay, so...", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "David, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about some of the synergies and maybe best practices that both Klepierre and Simon are kind of sharing with each other. And I realize it's still kind of in early days, but are there any sort of success stories or things that you could sort of talk about that kind of show how things are kind of transforming kind of across both companies?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, the fact is we've been very focused on the balance sheet. As you know, they've raised a lot of money in the bond market at much lower spreads than where they were beforehand. So that's a very tangible, very important, credible and important thing that we brought to the table. I'm not sure that absent our investment that they would have been able to do it. We've also reduced the reliance on their funding from BNP. And I mean, those are real tangible -- in the bounds of the organization making happen. Operationally, I mean, we're helping them think about all the promotional other income opportunities. I mean, that's going to take time, but we are now talking to certain sponsors on a global basis. We've helped them with a few tenants and a few areas on a global basis. Their head of leasing was in our -- at our shopping center convention, the ICSC. We had a number of global meetings with him and our people with the global brands, including H&M, Apple, just to name a few, Hollister. So it's happening. That stuff's going to take time, but the bond business is tangible. It's there, it happened, and that's only been in 4 months. Now strategically, you'll see changes with this company over a period of time. And the management team there has been very, very good, very cooperative, very interested in replicating what we have and listening to what we have to say. So it's working. It's a lot of work. We spent -- I spent last week there touring assets with them, going through strategy, going through numbers, going through developments. Actually, it's a scary thing helping design some of the extensions. It's scary because I was helping them, and that's -- but there's certain things I've learned over the years, too. So it's happening. It's going to take time. There's a lot that we're providing. There's more that we'll provide over a period of time. We're also respectful. We've been there 4 months. We try not to be Attila the Hun. We want to be -- we want to learn as much as we can. But the cooperation, the synergies are available. They're there. The chemistry between their managers and ours have been great. The only negative is that every morning, I have to hear about Europe every day. Harris reminded me of some of the ups and downs that go with the territory in trying to create value. We're big boys. We know nothing's easy. But I look at it, I'm getting paid to make this company better, and I've got a board and a management team that wants to get better, and we've got people here that can help make them better. And it's happening, and you can see it in the bond yields right away.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess second question, last quarter, we talked a little bit about the St. Louis project and kind of where you and the other project from Taubman were. Now that you guys have kind of started construction and had your groundbreaking, I'm just wondering, kind of maybe being first out of the ground, has the leasing dynamic changed at all? And can you kind of provide us with maybe an update on where you are leasing on that project?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we announced a whole host of tenants on July 11. We've added a few more to that mix. I mean, look, they're -- Taubman's a formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll announce certain tenants as well. We anticipate that they're going to build their project. We're going to build ours. Our numbers are -- we're comfortable with our investment. This is not driven by ego, by any stretch of the imagination. We expect to get our lease. We expect to have double-digit returns. Taubman's a very formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll feel the same way about what they're doing. And it's most likely that we're going to have 2 outlet centers there. But I think, as I said, we're comfortable. We've got a lot of experience in the outlet business. I've been at it since '98. We were -- people scratched their head when we did our first joint venture with Chelsea. People scratched their head when we bought it in '04. I got confidence in our team. We expect to build a very high-yielding outlet center and we're moving forward with it.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question on kind of the international outlets I see. I think, if I did my math right, that Japan sales were up kind of 5% to 6%. And I'm just wondering, how do you kind of look at Japan in terms of potentially new outlets? And maybe talk a little bit about just how Korea's performing and also the new project in Malaysia and any update on the China project.", "David E. Simon", "Sure. Generally, Asia is very strong. I mean, there's supply and -- and even with all the -- it gets down to kind of almost Europe to some extent. I mean, even with all the macro headlines in Japan, I mean, they're still doing roughly $1,000 a foot. And there's just not that many, and they're just not going to be that many. We've got our ninth that will open next spring. It's in a great location. We have a terrific partner in Mitsubishi Estate. So I don't think that 9 is going to go to 18. There might be 1 or 2 or 3 more to do in the next few years. We're also -- as you know, there, we phase a lot of stuff in, so we'll do 3, 4, 5 phases there. Japan, so even with all the headwinds and everything else, we've got a wonderful niche there, and we'll continue to exploit it and increase the cash flow there. Korea's the same thing. There's 1 or 2 formidable competitors, but our outlets there are probably -- what's the -- $700 a foot? $800?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "$800.", "David E. Simon", "$800 a foot. The brands that we deliver are great. We have a very good partner there as well. So it's fine in Malaysia. It's exactly what we thought it would be. It's really trying to get access to a Singaporean market. We have a great partner there. They're doing stuff worldwide, which we're talking to them about, some other opportunities, and it's meeting our expectations there, so so far, so good. China is a little bit not as far along as we would like it. It's still a very complex place to do business. We're still hopeful that we'll get one started there. But it is more complex, and we're being more cautious given the -- if you think there's a robust pipeline in the outlet business here, you happen to think that pipeline has been around for years and years and not much will get -- not much of it will get built. The pipeline there expands daily. So we're trying to really underwrite it smartly, make sure this is something that we want to do. We do have a good partner in Shanghai. But we're going to be very, very judicious in how we ultimately build something there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen and Company.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "David, I appreciate all the commentary on Klepierre. I have one other question. As I recall, their 2011 asset sales were completed at about a 5% premium to appraised NAV, and I believe at the beginning of this year, they talked about planning EUR 1 billion of additional sales for this year and next. I wonder if you could tell us number one, if that disposition plan is still in place and what the pricing expectations are relative to NAV.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, they're going to announce probably shortly here. But generally, I'll say this, and I want to be very careful. Everything -- they're ahead of schedule, and NAV, by and large, has not been an issue in terms of being able to sell the assets at or above their NAV. But you'll see their results. I don't want to -- I just want to be very careful here because they do report or they may have already reported. I think they go out at 6:00 Central European Time. But so far, so good. And it's still on plan, perhaps ahead of schedule, and it's moving right along.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Second question on Woodbury, which you mentioned earlier and you mentioned also in the last call, in terms of the expansion potential there, can you indicate whether the plan is to add square footage on land you already own or at land you otherwise control?", "David E. Simon", "It's land that we own. So it's really reconfiguring a number of spaces, decking some of the parking and creating additional space on the land that we own.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It's about a 60,000 square feet addition, primarily reconfiguring the additional -- the existing formats and just substantially upgrading the whole physical plant.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then separately on Amazon, David, you touched on this in, again, your prepared comments. But as they prepare to pay sales taxes in several large states this quarter and open more infill DCs, have they had any discussions with you about opening outlet or full-price stores?", "David E. Simon", "Not with us.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then final question, just a line item in other income maybe for Steve. The interest and dividend income was down materially on a consecutive-quarter basis. I wonder if you could tell us what's going on with that line item.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "A couple of things, Jim. Number one, the dividend from our U.K. investment, CSC, was a second quarter event last year, third quarter this year, just the timing of their payment of that dividend. And then we had some investments in some loans that were, in fact, paid off earlier this year, so interest income is down.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, we're bummed out about that.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So on a full year basis, so the loans that were paid off, it sounds like they're variable on a year-over-year basis.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "On a year-over-year basis, that's correct.", "David E. Simon", "And then the other point is we did -- as you know, we did have the mez loan with Mills, and obviously, that got paid off and retired as part of that whole transaction, so you're seeing that as well, Jim.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just another Klepierre question. David, your involvement in forming the strategic direction for the company, does that involve acquisitions at this stage, or is Klepierre somewhat held back by levering cost of capital at this stage?", "David E. Simon", "I don't think that they are. I don't know that it should be their #1 focus. And we actually did discuss at the recent meetings a couple of opportunities that are out there. But I don't think  it should be their #1 focus. But I don't think it's too far off in the future that we could be -- it could be up there, and we do think there's going to be a number of opportunistic deals. And again, it doesn't mean Klepierre. It could be Simon. It could be all sorts of things. But there are going to be a handful of those things to do, and I think it should be on the agenda, but probably not at the top of the list.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of Brazil, could you give us an update on discussions with retailers regarding the Brazil outlet industry? And in particular, I'm interested in some of what the domestic Brazilian retailers' thoughts are on the outlet industry and the outlet channel given, I guess, the infancy of that industry down there.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We had a, almost, say, 30 days ago, kind of a presentation to a number of Brazilian plus international retailers about our outlet pipeline with BR Malls. It was very, very well attended. The international retailers are growing there daily, and certainly, the high-end guys that we think are important to bring into the outlet properties are gaining entrance into Brazil on a weekly basis, so to speak, like Tory Burch just opened a store at a new high-end mall in S\u00e3o Paulo. So very, very well attended. The Brazilian retailers are very excited about the pipeline, and we expect them to populate these outlets aggressively. So it's very, very encouraging kind of what's going on down there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.", "Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is Wes Golladay. A quick question on the outlets. We've heard the number 100 outlets in 10 years. Do you think there's actually more capacity than that for development in the United States?", "David E. Simon", "No, and I wouldn't put much credence in our opinion, we could be wrong, but certainly, we don't think there's 10 outlets in -- or 100 outlets in 10 years. Not a chance. We don't see it that way.", "Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Well, I guess, maybe how would you view it, the total opportunity for development?", "David E. Simon", "Look, I think there'll be a handful, but I don't see 100 outlets in 10 years, not a chance.", "Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And turning to the malls, what are you guys seeing in terms of traffic trends for the last quarter?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Traffic has been relatively flat to up a little in all the platforms.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Christy McElroy from UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sorry for all the outlet questions, I just have a follow-up. Given the pipeline in the U.S. with competing projects and quite a few private developers in the fray, I'm wondering how influential the core group of outlet retailers are in the center actually getting built. And while demand for space is obviously very strong today, how are the deciding factors for retailers signing a lease and a new project different compared to what they were 5 to 7 years ago?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we are living this every day. I would say to you it is still quite a challenge to convince outlet retailers, whether they're manufacturers or full-price retailers. This is our experience, and we have a pretty good portfolio, pretty big one. I think it's still quite a challenge to convince them to go to new centers. That's why all this talk about this unbelievable demand and all of this hundred centers and this that and the other, I've got to tell you we work our tails off to convince the  retailers that this is worthy of an outlet center. So I don't think it's, by any stretch of the imagination, simple and easy to do. When we do it, we have confidence we'll do it. But it is not like you can plop these anywhere by anybody, anywhere by anybody, and it'll be successful. It's just not going to happen. And I think the retailers that have a high understanding of this business, whether they're manufacturers or full-price retailers, understand that and will also govern. They're open to buy very seriously.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing I would add is I think we would hope that the retailers have a high regard for the consistency of what we produce. David and I were just up in New Hampshire and visited Merrimack. That is an incredibly well-executed, well-leased, well-marketed project, and hopefully, we have that going for us when we approach retailers about our new project. They have confidence that we will -- they know what we will deliver and know that it will produce.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then on your property operating expenses, they seem to run a little bit lower than normal again this quarter. I know in Q1, there were some favorable comps, given weather and such. I'm wondering if there was anything specific in Q2 that you could point to, any trends that favorably impacted OpEx this quarter. And is there a way for you to break out your same-store NOI growth between revenue growth and expense growth?", "David E. Simon", "Well, there's a way to do it, but we don't. I assume we know what drives our business. Look, where size and scale -- when we talked about this company 15 years ago or 17 years ago or 18 years ago, we thought size and scale matter for a couple of different points. Retail relationships, ability to run efficiently, ability to cover our overhead at the executive level over a huge asset base more efficiently than our peer groups, that's what it takes to generate comp NOI growth, and that's what we do. Nothing jumps out, as we're reviewing it right now, that is worthy of mention. But we are very focused on our operating margins, and our size and scale and quality of assets allow us to do that.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanyo from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question in regards to any early indications about what back-to-school may look like this year?", "David E. Simon", "It's really too early to say at this point.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then, David, any other market -- I mean, you guys are seniors in many key markets, but any other markets internationally that you might be interested in?", "David E. Simon", "Let's see. Look, we have a big investment in Klepierre, and I think internationally, that's the big focus. We have got to make sure that that turns out to be a profitable investment. That's the #1 priority. The outlet business in Asia continues to progress. I explained that in detail to you. But that's really the focus. I mean, Brazil, Latin America, I mean, I do think will present more and more opportunities, not just Brazil but all of South America, for the company. And so I think you'll see us hopefully do some smart things down there over time. And Steve is whispering to me, but you can certainly jump in there. But we do have -- we are building Canada, Toronto. I mean, Toronto, there was a lot of talk about it. There's not a lot of talk about it now. We are under construction. We're going to have a great outlet there. We've got a great partner. We're looking at another deal in Canada, but hopefully, that will be a market that will possess -- present a few more opportunities for us.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just the last question. In regards to the supplemental line of credit, the additional $2 billion, should we be reading something into that in regards that you guys are seeing something out there that you need that additional source of capital for?", "David E. Simon", "I would just say it's consistent with our philosophy to be as prudent and opportunistic as we possibly can be. I mean, you're always trying to balance prudence against opportunity. They tend to kind of conflict each other. When you should be prudent, there's a lot of opportunities, so you try to get that right balance. And the world -- let's face it. The world is going to continue to be uncertain for, I think, a few years to come. If not, that's just the world we live in. So there's no reason not to be -- not to have the ability to be both prudent and opportunistic. And then based on how we read the tea leaves, figure out where the primary -- who wins, prudence or opportunity.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of John Kim from CLSA.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "I had a question on the Main Street Fairness Act. Do you view this initiative as ultimately a revenue booster for your centers, or is this more of a defense mechanism?", "David E. Simon", "Look, I think it helps -- I think it's going to help our merchants. Anything that helps our merchants ultimately helps us. Look, Congress should not -- look, this is a states' right issue. I think most people in this country believe in state rights. So that's one aspect of it. But also, the government, Congress should not be picking, creating winners and losers. And this certainly has helped fuel the online against the bricks-and-mortar. Certainly, we're not -- oh this is going to mean x million of revenues, but if it helps our merchants, it's bound to trickle down to us in some way, shape or form.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "So for the states that have already begun collecting tax from Internet companies, you haven't really seen a noticeable difference in sales?", "David E. Simon", "It's so early in that effort that I would -- certainly, we haven't seen anything, but it is just beginning.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. On Klepierre, I don't see the second quarter numbers out yet, but in the first quarter, retail sales in Spain were down 6%, Italy was down 2%. What's the bull case for the company to potentially turn these markets around?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think the bull case is that supply and demand will be in their favor once demand picks up because you cannot expand. It's very hard to get the right to build there. And the other point is they've got a great portfolio in Northern Europe, which is somewhat insulated from what's going on in kind of the Scandinavian areas, somewhat insulated from what's going on in Continental Europe. I think operationally, there are things that we can do to help the company increase its cash flow. And an operational focus from the company, we think, will increase the cash, so I think that's the bull case. The negative is, look, they're going to have to weather tough environment. The one country there that continues to be difficult for them is Spain. And again, it's not all Spain. It's certain assets in Spain. And we'll weather that storm, and I think as things stabilize, we'll get back to being able to generate cash flow growth from those assets.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Sure. And maybe just a follow-up to David Harris's question, if the euro continues to decline, how would that impact your decision to potentially acquire the remaining part of the company?", "David E. Simon", "We really -- at this point, we're pleased with our investment, and that's the focus. I can't really speculate on that going forward. Certainly, it makes it cheaper, right?", "John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Yes, well, that's the potential outcome.", "David E. Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just going back to the same-store growth, I assume a good portion of that is coming from the 3.7% average base rent growth. Can you give us some detail on where the 3.7% growth is coming from, especially given your spreads are right around 10%?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We're basically in the position of one, increasing occupancy; two, we're adding considerable number of anchors that are generating revenue. But see, it's just re-leasing our space at higher rents. And when you look at our expiring rents and look at what our average rent is, we've got a nice spread in there. And as our product gets better, we're able to take advantage of that and generate the higher rental revenues.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The 3.7% is in your small shop, correct?", "David E. Simon", "Correct, yes.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And the 10% spreads, I assume across maybe 10% to 13%.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, Nate, this is Steve. We've had this discussion before on calls, but one thing, we calculate our spread in the most conservative way possible, which is what is the ending cash rent that a tenant was paying compared to the beginning cash rent that the new tenant or the same tenant on the new lease is paying. And that is a much more conservative approach than the GAAP method of which you're preparing financials, which would include the straight-lining of both the old lease and the new lease. So that's going to have some impact on it.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I understand. Even on a cash basis, the delta between, let's say, 1.3% to 1.5%, let's say, from your spreads to 3.7% across a very large portfolio is still pretty wide.", "David E. Simon", "Well, you got overage rent. I mean, you got lots of things that...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "You're taking overage rent and you're capturing it in the new base rent.", "David E. Simon", "I mean, you got a lot of things going on.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one final question, a follow-up on St. Louis. Can you give us some insight on how the tenants are viewing the 2 projects? Are there any tenants that you're aware of that have said no to you because they were going next door?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, yes. There are a handful of tenants that had said no to us, absolutely.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And are there any tenants that have signed in both?", "David E. Simon", "There are some that have expressed that they're prepared to do both.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And so is it safe to say you're not putting in normal radius restrictions or you're not having the success putting them in...", "David E. Simon", "I think it's a tenant-by-tenant discussion. I don't think there's any -- it's a tenant by tenant -- we're going to tend to get that for the people that commit just to us like we do for every other outlet center.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And the only other thing to say is we have announced, as David said, we're now 62% leased and committed. So that is certainly consistent with the kind of leasing progress we have had on all of our new projects.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First on leasing. Could you comment on -- I know you figured releasing spreads that you quote are on a cash basis. What would that look like on a straight-line basis for that 10% number?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Ki Bin, we don't calculate it on a straight-line basis. As David has said, I think, gazillions of times on this calls, the laser focus is cash flow, and so that's the way we look at the spread.", "David E. Simon", "It would be higher, though.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It would be higher.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Yes, that was what I was trying to get at.", "David E. Simon", "We're still getting steps in all of our leases.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "And if it's possible, could you comment on what is the average vintage of the leases that have been expiring this year? Are they, like, 7 years old? And the second part of that question is, if you could calculate, what would the, on a like-for-like basis, the sales per square foot be back then versus today?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I want to caution you on 2 things. One, and Steve touched on it earlier, when we roll over, we've done a very good job over the years getting much more focused on our breakpoints on our overage rent. So when you look at the relationship between the spreads and our comp NOI growth, there's a comp NOI being generated from sources other than just our spread. And David just said we also build in all of our bumps over the course of the leases, so the ending rent has already been impacted by our ability to raise the base rent over the existing terms.", "David E. Simon", "But if you look at '04, '05 sales per square foot, they were in the $400s, and we're rolling leases over. I mean, our expiration aren't in front of me, but it's the mid to high 30s. I mean, that's -- so now we're at $550, and we're getting in the 50s. I mean, that gives you a sense of what's happened on that. I think that's what you asked.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Yes. I just want to clarify that. So you're saying roughly, on a like-for-like basis...", "David E. Simon", "In other words, if you look at the leases we did 6, 7 years ago are rolling off today. These are rough, rough numbers, but they were $38, $37, $38. That probably was just under 9% -- probably under 10%, probably 9% of sales. And if you look at where we are today, we're $550. And that relationship is probably still pretty the same, but therein lies the spread differential. That's what you're thinking about.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "Yes. And just last quick question, in respect to your comp sale, 1.5%, 1.4% treasury rates and maybe risk premiums offsetting some of that decline. How has that impacted B mall pricing, and have you seen any additional activity on that front?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think -- and I think this applies, which is great. I mean, this is what PIMCO -- this is what Bill Gross said. I mean, the fact of the matter is unless the real estate is going out of business, okay, the fact is people are going to need cash flow growth, right? And that's the world that we live in. In a slow growth environment, rates are going to stay low, cash flow is going to be stable. I mean, if we proved anything to you over the years, it's that this real estate is -- it doesn't mean that certain things don't turn against us, and they have, okay? We've had centers that we've lost for whatever reason. But these things are sticky, cash flow is stable and yield is there. And you're seeing it by opportunistic investors. You're seeing it -- I mean, in Europe, you're seeing it. I mean, the stuff that Klepierre is selling is to yield-hungry investors. Why would they want to buy the German bond when they can get a 6 yield or 5.5, 6 yield on a stable asset? I think that's great for us to be in, not just us but all real estate companies. And that's a very attractive feature, one of the reasons why we're increasing our dividend.", "Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research", "I guess maybe do you expect any kind of reignition of the transaction market for BMO in the second half and maybe specific to you, too?", "David E. Simon", "With those -- with the outlook the way it is, the answer is yes, and it's happening slowly. I mean, you're starting to see the market pick up.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Michael Bilerman. David, I just want to come back to the unit purchase from JCPenney, and I think most would agree with your comment that units, think of them as one-for-one common stock equivalents. So being able to buy something back and create $60 million of shareholder value is impressive, given the fact that there's still another 61 million units outstanding. And so is there something particular about this OP agreement with JCPenney that -- where there was restrictions or something that would have caused the value of that stake to be 20% less than what the market is?", "David E. Simon", "No. There's only one operating partnership, and all the unitholders are treated the same. There's a preferred unit, but we're getting rid of that soon. But all the unit holders, there's no separate, different agreements. They're all the same.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So then going back to the question of getting a 20% discount, was there a time lapse effectively if they came to you and said, \"Okay, I'm going to exercise -- I'm going to put my notice in to redeem units,\" and now you have the option of delivering them stock or cash. Was there a time that they saved on that?", "David E. Simon", "The time actually is very quick, but put that aside. We actually didn't get noticed, technically. But there was a discussion about -- relatively simple. If they give us -- they did not give us notice. They give us notice, they get the stock, and they can market it. We actually -- Shelly, correct me. But we actually have to register the stock, I think, right?", "Shelly J. Doran", "[indiscernible]", "David E. Simon", "So it's freely tradable, we register it, boom, done. It was in the discussion that obviously, it turned to cash. And we part -- believe it or not, we part with our cash. We're very tough whenever we write a check out of this building. We are very focused on parting with our cash. We like cash, and that's what happened.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But if they were to take stock, how quickly could they have monetized that stock?", "David E. Simon", "Two million shares, I assume it's pretty quick.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Why would someone leave $55 million on the table? I mean, it's not like small potatoes, right?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I'm not going to get into that. Let's move on, Michael.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Is there other opportunities that you have with -- you still have 61 million units. I recognize a lot of them are family -- there's a bunch of family units in there. But is there other opportunities where you can buy back stock at such an accretive discount?", "David E. Simon", "Look, there's nothing that I can really add to that other than what I've already said.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just curious what the board's course of action has been since the proxy and the shareholder vote.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I mean, it is -- the board obviously has taken the vote to heart. They are very focused in talking to shareholders about it. The good news -- look, I mean, the fact of the matter is we're putting this -- our focus, our #1 focus, and that's me, Rick, Steve, the other members of our team, is on the business, okay, and obviously, our performance over this year, last year, for as long as we've all been together, is pretty good, and it speaks for itself. And we have all the confidence in the world that we'll continue to deliver very good performance to our shareholders. There's no guarantees, but that's the focus. The vote, given our performance, was extremely disappointing, and we didn't understand the vote, and there's enough precedence out there to suggest it was -- we just didn't understand the vote. But we'll be talking to our shareholders about it, trying to understand the way they voted it. And I will say that we've had some discussions. There's not a clear consensus as to why we voted -- they voted against it. We've had a number of shareholders that were supportive of it, but the board will take its job very seriously. We welcome any shareholder comments. We've had discussions with shareholders. We expect to have more, and we'll take it from there. But the #1 focus, obviously, even though we're disappointed because we've been such stewards of capital and performance, continues to be how do we make this company better, and we do it every day. But we've had discussions, and we'll continue to have more discussions with shareholders.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, hopefully, this is okay from JCPenney, but should we expect any other announcements between you and JCPenney in regards to maybe buying anchor boxes or other sort of ventures with them in the future?", "David E. Simon", "Well, no. This thing was just really focused on the transaction that we did. We'll talk to them like we talk to all of our retail partners, but nothing -- I wouldn't expect anything out of the normal course of business.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Most have been answered, but just one question. David, in the past, you cut up the U.S. portfolio based on sales just to show how concentrated it was, x percent of your NOI comes from over $800, over $500 a foot in sales. When you look at the Klepierre portfolio, how concentrated is it on that basis?", "David E. Simon", "It's really not up for me to do that, but I'm sure they'll welcome the question. I will say this, they do a very sophisticated analysis of their portfolio, buys, hold, redevelopment. But it's really not up for me to do it. But I do think the quality is there, the opportunities for enhancing the operations are there, but it's really not up for me to do that. I will tell you, though, they're very sophisticated in how they slice and dice the portfolio and what they want to do with the assets.", "Operator", "Sir, you have no further questions at this time.

Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

This package is available on the Simon website in the Investors section.", "Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Good morning. Our results for the quarter were very strong. FFO was $2.29 per share, up 19.9% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus once again, this time by $0.12 per share.", "For our Malls and Premium Outlets, tenant sales were up 6.6% to $568 per square foot, occupancy was up 70 basis points to 95.3%, base minimum rent per square foot increased by 3.4%, and our releasing spread was a positive 10.8% or $5.21 per square foot.", "For the year, our 2012 FFO was $2,885,000,000, an increase of $446 million from 2011. Growth in FFO per share was an exceptional 15.8% to $7.98 per share, and we did achieve such growth through a number of ways: First of all, our comp property NOI growth in our Mall and Premium Outlet platform was 4.8% per year. We completed several acquisitions in 2012 which were done throughout the year, so we'll see more of their accretion into 2013 and beyond, but those include Mills, Kl\u00e9pierre, our investments, Silver Sands, Grand Prairie, Livermore.", "We also successfully reopened Opry Mills in Nashville, Tennessee. And we opened a new upscale premium outlet center in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and our Texas City, Texas, deal with our partner in -- with Steve's Hangar.", "Now our significant redevelopment pipeline is also bearing fruit. Again, not much benefit in '12 for these things, but we expect to see additional earnings accretion for '13, '14. But they include King of Prussia, Fashion Mall at Keystone, Pheasant Lane, Ontario Mills, Sawgrass Mills and Southridge Mall, again investments made throughout '12 and opening at the end of '12.", "We continue to demonstrate our balance sheet leadership. In December, we did a bond offering of $500 million of 10-year notes at 2.75% interest rate and $750 million of 5-year notes at 1.5%, the lowest coupons ever printed by a REIT. 2012, we issued a total of $3 billion in senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.81% and a weighted average term of 11.6 years.", "Now we also were very active in the secured debt markets. We closed or locked rates on 30 new mortgages totaling $3.7 billion, of which our share is $2.3 billion. The average interest rate on those loans is 3.88% with a weighted average term of 8 years.", "Let me turn to the dividend. Common stock dividend increased 17.1% in 2002 -- 2012 to a total of $4.10 per share for the year as compared to $3.50 paid in 2011. This morning, we announced the 6th consecutive quarterly increase in our dividend from $1.10 to $1.15 per share.", "Our stockholder -- total stockholder return in '12 was 26%. We've outperformed the RMS and the S&P for the 11th time in the past 12 years. Our compound annual return for the last decade was 21.4%, and since our IPO in December of 1993 was 17.2%.", "Transactions in December in the fourth quarter, we created a venture with CalPERS and Miller Capital Advisory to jointly own the shops in Mission Viejo and the Woodfield Mall, 2 of the best 100 malls in the U.S. Part of the transaction, as you know, we owned 100% of Mission and CalPERS own 100% of Woodfield. We now own 51% of Mission and 50% of Woodfield, and we lease and manage both assets. We have a very strong relationship with CalPERS and Miller, and we're excited to partner with them in Woodfield, where we think we'll have a good ability to increase that cash flow.", "Now let me talk about the Paragon deal. We completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in these 2 newly developed centers. These centers have been re-branded as Livermore Premium Outlets and Grand Prairie Premium Outlets. They serve the Greater San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, respectively. Both are 100% leased. Traffic and sales continue to meet or exceed expectations and with each center creating an excellent reputation in their respective trade areas.", "Now our new development -- redevelopment pipeline continues to move forward aggressively. We invested nearly $900 million in projects during 2012 and expect our share of capital spend in 2013 to be over $1 billion. We have 5 Premium Outlets under construction, all scheduled to open in 2012: 2 are  in the U.S., Chandler, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, and Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis; one in Japan; one in Canada, which is a suburb of Toronto; and our fifth is in Busan, Korea, which will be our third outlet center in Korea.", "We plan to start construction in the second quarter of the new upscale outlet center in Montr\u00e9al. This will be our second Premium Outlet Center in Canada. It will comprise approximately 390,000 square feet and is expected to open third quarter of '14. And construction is also under way at 24 redevelopment expansion projects throughout our U.S. portfolio and the 2 Premium Outlets in Asia. All will open in 2013 and '14. Several are very significant in size and scope, including expansions at Seattle Premium Outlets, Walt Whitman Shops, Sawgrass Mills and the redevelopment of an -- former enclosed mall into an open-air center at The Shops in Nanuet in Nyack, New York,", "Kl\u00e9pierre reported last Thursday. Total rents for the year were up 4% on a current basis and 2.3% on a like-for-like basis. In 2012, they completed asset sales totaling EUR 700 million, reduced their LTV by 200 basis points, continue to perform ahead of our expert -- expectations as we continue to refine the strategy for the company.", "In conclusion, I am and we are very pleased with our 2012 accomplishments and results. We reported record FFO per share of $7.98 per share. That is $0.71 higher than consensus at the beginning of 2012; $0.73 higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance range; $1.53, or 23.7%, than our high -- than our rate -- than our pre-Great Recession high FFO reported in 2008 of $6.45.", "We paid a record dividends of $4.10 per share. And with our recent increase in dividend this quarter, we're on track to pay at least $4.60 per share in '13. And this is $1 higher or 27.8% higher than the dividends paid in 2008 at the -- at our great -- at the Great Recession high. We look forward to another strong year in '13. And based upon our core business, FFO guidance for 2013 is in a range of $8.40 to $8.50 per share. The midpoint of this range is $2 higher than our record FFO per share prior to the Great Recession, or roughly 31% increase.", "With that, operator, we're ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm on the line with Ross as well. I was wondering if you could comment on the changing importance of outlets for retailers and then the differences in retailers' profitability across different platforms, especially in light of Mickey Drexler's comments at a forum a few weeks ago that the increasing importance of outlet sales versus full price to the bottom line isn't very widely discussed.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I don't think it's -- I don't think anything has really changed all that significantly. Over the years, it's been a very profitable distribution channel for the retailers. I expect it to continue. There are more retailers coming into the sector because of the fact that it is profitable for a number of the retailers. I also think what we've done, that is Simon, has increased the scale, the design elements, the layout for the outlet industry in total. We brought it to the front door as opposed to the backdoor of retailers. We brought new tenants in. And I think we've had an absolute direct impact on bringing new retailers into that sector and helping it take it out of the or less out of the -- more in the mainstream.", "Mickey, I love Mickey. Mickey makes lots of comments to those things, some of which had been directed at me in good fun. But the fact of the matter is it's a profitable business. We've had a lot to do with taking it out of kind of the backdoor and the front door. We've had a lot to do with the design and enhancing the look and feel of the product and also moving the product in better locations and bringing more tenants into it.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "David, it's Ross Nussbaum. I had an off-topic question, which pertains to your presence as the largest REIT in the industry and whether you had any thoughts on the increasing number of C corps that are converting to REITs and/or restructuring into opco/propcos and what kind of implications you think this trend has on the REIT industry overall.", "David E. Simon", "Well, that's a good question. I mean, I am starting to get a little bit concerned, maybe too strong a word, but I am getting a little bit concerned that the basic fundamentals of why companies are REITs is because they're in the real estate business and they're focused on growing their cash flow from their business as opposed to the opco/propco. I think the opco/propco has not worked its financing vehicle. I'm sure the investors are sophisticated to know which ones are primarily used for that vehicle. And so I'm getting a little bit concerned. I haven't had a chance. I've been too busy, frankly, to talk to NAREIT about what their whole view on this is. But the basic fundamentals of real estate investing with a seasoned management team, with quality real estate that can invest and grow their business is there. It's stronger than ever. And the returns, the cash flow, dividend increase for a number of companies has been remarkable in terms of the face of capital coming and going into the industry. The history of results for our industry has been phenomenal. I'm proud of our industry. I do think, though, if we get a little bit -- if it turns into a financing vehicle, I don't think it'll have a taint on the existing successful companies like ours, but I do think there should be a caution thrown to the wind with some of those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "David, I know you tend not to provide same-store NOI growth figures, but I was just wondering if you could sort of talk about what you did in 2012 successfully and maybe what may not repeat. Or are there some items that may be headwinds this year that we should be thinking about, so that 4.8% may or may not repeat? And I'll start there.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, 4.8% is an unbelievable execution. And let me just say this: I've read some of this commentary on our fourth quarter. I mean, I find it humorous because we look at it -- we look at our comp NOI on a year basis, not on a quarterly basis. And the important number is 4.8%. If you go -- also go back last quarter -- last quarter in 2011, we had a 4.5% increase. Yet, our quarterly or annual 2011 was 3.5%. So occasionally quarters are going to have a little extra performance, either overperformance or underperformance or right on performance. But, my goodness, focus on the year. The year was 4.8%. The other thing to focus on is that our comp NOI is -- what is it, Steve? 99%?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, $4.05 billion.", "David E. Simon", "So it's $4.05 billion, if you didn't hear that. 99% of our portfolio. We don't play games with it. It's in our 8-K. It's right there. So I felt like I had to mention that because I've seen some analyst comments on that. But put that as a side, look, we are -- in our plan for next year is not to achieve the 4.8%. I mean, that was a -- for the Outlets and the Mall business, that was an extraordinary year. It's not doable, frankly. Maybe we can execute that, but we'd like to be conservative and thoughtful. That's in our guidance. We certainly want to hit our numbers that we produce. We have an unbelievable track record of producing that, rivals any public company in the country. And so we'll see. There's always headwinds in our business. Tenants coming, tenants going, bankruptcies. What the guys are doing in Washington, are not executing the way we want. It's never perfect. It's never as good as we want it to be and never as bad as you think it's going to be. But in the meantime, we're $2 over our 2008 number per share. Our dividend is $1 higher and growing. We're doing lots of redevelopment and new development. So you know what? I think we'll just do fine.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess we're coming up kind on the -- year anniversary of the Kl\u00e9pierre investment, and I know you've been a bit reticent to talk about at least some of the operational changes or impact that you might be having on the company. Is it still too early to talk about those? Or can you share some of your thoughts with us on that?", "David E. Simon", "Well, that the -- Steve, operations take time to manifest itself. And -- but we -- in conjunction with the management and the board -- we don't run the company, first of all. But in conjunction with the management and the board, and as Chairman, I mean, we give a lot of strategic advice. So what have we done? We've done asset sales to increase the financial performance or the -- to decrease the LTV and increase the financial firepower. We had EUR 2 billion of liquidity. We've re-branded the company from 2 brands to 1 brand and Segese [ph] to Kl\u00e9pierre, we're -- we've decided to get out of the office business to focus entirely on retail real estate. They did a great job of executing 3 terrific new developments and -- in Sweden and France that if you had a chance to visit, you'd be very proud of. We brought in a new COO that used to work for us at Simon Ivanhoe and worked at Unibuy. The company is rejuvenated in terms of marketing and operations. So I think we've done a lot. And the good news is, it's been a good investment. It will be, I think, a better investment. It has an element of risk. But the fact that they produce comp NOI growth with all the negative said about Europe is pretty damn good work. And we're proud of our association. We're proud of our investment. We're making big and good progress there that will again take time operationally. But we're also -- we brought -- are buying in Claymeres [ph], their other publicly traded vehicle, and we'll end up monetizing those assets over time. So I think there's been a tremendous amount of work. I'm surprised you don't see that.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "No, I was just trying to figure out if you thought that there were real sort of synergies on the leasing side or things that would maybe accelerate some of that growth. But let me just last question. Can you just talk sort of about Brazil and China? I know you've kind of been dipping your toe into those 2 markets. And you didn't really mention them, so I'm curious kind of what your thoughts are as we sit here today.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, turning to China, we continue to underwrite a couple of Premium Outlet deals. I continue to be very cautious about China, to build anything and including outlets. So there's really nothing new to say there other than it's taking longer to find the right deal to do, which is fine with me. We have plenty to do. I think the returns, the -- trying to get to the numbers, understanding tenant demand, understanding what's a great site, the ability to build expeditiously is very complicated in China. And we have on-ground experience, as you know, that wasn't a great experience for us. But nevertheless, we continue to see whether or not there's an outlet opportunity there. But it's slow going. And the fact of the matter is that's fine with us. In Brazil, we continue to work with BR Malls on one project. It's going through the permitting process there. It's taking some time. Assuming we get the permits, we would still have an interest in doing that. There's no certainty that, that will be accomplished, but a site's been identified. And we think we feel good about it if, in fact, we get the right to build stuff, satisfy it, and there's also a couple of others that we're looking at. But both of these markets are complicated. Both of these markets warrant a high level of due diligence, a high level of thoughtfulness. And we're exhibiting that by not just willy-nilly plowing capital in there but really waiting for the right opportunity that can justify the risk. And make sure the returns are there, which, Steve, frankly, is questionable on some of the ones that we've looked at and turned down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "David, maybe we'll give you a rest and ask Steve a question to start off. Steve, you guys obviously just did some recent debt financing. One of those was a 5-year issuance. And just looking at how the 10-year has backed up, in 2019, it's a little bit light. But given how the 10-year has backed up, if you guys were going to go on the market again, would you just issue 10 and maybe another 30 year? Or would you still look to sort of fill in some of the near term?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Alex, it's a good question. It's really a couple of things: We've been really focused in this period of historically low interest rates in extending duration wherever we can. And in fact, if you look at the 8-K, for a portfolio that's $28 billion of debt, we moved the needle and extended duration by almost half a year and lowered our average borrowing cost for -- by 23 basis points. So our primary focus is locking in rates and extending duration wherever we can. The December offering happened to be a specific interest or situation, where we have a hole in our maturity schedule that was shorter term, and this -- the 5-year demand was so good that we issued shorter paper. But the focus is going to be primarily on longer-duration stuff.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question is, just going to the Paragon. I mean, obviously, you guys have your own outlet program, but you've already done a few deals now with the Paragon guys. Is there sort of a relationship there where as they source deals, they know they sort of have an exit? If a deal fits a certain criteria, they know they can sell it to you? Or they -- were those 2 just sort of one-offs?", "David E. Simon", "Well, first of all, those deals, we were originally in as a partner in the deal during the development phase. So -- or construction phase. So I don't know if you know that, but that's the first point. But yes, we have a very good relationship with Paragon. I mean, there's no exclusivity on their behalf, on our behalf. We're talking to them on a couple of other deals. David Lichtenstein is a shareholder in the company, we've -- as part of the Prime transaction. So there's a good relationship. We continue to talk about new stuff. And -- but there's no requirement or exclusivity on either side.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "But as they're talking to tenants about pre-leasing, can they talk about -- I mean, obviously, they do talk about the relationship and the fact that Simon the Premium Outlet brand, may be the one ending up managing these? I would imagine that, that would be helpful as they're trying to pre-lease. Can they say that or not the case?", "David E. Simon", "It's really -- it's a deal-by-deal basis, and it's really not the case necessarily. If we do something at the outset, that's a 50-50 partnership, and we're both leasing it. That's certainly the case. But Livermore and Grand Prairie, we did -- we were not involved in leasing or managing. We had nothing to do with it. They did an unbelievable job on their own. And when we got involved, it was essentially pre-let. If there's a couple of ground-up things that we come in at the beginning, we may lease jointly. But in Grand Prairie and Livermore, they did all the work themselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On the -- just on the core a little bit. Your occupancy at 95.3%, I mean, at what point are you getting -- I mean, it's a little bit different than what you reported prerecession because of the outlets that -- I mean, what point are you getting to where you think you're at a frictional minimum in terms of vacancy, and kind of what does that mean then for -- if so, what does that mean for your ability to push rents a little bit harder?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'll just say this, in our plan for '13, we do have an increase in occupancy for the portfolio. It obviously is getting more challenging than it has as we've increased the occupancy. But we're also focused on improving the mix, and we have some deals that are shorter term, and we're trying to clean those out and go longer term. So there's a hell of a lot to do. And we'll -- and we're bound to get certain stores back because of either bankruptcy and/or the tenant is shrinking its store fleet because of their own issues. But we do have -- we do have a plan to increase our occupancy this year. But as important and more importantly is improving the mix and lengthening some of the shorter term leases into full 7-, 8-year leases as opposed to 1-, 2- or 3-year deals.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So -- I mean, if any -- if I think about it in terms of lease spread, your numbers have been around 10% for a while. Is there any reason to think they might change this year?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Yes. In terms of our spread, no. We should be able to -- I mean, look, we're subject to -- as unfortunate as it might be, we're subject to the U.S. economy. I wish we could figure out the model where we weren't, but we are. So I mean, based on what we know today, I would think that we'd be able to achieve those kind of rental spreads.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just on the dividend. I mean, is there any -- first, '13, the dividend policy, you're going to keep doing what you've been doing over the past in terms of the quarterly adjustment?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're getting -- it's safe to say we're getting closer to our taxable income. So I think the growth rate will -- at 4.60, we're getting much closer to our taxable income, and we'll have to see how that manages itself this year. But we'll be paying, as I said, at least 4.60, but we'll have to assess it every quarter. But we are getting closer to our taxable income.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just a last question on Woodfield. I mean, any -- as you look at it now, anything that you think could be done there interesting in the near term, or is it just more of a longer term?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Paul, this is Rick. We are all over Woodfield, and frankly, we think there are a number of things we could do in both the operating expense category, the marketing category. It is a massive property. It's over 2.2 million square feet, almost 890,000 feet of center section. So we've got a lot of flexibility in how we can deal with that space to maximize the NOI and bring in different users and create incremental uses and drive the NOI there by making more efficient use of the existing space. David Contis and his team's been up there a number of times, and they're very focused on what we can do. And I think you'll be seeing a number of things implemented over the next few months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Just on the topic of Woodfield, what led you to JV Mission Viejo with CalPERS? Was it in terms of accessing the deal for Woodfield or did you want to reduce your exposure to Southern California somewhat?", "David E. Simon", "No, Cedrik, actually they have had Miller and CalPERS as partners. And they're  -- our partners have had a tremendous business in investing in top-quality regional malls. So they're -- they didn't want to reduce their overall exposure, and so it was one of those things where we talked about one other mall that was not in California. We really said, here are 2 malls that would meet their criteria. We obviously have a lot more but we just narrowed it down to 2. And we did that. In addition -- and Steve was intimately involved -- in addition, they actually wanted California exposure.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That's correct.", "David E. Simon", "So that's why they -- between the 2 that we discussed, they chose Mission because they did want to increase to their California exposure.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And are you able to share the cap rates that were used to value each property?", "David E. Simon", "They were exactly the same. So in other words, $1 of cash flow from Woodfield was valued at the same value, it was $1 of cash flow from Mission.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just going back to the short-term deals or short-term tenants question from earlier, as you transitioned some of those short-term tenants, or that space as currently leased to short-term tenants, to something longer, do you need to find new tenants? And if so, what kind of retailers are primarily growing in those spaces?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, one, if you keep track, we made substantial progress in the last quarter in reducing the amount of the specialty leasing agreements we have in excess of the 12 months. The -- what we're doing is we're bringing in a number of new tenants and for the most part, we're taking that space and incorporating it into existing spaces to create appropriate rooms. And I'm not going to give you the usual litany of new tenants that are coming to the mall spaces David always joked to me about, but we do have a number of tenants that are looking for larger footprints. And 3 that are particularly relevant, H&M, ZARA and UNIQLO, are looking to have footprints that are in the 20,000- to 25,000-foot range, and that requires significant reconfigurations of existing space, some pretty unique property solutions to satisfy those needs, and we want to do so because they're great retailers. And that's one of the real sources of incremental demand.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then final question, perhaps, going back to the outlet business a little bit. What's the appetite on the part of potential institutional joint venture partners to take positions in some of the outlet properties?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we like owning generally 100% of an asset. So we've never really pursued it. But it would be -- the Woodfield mission is a great example of how we think about joint venturing. If it's a new opportunity that we couldn't otherwise access, it's great to partner with a highly respected group like Miller and CalPERS. But for us to bring in a JV partner in any of our outlet business, we -- first of all, we just don't see -- there's a lot of growth in that business, and we don't -- it's not like we can't access capital if we need it. We've got, obviously, a significant amount of retained earnings and cash flow that we plowed back into the business to accelerate our growth, as evidenced by our growth over the last 2 or 3 years. But there's no doubt in my mind that if, in fact, we desire that the institutional investors would certainly have a high degree of interest. We get solicited all the time and we kind of just poo-poo it. And Mills is a great example where we decided to go ahead and buy that deal as opposed to bring in another highly thought of institutional investors because we thought there were still significant growth there, and we wanted to own 100% of the assets that we ended up buying.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Could I just expand that question on CalPERS JV. We've talked about this in the past, about Simon's ability to generate higher returns out of assets than perhaps properties that come from other ownerships. Is this going to be an example you might be able to look to, David?", "David E. Simon", "I think so. I will say this, there is a significant demand, David, from institutional -- highly capitalized, highly thoughtful, highly experienced, big-time institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, to invest in retail real estate. And I just had a recent meeting that -- and that's worldwide. It's not just U.S. There's a high demand to invest in Europe. There's a high demand to find opportunities in Asia, where we can certainly parlay that interest in our corporate success into creating new opportunities for the company.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Can I stay abroad for a minute. And Japan seems to have adopted a leaf out of the Bernanke book on currency debasement. It looks like we're looking at substantial reduction in the yen-dollar rate?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Yes.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "You have fairly substantial high net asset exposure with minimal Japanese yen. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that whether it might reverse then an opportunity for a dollar buyer? And also whether you might be thinking of putting some more hedge in place on your existing assets?", "David E. Simon", "Well, were currently underhedged in terms of our -- the value that we have. And we do have a hedge of roughly $200 million and --", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "$250 million.", "David E. Simon", "$250 million, roughly. So we do have a hedge. But our asset value is much greater than that. And we also hedge -- we get cash flow repatriated through our management and development fees, advisory fees that we do hedge, and we've hedged those over a long period of time. But what we don't hedge, though, is the cash flow that's generated from the business because it's harder to hedge given a lot of that capital goes back into the business to grow, either to build something new or expand. It's something we're seriously thinking about. We are underhedged. We do -- we will suffer a little bit this year, a couple of cents if the yen stays higher than where it is, given our plan. But I think it's -- we -- I'd say we'll develop a plan here over the next month or so. But it is something we're very focused on.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Obviously, as the company gets bigger and expose -- gets higher exposure to international, I mean, you're going to have to lead the way in the sector in terms of your sophistication around this?", "David E. Simon", "Yes.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "I mean, there are some other leading companies that fall a long way short on what's needed here. Can I just -- another point of detail, on page 14 of the 8-K, your international NOI is listed at 6.3%, that's inclusive of the Klepierre, I'm assuming?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, David. This is Steve. It does include our share of the Klepierre NOI from the date of the investment on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just a first question for Rick. Just in terms of leasing in 2013 and some of the, I guess, opportunities, what's sort of the incremental leasing opportunities to push occupancy up above 95% this year that you're looking at?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well David touched on, I think, the most important one, which is what we're doing is spending a great deal of time making more efficient use of the space that we have by trying to downsize underproductive tenants. And that is a way to generate a lot more NOI out of the existing space. But the other opportunities, as I mentioned, the 3 significant international users are all fairly aggressively looking for space now. And that is a major source of demand in the properties. And we've got a number of other tenants that are having brand extensions and new international tenants that are seeking space. So it's a matter, really, of coming up with ways to create space that will be appropriate for their needs. And for the most part, at this occupancy level, it involves downsizing existing underproductive tenants or trying to create incremental space. And a great example of that is Walt Whitman, where we are literally adding significant square footage across the entire front of the property by expanding it, and that's enabling us to bring in a significant number of new impact retailers.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And I guess that feeds into the second question I had. Just in terms of the development pipeline in the U.S., which is about $1 billion, if you include all of the re-anchoring that you're doing. Could you maybe just talk about what the shadow pipeline is, if you would, to look forward over the next sort of 3 or 4 years? What's the kind of volume of capital you're looking at putting back into the U.S? And how are you thinking about returns and construction costs and some of the trends in that development pipeline?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, we have said previously, and we think this is going to be the case, that we can foresee spending at pretty much that same $1 billion rate over the next couple of years. And that's the combination of the announced projects that are already underway. We're working on some new premium outlet deals. We're working on several significant redevelopment opportunities in the mall portfolio that David has talked about in the past. We've announced Nordstrom at Del Amo, Bloomingdale's at Stamford. And we still have a significant pipeline of opportunities in this portfolio that's going to enable us to deploy that level of capital at our historic returns.", "David E. Simon", "If you were to use the -- and the euros actually do a pretty good job in terms of how they look at the -- their pipeline. But we -- I'd say our controlled pipeline is at least $5 billion, as Rick mentioned, between the redevelopments, the field -- Roosevelt Fields, included in that field [ph], and the Copleys, and the Alamos of the world, and including the new development. So I'd say our controlled pipe is around $5 billion, and that's over a 3-, 4-year period of time. And that will give you a sense -- I mean, projects come in and projects go out, but that's kind of the order of magnitude that we see.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. Just had a question on Klepierre. Given that -- in fact, that this is the 10-year anniversary of the tax, there certainly is an element that, at some point, perhaps you can take this thing private over the course of this year or next. I guess, where do you sort of stand in terms of the desire to sort of increase your ownership? What is your relationship with BNP Paribas and their desire to sell stake and sort of how are your thoughts evolving on that?", "David E. Simon", "Well, these also are very simple, straightforward questions that I'm really not going to answer other than -- I will say this, we have an excellent relationship with BNP. They've been very supportive from the get-go, once we got the deal negotiated. And they make valuable contributions at the Supervisory Board level. But the rest, Michael, I'm really not going to comment on. We are pleased with our investment. It's going to take time, but I still think there's a unique opportunity here to turn Klepierre into a really premier retail real estate company in Continental Europe. It's going to take time. I'm very patient on this. \"Reasonably,\" I should say. I hope the market here is reasonably patient. But the fact of the matter is for the last -- shoot, the deal closed in late March, early April, I mean, we've done a lot of good stuff in a very short period of time, getting the company rejuvenated toward what we think is the -- allows them -- again, subject to a lot more improvement, but at least gives them the path toward preeminence in Continental European retail real estate.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then you had mentioned Copley, which I don't think yet is in the 8-K in terms of schedule. I guess when are you thinking about breaking ground, and are you thinking rental or condo? And I guess both would have a difference in terms of capital deployment or net capital invested at the end of the day.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, the vast -- we're still designing the building. And we may need -- because of that design, we may need to go back through some administrative approvals that we don't think will be a big deal. But the idea that we're circling right now is to do mostly rentals, though there will be some condo element to it. And so you'd have essentially a hybrid building.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question, just Sears and JCPenney. Obviously, you had some changes at Sears at the helm this quarter, I'm just curious how you sort of think about how that evolves. And then in terms of the JCPenney sort of rebranded stores, and any within your portfolio about, I guess, how you're sort of viewing those performing relative to the others within the portfolio.", "David E. Simon", "Well, Sears, I -- it's -- I really can't comment all that much on the management changes. I don't sense it's a huge deal there. So I'm not -- I don't think that's any major, major move on their front. And Penney, I like the new stores. Rick and I visited the new complete prototype, but we've also seen some of the new shops within the shops at some of our malls. We don't have all the data yet. It's -- I'm really not in the position to comment on how successful it is. They are -- I like what I see, and they're making progress. But the financial implications of that change is really best left for them to describe. And I assume they're coming out with their earnings here shortly, I would imagine. So we'll look forward to hearing more in terms of the progress. But just from a mall owner's point of view, rejuvenating that brand, Penney, that is, is welcome. And we're working with them to be supportive of their efforts in rejuvenating the brand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I think this one is for Rick on leasing spreads. I'm curious about market rents, in particular, because if I look at your -- I guess, it's the closing rate on leases, it's been moving lower over the last year, but the opening rate has been relatively flattish. Can you speak to the trends in market rents here in the U.S.? Because I'm wondering if the growth has been obscured a little bit, maybe by a mix issue in the leases that you're signing.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, frankly, we continue to see our average base rent go up quarter-over-quarter, and it has been consistently. So I would tell you that we still have pricing power. If you look at our occupancy cost percentage, it's still relatively low. We have significant demand and we're able to continue to grow, I think, to grow those rents.", "David E. Simon", "I think you really got to look at the spread, and that's the more driving -- I mean, mix always is moving around, what's expiring, what's coming up. But if look at kind of what the expiration schedule is and the incoming rents, I mean, you'll see the spread is there to be had if we execute.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess in that regard, right now, and thinking about the spreads down the road. I mean, specific to anchor expirations, I think in 2014, the expiring anchor rent just sort of north of $5. In most of recent years, that's been sort of between $2 and $4. Is that something that leads you to think that leasing spreads could decelerate a little bit in 2014, or is that just something unique there?", "David E. Simon", "The anchors invariably have options, so I wouldn't -- that really has very little drive in our income.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then a question, David, I guess for you, in the -- on asset pricing because a few of your competitors have put out portfolios in malls, in the market, that are generally kind of in the $300 square foot range for sales productivity. What's your sense in where assets like those are pricing today in this capital market, given your experience with recent mall sales?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, I -- it's really better left for them to explain what their pricing expectations are. The latest data that we have seen is what Westfield sold to Starwood. There's not much new beyond that. But I will tell you that some of the assets that are being sold, I find very aggressive pricing. I mean, there was this auction in Kansas City, kind of -- really not sure what it is. It used to be a lifestyle center, turned outlet, turned -- just a place where -- line [ph] center, but just a place where -- it's big, so you'd lease it to whomever you can lease it to. That pricing was pretty aggressive. So I mean, I -- I'm really -- it's really -- they're really better in a position to tell you what they want to see from pricing than we are.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question, I guess, on outlet development because -- I guess, Christy touched on it earlier, but you are seeing outlet development activity kick up, or at least certainly interest in it, has it gotten to a point where you guys are seeing maybe pressure on development yields because retailers feel that they have more options for who they can align with?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think that there's certainly going to be pressure on development yields for risky or ill-conceived projects. But they always are, right? I mean, that's the case in malls, outlet centers, power centers, lifestyle centers. The minute you have to beg a tenant to go into is the minute your yield goes down to unacceptable levels. I don't think it's going to change all that much for what we're trying to accomplish. I don't -- we're not going to get every deal. We're not going to win every deal. But I think the stuff that we're looking to build, I feel very good that we'll continue to generate the returns that you've grown accustomed to. By the way, it takes a lot of work to generate those yields, but -- so I'm sure there's going to be some yields that are going to, really, be way too low because, I mean, the nature of the business is people push projects and retailers sometimes don't pass up deals that are too good to be true. So as long as it's not our own mistake, it doesn't matter to us. It doesn't impact our business. And that's what you have to understand. I mean, too many people extrapolate, well, there's going to be 4 or 5 bad outlets. It's going to have some impact on you. It's going to have no impact on us, none. And there were 100 bad lifestyle deals, it didn't really have an impact on us. We're $2 higher this year than we were in the Great Recession. That says a lot about the company's ability to withstand the -- whatever the trend is out there. So it's -- the yield compression is not an issue for SPG. It might be for others. And so there'll be some bad deals done and we'll say, \"We knew it. We told you.\" But what can we say? What can we do? We just have to do what we do.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Actually, just a follow-up, you mentioned before that you prefer to own, particularly, your JV outlet developments, 100%. But I'm curious because return interest is very strong, or interest is very strong from institutional investors out there. If there was an opportunity for you to raise capital from there, what sort of terms or return split or valuation would lead you to maybe rethink that and take on a partner?", "David E. Simon", "If somebody wanted to come at a 2% yield on Woodberry -- I think Woodberry has got better risk-free credit than United States of America, and with growth potential. So 1 800 [ph], David, 2% yield at Woodberry, maybe I'd do it. I don't even know if I would do that, frankly. Rick, would you sell it in 2%? I don't know.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "There's a lot of growth left in Woodberry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A quick question. If we're thinking about -- let me see, you've got a comparable outlet in a comparable mall, let's say they're doing -- good centers doing $600, $700 a foot, do you think there's a cap rate differential there, number one? And then if you lower it to, say, a $350 or $400 foot center, the same question, is there a cap rate differential there?", "David E. Simon", "Cap rates are so real estate-specific that we'd have to know where the leases are, what the competitive marketplace is, where is this mall or outlet center? There's so many other variables than one just simple number. The most important point that I'd like to make is -- with respect to your question, is that, go back to our involvement in the outlet business, we -- David Bloom and I did a joint venture in 1998 in the outlet business. We built Orlando and Las Vegas together. Now I was so stupid because I invested in some technology business that I had to show the market that I was maybe not great in technology, but pretty good in real estate that I -- we had $4 million in Orlando and I sold it out to him, 1 year after, it was built for $40 million, which is 10x on a real estate deal in a year, which, by the way, is -- rivals as any private equity deal done or any venture capital deal. So I thought maybe at least the market would say, \"All right, so he screwed up in technology, but at least he knows what he's doing in real estate.\"", "We've been at it a long time. We've had a dramatic impact on this industry. We've brought it out of the back room into the front room. We've brought new retailers into the business. We've redesigned it. We've brought it closer to marketplaces, like what we did in Orlando and Vegas, et cetera. So -- and because of all those efforts, at the end of the day, a great outlet is no different, I think, in the mind of the investor than a great mall. And I think you could say that a good outlet is probably not that much different than a good mall. And you could take that thinking all the way from high to the end. At the end of the day, a bad outlet and a bad mall, who the hell knows? I can't comment on that. But -- so I just think it's -- they're pretty much comparable at the end of the day. And then it gets to the specific real estate questions, like what's rent roll doing? What's sales doing? How can you expand it and all that kind of stuff that go into specific real estate questions. Now, in addition, look, we've been at it since '98, and then I think people said, \"You know what, it's not a bad business. Let's get in it.\" So I don't know. I don't know. But that's the only way I can answer your question.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Do you think you're going to see the pace of asset sales pick up this year for some of the secondary market stuff you're looking at?", "David E. Simon", "My instinct is to say yes, but it's still hard work. But my instinct is to say yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carol", "[Audio Gap]", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "We saw you and Simon put together a great project in Houston. And then in October, you all both announced plans for Charlotte. And then in November, you all decided to work together. Is it safe to assume if you and Tanger are competing in the same market, there's a high likelihood that you all would work together in the future? Or would you both try to build your own centers? Or how is that decision made?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I -- we have a very good relationship with Tanger, where we have our 1 joint venture. We've got our 2 that are in predevelopment, development phase, Columbus, Charlotte. I would find it unlikely that at the end of the day, we would both be building in the same markets at the same time. You can never say never. But I'd find it unlikely given our good track record that we have with the Tanger guys. Now, look, we -- he just built in West Phoenix, and we're building in South Phoenix. There are some overlap in the trade area, but they're really 2 separate distinct outlets. I know his was well-leased at opening. Ours is going great. We open, don't forget, April 4. And -- but I would find it unlikely that we'd have a situation where we were both actually in 2 -- in 1 trade area where we're both building at the same time. And we may be competing and finding out who's going to win, but I would find it unusual we would both build at the same time.", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "In the process of competition, do you think it's highly likely you all would join together or one would just", "[Audio Gap]", "on the vacant Nordstorm space at Circle Centre Mall in Indianapolis, have you all had any luck re-tenanting that space? Or how are the discussions going there?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we have a very nominal -- just, first of all, just so you know, we have a very nominal financial interest in it. But we're working -- I mean, the mall is doing reasonably well. We're working hard to re-tenant it, but we don't have any tenant to announce right now.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I would just make the comment that we've got 635 department stores and there are 6 vacant. So less than 1%. So...", "David E. Simon", "And that happens to be one of them.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes, that's one of them. So thanks for asking.", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "So you sound like you're in good shape. That's just one close to me, so I notice it when I shop.", "David E. Simon", "It's closer to us.", "Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division", "Yes, it's about 2 hours for me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "When I look at sales trends in January, especially the second half of January, it seems like they've been slowing, at least the research we do here. And I'm curious, have you seen January sales yet or have any indication what sales trends at your properties might look like for January?", "David E. Simon", "We don't -- Rich, we don't get our January sales until November -- oh, I'm sorry, the month later. So we won't get them until the end of February. But anecdotally, I've heard actually very good stuff. And, in fact, what was going on in Washington clearly had a reasonably down impact on the whole holiday season. Some of that picked up in January. So I've actually heard the exact opposite of that. But I haven't talked to every retailer, and I'm sure there will be some winners and losers. But generally, Rick and I were at NRF a couple of weeks ago, and we were hearing January was okay. So I don't know where you're getting that. But actually, we heard the reverse. But I'm not going to opine on that just because it's anecdotal.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, mine as well, David, same thing. Okay, good. And then, Steve, looking at the credit loss provision, it was unusually high, at least certainly higher than it's been the last couple of years this quarter, and I realize it's been pretty low. But anything special going on with credit losses or your thoughts on that?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "No, Rich. And, in fact, I'd look at it more on an annual basis and not worry so much about an individual quarter, no different than the comment David made earlier about NOI. And if you look at it on an annual basis, it's still relatively below kind of historical norms for us as a percentage of revenue.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So no reason to think that goes higher substantially in '13?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "No, sir. In fact, I would tell you that the '12 actual is probably a pretty decent run rate for the entire year '13.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then last thing, guys, on -- back to Paragon for just a second. It seems, David, that you get in to projects like this maybe a bit later in the process. And hence, if you did get in to another one, it might be well along the way. So it would deliver much quicker, I guess, is one way to think about it. And I noticed they had one in the Twin Cities, I think, they were working on and probably have others. Are there any of the other ones that you're kind of looking at with them at this point?", "David E. Simon", "We're talking to them about 1 and perhaps 2 others. But look, they're -- as I said to you, they're competent developers. Each deal is going to be a little bit different. But the good news is we can't -- given our own resources, we can't tackle every opportunity out there. We never have thought about our business that way. And it's good to have a good relationship with Paragon, just like it is with Tanger, because at the end of the day, partnering on some of these, delivering good product to our retailers, making money for our shareholders is all in the same equation. So it's a good, healthy relationship, and I would be disappointed if there weren't a couple more to do with both of them as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just going back to 2013 guidance. I mean, you have provided a bit of a road map in regards to some of your underlying assumptions about where it seems your NOI is going, where you expect occupancy to go and maintaining leasing spreads. Any other kind of tidbits you could give us in regards to what's underlying your 2013 guidance?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we go through -- we are a large company. We got $80 billion of assets. We're in Europe. We're in Japan, Korea. We're in the mall business, the outlet business. We -- we've got development yields that we're trying to achieve, redevelopment. So, so much goes into how we do it. The most important is that we're dedicated to producing the results that we tell the market. We've done it for 9, 10 years. I don't even know. I lost track. We used to put that in, but since no one cares, we decided to take it out. And you know what, that's the number. We just don't think it's all that critical. Maybe we're wrong. We're happy to be -- we're happy to have our arm twisted to give you all the specific detail as to what we're trying to accomplish given our track record. You know we're trying to grow our comp NOI. You know we're trying to lower the cost of our debt. You know were trying to do our development deals according to our plan that we've -- we outlined in the 8-K. You know we're trying to increase our operating margins. You know we're trying to keep our overhead reasonably sane as the company gets bigger and bigger. You know all that, and we're not going to change. We just don't think, given our track record, we need to give you each and every little detail. We're happy to get our arm twisted, yelled at. Complain to Steve, if we do. But since we're such a big, big company, but it does include comp NOI growth. That's our #1 priority. It will always be managing the overhead is critical. There's some things out of our control, interest rates, currency, execution by others that we've empowered. But you put it all in and we think it's reasonable guidance given our past history of performance.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's fair. I guess the only reason why I asked is it sounds like a lot of things are still going to be going well in 2013. You have a fair amount of acquisitions that hit late in 2012. You have all these redevelopment and development efforts coming online in 2013. I was just kind of curious, is there any kind of number in there that weighs on 2013 earnings that we should be aware of?", "David E. Simon", "As a negative?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we sold -- I mean, we have some things that are negative. For instance, I'll give you 2 or 3 that come -- pop in my mind. We sold our interest in Capital Shopping Centres. We no longer get that dividend. That was dilutive because we essentially paid down debt. We sold -- we no longer -- we have some mortgages that we owned on the hope that maybe the owners were going to default. Those got paid off. So we -- our investment income is way down. We had a couple land sales. That's a lumpy business. So there's always those kind of things that are a little bit negative that we have to earn our way back. And Steve can shed more light. I mean, those are 2 or 3 that jump to mind. We have higher -- now we don't have much floating rate debt, but we do put in higher interest rate on the short term. So we have some exposure on that. So I mentioned the currency. We're already behind our budget in currency, but that didn't change our guidance. We'll figure out hopefully how to make that up in some way, shape or fashion. But that's hurting us with the yen. Those are some of the items that jump out.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on Grand Prairie and Livermore. With those assets being 100% occupied when you acquired them, how should we kind of think about growth within that portfolio and where you expect to get that from?", "David E. Simon", "Well, they were 100% leased prior to our 100% acquisition. And we like the real estate, so the growth will be there over time but nothing imminent. I mean, there could be based upon overage rental, I should say. So sales is still a little bit unknown because there's still some overage or percent rent deals with some of the anchors. So there may be growth because those projections may be less than what they produce. And then Livermore does have an expansion opportunity, so that's a couple of years away.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just 1 last specific question for Steve. Just ad expense during the quarter went up quite a bit. Just wondering why that was so.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I'm sorry, Tayo, the advertising expense?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, expense.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That would just be seasonal, but it nets out because most of that is reimbursed by the tenant. So that's the bottom line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Maybe, David, going back to the outlets. Do you have any thoughts maybe longer term on existing outlets that get cut off by new development? Because when I look at my area in San Francisco, I think the new Livermore outlet will probably siphon off some sales from Gilroy. You look at what's happening in Ohio, it looks like Jeffersonville might get fewer until shoppers from Columbus once the new outlet center opens up in that market. Are you worried about this at all? And maybe did this back in to your decision to sell Jeffersonville 2 years ago?", "David E. Simon", "Well, Jeffersonville was a requirement. So I think it's a fine asset, and I think it's a different trade area than what Columbus deals are. But yes, look, some of these may have some impact on some existing centers. I don't think there's enough to create an alarming concern. And Liver -- Gilroy is -- that's not an easy drive to go from there to Gilroy either way. As we get -- Livermore essentially gets the East and Gilroy gets the South. You may have some -- all this stuff that we have in the Napa area are pretty focused on that weekend consumer or whatever, visitor, tourist visitor. And -- so there could be some of that but nothing that I've seen that's been overly dramatic.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So too early to worry about that issue?", "David E. Simon", "Too early. But, look, certain new deals were going to impact existing centers, whether they're outlets or malls or -- that's just the nature of the business.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure, sure. And then you had talked about a Kansas City center earlier, and I was wondering if you could tell us what center that was and maybe what the cap rate was on that sale.", "David E. Simon", "Oh, I think it was -- our read of it was around a 6% cap rate.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "What was the asset exactly?", "David E. Simon", "It's -- go ahead, Rick.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It's an open-air project that had some community center, power center components, had some full price components, had a lot of food. It was surrounded by a number of attractions in Kansas City that made it a decent location. But as David said, very big, we really analogized it to our Mills product because it could be all things to all people. But at that cap rate, it was a very significant valuation.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So unanchored, fixed cap, can you tell us what the name of that center was so that we can do more [indiscernible].", "David E. Simon", "It was called The Legends in Kansas City on the West side on the way to Topeka.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then final question. David, you made some positive comments on B malls in the past, and I wonder if you could just maybe provide your updated thoughts on this tier of your property portfolio?", "David E. Simon", "Well, the demand, I think, is picking up in it. So I think it's a lot of elbow grease. But generally, the demand is picking up in the B mall category. Sales are actually okay. And, I mean, one thing I love to look at is kind of sales year-over-year if we had any that had the decrease, and we really didn't. So I think business there is steady [indiscernible] she goes.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And when you look at our anchor additions, they are being added throughout the portfolio. I'm not going to categorize the B, C, A. But throughout the portfolio, we're adding a lot of anchors, and that obviously only helps but increase market share.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then do you think there's any institutional interest in joint venturing some B malls currently, maybe something that does below $350 a foot, something in that range?", "David E. Simon", "Well, there's a lot of the private equity money doing it. So indirectly, that is institutional interest because all of their investors are institutional investors generally or some really rich people. So...", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "What about pension funds? Any pension funds that you think you might want to take an interest in, in some of these B malls?", "David E. Simon", "I think that is more going to be done through the private equity guys, and I think there's going to be roll-up strategies generated out of those guys. The yields are good. The business is more stable. There's more players coming into that. So that's where the interest is. And I think you'll see more transactions in that whole category.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman of Cowen Group.", "Michael Gorman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions for Steve. Steve, in the past couple of years, there's been sort of a ramp-up in the regional office costs from third quarter to fourth quarter that didn't really happen this year. I was just wondering why that was and if the fourth quarter is still a good run rate for 2013.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "No, I -- Mike, for 2013, I'd look at the annual number and not necessarily the quarter number. So that kind of $125 million-ish number in total is a good number. And then how it breaks out quarter-to-quarter can depend upon a lot of seasonal things, like David mentioned, with respect to the NOI. But I'd really focus on the annual number.", "Michael Gorman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 1 more clarification. When I was looking at the 8-K, there's a footnote that talks about land sale gains of just about $8 million, and that seems a little bit different from the breakout of $4.4 million on the income statement. Is that just unconsolidated land sale gains that's the difference there? Or...", "David E. Simon", "Yes, we had one that flow through our JV.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "JV. That's correct. Bonus points.", "David E. Simon", "We love when people read our financial statements, especially when management does it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I'm here with Craig Schmidt. Just a few questions. I guess just thinking about -- 2012 clearly was just a great year for the company. David, how are you feeling, I guess, the start of this year versus last year? And what's the message to the team, I guess, for this year?", "David E. Simon", "Thank you for mentioning that. We did have a really, really good year, and I'm frankly proud of the organization that -- on all fronts, financing, operations, leasing. Basically, there were really no -- we really executed well, and I appreciate those comments. I appreciate you pointing those out because we worked our ass off in '12 to deliver that. And we had a lot of moving pieces, as we always do, and we did a lot of deals. People forget about all the deals that we did. So -- and hopefully, the fruits of those investments have -- did show, to some extent in '12, but they'll show more importantly in '13 and '14. So thank you for highlighting that. Look, our -- we're the old Green Bay Packers, 3 yards in a cloud of dust. If our -- if we said anything different to our people, they would -- they'd be shocked. So we're not -- we're pleased with what we did in '12. We got a lot going on in '13 already. And I think what we're doing at the property level in terms of our reinvestment is a huge focus, and delivering the redevelopment yields that we want is very, very important to -- for both the consumer and the retailer. And I just think it's more of the same of what we do. We -- and I would hope to be able to have another year like that in '13, but it takes a lot of work. There's always the unknown out there. We are spending a lot of capital so we got to produce the returns that we want in that capital invested. We have a good track record, but that doesn't necessarily mean you can produce it. The mall teams are in good shape. Outlets team is in good shape. We're still working through our international, how to beef that up. The Mills team is in good shape. So generally, I'm pleased, but as everybody knows around here, we don't rest. We fight and we continue to work to have another good year.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess addressing maybe one of our concerns or question marks on the consumer. Any particular area you're more worried about, whether it's luxury or at the aspirational shopper or the middle-income shopper?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think, over a long period of time, the middle-income person has been squeezed. And that always -- I don't want to get into this big macro discussion because people will either disagree or I'll bore them to death. But look, that's a big focus. It's always been a big concern. But we're in a good spot because we have that bifurcated product. We have the high-end, and that continues to do well. Look, it will ebb and flow, but at the end of the day, the people there have purchasing power. And there may be a bad quarter or 2 of sales, but they're going to -- those assets are only going to get better. And we're very well-represented in the value side. So we have that bifurcation like what the retailers are trying to accomplish. We have some stuff in the middle that gets squeezed. We have the ability to manage those reasonably well. That does retard our growth rate to some extent because some of those asset's cash flow does go down. But generally, the bifurcation that is out there between looking for value or looking for the higher-end product is no better represented than what we do. We're the best representative of what's out there is what I really should say.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then turning to the Internet, I don't believe you guys really discussed that. Just coming for the holidays and it seems like more of the discussion from the retailers coming out at some of the latest conferences has been recognizing the importance of using the Internet, along with bricks and mortar. I don't know if there's anything new you've been talking to retailers about, any new thoughts on how to leverage your properties, anything -- any new initiatives.", "David E. Simon", "Well, there's lots -- we could go through lots of what we're doing on the digital front, marketing and everything else. But I'd say that -- I don't -- I would just say this. The good news of all of this is that, in my opinion, the retailers clearly need stores, clearly want to invest in stores. And I think all the technology will enhance their ability to deliver better service to the stores that they have as we will also. I think we'll able to enhance our service levels through the use of technology, and I think that's critical in today's environment. I have yet to see, frankly, and it may come one day. But I've yet to see a retailer say they're not spending money, opening new stores because they're reallocating capital more toward the Internet. Now we may cross that fulcrum at some point, but I haven't seen it. And I think what it also means is they're going to be selective on where they go and what they want to do. But I'm a strong believer that good real state will get stronger and better. And I've said to you for a number of years, the retail real estate, some of it will become obsolete. We've seen it in some of our assets. It's unfortunate, but that's reality. But I think we'll more than make up for it as demand is more focused on the better real estate, which we own a vast preponderance of. And -- but I think technology is ultimately going to end up being useful to delivering a better product and service to our consumers and make it a more enjoyable experience.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, it's Craig here. I just -- my question focuses on The Mills. Could you talk a little bit about the redevelopment at Sawgrass? And then maybe, in general, the opportunities or direction given, as you mentioned, the significant reinvestment in The Mills in 2012?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, there's a couple of things that are going on at Sawgrass, Craig. First, we took back the Wannado use that was a children's interactive retailer. It's about 110,000 feet. That's been completely redivided now into new tenants, and they're all open. And that's doing very well. It's added a new entrance into the mall. We added Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and that's doing well. We're opening later, thinking early second quarter, an expansion of The Colonnade, which is our upscale outlet presentation at Sawgrass. And that's going to have almost exclusively high-end designers with their only location in Southeast Florida. And that -- that's 100% leased, and we'll be doing very well. We still have another 400,000 feet of FAR [ph] at Sawgrass, and we're actively working on programs to further expand the square footage there and reconfigure it. And we're also working on a renovation of the Oasis, which is the open-air section of the property. We just added a California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory and bringing that up. So a very powerful property, doing very well and a major focus of redevelopment efforts and capital.", "David E. Simon", "And I would -- I just would add. This mall will do over $100 million of EBITDA. And in the next 2 to 3 years, it'll probably be over $120 million, without the expansion, the big expansion that Rick just mentioned. So it's a beast, but don't tell anybody, okay?", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just 1 last question for Steve. In Brazil, Steve, anything new on the financing front? Anything -- oh, the capital markets there, I'm not sure if there's any new opportunities for a U.S. real estate company there.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "In Brazil?", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "You mean in terms of raising dollars in Brazil?", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "In terms of tapping line of credit there for you -- so you could have natural hedge in anything you invest in.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "No, not really. No. We really haven't made any investments yet, so -- but no.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.", "Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But really quick on Tayo's question. So when you guys give guidance, there's kind of 2 groups. There are companies that throw in spec acquisitions that they haven't made yet, and then you have guys like the Boston Properties that just give a no-acquisition guidance. And then to the extent you get stuff done later in the year, the numbers end up going up. And is that part of why you did so well in 2012 versus your initial guidance? And for 2013, is that how you've set it up as well?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me -- certainly, we did have some growth because of our investments that we hadn't planned on. But yes, let me make it clear. In 2013, we have no spec acquisitions at all. So nothing -- no spec investments.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue. And I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Well, thank you so much for your participation, and we look forward to chatting in the near future.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Simon", "Good morning. Our results for the quarter were strong. FFO was $2.05 per share, up 12.6% from the first quarter of 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus at quarter end by $0.05 per share. For our Malls and Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 4.8% and that was off a 5.7% increase in Q1 of 2012. Tenant sales were up 5.3% to $575 per square foot. Occupancy, up 110 basis points to 94.7%. Base minimum rent per square foot was 3% higher and our re-leasing spread was a positive 13.4% or $7 per square foot. We were very active in the debt markets during the quarter closing our locking rates on 13 new loans, totaling approximately $2 billion, of which our share was $1.3 billion, the average rate was 2.92%, and a weighted average term of a little over 8 years.", "Let me turn to the all important development activity. First of all, we opened the Phoenix Premium Outlet Centers in Chandler, Arizona on April 4. This center is 100% leased, open with an impressive collection of stores. I will not name them, Rick will if you're interested. Several high profile stores will be opening in the coming weeks, and the good news is the shopper response has been very strong and many merchants reporting as one of their best outlet openings in the last couple of years.", "Shisui Premium Outlets opened on April 19. This our ninth center in Japan. It's located 15 minutes from Narita International Airport, serving Greater Tokyo. The center opened with large crowds and 70 media outlets opening, and we expect this to be a terrific center serving the area of visitors to Tokyo, given the proximity of the airport. Significant redevelopment projects were completed during the quarter; Apple Blossom Mall, Quaker Bridge Mall and South Hills Village. Several significant projects are on track for completion in 2013, including expansions in Sawgrass Mills, Dadeland Mall, Seattle Premium Outlets, Orlando Premium Outlets at Vineland, Walt Whitman Shops, and the and the re-grand opening of the shops at The Shops at Nanuet and the University Town Plaza in Pensacola.", "Redevelopment expansion projects including the addition of acres and big bucks tenants are underway at 44 properties in the U.S., 2 in Asia. Our share of this cost is approximately $1 billion and the blended estimated rate of return is approximately 11%. We have 3 Premium Outlet Centers under construction, opening in the third quarter of this year. St. Louis Premium Outlets in Chesterfield, Missouri, opening in August 1, which is 96% leased. Toronto Premium Outlets in Ontario, Canada, opening August 22, which is 85% currently leased. Busan Premium Outlets in Korea, opening in late August. As we highlight in the press release, demand for space in all of these centers has been exceptional and we expect to be fully leased at opening.", "We also have at least 8 additional new Premium Outlet projects in North America in various stages of predevelopment. Kl\u00e9pierre reported its first quarter revenues this week. You can read about them, so I'll be brief other than to say that rents were up for the quarter a total of 3.4% reaffirmed 2013 guidance. We've now owned our stake for 13 months. Progress has been made in several aspects of the business. They have sold EUR 760 million of assets. They have simplified their business with the elimination of the [indiscernible] sub-brand, as well as the ongoing sale of the office portfolio.", "Their focus on operations, we've added a new CEO. They're generating additional Simon brand venture-type revenues, as recently evidenced by the Coca-Cola partnership. They strengthened their balance sheet through recent financing activities and they've opened 2 great malls in St. Lazare, Paris and Emporia in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. And I think if anyone has had the opportunity to visit it, visit those centers, you'll see that the company has clearly the capability to build first-class 21st century retail.", "Today, we announced the dividend of $1.15 per share for the quarter. Over the past 6 quarters, we have increased the common stock dividend each quarter as we've been playing catch up to our taxable income. Our growth rate in our dividend has been over 31% over the last 2 years. Importantly, we anticipate, subject to review and Board approval, increasing our dividend as we anticipate our taxable income continuing to grow.", "Guidance. Today we increased the top and the bottom line of our 2013 FFO guidance to a current range of $8.50 to $8.60 per share. This is an increase from $0.10 from the initial guidance in February of $8.40 to $8.50 per share. Strong operating performance is the driver of this increase.", "Occupancy. Reasonable Mall and Premium occupancy cost of 11.3% and strong rent spreads give us good momentum. Finally, '13 is off to a good start, and we're ready to answer any of your questions that you'd like to post.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector of Bank of America", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's Craig Schmidt here. It sounds like you've made real progress on your dispositions at Kl\u00e9pierre. Maybe you could give some more color on what's left to do, as well as maybe some of your refurbishes that you've done in the portfolio, and any successes you've had in bringing new retailers to your Kl\u00e9pierre portfolio?", "David E. Simon", "Well, first of all, they will continue to sell non-core assets as well as the office portfolio. So they've got a couple of the office deals that are close to being signed up, including their headquarters. And they'll continue to sell kind of the smaller non-core assets, which frankly are very stable, solid centers, but they don't have the extension capabilities that we're interested in pursuing. And they've done a great -- a number of extensions like Plessui [ph] in Paris. On the east side of Paris, near the airport that I think represents the ability to take a smaller center and expand it. And on the retail front, we're continuing to solidify that. The operational side of the business is the true upside, the coordination among retail, what we do at Simon-brand ventures. How we operate the centers is the next chapter in the story. Obviously that takes some time. We've had to add to the personnel ranks, we had to set the strategy and we're pleased with what's going on there, and I think there'll be more to come.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And are you surprised that -- are you surprised that your ability to push rents, given the general difficulty in Europe?", "David E. Simon", "Look, I don't run this day-to-day. There -- some of these questions are better asked for them. We are not the ones pushing the rents. We're providing strategic advice and helping them focus on what is important in their business and also, showing them how we run our business so they can run their business. I'm not surprised that a number of those countries have stability in cash flow in tough economic times. I think what you've seen here in the U.S. is that the same thing happened here for us in very tough economic times. And the one area that -- where they're having the most difficulty is in Spain. And that is a focus for the company, but that continues to be something that is affecting the cash flow to some extent is because Spain continues to be under pressure for basically all retail real estate owners that have real estate in Spain.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. I was impressed with your 96% lease in St. Louis. Do you know how much will open in August?", "David E. Simon", "We should be in the 90s. There's always a few laggers, but that's a real number and we should be in the 90s. I mean, even though we'd love to open every center at 100% leased and operate it, sometimes it does take time. Phoenix is a great example. We're at 100% leased. We were in the kind of the low 90s to be at opening, but in the last couple of months, we'll be 100% occupied. Same thing will happen in St. Louis. There may be a couple of slow people, but we are 96% leased.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Follow up on Craig's question about the outlets. Can you disclose the expected yields at Chandler and St. Louis for 2013 and maybe discuss some pre-leasing progress at Columbus and Charlotte?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, our yields in the outlet business continue to be attractive. These will be double-digit yields unquestionably, and Chandler will be probably north of 10%, St. Louis will at or about 10%. And in addition, as you may probably know, we're looking at Phase 2 now and, obviously, as we bring that online in St. Louis, we will -- the yields will go up. But they're both north of 10%. They are both north of 10%. Now on your question on Columbus, let me just say this, Columbus is a very competitive market. There's a lot of folks that have competing real estate there and sites. So we'll see, we may or may not be the victor in that competition, but we're working to continue to try and move that forward. Charlotte is basically a go deal. So with us in Tanger, we expect to start construction in the next 2 months. We're very excited about that project. I'm not going to tell you what the yield is because I don't know what Tanger does, but it will be very, very good. The retailers are very happy that we have put together our joint venture. They -- we very excited about going in and it's got to be at least over 50%, 60% pre-leased. Not that we really need it because the one thing that we know is we have 80 Premium Outlets in the world, I think. So we don't, Christy, we don't really need to pre-lease like some others that might, because we kind of know whether or not we can lease it. But Charlotte's go, starting construction here shortly and we're racing to do a '14 opening.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then I know that you continue to do quite a bit of anchor in big-box repositioning. Can you talk a little bit about what the retailer demand is like today for Mall anchor space? How you think about getting that space back from a re-tenanting perspective. And are sale leasebacks of anchor space something that you would consider if a major tenant came to you looking to raise capital?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Christy, it's Rick Sokolov. The demand is as good as it has ever been, and I think that, that can be referenced by the number of spaces we have available. In our mall portfolio, we literally have 635 department stores and 1% of them, 6 or 7, are vacant. And that's the lowest it has been in as long as I can remember. We actively deal with every one of our malls to keep a running list of the people that have demand to get in there, and we are in a constant dialogue with our anchors that we've identified that we have the potential of getting back to try and make them better. And if you look over the years, I think we've added almost 175 boxes and anchors over the last 4 years in the portfolio. So we've been very active and it's making them a lot better. I do not believe we would really be interested in entertaining sale leasebacks.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And are you able to of quantify maybe a range of what you might pay for vacant anchor box space for the Class A mall versus the Class B mall?", "David E. Simon", "Well, each deal is very, very -- depends on a lots of individual characteristics of each deal. It's not really something that you can generalize about.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "It's Ross Nussbaum. One final question. The 4.8% same-store NOI growth you've generated this quarter, if I think about that relative to the occupancy gains you had and the re-leasing spreads over the last  year, it kind of feels like there's something else that's helping that number. Is there a piece there that I'm not thinking about?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, partly is good sales growth, partly is that we're very focused on operating to the best of our ability. I would point out, last quarter, Q1 '12, we had 5.7% comp increase. So that 4.8% on top of 5.7% is just running the company as well as we can. But we're never satisfied. We're always trying to improve, and that's what we're all about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On your re-leasing stats, the opening number went from $53 to $55 [ph] , and I guess it's a 12-month trailing average. And so, I mean how much of your -- is there a disproportionate share opening in the first quarter because I'm trying to see the kind of forecast that number out it was a big jump given that is a rolling average?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Paul, this is Steve. Some of it is mix. In the mall business especially, there are more leases that are tied to traditional retailer's fiscal year end, which is January 31. And in fact, if you look at the supplemental, as I recall, the remaining square footage that we have expiring in '13 is in the 3 million to 4 million square foot range, where over a normal year like 2014, 2015, it's 8 to 9 million square feet. So we have dealt with a lot of the -- especially regional mall expirations that occurred January 31.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. That makes sense. And then, I mean, can you maybe just characterize -- I mean, you provide a lot of -- you list all your redevelopment projects and it looks like there's like 37 in there and you have about $700 million it listed in that stock [ph] ,  which is -- I mean it's only about $20 million per project, but it looks like there's some that are kind adding new space and it should represent, I guess, a more sizable chunk of that. And I'm trying to see -- should we see -- should we expect to see more expansions of malls, given the demand and given your spreads and resulting in some lumpier projects that pull that number up? Are there lumpy projects in there that represent a big share of that $700 million?", "David E. Simon", "The lumpy projects are basically, hopefully ready to start shortly. And I'm not going to list -- I'm just from recall. I mean, the lumpy ones, you'll start to see later on this year and in '14, I they include as Roosevelt Field of Copley, the Lambeau, and Woodbury, King of Prussia, to name -- Houston Galleria, to name 4, 5 or 6 lumpy, bigger, bigger, chunkier ones. You're right. A lot of what we have now is, they run the -- they run the $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, but you have something like Nanuet, which is $150 million project and Walt Whitman is around $80 million. So you got a little -- you got it all over the Board. But the lumpier, bigger ones, we are essentially in our first phase of the Lambeau. We will begin our first phase of Roosevelt Field here in the fall. Stanford, Rick whispered to me, thank you, we're finalizing everything there to as many of you know to relocate Bloomingdale's, build them a new store and then we take over their existing Bloomingdale's store and carve it up for small shops. So the bigger, lumpier ones really are, hopefully, beginning to start second half of '13, and '14 will be a huge year for us, '15 as well, as these bigger, lumpier ones come onstream.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Paul, it's Steve. I would just add one thing to that. Because it gets lost in the sauce sometimes but between -- David mentioned Woodbury, but he didn't mention Desert Hills, Orlando Premium, Las Vegas North, those are 4 Premium Outlets that's all to north of $1,000 of food and sales where we are adding significant amount of space. And so we're -- those are projects that will come on in the next year or 2 as well.", "David E. Simon", "And as Steve said, those are, on average, are about $100 million a pop.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes. So I mean, that number could, well it should really double, probably, in a year from now.", "David E. Simon", "It's going to balloon, and I think what we have said and what we've said and we'll say again is that this is our #1 priority. This is the huge focus for the company. This is where we'll spend most of our time. And the good news is we recognized this that the world was not going to end a little bit ahead of others. So we're in the midst of doing this now. Woodbury is going to start. Right after this, most people, after their first quarter, our earnings take the afternoon off, right after this, Rick and I are going to spend 2 hours on the final approval of Woodbury. It's $168 million deal, and it's going to really, really be cool and it's really going to start and we really got the approvals and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then in the afternoon, we do take a lunch break. Rick demands to go out to lunch. I like to eat at my desk. It's a source of much conflict in the organization, but right after that, we're approving, I don't know, 20-some odd different mall deals. So #1 priority, we're glad we're in the midst of this now and a lot of good stuff to come.", "Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Would you think those blended stabilized returns are going to be around? I mean, you've got 9 -- you've got 14% for the Premium Outlets in there. Is that going to change much?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Look, I think they'll all be very, very accretive to our company. I don't -- soon as the project gets approved and we put it in there, you'll see the return.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "David, we knew that [indiscernible continues to grow in your portfolio and we're passed some previous peak. What do you think is stabilized occupancy?", "David E. Simon", "Well, actually, I've been very impressed with our leasing team that they've been able to achieve these occupancy levels. So I think the focus now is, it's always good to, on the margin, to continually increase occupancy. But, Cedrik, I do believe that the focus now will be making sure that the mix is the best that it can be. But I have actually been very pleased and impressed with our leasing team in the amount of their ability to drive occupancy. I don't tell them because then they'll, then they'll take the afternoon off, where Rick and I won't, but now, seriously, I've been very pleased with the results that they've been able to produce.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And Cendrik, the only thing I would add is that the number that I'm thinking about is higher than I would have told you perhaps a year ago, because what has emerged in our sector now is you have a number, very high fashion, highly productive tenants like ZARA, H&M, UNIQLO, Topshop that are demanding bigger spaces. And because they are all bigger space, that's going to create incremental demand for our space that could enable us to perhaps drive the percentage higher than what otherwise be the case absent that demand.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So as you look at your ability to change the mix, what can it do for your ability to push rents in the centers?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, it's relatively straightforward. The better the tenant does in terms of sales per square foot, the greater they have the ability to pay rent. And it's really that simple. So as we do that, we're hopeful that rent will follow or be part of that initial equation.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And turning maybe to densification. You've got -- you're talking about Copley earlier. It seems that you could add non-retail users depending on the city. How many malls do you own where you think you could add non-retail users and densify the site?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Cedrik, it's Rick. Right now, we're working on adding hotels at 5 different projects, and we're working on adding multifamily at 4 additional ones. We're under construction with a multifamily project at Firewheel in Garland, Texas, so we still think there is very good demand for it. What we have found is that when we add these hotels and multifamily or condo components in our projects, they are yielding the higher room rates for hotels and monthly rentals from multifamily because people very much enjoy the mixed aspects of the community. So we think we bring an incremental value to those components and we're going to continue to pursue them.", "David E. Simon", "I just roughly put Copley aside because that's the big one. But there are at least 12 to 15 in each area that are of immediate focus. That doesn't mean it's limited to those, say, 24 to 30, but there is a list of those 12 or so in each category being hotel or and/or multifamily that we're very focused on. In fact, we're going to prove this afternoon in Southdale more than likely. I'm still struggling with the returns because our returns are higher than the multifamily guys gets. But -- so I'm still trying, I'm still struggling with some of those deals. But I do think there is a pipeline to the advantage of that, and it's good for the real estate generally.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And just final question, in your Annual Shareholder letter, you talked about continuing to lead the industry and promoting the malls and marketing medium. How much more can you do? How much more income can you generate from that aspect of the business?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think it's also just more than income in that. I could be wrong here, but I do think, I do think we're on the verge of a technology backlash. And our focus is creating a mall environment where people -- we had a meeting on this -- kind of a brainstorming meeting on this Monday, and something was said that was very clever, is that people today are looking down, they're not looking up. And what happens in the mall environment is we do give them the opportunity to look up and around and not just down. Down meaning at your mobile device and everything else. So I do think the mall has a unique ability to be part of that, maybe, next wave of trying to create social responsibility, community relations, community feel, and part of a process where we actually look up as opposed to look down. So it's a big focus for our company. The revenue side, obviously, we love cash flow, so we're cash flow junkies, so we're going to look to that too. But there's a unique ability for us to really kind of create community in our properties beyond that. And I think that's a huge mission for us to try and achieve. It's a long-term prospect, lots of ideas there, very hard to sort out exactly how we will execute it. But -- and the good news is, just to segue into the e-commerce, I mean, you're seeing more and more pure e-commerce companies opening stores because they know that people frankly want to look up, they don't always want to look down. So a great example is this Warby Parker, this eyeglass thing that was kind of the new hot dotcom thing and they're opening physical stores. Now whether they go to the malls or not, I'm not -- who knows? But the fact of the matter is, I think they recognized that people want to touch, feel, look up. So our mission is to get people to look up, not look down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's been a while since you combined the operating statistics of the mall and the outlet business together. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how it's just performing, some of the similarities and differences? And then as we look at the 79.6% of your NOI that comes from Malls and Premium Outlets, could you sort of give us a rough sense as to what the percentage is coming from outlets versus malls?", "David E. Simon", "Sure. I'll just say this. Steve can answer the second one. In the real estate recession, or I should say, not the real estate recession, because frankly, having lived through '90 to '93, this was child's play. But if you look at the general economy, our outlets clearly outperformed the malls during that '09, '10, and '11 period. And now I will say, Quentin, generally, in terms of sales growth and comp growth, they're relatively close. The outlets are still marginally better, but the difference between those 2 has narrowed considerably. Now with respect to the breakout, do you...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes. Quentin, if you actually -- in our year end [indiscernible] , that's posted on the website, we do break it out for you and I don't have it in front of me. But as I recall, the malls are 55% and I think the outlets are 25% because when you put the outlets and the mills together, essentially about 1/3 of our NOI comes from the value side of the business.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just in terms of the ongoing success that you're having with Kl\u00e9pierre in terms of improving operations and capital and asset sales and so forth having an influence, are you spending a lot of time looking at a similar style of public company investment where you take a similar amount of minority stake and gets some Board representation? Is that something that's increasingly attractive to you, given the success of Kl\u00e9pierre?", "David E. Simon", "We have a thought about it from time to time. It's not a big focus for us. But it could lend itself to a situation here or there. But Kl\u00e9pierre was -- the reason we made the investment the way we did was for all sorts of reason, including risk management. So really, it would depend on the circumstances. It's not something that we're out looking to do, but in the right kind of context, it's conceivable.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. It sounds like if you're really a cash flow junkie, you should put advertising in the floors, that way you can get more money when people are looking down.", "David E. Simon", "We tried that. We've done that. We did \"buy a footprint\", but it didn't go over well. It was great for the kids. Then when I saw the adults using it, I thought it was a little tacky.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Thinking about Kl\u00e9pierre, I guess we've elapsed the 6th status for them to effectively go private. So how should we think about your stake and how you want to evolve over time, whether you want this to be stub [ph] outstanding, whether you want to bring it in-house, whether you want to bring a joint venture partner in. How should we think about how that evolves now that the, at least the REIT issue, the French REIT issue is elapsing?", "David E. Simon", "Well, Michael, I would love to answer that question, but I respectfully won't. We are pleased with the investment. We're making good strides. We need to make more strides. And I said the big problem with the company today is somewhat out of their control, not just dealing with the Spanish economy. But we're pleased, but I really, as much as I'd like to talk about that kind of stuff, I really can't. It is a public company. I've got to respect that situation. So we're pleased we are making very good strides. And I would say operationally, things do take longer there than they would than they would, say, here. But we've been pleased with kind of the blocking and tackling that the company is undertaking now, they still need to do a lot more, though we've been pleased with the progress they've made to date.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just going back to the rental spreads on Page 19 of your sup, and, Steve, you answered that the count, the retailer calendar year end, the January 31. But, I guess, I'm still having a hard time. March 31, '12, it's $7 million trailing at  $54, $49 expiring and now you're 3/31/3 [ph] 7.4 million square feet of $59 versus $52, and even 12/31/12, 8 million square feet of $53, $48, it just seems like there's -- that the opening/closing arch is much, much higher this quarter. Whatever happened in the first quarter of 2013 was dramatically higher rents than at any point over trailing '12 [ph] any other quarter.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Michael, that's true, but if we also look, they were dramatically higher closing rents as well. So some of it is clearly mixed-driven. Some of it is clearly the fact that over the years, our portfolio continues to get better. And so the rents that we were able to do leases at 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 8 years ago were better, and those are all now rolling off. So --  but mix is clearly an issue, or component of it.", "David E. Simon", "And I would just point out that we have in our portfolio, U.S. portfolio, not including the Mills, or actually it does include the Mills, we have 121 properties that do over $700 a foot. So...", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "121?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That average $700 a foot in sales.", "David E. Simon", "121. So and as a Steve said, Rick said, we're really trying to make those properties better and better in all sorts of different ways. So that's going to  lead to more rent growth. But again, I would not overreact to one really good-looking statistic in one particular quarter. Just like I would ask for forgiveness to the extent that one quarter, we have a statistic that looks bad. I'm sure part of it is mix, we can drill down to it a little bit more, but demand is good and we got a reasonably good portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And just going, I guess, sort of back to Christy's question on department stores and just thinking about JCPenney in particular, especially if they brought in AlixPartners. Your sense of -- as you guys obviously speak to them, other department stores, how much do you think the massive Ala Moana trade has worked department store managements in thinking what their boxes are worth or do you think most people are pretty realistic in what they think their real estate is worth?", "David E. Simon", "Look, I can't speculate what Ala Moana, how that has affected the judgment of department store or retail CEOs. I would point out though since Ala Moana, there just hasn't been a lot of box trades and you can come to your own conclusion as to why maybe because they don't want to sell or maybe there's a spread between the bid and the ask. I don't know. But I can't speculate on how they think about that at all, Alex.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then going to Kl\u00e9pierre, while I know that you don't want to comment directly on their operations, can you just give us a sense as you guys think about the growth and what Simon can bring to their platform, this split between improving NOI versus bringing in the Simon brand venture type revenue stream and increasing that ancillary income. How would you think about the growth? Is more of it just going to come from NOI or is there a big opportunity, you think, to really improve the ancillary income that, that could be a meaningful contributor?", "David E. Simon", "Well, again, I'm not going to quantify that. It's not something I can do. Look, I think the important thing to put in perspective there, Alex, is that we don't run the company. We own a stake, we're pleased with the stake, we can show them how we run it and then they need to apply it. And we brought in, the company has brought in some talented people to learn from what we do, assuming we do what we do reasonably well. I mean, I'm not telling you we do what we do is great, because I always think it can get better. But assuming we do what we do reasonably well, we can show them how we do it and how we think about the business, but they've got to do that. They're the ones that need to do it. And it's not easy to do when the economy there is sputtering along and in some cases, still contracting, i.e., Spain. But they get what we're doing, they want to run the company better, they are running the company better. And I think as kind of I said in my letter, I do think there's growth there as soon as the economy of Europe generally stabilizes and I do think the economy of Europe will stabilize. It's not going to -- despite my personal view of it, it's not going to what continue to contract as it has over the last year or 2. So, I mean -- so it was a long winded answer, but I'm not going to speculate exactly how much NOI growth there is, but I do think there's improvement in how they run the business and I think they would agree, I think, that's their big focus in the upcoming years.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally for Steve -- and thank you for new supplemental. On Page 23 in the CapEx and development page, there's an item called conversion from accrual to cash basis. And if you don't have this off hand, we can discuss offline. But just curious what that is.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, it's simple, Alex. We give you a CapEx number but there are CapEx numbers where we have accrued obligations like we got a construction build, but we haven't paid it yet. Okay. And all we're doing is giving you both the accrual number and the cash number because some people look at it and want the accrual number, some want the cash number.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, that make sense.", "David E. Simon", "Sure. And, by the way, that's been in there for a long time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Listen, there's a question, David. See if you feel -- how comfortable you feel answering this. Any thoughts as to what Simon might look like if we were to lose the tax break?", "David E. Simon", "I don't worry about that at all, David. I just -- REITs have been around for 60 years, it's not going to happen. I just can't imagine it's going to happen. As you know, it's revenue-neutral. If, in fact, there was some change, I think the -- I think most politicians understand the importance commercial real estate has in stabilizing the general economy. The last thing in the world they would want to do is create some kind of economic uncertainty. They've seen the fact that the downturn and what commercial real estate, how it handled itself in the amount of liquidity that reached -- brought to the table to stabilize pricing, and that create kind of what happened in the early '90s. And as I said, I have lived through that, as has Rick.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Me, too.", "David E. Simon", "You, too. Some others. It's not going to happen. But, by the way, if it did, we would, we would be best positioned to take advantage of it. Because, as you know, our cash flow is significantly above our dividend payment. And look, I have always fantasized, I probably shouldn't say this. So I always fantasized we pay out a $1.5 billion a year in dividends, $1.6 billion? What is the numbers now?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "$1.6 billion.", "David E. Simon", "$1.6 billion. Imagine if I have that amount of capital through 2, 3, 4 years. So we would do some great stuff with it. But David, that's on a side, it's not going to happen. REITs have performed, they've been very important to the economy, they've been great for individual shareholders, they helped stabilized pricing. No way.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So no Plan B planning at this point?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we don't need to. But like I said, if the sun hits the moon and hits another galaxy, we will be better positioned than anybody else.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Well, tax breaks aren't granted in perpetuity. So I think the question is out there. A similar question actually related to Kl\u00e9pierre. I mean obviously, there's been a lot of talk about tax increases and public policy responses that may be somewhat more fluid in Europe today. Any notion at all that the tax status of the company like Kl\u00e9pierre is being questioned?", "David E. Simon", "Not at all.", "David E. Simon", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let me go back to the leasing spreads again, not to beat a dead horse here, but the 13%, so the 300-basis point pickup, when I first looked at that, what went into my mind was you're starting to roll some shorter term post-downturn leases and you're getting the benefit there. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, does it feel like this increase whether it's 200 basis points, 300 or whatever it is, is probably going to be sticky going forward or is it just purely an anomaly where Q2 rolls around and for some reason were back down to 10%?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Mike, it's Steve. Let me take a shot at it and Rick can weigh in or David. I think if you look at the -- we give you 5 quarters' worth of information, and the one thing you can see from the 5 quarters is that the spread has increased over each of the 5 quarters. The magnitude of the increase, this quarter was substantial relative to the trend that we had been seeing, but we had been going from the low 4s to the mid 4s to $5 a foot. So and, as I said, some of that is lumpy because of first quarter explorations, but the fact is, deal flow has been getting better, quality of deals has been getting better, occupancy cost has stayed relatively low. So as you want to think about it, as a mark-to-market or however you want to think about it, there is, there should be an upward bias. Is the upward bias from $5 to $7, I think that's hard to say. But the trend has been good.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, secondly, just curious about what are the thoughts on the pace of rolling out outlets in Brazil today compared to what you were thinking 6 months or a year ago?", "David E. Simon", "Let me answer it if I could. I think both. As you know, we've looked diligently in Brazil and diligently in China. Both markets for us have proven to be very, very difficult to find the right project with the right risk/reward ratio, and hence we have nothing -- I mean, we're still working with BR Malls. We're still hopeful that eventually, we'll be able to do something there. China is proved to be a market that I continue to really question whether or not anybody can make money investing there, especially us. And so I'm hopeful that over time, we'll find the right opportunity with BR in Brazil, but that's taken longer than we anticipated. And then China is really, really on the back burner. And I have no regrets about it being on the back burner.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deutsche Bank.", "Unknown Analyst", "I just wanted to go back to JCPenney real quick. Just, obviously given the transition at the top there, I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that move itself. But then also, given their sort of return to more conditional marketing tactics that they've been known for. At the ground- level, have you seen any change in traffic levels and that kind of thing since the move?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me just mention, we're pleased that Mike Ullman is back. I think he will -- he's obviously a very confident, seasoned, thoughtful CEO and leader. And given all the turmoil that Penny was going through, a perfect choice to help stabilize the company. And that we have great respect for him and his ability. And I would say, generally having walked a number of Penny stores with David Contis and Rick over the last -- not just the stores. So the stores are looking better. So I think they're heading on the right track. It's very hard for me to speculate exactly how it's all going to shakeout. But the bottom line is the organization needed some stability and thoughtfulness, and I think Mike's perfectly the right guy to provide that,", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And just want to go back to some comments you made about the department -- no, the anchor space I, think, 635, only 6 or 7 vacant, so some of the lowest vacancy you've ever seen there. But then you also kind of you say that -- I think I heard no interest in sale-leasebacks. Just curious, if you could comment on what kind of demand is out there for additional anchor space, obviously with the, vacancy low, that's good, but I mean, are you seeing much demand for anchor space? It just seem like more people are moving to the outlet channel in terms of the traditional anchors.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "This is Rick. There is a great deal of demand for the space, and if you look at the kind of tenants that we're adding to the properties, we're adding Wegmans, Fresh Market, Dick's, theaters, health clubs. There is a substantially broader number of categories of retailers that want to take advantage of all the traffic en masse that we are creating at these properties. So we have, again, more demand today than we have had historically from a broader collection and a variety of retailers than we've had in the past, and all that is helping drive, I think, the growth of our property and the lack of vacancy among our anchor boxes.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Do you have enough data points at this point for some of these non-traditional anchor malls, as far as how the performance of those malls compares to historically the traditional setup our mix?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I think that all of our anchor components are part of the mix that we have at the property. They are not going to be game changing, but they obviously want to be a property that are consistent with their growth and in some instances, merely a function of whether we can accommodate the physical configuration. Wegmans needs almost 4 acres of land for a single level building, well in a lot of instances, that can [ph] happen. So it's really less a function of that kind of a correlation, a more a function of can we continue to give our trade area shoppers more reasons to come to our properties, then that's what we're all about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Moore of RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "On the bankruptcy front in the lease termination front and that sort of side of the equation, it seems that things are pretty good. I guess, Rick, how would you characterize the outlook for lost tenants over the next 3 to 9 months?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, if you look historically, our bankruptcy numbers have been up a little in '13 just because of Bakers. But overall, the credit profile of our tenants has never been better. Our receivables, Steve can elaborate, has never been in better shape or bad debt is stable. So we're feeling good about the credit profile of our tenants and more importantly, their rent-paying ability, which continues to be pretty strong.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, Rich, this is Steve. Just to put numbers on Rick's overall statement. I think at the end of the third quarter, we were chasing $42 million of receivables that had been built, but not yet been paid and that's on about a $7 billion annual base of revenue that we bill either on the consolidated or the JV property. So you're literally talking about less than 2 days\u2019 worth of revenue. And the credit profile, as Rick said, is very strong right now.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I don't think my calculator decimals go out that far, Steve, so. Okay, good. And then on the outlets, I think didn't you guys do the development of Houston and Tangers doing Charlotte, and how do you split up Columbus? So, I guess, who's driving Columbus is what I'm curious.", "David E. Simon", "It's -- in Charlotte, we've actually switched the roles that we had in Texas. And in Texas, we were the developer and we jointly leased and they run the center. In Charlotte, they are the developer as there was the site. We're going to manage the center and will jointly lease. And then in Columbus, again, Columbus is a competitive marketplace. But in Columbus, we're switching back to the other deal. So it's been -- partnerships are very common in the real estate industry. All sorts of people are partnered, developers over the years have always partnered. We have a very good relationship with Tanger and so it's just kind of a natural to say, okay, this is a way it was here, we're going to swap there and then go back here, and then there's another deal to do, it would probably swap back to the way we're doing Charlotte. So long winded, but Charlotte will be a the Charlotte Premium Outlet, and then Tanger will be branding Columbus, if, in fact, we're the successful developer.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, David, how many more do you think of the 8 that you have going and you would do with or that you're thinking about for North America you'd do with Tanger?", "David E. Simon", "Well, in the 2 or in the 8, and that be of the 8 North America, that includes Canada by the way, and we are actually looking at another site in Mexico. And we've seen very good progress in our outlet in Mexico City. But of the 8, 2 of those are Charlotte and Columbus, of the 8.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And no more plans yet with Tanger?", "David E. Simon", "No, sir.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then the last things, the recovery ratio, I think it was pretty much a high this time, this quarter. I mean, is it going to stay up where it is?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, I think we're excited -- I tell you in a weird sort of way the recovery ratio the way those of us who have been around awhile that historically thought about it. It's kind of less relevant now because we are 90 plus percent converted to fixed KM, so the KM charge is just another fixed charge that the retailer looks at in the calculation of the total occupancy cost that they're paying to the landlord. Our fixed KM all have individual annual escalators. And if you look at our operating cost, they've been pretty flat. And as long as that's the case, you're going to see the recovery ratio the way developers have traditionally thought about it, continue to increase.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "But I will tell you just in terms of our ability to drive rents if you go back and we've given you some of the quarters in the K, but our occupancy cost is down over 100 basis points since 12/31/10. So we're still providing very good profitability and value for our retailers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore Partners.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "David, you made some comments last [ph] quarter that demand is picking up in the B mall category that sales were actually okay. So 3, 4 months into the new year, is that still the situation generally that the B mall segment continues to perform okay?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, yes, it is.", "Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then also, maybe for Steve based on some of your recent conversations with the lenders. Are the lenders taking a more conservative approach maybe to the B mall category given obviously what's happening at JCPenney?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, Ben, I would just say that lenders and I assume you're referring to the secured lenders, generally speaking, I have kept a more conservative posture. Loan to values are still relatively modest, underwriting is still relatively conservative. And that's true regardless of the quality of the asset.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So no significant change over the past few weeks given obviously the new management team at JCPenney's and a lot of uncertainty going on with that particular anchor; is that a fair assumption?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That's fair.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe switching gears. You made some comments on China just now. On the back burner, just to find opportunities, just to make money. Can you just elaborate a bit on some of the challenges that you see in China today that makes you a little more cautious because I do recall that you guys did go to China a few years ago doing some anchored centers, and I was curious what you see today that makes it still very challenging for you guys.", "David E. Simon", "Well, that was a very good experience. And we brought 70% -- look, any time you invest capital and you only bring 70% of it back home, you learn a lesson. And I would say, Ben, generally, generally, the ability to underwrite the product there in terms of what the tenants are going to pay, what the costs are, what the approval process is, all of the elements of the P&L and pro forma, including construction cost, land cost, permitting, it's all very, not to say that people can't make money there, but it's all very difficult to really have a high degree of confidence. And when you think of the risks associated there, you would hope that the returns are better, at least on the piece of paper that you're ready to make the investment are. And frankly, they're not, and that's what -- that's where the big gap exist. And so a lot of it is, build and they will come, and that plays out pretty badly in real estate development. I mean, it's certainly, build it and they will come in the U.S. As Rick knows and I know, Rick's older so he knows a little bit more than I know. Build it and they will come did not make every mall successful. There were a lot of malls that frankly shouldn't have been built. So it's just very tough to have the level of precision that we want and if there were margin for error, i.e., returns on investment that were higher, you would take the risk. I just don't see it in everything that we look at on a piece of paper in China. Brazil is a little bit different. You can pencil better returns there. But again, finding the right site and the right -- and the ability to build and so on is a little more tough -- difficult but you do see a little bit of a -- you do see a much better returns at least on a paper.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just one final one on China. I mean, what type of returns would make it more attractive for you to go into China, given all the risk that you've kind of elaborated on?", "David E. Simon", "You'll know it when we do it, and right now, I don't see anything on the drawing board that's going to -- and again, please, the fact of the matter is, somebody could be very successful and we could miss an opportunity, but for whatever reason, whatever we're looking at, it's just not making sense for us. That's not to say others might not be successful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin of BMO.", "Josh Patinkin", "A couple of questions on Toronto Premium Outlet and the broader opportunity set for the Premium Outlet brand in Canada. Hudson Bay is opening their first outlet store there. Are you in a position to announce any other merchants?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, we will. I don't know when we're going to do that, but we normally do that. We normally have done that throughout the process, but we will. I mean, this should be, by all accounts, a very successful outlet center.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We're already 85% leased and committed, and we will be putting out a press release in the next month or so. It's opening in August. So it's happening and it's gotten very good response from both the Canadian-based retailers, but also the U.S. retailers that are operating in Toronto already.", "Josh Patinkin", "Okay. So that was my next question. The American brand, I'm trying to assess their level of interest in Canada, and are the Canadian brands that are going in there, are they developing a made-for-outlet merchandising strategy similar to what happened?", "David E. Simon", "Some are. Yes, some are now. Hudson Bay is a perfect example. We have a wonderful relationship with the parent, which is, as you know, Lord & Taylor and we've picked up the phone and said, this, you're doing Lord & Taylor outlets in the U.S. a few here and there. You ought to do it with Hudson Bay and, really, we generated that idea. They thought long and hard about it and they were very interested in doing that. So I do think it will start a trend there, no question about it. And the U.S. folks are very interested, assuming they have a full price presence ahead of that. And Canada generally is very attractive to most U.S. retailers. But not all are there. And some of their outlet concepts will be delayed to the extent that until they have the full price there, which is coming and for us, with Toronto Premium Outlets, the luxury brands are starting to hit Toronto, and what we think over time, as they hit there, we have the natural place for them to do the outlet. But again, that's going to take time. In the meantime, we're going to have a terrific center and we have a Phase 2 there that would allow us to bring in the luxury guys as they hit kind of the greater Toronto market.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. As you look at Canada, how many Premium Outlet caliber malls are there to build in Canada do you think?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we expect in our, at least one of the -- now this was a great secret, now you've got 3 or 4 of the 8, but one in Mexico [ph] . One of the 8, at least 8 is in Montr\u00e9al, which we expect, again another meeting today on it, but we're going to start construction on that in July. And so that's -- we think that's a good market, a very good market. Now it poses a little trickier leasing because a number of the U.S. brands won't go up to Qu\u00e9bec, but we think that's offset by some of the international brands that really do like Montr\u00e9al. In fact, Montr\u00e9al is a great fashion city and they have great malls there, and we think it's going to be a great long-term project. So we've got Montr\u00e9al. Obviously, Vancouver is a very interesting market as well. We're focused on those kind of bigger gateway areas up in Canada.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "David, you've updated your FFO guidance at the first quarter for stronger operations. Just going back to the first -- fourth quarter volume you said on that call, it was going to be tough to match the 4.8% same-store growth you did in '12. Could you perhaps give us an update of those thoughts?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we -- look, the first quarter was very good. We had a -- what's really impressive for me is that it was off a really good first quarter in '12. So that's pretty significant cash flow growth when you had the 5 7 plus the 4 8, on top of the 4 8.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I agree.", "David E. Simon", "I am conservative by nature. I think the organization generally is even though we probably don't compliment them as much as we should, they're really doing a good job. So it would be -- I would be very, very excited if we maintained that we are not anticipating that. We also kind of trended down through the year. First quarter was better or so last year if you look, we kind of -- I don't remember where we were overall for '12, but...", "Unknown Executive", "4 8.", "David E. Simon", "4 8. So I think '13 we're heading the right direction. I'm really not answering your question, but it's off to a good start is all I can tell you.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then any thoughts about some of the fundamental strength of the B mall market. There seems to be some new entrants into the B mall category, people looking to buy some of those major assets [ph] , et cetera. What are your thoughts in terms of perhaps accelerating your sales out of that group, taking advantage of the new entrants to that market?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're still going to prune the portfolio. So I'm pleased that there are new people coming in the market that are looking at deals. So I think that's good for us generally.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally on St. Louis. You have 97% spoken for at this point. Now that you're getting closer to the open, can you give us a little bit more, perhaps the insight into the negotiations with the retailers of why they chose your site over the competing and what type of sales they're expecting to get out of that?", "David E. Simon", "Look, I -- really, I'm not going to get into that, Nate, other than to say we presented to them what they thought the center was going to be like Cincinnati Premium Outlets. This is kind of how we envisioned the productivity and the mix. And that's been very -- it's a quite center, but it's been well received by the community and by the retailers. And that's how we sold it to the retailers. Now they have a lot of confidence that if we say we're going to build Cincinnati, they did, we did that, so that's how we kind of sold it, and to them in terms of how they should think about the productivity. The pricing was similar to that. I mean, and we took it from there. I mean, nothing beyond that, really. I mean, it was competitive, but at the end of the day, I think retailers have a level of confidence with us that -- in terms of the outlet product. I will say this, though, we got the -- this pricing in new deal, it's not -- the outlet retailer generally, they know what they can afford to pay. So as much as we'd like to say, there's just great, huge negotiation on rents, I mean they're used to saying, here's what I pay on the new outlet center and that's what they pay. So they're in a very good position to bargain what the rental rate is. I mean, the one thing they really wanted to do, they really don't like competing centers. They really like when there's one site and then they all go because they don't -- they know what they can afford to pay and then that's what they pay. So in Charlotte, as much as the market might think, boy, Charlotte looks like we're going to build that one center. The retail community loved the fact that they didn't have to worry about a competing site. They really, really like it. Now in St. Louis, I'm sure a number of them felt that way as well.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess your success there hasn't whetted your appetite for another bite [ph] .", "David E. Simon", "No. Look, we've lost plenty of those, too. And I mean -- but it's, like I said, it's not -- it's common to partner and just get a deal done for the community, for the retailers and be done with it. In this case, it didn't happen.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will like to hand the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thank you for your time and your interest, and we'll talk to you very, very soon.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

My name is Allison, and I'll be operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Liz Zale", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Joining me on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

The supplemental document is available on simon.com in the Investors section.", "And with that, I would like to now introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Good morning. It was another productive quarter. FFO was $2.11 per share, up 11.6% from the second quarter of '12. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus by $0.04. For Malls and Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 5.9%, driven by occupancy, up 90 basis points to 95.1%; a growth in the releasing spread to $7.49 per square foot, or 14.1%; base minimum rent per square foot, 3.6% higher than the year ago period. And our tenant sales were up 4.2% to $577 per square foot.", "Now let me turn to just some deal activity. On May 30, we acquired a 390,000 square-foot outlet center in Portland, Oregon, $447 million. This is a very productive center, with sales in excess of $600 per square foot. It's 99% leased, has a great tenant lineup and fits terrific with our Outlet portfolio. And it's been rebranded Woodburn Premium Outlets. And as you would expect, it's immediately accretive to FFO.", "On June 3, we announced our JV with McArthurGlen to invest in certain of their designer outlets and become a partner in the property management development companies. They have a terrific and one of the best performing portfolios of high-quality retail real estate in Europe and a good, strong team of professionals. The transaction supports and extends our International Premium Outlet strategy. We completed the initial phase of this transaction and are now 50-50 partners in the management and development companies. And we also will become a partner in their new designer outlet project in Vancouver and are working to close our investment in several of their existing centers.", "On May 7, we sold Laguna Hills Mall for $110 million.", "Now let me turn to new development. Phoenix and Shisui opened in April, both 100% leased, both strong openings. And we're pleased with the performance. The third quarter -- this third quarter, we have 3 new Premium Outlet Centers that will open. Toronto, this week, August 1. You're all welcome. St. Louis, which is 100% leased, on August 22. You're all welcome. Busan, Korea maybe a little bit out of your way, but it is 99% leased, and it opens on August 29. The construction started during the second quarter at our Premium Outlets Montr\u00e9al, which is our second Premium Outlet Center in Canada. Vancouver will be our third. And let me just turn to redevelopment activity.", "A lot going on. I won't go through everything, but some highlights. In April, we completed the redevelopment of an existing limited building in Dadeland Mall. It's great. Go look at it. The redevelopment of Walt Whitman opens this September, with the addition of retailers and restaurants on the exterior of the building. The Shops at Nanuet in suburban New York City opens in October. At this project, we actually demolished the existing mall and created a new open air center. The redevelopment of Lenox Square continues as does the transformation of Del Amo Fashion Center, among several other centers that are all listed in the 8-K.", "And on the Premium Outlet front, we completed expansions at Paju and Seattle during the second quarter. Expansions are underway at Orlando Premium Outlets in Vineland and Johor Malaysia. Both of these projects will open in the fourth quarter. The significant expansion at Desert Hills continues, will open in April of next year. And finally, on that front, we started this quarter the $170 million redevelopment expansion of Woodbury Commons in New York.", "The Mills -- Sawgrass Mills, we opened the expansion in The Colonnade Outlets during the second quarter, as well as the redevelopment of the former Wannado space. Macy's opened at Gurnee Mills last week. In addition, we have significant box activity throughout The Mills and Mall portfolio with numerous stores under construction.", "Our pipeline in new development, redevelopment projects is significant and growing. Stuff is coming online. We're also under construction with several projects. We expect this to continue at least $1 billion annually through 2016. And I'll remind you that we're funding this primarily with $1 billion of our free annual cash flow generated by the company.", "Just quickly on financing. We're pleased with the Standard & Poor's upgrade in May with our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt ratings were increased to A level. We believe this reflects our conservative balance sheet strategy, the quality of our portfolio and the ongoing focus of being a good steward of capital.", "We continue to be active in the debt markets. So far, year-to-date, we did 17 new loans, approximately $2.4 billion, of which our shares is $1.7 billion. The average interest rate on the loans is 2.9%, and the average term is 8.1 years.", "Kl\u00e9pierre reported solid first half results. I won't go through them in detail. They're available. Shopping center gross rents, which represents 94.4% of total rents, were up 4.1%, or 2.5% on a like-for-like basis. They increased their 2013 guidance for net cash -- net current cash flow per share. And they continue to upgrade the portfolio through development, redevelopment, as well as the disposition on noncore assets.", "Today, we increased the top and the bottom of our 2013 FFO guidance once again to a new range of $8.60 to $8.70 of FFO per share. This is an increase of $0.20 from our initial guidance or over $70 million. And as always, we are extremely focused on the successful execution of our plan for '13, from the effective leasing and management of our high-quality existing portfolio to the successful delivery of our new and redevelopment pipeline and the achievement of the returns that we have outlined.", "We're now ready for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of New York.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I look at the supplemental and it says the openings projected for 2015 and beyond, and it lists Del Amo and Roosevelt Field but it doesn't list Copley Place and Houston Galleria. Is this just because those projects are starting later or is there a change in plan for those assets?", "David E. Simon", "No change at all. We are -- actually, once they are formally approved within our internal process, they go on a schedule. Copley, we're actually going through, just a little bit more permitting approvals, which we expect to have by the end of the year. And then The Galleria, we have an announcement coming shortly. Stay tuned. We approved it internally. They'll both be on our list. No real change of plans on either one.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I also noticed in the anchor section, you're adding a Wegmans to the Montgomery Mall. May you be adding supermarkets to other centers and was there any change that you made in terms of parking or access to make Wegmans work with the rest of the mall?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Craig, it's Rick. The Wegmans is being built on the site of a former Boscov's, which we demolished. And the land was suitable to be able to have all their parking accommodated. We are putting several outside uses in Montgomery just to be accommodative to that, so we're having some uses we think will work well with the supermarket. And we're also adding a Fairway Market at Nanuet. So these types of high profile, high-volume users are, we think, very additive to the properties.", "David E. Simon", "Craig, I remember you used to asked about Nanuet all the time. So now thankfully, it's opening in October. And we're basically virtually leased, not everybody will open by this year. But by spring of next year, all 100% will be opened.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was actually by that site a couple of weeks ago. It looks like it's pretty transformative.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, it should be. We're excited about it.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One last thing. Are you able to give a cap rate on the Laguna Hills Mall that you sold in May?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'll let you do the math. The NOI, if I remember correctly, was around $6.5 million or something in that range, $6.5 million.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just on the McArthurGlen acquisition. Can you just talk broadly about the opportunity in Europe with Outlets and how involved Simon senior management will be with the management and growth of that business?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think there is a significant opportunity, both within their existing portfolio and the ability to add extensions to them, as well as continue to upgrade the tenant offerings and add to the footfall of those centers through tourism efforts and the like. In addition, McArthurGlen does have a significant pipeline of additional opportunities in terms of new development. So when you couple those, as well as we do think there'll be acquisition opportunities within their portfolio and others, we think it's going to end up being a significant platform for our growth over the next several years. It's a complicated deal not only because it's in Europe and you're in different countries, but also the ownership of the assets are owned not by just one individual, but by various partners and funds. I think over time, as we solidify the platform, bring our expertise to the table, along with their assets and their people, it should be a very good deal for us. So we're excited about it. And the sales productivity of these centers is very high, and there's not a lot of them. And they're very well accepted, and there's not that many players in Europe that do it at such a high level. So we think, ultimately, it's going to be a good transaction for us.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I think you still own a stake in Value Retail, the other outlet developer and owner in Europe. Are you now a seller of that stake?", "David E. Simon", "Do you have an offer for me?", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I don't have the money.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. No, we're happy with that stake. But we're always interested in whatever we can do to benefit our shareholders. But that investment has been good for us. We anticipate continuing in it. As you might know, I mean, that was kind of an investment that the former Chelsea made. We've added to it over the years. We've got a significant embedded gain compared to our book value of it, and they do a very good job in terms of operating their centers as well. So we think we're a long-term owner of it, but I never rule anything out.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, there's been a lot of media speculation on the Colonial investment management platform in Australia. I know you guys are constantly looking at global opportunities. Is the Australian mall industry one that interests you?", "David E. Simon", "Well, maybe. Haven't ruled it out. But we'll look at anything. I mean, Westfield does such a good job. We've always been a little bit reluctant to enter that market. On the other hand, it's an interesting market. It's very stable. We like the people there, and the malls there do very well. So I wouldn't rule anything out, just like we've monitored Brazil for years. Haven't found the right transaction. We wouldn't rule any one particular place out. The one place we continue to be the most concerned about, as we look internationally, is China just because it's a tough place to figure out who's on first. Australia, to some extent, has a lot of benefits, that it's a very transparent market.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on McArthurGlen. With regard to the property management development partnership, will there be any immediate impact to cash flow, just thinking about any fees? Or is that further down the road?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's a profitable management company, so our investment will have a return associated with it. Now that will just end up flowing through our JV line, so it's not going to be in our management company. So it will be hard for you to see. But they're profitable, and we expect to have a pretty good return on our investment in the management company.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "What was the investment?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's really separated into 2 pieces, but both for the management and the development was GBP 25 million.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Are you able to disclose the Q2 '13 only year-over-year change in sales?", "David E. Simon", "Say it again?", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just the quarter change in sales, so if I were just to isolate the second quarter sales and look at it on a year-over-year basis.", "David E. Simon", "We don't do that, but it was up about 1%.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, regarding some of the new sort of in-store customer tracking technology that some retailers are using today, are you having to do any upgrades to the technological infrastructure of your malls, such as increasing bandwidth or other changes? And are you using any new technologies to sort of collect any of your own data on customers or analyze shopper traffic patterns?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, that whole area, we are treading very, very carefully because it is lots of privacy concerns. So we have not -- we've looked at it all. But the fact of the matter is, until the folks in Washington feel good about it, we are watching it and we're not really playing in any of that stuff because we really don't know what kind of privacy violations it may generate. So I would tell you that we're treading very, very carefully and have done nothing along the lines that would be able to track anything like that, period, end of story. Now with respect to -- I think the big effort generally in the mall industry is we're all investing in WiFi networks throughout our malls. We're doing that as well. We're starting at the bigger ones first, and that's really primarily for the benefit of our consumer. But to the extent that it can help facilitate our retailers, we're happy for them to participate. But again, I would tell you, on the privacy front, we're not doing anything. We're treading very, very carefully.", "Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And from a CapEx perspective, what are the sort of per mall costs associated with adding the WiFi?", "David E. Simon", "It depends. I'd say, generally, it's around $150,000 a mall, but it really depends. Somewhere in that range.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Steve, you've been a little quiet so far, so maybe I'll lead off with you. As far as the A rating, is this a blessing or a bit of a curse? In any way, does it limit your ability whether it's on the redevelopment front or on the overseas investment front? Does being an A student, does that hinder your guys' flexibility or would you rather be A-?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It does not hinder it at all, Alex. And in fact, one of the additions that we made to the 8-K this quarter was to give you some look at some credit metrics over a 5-year look-back period, and you can see how the metrics had improved. The coverage has gotten better, leverage went down, debt to EBITDA went down. So I think, if anything, it's just a reflection of the continued strengthening of the balance sheet. And to the extent that we can absolutely borrow at cheaper rates than anyone else in our sector, I think that's absolutely a good thing.", "David E. Simon", "And I'll just add, S&P, they're pretty smart folks. They've seen what we've done historically, both in redevelopment and M&A activity, so they have every expectation that, that will continue. And they don't necessarily just rate you based upon being a status business. They rate you on what you've done and what they expect for you to do going forward. And our redevelopment pipeline of $5 billion thereabouts, as well as our continual activity in finding smart external investments, is part of our history of our company. And they actually like that stuff because it's obviously increased our return on equity and increased our cash flow and made us a better company. So that's all factored into how they look at us going forward.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question is going onto the McArthurGlen and Kl\u00e9pierre. The first part is just, when you were talking, David, earlier about buying out in McArthurGlen, presumably, that was buying out some of those individual ownership stakes so that it would be JVs that you would own McArthurGlen assets with McArthurGlen and Simon as the ownership structure. And then separate...", "David E. Simon", "Correct. That's correct.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then separate is, it's early on, but down the road, do you synergies between Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen? Or in your view, these are 2 totally separate platforms, they each have to stand on their own?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think, initially, they are definitely 2 separate platforms and definitely will stand on their own. I mean, they both have very successful operating platforms. And they have obviously dedicated management for both, and they're both big businesses. But I do think, with time, there certainly could be cooperation between the 2, but it's not necessary. But I would expect the 2 to cooperate over time. And especially in France, where McArthurGlen has at least 3 in the pipe of new potential developments, given the history of Kl\u00e9pierre and developing it in France, there's no reason why some sort of cooperation wouldn't make sense for both companies. And we'll certainly encourage that. I happen to know both guys who run it, so that will make it a little bit easier.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "David, when I look at some of the recent acquisitions, they always seem to be largely strategic. You think about the big picture. You look at adding outlets to Europe, where you obviously have the full price presence. It's got similarities with what you've done in the U.S. The approach always seems to be primarily strategic. Do you also look at plays where you would find more distressed real estate, where you would find big discounts to any of your asset value? Or is this on the back burner and you keep looking for strategic acquisitions?", "David E. Simon", "I can't tell you -- there is nothing more than buying something cheap that excites me and the team here. So we love to buy things really cheap. And if that can be done on a distressed basis, we like it as long as -- ultimately, we've got to believe in the real estate because we're not -- well, I wouldn't say we're traders. So at the end of the day, we've got to have a long-term view that we like the cash flow that's being generated from the real estate. But to some extent, I mean, if you go back to the Kl\u00e9pierre deal -- and look,", "Europe is still squishy, to put it mildly. That was a -- I wouldn't call it a distressed situation, but it was certainly at a pretty decent discount to NAV in an uncertain future. And not many people are investing in Europe. When we talk about McArthurGlen, there are not many people that are, at this point, taking the position that Europe is a good place to invest in. So to some extent, both of those transactions are somewhat contrarian. And if we see those as capital ebbs and flows throughout the world, I mean, I would hope that we would be able to take advantage of it. So we certainly love to try and do that. It's not what we do every day. We've got to believe in the real estate at the end of the day. But I would tell you that we've done it historically, so we would hope to continue to find those kind of opportunities.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And when you look at it currently, are those investment possibilities primarily outside of the U.S.? Or do you see potential, either distressed here, distressed properties or even companies that might be at prices that are of more interest in the United States?", "David E. Simon", "I would say, Cedrik, generally, those kind of opportunities are outside the U.S.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Would you be able to share the cap rate on Woodburn?", "David E. Simon", "You won't believe it, but it was 10.5%, only because we had a long-term option to buy it at a 10.5% cap rate. So it's not a reflection of market value, but it just goes -- it's a long history there, but it's a pretty good deal for us.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "How did that option -- how was it put together?", "David E. Simon", "It was really by the outlet guys with Craig over a number of years, history of kind of that whole relationship. I really -- it's not really all that material how it got there, but it just -- it's a good deal for us. And importantly, it's a very good center.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping that you guys could focus a little bit on the core portfolio, since that's the primary driver of, I think, growth here. You guys are now 95% occupied. The business is really kind of hitting on all cylinders. When I look at the re-leasing spreads and look at kind of where ending rents are for next year, they actually are lower in '14 than they are for the balance of this year. And I'm just curious how are you and Rick thinking about kind of the leasing, the discussions with tenants and kind of what are you guys doing differently today, given where you're sitting with the portfolio as well leased as it is?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It's Rick. Basically, we are spending a lot of time just focusing on our mix, focusing on getting the right tenants in the right spaces to maximize the productivity, to maximize the rent that they can pay. And I will tell you that a lot of the calls that David and I receive are tenants worried about whether they're going to be renewed in their spaces as opposed to having to solicit interest in the spaces. So we're in a pretty dynamic market. All of the improvements we're making to this portfolio, in the renovations, the redevelopment, I think, over the last 4 years, we've probably added 200 different anchors to these portfolios. We're just taking market share and making them better. And I think that the thing you can focus on is the fact that our occupancy cost is 11.3%. And as you see with our spreads and you see with the momentum we have, we're going to be able to continue to grow that NOI because of all those reasons.", "David E. Simon", "Steve, I would just say, look, I mean, the fact is supply and demand is a little bit better. But our philosophy on how we operate the business is not all that different. I mean, we've seen cycles ebb and flow. At the end of the day, what's best for the business is creating the win-win with the retailer, and we've done that. We don't get to where we are today if we hadn't taken that philosophy over the last 50 years. So it's not all that different. Sure, it's better to be in this kind of environment, where supply and demand is in the owner's favor, but that changes, too. And so at the end of the day, it's all about just trying to create a win-win, which I think the history of our company suggests we know how to do it.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe a quick question for Steve. On the Page 22 on the supplemental, you've obviously got a fairly large decline in the Other income. And even if you strip out some of the things like the gain on land sales, the Other was down about $10 million and it's down about $12 million for the year. Can you sort of just talk about that and how do we think about that business in the back half of the year and into next year?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Sure, Steve. There are a couple of things that were in Other income in 2012 that aren't there in 2013. If you remember, we talked from time to time on prior calls that we were owners of some mortgages, so there was some income flowing through from that debt. That debt has all been paid off. Likewise, we were the mezz lender to The Mills. That debt was obviously retired as part of the transaction in 2012. And then we have had, as you mentioned, both lower land sales, as well as, on a year-to-date basis, much lower lease settlement income.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, just to reinforce there because I saw your -- well, just to reinforce, the core business of the -- what's in the Other income, sponsorship, all of the ancillary things that are generated from the ball business is up this year compared to last year. So there's no change there. That category does represent a lot of our other activity, whether it's loaning folks, buying mortgages. Sometimes, we loan developers money, where we get an option to buy. As Steve said, we bought mortgages. Last year, we sold our investment in the domain residential. So that also category represents kind of the other activity that the company does that's not its, what I'll call, its operating business. And it's a little bit lumpy, no big deal. But the important point is, it is other income, which is good. It's not other losses, that's point one. Point two is that the core business sponsorship, et cetera, is all trending up this year compared to Q2 of last year and year-to-date. Now I don't have exactly that number, what it's up, but we can certainly get it to you pretty quick unless you have it. We don't have the core business number, but we can get that for you, no big deal.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, David, just talk maybe a little bit about the Brazil situation, your relationship with BR malls and sort of what's going on in terms of looking for deals down there and kind of the weakness in Brazil and how do you think that sort of plays out over the next year or 2?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, the joint venture that we have with BR, the first deal we were looking to build an outlet center in was in S\u00e3o Paulo. And as you know, it ran into right-to-build issues. Those, still to this day, have not been satisfied, at least to our comfort level. So at this point, it's a no-go deal until that gets satisfied. And if it does get satisfied, then we'll have a decision to make. And we'll have to assess the climate, both short term and medium term, in deciding whether or not to go forward. But the condition precedent to that decision is not yet there, and that's the right-to-build issue. There is a couple of other sites that our team went down to look at. That may be in the pipe in the future. So let's put that aside. I mean, the macro stuff there is concerning all the supply in the market is concerning. That's kind we kind of like the Outlet business because it was different. It was new. It was going to get ahead of a lot of the supply that came on, on the full price. Obviously, you've got to weigh the macro in. But long term, Brazil is a great, great country with a lot of dynamic growth to it. But we're very cautious on a market like that, and we haven't found the right deal. And thankfully, in hindsight, our decision not to invest aggressively there has been the appropriate one. So we'll wait to see. I've always worried about the cash flows from the buildings that have been built there and whether that was sustainable with all the new supply, the fact that a lot of the cash flow comes from parking. There's a whole host of things. The cost of the goods down there is significant. The high-end malls there, whether they're profitable for the retailers or not, still it's a question mark. So there's a lot there to underwrite. And essentially, that's -- you should assume that those questions have been factored into the fact that we have not made an investment in Brazil.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on sales growth. With regards to the increase from $575 a square foot reported in the first quarter to $577 reported now, do you think the sequential increase of 35 basis points is a sign for concern as it's somewhat weaker than the other recent quarters?", "David E. Simon", "No.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "No, okay. And then can you comment on which areas of retail seem to be doing especially well versus the ones that are keeping that number from increasing as much as it had been in previous 3 quarters?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I'll let Rick talk about that. But I will say this. I mean, the ups and downs of retailers and retail sales is a historical fact. But the increasing of our cash flow year after year is also a historical fact. And so we don't get overexcited whether sales go up 5% or down 5% because we know that the cash flow that we generate from our buildings has a long history of increasing, given that we've got tenants in there that are very profitable and we have leases that are below market. So when we look at -- we give you this information, I don't -- I have never pulled my hair out based upon -- or jumped up for joy when sales have increased. I mean, we're just giving you the facts. The fact of the matter is our comp NOI is going to grow because our market rents are well below what leases are rolling over, as someone pointed out earlier. So I just want to reinforce that point, and then Rick can go ahead and answer your question.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Just to add a little more color to that, the stronger regions for us were New England, the Mountain states, Southwest and South Atlantic; a little weaker were the Plains, Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes. The stronger categories were juniors, women's specialty, accessories, men's shoes and women's better. And the weaker areas were women's popular, home furniture and women's special size.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Did you guys talk about a yield expectation for your investment in McArthurGlen?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're going to -- when the whole deal closes, we'll give that to you. But as we said initially when we announced it in May, that it will be accretive, and it's going to be -- we believe it's going to be a profitable transaction. But until all the elements of it close, we're not going to get into those details.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you guys made an investment in 6 interests in their malls. They own about, I think, about 20 or more. Was it just because of the structures in the individual malls or was it more selective buying?", "David E. Simon", "Well, again, we haven't closed on 4 of the 6 yet. But when those close, some of those interests are held outside of MGE, which again, over time, I think we'll have the opportunity to the extent that we want to, to buy interest in some of those assets. But they're not really, at this point, owned by MGE other than a couple, which we kind of collectively both agreed that we didn't want to buy at this particular point. So again, this is a long-term transaction that we feel will be able to increase our investment in but in a methodical, thoughtful way. And we're just focused on finishing the first deal, and then we'll be able to look at other opportunities going forward not just with some of the other assets that they manage, but don't own or own very little, but also other opportunities out there.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the 5.9% same-store NOI growth, could you help us -- could you break it out a little bit, maybe how much of it will fund the revenue front versus expenses? And it looks like your tenant reimbursements increased pretty significantly. How much of that looks driven by that as well?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Ki Bin, this is Steve. You hit the 3 components. Minimum rent was over half of it. A contributor was also the net increases in recoveries, if you will, and then percentage rents. If you look at our overage rent line on both the consolidated financials, but then also our share of the JV income, overage rent was a contributor as well.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And is that -- the increase in recovery, so what thought about that, it seems this is higher than it's been before on a year-over-year basis?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, I don't think it's higher than it's been year before, but it's -- we're 90-plus percent converted to fixed CAM. We have annual escalators of that fixed charge, and that annual escalator has been at a higher rate than expenses have been growing. And in fact, we've done a really good job of holding expenses relatively flat, so that's been additive.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And last question, and I'll kind of leave it open-ended. Surprised that you guys didn't include the outlet development in Philadelphia with Penn REIT in your, I guess maybe it's too new, in your development pages or disclosures. And I guess I'll leave it open-ended, maybe you could comment a little bit about that?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, I mean, it's -- once we approve it internally, it will go on our schedule. We expect it to go forward. It's still finalizing the permit. We're actually rushing, I hope to start this year so we could open next year. That's going to be touch and go just because we have to go through some permitting stuff. Once we do it and approve it, it will be there. We expect it to be a good deal. Penn REIT approached us with the site, I don't know, 1.5 year, 2 years ago, Rick, probably?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "About a year.", "David E. Simon", "We looked at it. We did a little bit of tentative pre-leasing with the retailers. They expressed an interest. We're going to build it once we get permitted, not overly complicated. And then, hopefully, if we do get to jump through the hoops that we need to jump through, we could actually start this year and then have a chance of opening next year. But like I said, that's right on the bubble. If not, it will be a '15 opening.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Is that a 50-50 JV?", "David E. Simon", "No, we own 75%. We have -- and they own 25%, and we have a small partner in our piece. So I think our effective, I remember, is around 65%. Our effective ownership is 65%.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets.", "Paul E. Adornato - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I guess this morning, Hudson's Bay was talking about spinning off their real estate into a Canadian REIT. And so the question is not on Hudson's Bay or Canadian REITs, but really just the longer-term trend of the anchors trying to capture the real estate value for their own shareholders. I was wondering if you had any thoughts or comments on that dynamic and how you might see it playing out going forward.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I will tell you that the attractiveness of a company like ours versus a captive REIT are a completely different set of institutional investors. What people look to in our investment is the growth, rising dividends, the dynamic nature of our company. And by investing with us, they've been well rewarded by our ability to increase our earnings and our dividend and, obviously, the resulting stock price increase. In those captive REITs, they're basically a different set of investors. They're bond-like investors. So it's a whole different thing. And if a retailer wants to do it, I mean, god bless them. I mean, if they makes them ultimately a better retailer and they can use that capital to reinvest in their business, it's no big deal from our standpoint. So there are some that are also trying to redevelop some of their boxes. I think they have found that to be really difficult, and I think what they'd rather end up doing is trying to figure out what the fair market value is and then look for the developer, i.e., us to make the profit. And that's been the nature of the development business for years is that the developer tends to get the development profit because they know what they're doing. So I don't think any of this is really all that different. I think it's potentially an attractive way for them to raise the capital to fund Saks. And if they can do that and make the combination a better, more profitable business, we're all for it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "It looks as if we ended the 30-year decline in long-term interest rates in the first half of this year. So if rates are going to be going up, what do you think Simon might have to do differently over the next 3 to 5 years in order to generate returns as attractive as the returns you've been able to generate over the last couple of decades, David?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think the plan has been put in place, David, which is for us to generate the kind of returns that we want to generate that we've done historically, it's really the redevelopment, new development pipe that we've produced. And that's bigger than it's ever been. A lot of the returns that we generated historically was because we bought a lot of stuff at good prices and the values went up, and we added value through increasing the cash flow. The arbitrage that we have in the redevelopment and new development business, and as large as it is, is actually higher even with higher interest rates. So as long as we can execute, and that's assessing retailer demand and making sure the costs are right, I think we can still do what we've done as we've shifted more toward redevelopment and new development as opposed to acquisition in terms of how we look at all the capital that we're plowing back into the business. So I don't think we have to do anything extraordinary. And other than -- and it is extraordinary other than execute our pipe, which is huge and complicated. But if we can do that, I think we're in good stead.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "David, I'd also remind you, as I think David mentioned in his opening remarks, we fund that pipeline with free cash flow. So in theory, the cost of that capital is 0, so the arbitrage is very good. But I'd also remind you, we have $2.9 billion of debt coming due next year. The weighted average interest rate is 6%. We've got $2.9 billion coming due the following year at a weighted average interest rate of about 5 1/4%. So even though with the spike in interest rates that we've seen, today, our bonds trade in the 3 3/4% range for 10 year. So there still should be a very positive pickup as we refinance that debt over the next couple of years.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, you read my note that I put out a month ago or so, and I've made 6 suggestions that REITs might adopt by way of strategy and tactics to generate performance in a rising rate environment. Would you just care to expand on why you think that managing leverage over the cycle would perhaps not be the right way to go?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, David, listen, I think one of the things we should have all learned coming out of '08, '09 is that the world changes. It's a volatile place. The price we pay for being a REIT is that we don't fund -- self-fund our debt from cash flow, so we should all run with a fair bit of liquidity. And I think we should all run with relatively conservative balance sheets. So you and I might disagree on that particular point.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a point of detail on the McArthurGlen deal. If we think about the return expectations you underwrote there, on the existing assets, do you think those assets are going to produce higher returns than dollars invested in the existing outlet centers in the U.S. and so we're looking really at this transaction as offering the better returns from development as we go forward? Or do you think it's going to be -- you're going to get attractive returns out of the existing assets as well?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I think the returns that we were able to generate out of the U.S. Outlet business are pretty damn good. So there's not much out there that we're going to do that's going to rival the returns that we get from new development and extending our existing U.S. Premium Outlet business. But that doesn't mean that, that should eliminate us making other good investments. And we are as busy as we've ever been in the U.S. Premium Outlet business. We're not doing every deal. I mean, there's lots of other outlet developers doing lots of new business in that space, both redevelopment and new development. So we're focused on what we can do, and that's great. And we're piling a lot of capital on that as evidenced by the new development and the extensions at Woodbury and Seattle and Desert Hills and Orlando and Vegas, et cetera. But that doesn't mean that the stuff that we're doing in Europe is not going to be attractive over both the medium and the long run. It's not quite as good as the U.S.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Right. I mean, having seen a couple of those McArthur assets over the years, I mean, I only think [ph] they've been pretty well managed. I'm not suggesting that you couldn't squeeze some more out of them, but it's not like there's huge amount being left on the table, I don't think.", "David E. Simon", "Well, people have said that about other stuff that we bought, and we figure out how to do that. So I'm hopeful we can do the same thing here as well.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from John Kim of CLSA.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on your potential interest in CFX retail in Australia. Internationally, your acquisitions have primarily been through joint ventures. But regarding CFX, I was wondering if your preference was again to go this route. Or would you entertain the idea of fully owning and managing the assets, given the high quality of the portfolio and given the fact that the management rights are for sale?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we didn't say any of that. So I think someone asked a big picture question about Australia, and that's all I said was we haven't ruled it out. We've -- so I really can't add anything more to that than what I just said.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. Then maybe I could just clarify, is the Commonwealth Bank's potential sale of its management rights and interest in CFX, is that something that's heightened your interest in Australia than a normal investment?", "David E. Simon", "Well, again, we haven't -- we look at opportunities worldwide, and that would -- to the extent that, that surfaces, we'd look at it just like anything else. I mean, I can't really expound on it. There's nothing really to add at this point.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. Just turning to another Aussie company. There are market reports that Lend Lease, who you've transacted with in the past, is looking to sell its ownership stake and management rights of Bluewater in the U.K. Would a single acquisition like this be appealing to you in complementing your European investment? Or do you still prefer a platform in entering a new market?", "David E. Simon", "I would say one individual asset would have -- this is a generic statement. It would have to be a unique individual asset in a market that we're familiar with for us to do it, to do that as supposed to just -- I'd prefer a platform. Certainly, an asset like Bluewater is unique, and it's a very good asset. But generally, it would have to just -- this is a generic statement. For us to enter into a market that we don't -- we're not -- we don't have any presence, it would have to be the best of the best in terms of an asset. I'd prefer a platform, and that's basically a generic statement, outside of it being kind of the best asset in that market.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Can you comment on whether or not the U.K. is within Kl\u00e9pierre's domain? Or is it sort of an open market for either one of you to invest in?", "David E. Simon", "Well, first of all, there are no restrictions that we have vis-\u00e0-vis Kl\u00e9pierre other than, I'm Chairman of the Supervisory Board and I've got to obviously act accordingly. They are not in the U.K. I don't -- there's never been any discussion that they'd have any interest in the U.K., and I don't foresee that at all.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question for both David and Steve. What sort of interest rate environment are you guys managing the business towards over the next few years? Are you expecting higher rates in, say, the next 2 to 3 years?", "David E. Simon", "Well, are we? Sure. I wish I could tell you what the rate is, then I would also be trading treasuries, I guess. But the fact of the matter is we're being as aggressive on refinancing our business as we can. We're not all that excited doing, trading dollars, which essentially is, to some extent, our secured debt's got obviously, make whole provisions and all of it or most of it. But as soon as they are open to prepay, we're refinancing that. We don't necessarily believe in funding the make-whole premium. It's basically trading present-value dollars. It creates lumpiness in the earnings blah, blah, blah. I'm not a big fan of it. We may do it in one particular context on one deal. But I mean, we're as active as we can, Steve, on refinancing.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "We are. And not only that, Jeff, we have, despite the fact that LIBOR is at 20 bps and hasn't moved, and there would be a temptation to float. The fact is 90-plus percent of our debt is fixed-rate debt. And we've done the match with long-lived assets and long term fixed-rate debt. I mean, Jeff, I think David's right. I think rates are likely to rise. Having said that, they've already moved 75 to 100 bps, and we don't have a lot of robust economic growth in the economy today. But I do think it's probably likely that we'll see a higher rate environment going forward.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Have you guys seen already any demonstrable impact on asset pricing, either deals being retraded, or do you expect a better acquisition environment ahead?", "David E. Simon", "No, I mean, I don't think there's been a really reaction on the transaction side because of rising rates at all. I have not seen that at all.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And maybe this one's for Rick, just on occupancy costs, I'm curious. The pace of sales growth is decelerating, but re-leasing spreads have been fairly healthy. Why haven't we seen an increase in occupancy costs? And do you think that's going to ratchet up in the next 12 months?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, one of the components of occupancy costs are sales and the rents. Frankly, we're only rolling relatively small percentage of our square footage every year. And our sales have been growing pretty aggressively, and our spreads have been growing right along with that. So as we pointed out earlier, given that we're 11.3%, we think we still have considerable room to grow our rent even in a moderating sales environment.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just maybe an understanding percentage rents. I know overall, the portfolio does about $577 a square foot. But when you guys look at who actually pays percentage rents, does the sales productivity of those tenants vary much from the portfolio average? I'm just curious if the productivity of the percentage rent payers is sort of higher or lower than the portfolio as a whole?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It is all over the block. We've got over 1,200 tenants that pay us percentage rent. So we have a very wide and diverse base. And really, there's no particular corollary between how would you say, sales productivity and the payment of percentage rent.", "David E. Simon", "And to amplify Rick's point about 1,200. A lot of our percentage rent payers are actually department stores that pay a 1% or 2% or 3%, depending on the vintage of the original deal. And I would tell you that, that's a big component of our percentage rent. And as you might imagine, it's been kind of static over the last several years. And in some cases, down when you're talking about a penny.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just one last question, actually, for you, David. I recall that I think Simon or Chelsea had bought in Craig's interest in their Carlsbad's outlet years ago for, I think, around a 10 cap. Are there any more of those purchase options still lingering with Craig?", "David E. Simon", "We're looking. I'd like to find a few more, but I don't believe so. But if I stumble upon it, I'll let you know.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just focusing on the same-store growth. You're in the mid-5s through the first half of the year against some pretty tough comps in '12. And you had mentioned earlier in the year that some of the redevelopment might weigh on '13 growth. Would you say you've navigated through that better than expected, or should we expect some of that to rear its head in the second half of the year?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think our comps -- I have been very, very pleased, and it's above our own internal budgets on our comp, our comp NOI growth. So it's -- we've -- the team, the folks, the leasing, the management folks have done a fantastic job year-to-date and beaten my own internal expectations. So they've done a great job.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I mean, so looking ahead to the second half of the year, I mean you do have some pretty easy comps from last year. Is there anything out there in the redevelopment that should make us think that you would not continue what you've been doing here in the second -- in the first half?", "David E. Simon", "Well again, redevelopment, we exclude. So it's really -- it's not -- that's not a net number. So let's put that aside. I mean look, there are unknowns in the business environment, right? Sales. I hate blaming the weather, I will never blame the weather. Even if we miss one quarter because of the weather, you will not hear the weather excuse here.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Will you take credit for it though?", "David E. Simon", "We won't take credit. We will not blame an early Easter, a late Easter, early Halloween or a late Halloween. But there are lots of things, Nate, out of our control: tenant bankruptcies, lousy sales, lousy weather, whatever, international politics, U.S. politics, whatever changes the consumer mindset. So I mean we're still in an uncertain environment, that's why we try to be very cautious in how we look at things. And I've been, as I said to you, I wish I could give you a number, I won't. You know we don't. But I've been very, very happy with the way the teams executed operationally. They've done a great job thus far.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to clarify, just on the McArthurGlen deal. I know you're going to provide more details when it finally closes. In terms of the guidance update though, I mean is there anything baked in for accretion for McArthurGlen and also, any transaction costs baked in?", "David E. Simon", "No, not at all, not -- it's not in our numbers. Correct.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, just going back to the interest rate commentary. I mean, appreciate the color on not wanting to pre-pay some of the mortgages. But just curious if you're thinking about pre-funding some of the unsecured debt that's coming due, given where rates are today, how they've backed up in light of your rating increase or improvement there?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, that's a distinct possibility as we look out in the third and fourth quarter. That -- I would -- Steve, can add to this. But I -- we always are trying -- we always get ahead of that schedule. So it wouldn't surprise -- it shouldn't surprise you if we do that some time this year.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, I mean bonds are like mortgages in that there is the equivalent of a yield maintenance. There's a make-whole. So to some extent, you are trading dollars. But having said that, much like we did in December of '12, we went to the bond market to pre-fund, if you will, our '13 maturities because we knew what they were. If you look at our debt maturities schedule, we've got about $900 million of bonds coming due in 2014. So as David mentioned, we do look at the market. We monitor the market. One of the great things about the bond market is that you can go relatively quickly. And so we do have that option to pre-fund that at some point in time.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones on McArthurGlen, sorry about this. But the EUR 435 million was an equity investment. Can you let us know what the associated debt is that goes along with that?", "David E. Simon", "We will outline all of that when we're closed on the transaction. But the leverage on -- there's nothing extraordinary about the leverage amount on these assets. So -- but we'll lay it all out with all the facts once all of the elements get closed.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Do you think that's Q3, or is that Q4?", "David E. Simon", "Let's see. When Q3 -- I would think that it should be completed by the end of this quarter.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, last question. What was the trigger to sell the Laguna Hills Mall?", "David E. Simon", "It's very interesting. We had a redevelopment plan -- even after that redevelopment plan, given all of the -- what the assets are -- if you've been to Laguna and you know kind of the -- what we owned in Orange County, what the spectrum does and what the spectrum is, our Mission Viejo and Brea Mall. Even with the redevelopment, even though it's well located, it was never going to be a really good core asset like Brea or Mission or Orange, the outlets in Orange. So we said, \"You know what, we can reinvest -- we can take that capital and reinvest it in what we think will be a core opportunity at the end of the day. \" And it was really that kind of thinking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "David, you mentioned having no additional purchase options with Craig Realty. But I do recall you did have some prior agreements with Prime when you ended up buying Livermore and Grand Prairie. So maybe based on your comments, is it fair to assume that you have no prior agreement, option or other with any private outlet owners at this time?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'm just trying to think. Don't put me on the spot like that. I can't remember everything. We will do -- we are about to do another deal with Prime that actually will probably sign up this week. So -- and they've announced -- it's no secret. I mean it's in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which we think is going to be a terrific investment for us. And -- so you're putting me on the spot, I mean -- but we've got a couple of other opportunities. So I just want to be careful how you characterize that. But there's other stuff that we're working on that we'll have options to get in on. So I shouldn't unilaterally say, \"Yes, you're right.\" I think there are other stuff out there.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "All right, sorry for putting you on the spot. But maybe for that deal with Prime in Minneapolis, I mean, can you talk about the pricing and the cap rate on that potential deal? And are you going to buy up the entire center outright at this point?", "David E. Simon", "In that case, there's no option to buy it, frankly. But it's -- we're development partners. So that's -- we're just going in on the development side. So the returns are consistent with kind of what we've developed over the years in the outlet business.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But you are going to be an owner of that project, right?", "David E. Simon", "Correct, correct.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And I'm just curious. Why is the expansion at Woodbury Premium Outlet so expensive, given the relatively modest expansion of physical space there? Is there anything unusual going on with that, that would lead to that $170 million investment than you're thinking?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're upgrade -- first of all, parking is really expensive because we have to deck the parking to create the additional space. We have a tight site to start with, and we've got a lot of infrastructure work in terms of the parking. A lot of -- we're redoing all of the ingress, egress, all the roads around it. And then, I mean as much as we love the center, it is long in the tooth. So we're also bringing it, keeping it consistently, with consistent theming, but it does need to be renovated. But at the end of the day, even with that said, so you have the parking, you've got all the road work, it's going to make it better for the consumer to get in and out of. We're renovating the mall. We've got some demolishing -- a couple of buildings. You put it all together. New York ain't cheap. It's not like building in the Midwest, you put it all together. I had the same reaction, frankly, but I still like the returns. And it's -- it is the world's best outlet center. So if we're going to spend money anywhere, it ought to be in the world's best outlet center. And so you put it all together, it's a good return. And it is what it is. We're actually very excited; it's progressing. We actually -- originally, were going to do over a 3-year period. I told the guys to go back, figure out how to get it done in '15. And they've come up with a plan. So we're going to -- this thing is going to be hot and heavy for 1.5 years. But I think afterwards, it will reinforce its position as the world's best outlet center. So we're -- we couldn't be more excited about a project than that one.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But a lot of nonincome-producing work that you're doing there. So a good return to you, but below the 12% that you're getting on some of the other redevelopments in the outlet space?", "David E. Simon", "Correct, correct, correct.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And then just a final one. I know it's a small potential investment. But can you maybe comment on your intentions that, that land at Oyster Bay that you're trying to buy with some of your partners?", "David E. Simon", "Nothing really to say other than to the extent it moves forward, us and our partners will look at it and come up with a plan that's got -- that's subject to zoning. And we would expect to come up with a responsible development plan, but it's all going to be something that's going to be subject to getting zoning approvals. But we hope to benefit the community there and work with the community there to come up with the appropriate plan. But it's going to be driven, not just by us, but our 2 highly regarded partners.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Is the goal to build a regional mall at that site longer term?", "David E. Simon", "No. No, no, I don't see that at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Back -- way back to the recovery ratio questions, Steve. The JV recovery ratio is up pretty extensively in the first and second quarter of this year. Is that going to continue at that kind of rate, you think? I mean are we level at 2Q for a recovery ratio in the joint venture platform?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, Rich, it's just, I mean, ultimately, it's math. It's a function of where the expenses go relative to the contractual increases that we have built into our leases. Give me your view on where you think inflation is headed and where costs are headed. So far, over a period of several years now, we've been having expenses grow at a slower rate than the escalators in the leases. So it's been additive to the comp NOI growth. In any event, Rich, I would say that the pace of the additiveness will probably slow down.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. That's fair. Then the -- you commented, David, on the, on what's going on in Brazil as far as outlet centers go. What do you think for North America, in terms of how many you can build annually or some number that addresses that sort of concept over the next 5 years?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I can't put a number on them. I mean there's a big pipeline out there. We're going to do a handful, lots of other guys are involved and trying to do a number of them, and we'll see. I mean I -- not clear to me that they'll all get built, but obviously, it's the flavor of the month. There's any center that's out there that is not meeting its performance expectations, turns into an outlet center. They're all harder to do than what people think, but there's a lot of, obviously, very capable, confident developers out there trying to build outlets. The important thing is, what we build is good. And I can't worry about what others build. I can only worry about what we build. And it's every intention, on our front, to only build what we can lease and generate a positive return on. And thankfully, Rick, we haven't really screwed up yet in the new development side. So hopefully, that will continue.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And the only thing that I would emphasize, and David touched on it earlier, is that in addition to new developments, these expansions that we're doing are at some of the best outlet centers in the world, and they're not small. Desert Hills is 147,000 feet. Las Vegas North is 147,000 feet. Seattle was 90,000 feet. These are big substantial expansions that were bringing great retailers, making some of the best in the world even better. And that shouldn't be lost sight of.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. While you're on that, Rick, I have a question for you on Desert Hills. I just was in the area and saw that one. And it's always been a great center. And I'm curious, I didn't quite get exactly what you're doing there. It looks like you might be building a golf course in the middle or something?", "David E. Simon", "Even though Steve wanted us to...", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I thought it was finally time to have a golf course at an outlet center.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "What's going on now is -- there's really 3 things going on simultaneously. We are, as David alluded to at Woodbury, we're building a parking deck behind the existing larger section of Desert Hills, plus we've already built additional great parking behind the smaller section. And now what you're seeing in the interior of the larger section is the actual development of the retail space that's basically going to be an inner ring. So we're going to maintain our race track layout, but it now instead of being single-sided with parking in the middle, it's going to be double-sided with parking in the decks.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I got you. So how many retailers do you have there, do you think?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, we're adding 147,000 feet. And frankly, one of the things we've been able to do to drive our NOI is to try and be a lot more disciplined on the size of the retailers and maximizing our revenues by trying to fit as many new retail concepts into the space as possible. So I would hope that it would be several dozen, but it remains to be seen because people want as large a store as they can get there.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. I got you. And last thing, guys, do you have any updated thoughts on JCPenney and how they're doing, I guess, over the past quarter?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing that I would comment on is that we're obviously in the stores. The stores look good. We know as much about their sales as you do. I will tell you that through our channel check, the debt's trading at par. I think this is just a matter of giving the management team time to position it where they want to position it. It's still a formidable retailer with considerable gross sales, and we certainly hope they can recapture market share and resume a growth profile.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Two quick ones with Steve. First, Steve, the reversal of the provision for credit losses. I'm just wondering how much of that is a signal to the Street, about how confident Simon is feeling about tenant credit?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, Tayo, it's not really a reversal of a provision. It's just the fact that there were some receivables that we had reserved for, and in essence, written off, that in fact, were subsequently collected. But I will say this. As we look at our credit profile of our tenants and as we look at our receivables every month that we do, number of outstanding receivables, number of tenants on the watch list is pretty muted right now. And I would say the overall health of the retailers is pretty, pretty strong right now.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, other than I just -- there are a few out there that -- and don't ask me to name names because I won't. But there are a few out there that still have some clouds around them, so we are -- we're focused on 2 or 3 out there that are relatively decent sized for the mall business that we'll have to just monitor how they ultimately turn their business around.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, just the JV income, Steve. First quarter, that number was about $54 million. But I think you mentioned that number was on the high side because of some mark-to-market on the Kl\u00e9pierre leases. But in 2Q, the number comes in at $56.5 million. I'm just kind of wondering, from a run rate perspective, what makes sense for us to be modeling?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I would say, Tayo, the run rate is probably more in line with what we saw in the first quarter, backing out that onetime trend [ph], onetime thing we talked about. So it's in the high 40s to about $50 million a quarter, I think.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So what happened this quarter again to make it still elevated?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "There was a gain, a small gain, that flowed through related to Kl\u00e9pierre's sale of their home office headquarter building.", "Operator", "Sir, we have no further question at this time. So I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Thank you very much. Have a great rest of the summer. See you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

The supplemental information is available on the investors.simon.com.", "I would now like to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Good morning. It was a strong quarter with excellent performance in our core business. We had strong progress on our growth strategy, which includes redevelopment and expansion of existing properties to meet retailer demand and enhanced productivity, development of new Premium Outlets and our continued smart acquisition strategy. FFO was $2.21 per share, up 11.1% from the third quarter of 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus estimate by $0.05 per share.", "For the malls and the Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 4.9% for the quarter, driven by tenant sales up 3% to $579 per square foot. Occupancy up 90 basis points to 95.5%. Our releasing spread was a positive 15.2%, or $8.05 per square foot. Retailer demand for space in our properties remained strong and healthy, driving our occupancy increases. Our retailers sales continues -- growth continues to be ahead of GDP. And more important to us, our existing leases are under market rent. And keep in mind, we see almost no or very little correlation between tenant sales growth and our NOI growth due to our ability to replace underperforming retailers. We have good visibility for strong NOI growth over the near term.", "New development, just quickly, we opened 3 new Premium Outlet Centers during August, all of which have exceeded expectations. All were nearly 100% leased at opening, and sales per square foot of all 3 properties are trending above our portfolio average. The total net development cost of the 3 were $400 million, that's not our share, but in total, we expect a first year return of 10.5% on our cost.", "We broke ground on Premium Outlets in Charlotte and in Montr\u00e9al.

It's 98% leased. Community acceptance and early reports on sales have exceeded expectations. We also opened a 105,000 square-foot expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets in October. It's 100% leased. Redevelopment and expansion projects ongoing at more than 35 properties in the U.S. and Asia.", "Overall, our multi-year pipeline of new development and redevelopment and expansion projects is key to driving growth in NOI. We continue to expect development investment at least $1 billion annually, from '13 through '16 go projects. Go projects include Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Woodbury, Stanford, Del Amo, just to name a few. In other words, they are under construction.", "International, just let me mention a few things. Finally, we completed the closing of our joint venture with McArthurGlen. It includes ownership interest in 5 McArthurGlen Designer Outlets located in Vienna, Venice in Naples, in the Netherlands, near D\u00fcsseldorf and one in the U.K. near Kent. We also own a 50% interest in their management and development company, which has a strong pipeline of future projects and opportunities. We're excited to partner together. Great platform for high quality retail real estate in Europe and a strong team of professionals. This partnership supports and extends our international growth strategy. Important industry synergies will be taken advantaged of in upcoming years, similar to what we're accomplishing with Kl\u00e9pierre.", "Total consideration for the recent investments is approximately $500 million at a cap rate of slightly north of 6.5%.

On the Eurobonds, just sort of curious what the reception was over there as far as -- is there a dedicated REIT bond community? Or do people -- are they generally -- as in do they look at you guys as a real estate company or do they look at you as a corporate America, Fortune 500 company?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Alex, it's really the latter. The real estate market over there, the investment grade real estate market isn't deep enough that there are people who are dedicated real estate bond investors. So the interest was very high. I think we met with almost 50 investors during a 4.5-day roadshow. Almost all of them ended up coming into the deal. They are money managers, insurance companies, pension funds, really sticky, good, patient money. But they are -- they certainly viewed us not only as a best-in-class real estate company, but as a major U.S. corporate who has a presence in Europe, but also gets 90% of its income from the U.S., which was an important diversification element for them.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up to that. Should we expect you guys to issue in Japan if you are looking at outside the country for long-term capital?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It's a good question, Alex. I mean, I would say this. Right now, we have a multi-currency tranche on our credit facility, and we do have yen outstanding that acts as a hedge against our equity investment in our Premium Outlets portfolio in Japan. No plans, at the present time, to go to the bond market in Japan, but that's certainly an option that would be available to us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "David, a question on the outlet business. So the recent openings, you're up to probably 25%, 30% of NOI housed within outlets. And I'm sort of curious, one, we sort of reevaluate at this point sort of breaking that out as a stand-alone in terms of metrics, in terms of performance, just given the size and how good it's performing. But also, as you think about the pie assignment on Page 19 of your supplemental, where the sort of outlet to go over the next 5 years from what you can see relative to the other pieces in there? And maybe you can talk about sort of that range of opportunities that you see that you ended your comments with.", "David E. Simon", "Well, no, the fact is we really run this together, even though we have separated some personnel. The fact is, we really run the business as one entity on the outlets and the malls. So we don't see any reason to separate it out. And the fact is, both are -- we couldn't produce these results if both weren't producing very favorable results. They're both material enough. So the fact of the matter is, this is -- our numbers are a real good indication of what's going on in our business, whether you want to just look at malls or outlets. It's really -- it really is -- requires to deliver, both have to produce these kind of results to have it shown together. Now, with respect to the outlet business, look, that's where our new development is focused. As you know, we just opened 3, which is pretty good work. We've got a good pipeline of 4, 5, 6 others, a couple of which are already under construction. We've got another 3 or 4 that are in the pipeline. So that's going to continue to move the outlet business percentage up. On the other hand, as I mentioned to you, we are under construction, or about to be under construction, in Stanford, the Field, Del Amo, Houston Galleria, just a -- I won't -- I know Rick wants to list them all, but I will not let him. So just to name a few. And I think that will start to kick in '15, '16, '17, that will probably rebalance the pie chart as we look back in 3, 4 years from now.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What you're saying, the range of opportunities, as you sort of -- you ended your comments with that you're not resting on your laurels, you see a range of opportunities. Obviously, you talked about the development in outlets and all the redevelopment that's happening, what other sort of scope should we think about and how it impacts that -- your pie chart or the company in terms of opportunities? That's what I sort of want to dig into a little bit.", "David E. Simon", "If I told you, then you would upgrade somebody and the price would go up. So I'd rather just keep that to myself.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Michael, this is Steve. Just to put a pin in it, though. Over the last 4 years, we spent over $12 billion in acquisition of assets, so not an insignificant number.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, look, I think, as Steve said, is as we look back since 2010 -- and these are gross numbers, we've purchased about $12.8 billion -- these are gross, so it includes debt assumption, all these other stuff, not necessarily our share. But we've acquired about $12.8 million. We disposed about $2.7 million. And we've developed $1 billion of new stuff ground up. So, again, I know it gets lost in the sauce, but we're always very focused on upgrading and reconstituting the portfolio. And we see -- look we see, international growth ahead of us, Michael, if that's what you're asking. And in the U.S., we've got the expansion pipeline, which is overwhelming. I mean, literally, nobody in our industry is doing what we're doing, expanding our existing great assets. Nobody. And also complementing that is all the new development we're doing in the outlet business, of which, as you know, we're executing consistent with the returns that we've done historically. Toronto is great. St. Louis is great. We're under construction in Charlotte. Montr\u00e9al based upon Houston is great. Vancouver, now that we're in the McArthurGlen partnership, that's going to be good. We got a couple of new sites that we're working on, some ourselves, some with partners. Tampa is an example, and so on. So there's a lot to do. And how that pie chart changes, we'll see. But the fact of the matter is, we see pretty good growth organically just assuming we can execute the way we have in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "David, we understand that you've joined some of your mall peers to do a beta test of same-day delivery with Deliv. And I'm remembering back to a conversation we had, maybe 10 years ago, where you had talked about Domino's Pizza and the fact that they weren't in the pizza business, but they were really in the 30-minute logistics business, and wouldn't that be cool if the mall could figure out how to do that. Is that affectively what you're trying to accomplish here with this beta test? And is that really the future of the mall in order to compete with the Amazons of the world?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I do think the mall has a unique advantage in that it's already got the infrastructure -- physical infrastructure to satisfy consumers that want same-day delivery. Now it sounds great, it's a little more complicated than that. But to the extent, one of the things having spent yesterday with our mall team, just kind of going -- not property by property, that we look forward to on a couple of weeks. But the thing that I am focused on in our mall business -- and when I say mall business, I include the outlets, is that we have to make -- we've always made retailer service a priority. So Rick and I are as good at sucking up to retailers as possible, okay? Sometimes, Rick is better than I am, but we both can suck up when required. The one thing we don't do the way I would like us to, is I really want to -- I want to provide better service to our consumers, the actual shoppers. And whether that's -- something we instituted last year was just surprising delights, come to the mall and we're going to give you a free cup of coffee, we're going to schlep your bags. We're going to make your visit really better. Think about the hotel level of service at a good hotel when you're checking in and they're taking care of you to make your stay pleasant. With that said, we do think delivery, or schlepping, you remember we started YourSherpa -- probably not politically correct, but whatever. But we started this years ago, we are actually too far ahead of our time. But the fact of the matter is, we want to increase the level of customer service that we provide to our shoppers. We think this is consistent with that, whether this venture will do that or not, we don't know, we'll going to continue to experiment, we've got a whole smorgasbord of things that we're investing to do that and the sole purpose is to make the consumer visit more pleasant, which is a huge focus for us this year, next year and the year after.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "That makes sense. As I thought about this, I said to my myself, is the next evolution that I go to your website for whatever mall I'm shopping at, and I can do a search for white shirt, and then instantly your website brings up every white shirt that's being sold in the mall, I can click on which one I want and buy it. Is that the next evolution that you have to get to, the integration of inventory of all your retailers onto your website so -- that is the interface?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I would say that would be terrific if we could ultimately get to their store-level inventory and be able to communicate that to the consumer, much like the mall aggregates all the physical stores. If we could figure out how to do that, that would be great. It's not that easy because you have to essentially get into the customer -- or the retailer's inventory. But the one thing I want you to do is when you do go to the mall, I want to be able to tell you, when you go to the mall, here's what's new in retailer XYZ, here's what promotion XYZ retailer has. Here's who does have a white shirt, to go to what retailer. So you have a -- your first stop at the mall is going to be able to communicate to you what's new and what's exciting so that makes your visit that much more pleasant if, in fact, we can do that. And more profitable for you. So I think it's interesting to do it while you're in the physical environment, as it is whether you're at home or on your mobile device.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm actually Craig Schmidt. I'm noticing the new development blended stabilized rate of return is 9%. Is that more due to higher cost or are the rents unable to be pushed as much as say maybe 1 year ago?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Craig, it's Steve. It's really neither. That number, the mix changes from time to time. We opened some projects, as David mentioned, the first year return on the stuff that has opened, which is no longer on the list, was 10.5%. So it's simply a mix change. But there's been no real fundamental change in our ability to get rents or cost control or our expectations for our development pipeline.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I just -- I noticed the leasing spreads have been up 4 quarters in a row and, on a dollar basis, have grown from $4.86 to $8.05. I'm wondering, where can they go from here? And is that from limited supply of quality space or just a growing demand from retailers?", "David E. Simon", "Well, it's a function of demand is solid, and you got to look at what's expiring. So as I said, we -- there's a huge focus of our retailers sales. We've tried to explain the correlation is slight, if at all, and it's in a lag. The fact is, as you know, retail sales have gone up dramatically since the Great Recession. And you look at what's expiring and you look at the supply and demand characteristics, you put it all together, it's more of an art than a science, and that's why we're able to have pretty good releasing spreads. Now, the fact of the matter is $8 is pretty damn good. We're finishing our budget for next year. We're going to see good comp NOI growth just like we had in the last 2 or 3 years. And that ultimately does not take into account when we look at what the Houston Gallerias and the Fields and the Del Amos are going to do after those developments are done. And those malls have been transformed to take the rightful position in the 21st century of great real estate that can't be duplicated. So I can't -- we're not going to give you a number, but things are okay and we'll continue to pound away.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering, did you see anything change in terms of traffic during the third quarter?", "David E. Simon", "Well, generally, September was a pretty bad month in terms of traffic and sales for all retailers. And we're starting to hear and feel the traffic is bouncing back in October. But clearly, clearly, the general economy has slowed. And we're no -- the fact is, we get impacted by that less than most others because of where our properties are positioned and the depth and breadth and the diversity of our properties. But the fact is, we're not denying that the world -- the U.S. has actually slowed. We could talk philosophically about why, but it's nothing with what we're doing. But we're -- we certainly have seen that from our retailers generally across the board to both high-end, middle and at the more moderate customer base.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then, I guess going back to one of your answers before where you mentioned -- if I mentioned the stock, it would go up, upgrade it, blah blah blah. Off-the-cuff comment there?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, and probably a stupid one. Yes, off the cuff and stupid. It's a little early. We're usually at 11:00, 9:00 we're trying to get our groove on. So the fact is, it's probably off the cuff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to think about outlets for a second and when we look at some of the recent projects, some of them -- just in the industry in general, some of them have been more, or been far more correlated with population centers rather than being further outside. What do you think it means for the projects you must develop over the next 10 years and what does it mean for the existing real estate -- in the outlet business that tends to be at the outskirts of town?", "David E. Simon", "Well, again, Cedrik, I believe there's been one that's been built that's more infilled. So we do not hear -- I will just tell you this, our outlet business is great. We're building terrific products. We will not make pronouncements about what the future of the world is going to be, we're not that good or arrogant. We're going to continue to do what we do. We're picking -- we've always picked, over the last several years, major, important metro markets, usually suburban locations -- Toronto, St. Louis, New Hampshire, go down list, all of which have been very successful. We're continuing to do that. There may be 1 or 2 built that's more urban. But one does not make a trend. We will not make pronouncements here. We're not in that business. We're in running our business day in and day out to increase our cash flow, make smart investments, smart developments. And our track record indicates, so far, knock on wood, we're pretty good at that. But I will not make pronouncements if that's the new trend, one does not make a trend.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. What do retailers say about their preferred locations in terms of outlets, and whether or not they do you have an interest in trying to move more infill?", "David E. Simon", "Well, the fact that we're 100% leased on every outlet that we opened gives you an indication what they're telling us.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I think, Cedrik, the retailers want to be where they can be as productive as possible. And what you're finding in all of our properties is that we continue to add high impact retailers, making them more and more attractive to consumers, which drive sales, which drives retail interest. There's no magic to this business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Thinking about dispositions for a second. I don't think you addressed those, Dave. You sold off 2 this quarter, and I'm curious, have you given more thought to maybe selling off a bigger chunk or spinning out a group of your lower tier regional mall assets in the U.S.?", "David E. Simon", "Well, Rich, the fact is, we're always looking to do as much portfolio management as we can. And as I mentioned to you earlier, I mean, since 2010, basically, $12.8 billion of acquisitions, $2.7 billion of dispositions, $1 billion of new development, not including the redevelopment. So that's part of our focus day in and day out, and that will always be an important thing in terms of what we do. And the form of which that takes will depend on market conditions, but we'll continue to do portfolio management. It's very important, very vital. It's been something that we've been pretty good at over the 20-year history of a public company. So we'll continue to do that, Rich.", "Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But no real thought, Dave, to a big chunk, I guess, of assets as opposed to 1 or 2 at a time as opportunities arise?", "David E. Simon", "Well, again, I'm not going to share exactly the internal workings that we do day in and day out in terms of how do you do the best portfolio management possible. But needless to say, if you look at our history, it's an important thing that the senior management team needs to do. And we'll continue to do it to the best of our ability. So I'm not saying one way or another exactly how that will be done, it'll just -- we will portfolio manage to the best of our abilities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to go back to -- along the line of Craig's questioning, and again, releasing spreads, ability to keep raising rents going forward. Steve, could you give us a sense of where occupancy costs are right now relative to historical levels, and how much that gives you confidence about pushing rent going forward?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Tayo, the occupancy costs are 11.4%. I think we give you about 5 quarters of trailing in the supplemental on Page 23. And that's down 100 to 150 basis points from where it would have been going back to 2010.", "But I think, the other point I would add, is that it's been very stable over those 5 quarters. So we are -- we've been at that 11.3% to 11.4% range, and we still have momentum in our business. And that bodes, I believe, very well for our ability to hopefully continue our performance going forward.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. But with your -- with the tenants at this point, when you're going through a lease negotiation like, how much are they really kind of bringing up this issue of slowing tenant sales in general in a tough retail outlook when they're negotiating with you? Or do they just want the space so badly, it doesn't really come up?", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me answer that, I mean, the perception that retailers negotiate -- let's take an example, let's say, their comp NOI is up 4% and they're willing to pay $11. And the comp sales are flat, they go to $10. It's not reality, okay? If they look at it over a longer period of time, what they're going to do, what the return on equity and profitability in that store is. So, again, we try to give you a sense of these numbers generally, what's happening in the -- from our retailers. But the fact is, comps -- the immediate ups and downs of comps have no bearing on what rent we can charge overall. And so -- over a long period of time, potentially. But the one thing you have to remember is, our comp sales also include the retailers that are going out of favor. And if they were in favor 5 or 7 years ago, sometimes, they're able to negotiate whatever rents because we think they are a new and exciting retailer. If that wanes or waxes, the fact is, we're able to replace that retailer with someone else that's there. So there is no, \"Boy, I had a bad quarter of sales; therefore, I'm going to charge -- I want to pay you less rent.\" It doesn't work that way.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "That's definitely helpful color. I think I was up along the line of, if you've had 3 quarters of bad sales, so that's kind of what I was kind of thinking. What happens at that point. But I think the explanation has been very helpful.", "David E. Simon", "Sure. No worries.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Don't lose sight of the fact that between 2010 and 2012, over that 3-year period, sales were up 25% in our portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just since no one asked it here, I'll just throw it out there. Just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts here on what you're seeing from JCPenney. And given that they are discounting pretty heavily to try to claw back some share and sales, just wondering if you're seeing or noticing any impact on other parts of the mall as a result of those efforts.", "David E. Simon", "Now, I would say, generally, it's not -- there's not a real impact of the mall environment. Both with the old Penney, the potential new-transformed Penney, and now the recovering to back-to-basics Penney. I mean, if you go through kind of the 3 cycles the way they were doing it, the radical change, now back-to-basics Penney. The fact of the matter is, it really hasn't impacted kind of the entire mall environment than what we have. If they get back to the basic Penney, having them -- they do broaden the mix generally in the environment and they appeal to a more moderate consumer, which we'd love to have in a number of cases, in a number of malls, as well as the higher-income consumer. And that market is there for them to appeal to that consumer in the mall environment, which they've done historically for 100-plus years. So -- and even before the mall environment. So we'll wait and see how they do that. But it's really had no impact on the -- what I'll call, the mall environment.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So, I mean -- so as they -- I mean, they are making some progress on the sale declines, so I'm just curious if that's hurting anybody else. But it sounds like not.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we're glad that they are. But again, it's not a huge impact on what's going on in the mall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Evercore.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Maybe for David. I'm curious if you any thoughts on the B mall or even C mall sales market, which has been surprisingly active this year. Maybe in terms of the prices being paid for this type of assets. What that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything? And then, also, maybe building off of Rich's question. Do you think spending on a B-mall portfolio would unlock some value for guys?", "David E. Simon", "Well, there's a lot there. So -- and you broke up out on the end. Did you hear the end part?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "The potential of...", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I guess, maybe just starting, just what your thoughts are in terms of the prices being paid for the B and C malls, and what that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything at all?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I'm not going to comment on the value of our stock other than you look -- you need to look at us as a company that can increase its cash flow and its dividend and it has a lot of future, very high returns on equity investments, underlevered, ability to execute its game plan. We get caught up too much on A malls, B malls, tenant sales, all of that stuff. Put it all in the blender, you allocate it, you figure out what's most important to you. What's most important to me is cash flow growth and return on investment and equity, and that's what we strive to execute. And ability to finance our business appropriately, making smart investment decisions, which all kind of factors in. Then the market decides what the value of the stock should be. I don't -- I don't get carried away one way or the other. And the fact is, we look at every asset as it's very important to our business. We look at the future growth prospects. If we might dispose of them, we look at what the price we might get. We'd factor in the taxable income, what we might have to do in terms of dividends if we sold it. Because, as you know, we're at our taxable income number, it's growing rapidly. Our dividend is going to grow. We put all those things in and we try to do the best we can, and we'll see where it takes us. So it's good -- the big picture -- I'm not going to comment on price other than it's, I think, is very positive, generally speaking, that there's a lot of activity in -- if you want to call it B or C malls, call it B or C mall. And I think that never hurts us as an owner of -- if you want to say we're an owner of B and C, that's fine, it never hurts us that there's a lot of capital activity in that business.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And maybe for a follow-up instead. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for cash flow growth in your A malls versus the B malls, and whether you think that's going to compress in the coming few quarters or even years?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think, historically, the better the center or the more -- let me say it differently, the more market share any piece of real estate has, the better its cash flow growth characteristics they have. So whether it's A or B, is irrelevant. It's really a question of, does it have market share, what's the competitive outlook. And those that have that position have better growth characteristics, generally speaking.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets.", "Josh Patinkin", "Thinking about McArthurGlen in the European outlet business, specifically the leasing side. We have upside exposure in the U.S. with overage rents? Is it similarly structured there? Or any other nuances we should be thinking about?", "David E. Simon", "It's very much structured towards sales. But it's even more clever in the sense that they have -- in their leases, they get a percent of sales. But the high watermark is then fixed at kind of their base rent, so you get the best of both worlds in a sense. And these centers, on average, do just a -- if you convert, you all can convert, but we'll do it. These things average about $900 a foot. So it is a -- the ones that we've invested in. And as we think over time, we'll be able to invest in other outlets in Europe through McArthurGlen. We think it's a very productive portfolio and extension opportunities and the like. So we think it's -- we like it and we expect it to be a very good investment for us over time. And I think we're coming in at a decent valuation. So again, that's our ability to assess real estate, handle the complexity of a partnership like this, different countries, different personalities. We're one of the few companies that are able to do a deal like this. And that is a, respectfully I say, a competitive advantage for the company.", "Josh Patinkin", "In terms of growth there, how penetrated do you think Europe is with outlets relative to U.S. and what's the opportunity set in your view?", "David E. Simon", "It's good. Because the right to build in Europe continues whether it's an outlet or even a full priced, it continues to be very high -- or very hard, I should say.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So we see quite a bit of a mall trades here in the last couple of months, and given the activity in the market, was curious on your assessment of recent A- and B-mall asset pricing. Has there been a notable change in cap rates or return expectations giving -- given rising rate expectations and flowing sale trends?", "David E. Simon", "No.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. One more follow-up, if I may, on the releasing spread question. You guys also had a pretty good pickup in CapEx spend this quarter versus prior quarters. How much of this improved releasing spread, would you say, was bought this quarter with the higher CapEx spend?", "David E. Simon", "None.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "None.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, you really -- yes, none. I mean, that -- there's some -- always going to be some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but no issue there. We don't buy -- we're very frugal, as you know, when it comes to tenant allowance and the like.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the comments in terms of upgrading the assets, and you've done a great job over time and very strong redevelopment pipeline now. And when you go through the mall portfolio, mall-by-mall in the next couple of weeks, how much do you have in terms of shadow redevelopment pipeline, where you look at it and say, \"We'd love to do this redevelopment, but don't want to do so until we -- as we look at the struggling anchors here, if this were to happen, we'd do it.\" Just trying to think about that -- the opportunity in terms of that shadow pipeline there.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, let me just -- if I could just comment generally on it. We are in the midst, again, of doing the biggest extensions and the biggest redevelopments that we have. So as an example, I'm not going to do the list. We are under construction in the Field, Roosevelt Field, we are under construction in Stanford, we're under construction shortly in Houston Galleria. And we're getting the approvals in the King of Prussia to create the extension between the 2 big assets. We just got approval from the BRA at Copley, we still need another hurdle. So we are literally -- we just finished Nanuet, Shops at Nanuet, which -- if anybody that's seen the mall prior to what we've done before, you would be pleasantly surprised not only just with the transformation but with the lease-up. So we are -- so for Del Amo, to name another one, we're in the midst of a huge construction there, bringing Nordstrom in and all the rest. So right now, the biggest focus is executing these huge, big redevelopments that are going to be really exciting. And there's a lot of opportunities beyond that. And our pipeline, in terms of redevelopment, is in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. But beyond discussing it, because everybody can have the shadow, the fact of the matter is, it's happening right now. Right now it's happening. So this is no longer, \"We're going to do this,\" it's actually happening. And I've got the pictures to prove it, if you're interested.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "And the only thing I would add is David touched on the major redevelopment projects, we're also adding 39 new anchors across the platforms this year, and we've been adding that every year, and each of those additions just make our properties stronger. We also have an ongoing renovation program, where we're renovating a number of projects every year. And all that is just part of what we're doing to keep our products relevant and enhance their market share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Roane with Hilliard Lyons.", "Jeremy Roane", "I was wondering if you could speak on what has driven the property operating expenses down and maybe shed some light on if this type of expense reduction can be expected going forward?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Jeremy, it's Steve Sterrett. It's a couple of things. One is, as David mentioned earlier, we have sold some assets. We also had a wholly-owned asset that converted into a joint venture in 2013. So there are fewer properties which is causing part of the decline that you're seeing. The rest of the decline is caused by the fact that insurance costs are a little lower. It's really those 2 items that are driving it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Rick, I got a -- just a question on sort of occupancy. 95.5%, I recognize that includes the outlets, but I think that's the peak, overall, and certainly ahead of where you were even in the fourth quarter of last year. And so I'm just curious, as you head into the holiday season when you start including some of that temp spaces, how should we think about occupancy and full the portfolio is? How you're balancing that with rent, which continues to move up in terms of the spreads? And then as you think about '14, given the fact that you've already leased a lot of that space and done your renewals, what's that visibility that you have into '14 in terms of occupancy? It seems like a great place to start from at 95.5% today.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, first, we don't include temp space in the occupancy. Secondly, what we're doing is making our space more efficient, and we are going to be able to continue to generate increases in NOI because we're constantly looking to see how we can make our space more effective by bringing in more productive tenants. David made the point earlier, by decreasing the amount of the space allocated to given tenants. And frankly, we still have leasing going on in the pipeline. So we're never going to be satisfied and never get to the point where we say to you, \"Well, we're fully occupied.\" The bottom line is, look in the Premium Outlets, they're 100%, for all intents and purposes, and we're still driving our NOI and driving spreads, because we're doing more effective leasing, more effective space allocation to more productive tenants.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So where does occupancy go then? I'm just -- I know you don't include temps, so what does that mean for the fourth quarter in terms of...", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I would certainly hope that we continue to show advances over where we are.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And your '14 outlook in terms of how much you've already done relative to that role?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We're certainly going to anticipate that we're going to be able to increase it in '14.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "This still a little early for us old folks.", "David E. Simon", "I know. You know what? No doubt, okay? No doubt.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "I know you talked a little bit about sales on this call, but if you look at your percentage rent growth line, in the first half of the year it was growing about 30% or more, and we're down to 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. That seems consistent with the slowdown that we're hearing from a lot of the mall retailers. Is that -- I mean, can we assume that you're all thinking that for temporary slowdown and that we will pick up even in this quarter?", "David E. Simon", "Well, the fact is that some of our percentage rents -- we've had certain tenants that have run into harder sales and then some that have picked the balance up, so it's all over the lot. But we'll see how it -- we'll see how the next couple of months pan out, David. It's very hard for us to give you a really specific answer to that question. We do have certain earnings tie -- risk tied to percentage rent. We gave -- we took that into account in raising our guidance. And -- but it's clear, and we're not denying this. It is clear that -- and it's not Simon Property Group, it is clear that the economy has slowed. You've seen it with wages, you've seen it with employment, needless to say, we don't have to get into what's going on in terms of leadership in our country. None of which we use as an excuse because we put blinders on, the best of our abilities, when it comes to that kind of stuff. But we're operating at a high level in a very slow growth economy. And we are outpacing the growth in the economy, and that's all that we can do. But we are affected by the economy. I mean, I wish I wasn't, but we are. And...", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "What period does this most remind you of in, say, the last 10 or 15 years, David?", "David E. Simon", "Good question. Good question. The fact is, I don't have an immediate -- usually I would just make something up, but I can't even come up with that at this point. But I would say a little bit like coming out of -- my initial reaction would be coming out of the -- when we were public, coming out of kind of the '97, that era where we're just kind of -- we weren't -- we hadn't ended, we'd survived and it was just grinding -- we were grinding about. And by the way, we we're grinding, I got double digits FFO increase, okay? So just keep that in perspective. But kind of like that, David, would be the initial off-the-cuff reaction.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Can I sneak in with a quick one for Steve?", "David E. Simon", "Sure. Sure.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, with the issuance of the Eurobond, it reminded me, are you embracing -- have you used any of these tax structures that have sort of coming under greater scrutiny like double Irish or even The Netherlands, Luxembourg to structure your offshore interest?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Not really, David. It's pretty plain vanilla. We record -- as an example, we record tax expense as it relates to the Kl\u00e9pierre earnings that we picked up our share of every quarter. So relatively plain vanilla structure.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. In fact, it's -- just to reinforce what Steve said, if you look at our -- we did -- as we made more international investments, we're having to pay taxes in those jurisdictions. And if you see in our P&L, we actually separated that out so that you can see that impact, because it's becoming less than trivial.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Right. Simon is not Apple.", "David E. Simon", "No, no. I wish I were. And I like its stock quote [ph]. But I don't want the pearl icon on me, but I do wish I were Apple.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Well, isn't he urging share buybacks and dividends, so you're kind of halfway there.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of John Kim with CLSA.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on international opportunities. Right now, international is about 8% of your NOI. What level do you feel comfortable just going to in the next few years? And then also geographically, where do you see the most compelling opportunity between Europe, Asia and South America?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we don't -- our only goal is to make smart investments, and investments that we can add value to. So the fact of the matter is, if the -- if our international business stays the same or goes up slightly, it doesn't -- that's not how we think. We're only looking to make smart investments where we can add value. And we have a higher threshold in international investments, because it's a lot of work and it's got to be -- there's no desire here just to do international for the sake of international. The desire here is to make international investments because, one, we think we can add value; and, two, is because we think at the end of the day, we're going to make money, and Kl\u00e9pierre is a perfect example of that. So I don't have, in my mind, it ought to go from X to Y. And each jurisdiction that we're in is different, but we are doing new development in Asia. We're not an acquirer of assets in Asia just because it's a tougher market. And we're sticking to the outlet business and markets that we're in where we can develop and it meets our threshold return requirements, which has been, certainly a real challenge in China, as an example. And that's why we did an investment in '08 and '09, we got out of it, and we haven't done anything since.", "John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "I was going to actually follow-up on -- if there had been any update on your view to China and Brazil?", "David E. Simon", "Well, China, I gave to you. Brazil, we continue to look at opportunities there in the outlet sector, a few sites that we're in, but nothing really imminent in the marketplace.", "Operator", "That concludes the question-and-answer part of today's call.", "David E. Simon", "Okay, thank you. I know you have a number of calls to go to, so thanks for your participation.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Simon Property Group's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our Investor Relations website, investor.simon.com.", "With that, we will start the call. And I would like to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thanks, Liz. Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up 2013, which also was our 20th year as a public company. First, let me talk about the quarter's strong performance. Given the growth in our core business, we continue to see a positive impact on our growth strategy, which basically is comprised of investing in our existing assets to expand and to meet the retailer demand, enhance productivity, continue to develop new outlets and make smart, thoughtful, accretive acquisitions.", "FFO was $2.47 per share, up 7.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus again by $0.05 per share. For our mall and Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 5.5% for the quarter, driven by basement rent increase; occupancy, up 80 basis points to 96.1%; and the continuation of positive sales from 2012. Our releasing spread continues to grow. It was a positive 16.8% or $8.94 per square foot, with much of the improvement driven by better leasing execution in the malls, while Premium Outlets spread continues to be robust. Mills comparable NOI was up 11% for the quarter, 10.8% for the year, driven by all the other factors I just went through.", "For the year, our FFO in total was $3.2 billion, an increase of $321 million from 2012. This resulted in a per share FFO growth of 10.9% to $8.85 per share. This was $0.46 above where the consensus started in early 2013 at $8.39. Our performance was driven by thoughtful capital allocation, and I'm proud of the execution of the team. We opened 5 new Premium Outlets this year, 3 in North America and 2 in Asia. We invested, in total, $942 million in new and redevelopment projects in response to retailer demand and customer needs. These projects are all off to very good starts, and we'll increase the productivity of our assets. We completed $1.05 billion of acquisitions, including the expansion of our European presence, with the investment in McArthurGlen's Designer Outlet assets and the management development company. We also, in January, acquired our joint venture partner's remaining interest in Kravco Simon, which is -- owns 10 assets. We now own 100% of King of Prussia mall, which is an iconic asset with a major expansion in the works. We strengthened and we also disposed the 49 core retail assets, as well as announced our spinoff transaction, which we'll talk about in a moment.", "We see strength across our portfolio and platforms. Occupancy continues to rise, which is a sign of retailer demand. The majority of our existing leases are under market. Ongoing NOI growth is supported by our ability to replace underperforming retailers. And as a final note on the operations, our operating profit margin grew by 60 basis points to 71.7% in 2013.", "In the quarter, the fourth quarter that is, we broke ground on Premium Outlets in Montr\u00e9al in early October and construction is underway. It's cold up there, but it's still -- we're still working. Construction also continues on new developments in Vancouver, Minneapolis and Charlotte. Less cold and our pipeline includes 6 additional new outlets expected to start construction in 2014, 2015.", "Redevelopment expansions are ongoing at 25 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico. We opened 2 in the fourth quarter, the shops at Nanuet, Walt Whitman in Long Island. Please go visit. Well executed, thank you for the team -- thank you to the team. Also, open expansion and number of other properties in the fourth quarter, including Orlando Premium Outlets at Vineland and Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia.", "Construction is ongoing to expand-enhance some of our most productive properties, which please do not lose sight of Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Houston Galleria, Lenox Square, Del Amo and Desert Hills just to name a few. Overall, our multi-year pipeline of new development and redevelopment expansion projects will continue to drive growth NOI and in the future. And our pipeline continues to -- we expect to invest approximately $1 billion annually through 2016.", "To give you a quick international update, Kl\u00e9pierre will report next week. But I'm proud of the fact that the company, with our help, has implemented a very thoughtful strategy. We've strengthened the balance sheet. We've improved operations and focused on cash flow growth. We have now signed and we were instrumental in the deal with Carrefour to sell smaller assets in order to focus on larger and more productive centers. We are exiting the office business. That will be completed shortly, including selling the headquarter building. We've strengthened the management with the hiring of Jean-Marc Jestin as COO. And we're focused on capital allocation among their different markets and continue to work on leasing and marketing opportunities.", "Together, the European retail recovery is stable and continuing. And then just to finally mention that we did close McArthurGlen. I was actually there at both places this week, a day with McArthurGlen, 2 days with Kl\u00e9pierre. The opportunities -- McArthurGlen are there. We've got development and expansion projects to consider and continue to be impressed with where Kl\u00e9pierre is headed.", "Now just to talk briefly about SpinCo. We have -- as you know, we won't go into much detail today about it, but we plan to spin off our strip center business in 44 smaller enclosed malls. We believe this will create additional value for Simon Property Group shareholders and be a good investment vehicle for SpinCo. We have yet to name the names. SpinCo is not the name, okay? SpinCo is not the name. And we're open to any ideas out there for any names. Please send them to us. We expect the transaction to be effective in the second quarter of 2014. We'll provide further updates as it's available, but everything is moving absolutely according to plan there.", "Fourth quarter capital market activity, we were busy. We closed or locked rates on 10 new secured loans, totaling approximately $2.2 billion. Our share of that is roughly $1 billion. Including in the fourth quarter activity is the $1.2 billion refinance at Aventura Mall at a rate of 2.75.", "In January, as you know, we announced and closed a bid offering of $1.2 billion of senior notes with a combined weighted average duration of 7.5 years and an average coupon rate of just under 3%. Demand was very robust for these bonds. We're using the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay debt, including the unencumbering of $820 million mortgage on Sawgrass Mills.", "Dividend, we increased the dividend again in the first quarter, $1 to $1.25. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.7%. SPG, which not including SpinCo, will now pay, as you know, at least $5 in 2014. Now I would just take a moment to talk about something and I'll turn to '14. I'd like to make an announcement regarding our management team. Steve Sterrett, our long-term CFO, will be retiring in March of 2015. So he will be staying on board through another full fiscal year in our process. It's hard to overstate the contributions that Steve has made to our company. And I know I speak for everyone when I say we will be sorry to see him go. As many of you know, Steve has been with the company for 20 years during the period of extraordinary growth. Throughout it all, Steve's contributions have been immeasurable. We will conduct a search during the next few months for Steve's replacement. Expect to consider both internal and external candidates. And having Steve available for the rest of 2014 in the audit cycle will helpful and ensure a smooth transition. And he will still not be able to beat me on a consistent basis in golf.", "Now let me just talk about 2014. I'm sure he'll have a response to that, by the way, but let's talk about 2014. Guidance is in a range of $9.50 to $9.60. This represents at the midpoint growth rate of 8%. This is based on comparable NOI growth of at least 4% for a combined mall and outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is on a comparable basis for 2013 and ignores any potential impact of SpinCo. When SpinCo is effective, we'll provide updated and adjust the range for SPG, as well as provide a range for SpinCo.", "And now let me conclude. We had a great year, a great fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize the creation of the value for our properties, our retailers and our shareholders. We believe we have very great prospects for 2014. And we're now ready for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm here with Jeremy Metz. Can you break out the terms for the Kravco purchase, as well as for Oyster Bay and Arizona Mills, how you broke out the consideration for those?", "David E. Simon", "Well the Kravco purchase was a -- basically, we had to put in a call at a combined cap rate of...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "A little bit over 8%.", "David E. Simon", "A little over 8%.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "And as well as 113%.", "David E. Simon", "113%. And we -- what was your next question?", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On Oyster Bay and Arizona Mills, how did the consideration break out between those assets?", "David E. Simon", "Well that was a private negotiation, and we will not be going through that.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, when can we expect an update on SpinCo management? Can you talk a little bit about that?", "David E. Simon", "We got initial comments from the SEC, so we're in that process. We are -- have identified both an internal and external candidate that we're having serious discussions with. And now we would hope to conclude that over the next few weeks. And as soon as we do, I'm sure it will be part of our filing. The board's pretty much set, and it's going according to plan.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The portfolio continues to perform very well, but there's clearly a lot of questions swirling around shopper traffic, shopper habits, et cetera. Could you maybe comment on what you're seeing? Are we seeing a sea change in retail as characterized by Starbucks last week? And what do you think this impact could have on your business over the next few years?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we've been doing this for quite some time. And I think we have to put the fourth quarter sales into perspective. First of all, and these are just some thoughts off the top of my head, we are absolutely believers that our business will continue to grow. But let me just talk about the fourth quarter because I do think we were at the point of a little bit of overreaction. Clearly, in '13, there was a move toward global goods, which happens in certain cycles. And as the second half of the year came about, I do think the consumer was relatively cautious. We had a short season. There was, obviously, lots of weather issues for certain parts of the country. And I don't think what's put in perspective, which I listened to the pundits on TV and elsewhere, not just on TV but elsewhere, but between the confusion of ObamaCare and taxes did raise pretty materially for the consumer, you have what I'll call a -- I don't know if it was a perfect storm, but you have a lot of this stuff all come together or that basically resulted in the consumer being very cautious. The pundits, I've heard this stuff about malls in the Internet, obviously, having the right retailers, the right customer service, the right look and feel of the properties will continue to hold our own in that space without question.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you're not seeing anything at the ground level that indicates shopper traffic is roughly 50% over the last 3 years or anything like that?", "David E. Simon", "50%?", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Well, that's what ShopperTrak says.", "David E. Simon", "Well, let me talk about -- I'm not going to name names. But we don't use them, and we don't know how reliable a lot of those traffic numbers are. And we'll leave it at that. The answer is, all I can tell you, Nate, is look at our results. That's all I can tell you is look at our results. I think you know at this point, doing this for 20 years and continuing to beat everybody's expectations about the profitability of what this company can't produce, I would suggest to you that things are not what others say they are. And I'll leave it at that.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I mean, in the -- over the last few years, you have discussed various initiatives of helping and embracing online and developing something at the Simon level. Any update on that?", "David E. Simon", "Well it would take 30 minutes on this call, but we're happy to go through that in great detail. We have a significant amount of initiatives that we're embarking upon to improve the consumer experience, whether pre-mall or during mall visit. And we are absolutely embracing technology and how it can -- how it could be used effectively to make the consumer more satisfied during their visit or as they come to the mall. The retailers feel the absolute same way. And there's probably 20-plus things that are ongoing in this company, individually, collectively with the mall industry, as well as in conjunction with the retailers that we're working on. But it's -- there are so many that I can't do it at this call, but we're happy to share those as they get rolled out.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Josh Patinkin of BMO Capital Markets.", "Josh Patinkin", "I'm trying to get a better sense of what the opportunity to consolidate McArthurGlen managed funds look like. So it's obviously not programmatic, but can you give us a general sense for the total size of the enterprise and what could come up in the next few years?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, they're a leader in that industry. I think we'll have opportunities to grow that business through new development and extensions of existing assets, as well as acquisitions of assets that either they manage and own a small piece of and/or others that do. But it's really -- I'm not in the position to give you a specific number. But as you know, we've taken our platforms over the years and run them significantly. It reminds me of the outlet business when we entered into it in 2004. We have roughly grown. We have -- if I could put the numbers correctly, we have increased the cash flow of that business roughly 4x. And needless to say, you take the 4x plus the reduction in cap rate, and you'd see the value created there. I think it's harder to develop in Asia, but a great team, good people and we'll just take it a step at a time.", "Josh Patinkin", "Okay. And then more globally on outlets, you built a lot of centers last decade. And so is there a big sea change in the leasing conversation as you approach tenure rollovers? And do you think higher occupancy cost will become more acceptable to merchants in that business?", "David E. Simon", "I'll turn it to Rick to [indiscernible].", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Absolutely, we are seeing an ability to increase our rents. We have significant demand in the outlet sector. If you listen to the retailers, there are many retailers that are entering the sector for the first time as an additional prong and bare growth strategy. And where you have a lot of demand you're able to drive rates, our properties are very productive. We're making them better. And that does give us pricing power.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So I wanted to go back to Nate's question and ask it a little in a different way, more from a leasing perspective. As we sort of hear more from retailers about the integration of their bricks-and-mortar business with their e-commerce business, so I'm thinking about the longer-term omni-channel initiatives. I'm wondering if you could give us some perspective on how the changes are impacting sort of the leasing cost and how you would expect it to evolve over time? So first, how the retailers are thinking about occupancy costs. You addressed it a little bit in terms of the outlet, but I'm thinking about the [indiscernible] either -- just thinking about the sales within the 4 walls of the store versus sort of the value of that locations, the overall.", "David E. Simon", "I think the good news for us, as mall owners, is I expect them to drive traffic and distribute through their store. So what it means, I believe, over time is that, that store location will become more valuable because instead of building a bunch of distribution centers or trying to figure out how to get various online purchases to the consumer, the most effective and perhaps cost-effective way for them to do it is by using their existing store. Now that means that they're going to have to have a better handle on store and create algorithms in terms of what can be distributed out to the store or not. But I think what it's going to ultimately mean is that they're going to drive purchase -- drive sales through those stores, which, as far as we're concerned and what's in our leases and we'll continue to be, is those sales will be generated from that store. So I don't -- now if they have the store that's losing money, they're not going to keep it open, but that's been that way for 30 years, 40 years. So -- but that's what I anticipate.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "The only other thing I would add and I think it's a very significant advantage to our retailers and in David and my discussions with them, they are very focused on it. It's the ability to fulfill their orders online out of their stores and reorient it to whatever store has the appropriate inventory, that's going to have, in their opinion, significant margin enhancement possibility because they won't be able to have less markdowns by selling at full price goods that might otherwise have to be discounted in various locations. And they're all spending a great deal of time getting that backbone in place to effectuate that.", "David E. Simon", "The one thing that people have questioned is whether they're going turn these stores into showrooms. And the fact of the matter is, I talked to a very prominent retailer CEO about this issue. They lose sales when they do that, okay? So -- especially when it becomes apparel. So I don't believe that if they want -- if this retailer continues to have an enviable bricks-and-mortar strategy that they are going to get in a point where it's a showroom because people want to -- continue to want to make sure that the size looks right on all that other stuff, okay?", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So as it becomes more of a supply-demand of that location issue versus an occupancy cost when negotiating the rent, and how do you attribute as they further integrate their business with e-commerce, how do you attribute the specific sales of that store when reporting up to you?", "David E. Simon", "It's easy. They'd have to keep track of it. That's simple, if it goes through their POS, and it's going to have to if the stores \u2013- that the inventories in the store. That's a simple exercise. We have audit -- yes, we have audit rights, okay?", "Unknown Analyst", "David, I have one quick question just in terms of -- and I recognize the deal with the problems[ph] are it's a private transaction. So there certainly was a time where they didn't want to take your stock pretty forcefully. So I'm just curious how that transaction came about and what your plans are now that you're on those parcels of land in terms of the timing of potentially doing something on that site?", "David E. Simon", "Look, we -- even though we obviously have had issues over the years with Taubman, we've always had what I call a good professional relationship, certainly, as the dust is settled from several years ago. So again, I can't really comment on that other than -- let me talk about the property. We're very excited about it. We are very interested in working with the town of Oyster Bay and our partner, Castagna Realty. We're going to work with the residents, come up with a development plan. Also, at the property that we own with Castagna Realty, together, we think there is an absolute way to create a win-win for the community and for us and our partner. And it's great real estate. So how we got there is really not important. I'm convinced that's in the best interest of our shareholders, and I'm convinced that Taubman feels the same way. So that actually can happen where you can have a win-win for both companies.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just two questions here. The first is the other big story, apart from the Internet this past season, was the Penney closure. And if you look at the 33 stores they closed, you could say, okay, they went through the whole thing and they could only find 33 stores. And Sears, for the all the years they've talking of rationalizing, the Sears are still open. So should we read this as the various department stores have done these big reviews and these are all the stores that they've closed or your sense is this the start of a wave and over the next several years we're going to see a lot more of these big-type announcements?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, I think it's a function of what the retailer ultimately is able to do. But the store closures for us is a kind of a normal standard operating procedure that we deal with. We've had retailers clearly -- not necessarily the scale of a couple of that you mentioned -- but we've had retailers coming out of business for years. And so, again, yes, it does add to the workload but we find a way to get the job done. And I think you're right though, Alex, is that they went through the portfolio, generally. And what we understand, which I'm not sure is for us to say, but we understand that, that was the list that was actually generating negative cash flow. So I think you're right in the sense of that a number of these retailers continue to have profitability and even in stores that are not as overly productive because for whatever reason. So, as an example, and I don't know maybe we'll have this, but people talked about small malls, B-malls, the Internet. But our comp, in the fourth quarter of our comp, NOI increased for the SpinCo malls was 4%. So that speaks to the ability to continue to move the needle forward despite all the noise. Now, look, the fourth quarter sales, I gave you that. I do think a lot happen all on the fourth quarter. But the consumer, between the uncertainty of ObamaCare, the increase in taxes, wage growth continues to be anemic, they spend on durable goods, they slowed down in the third and fourth quarter across-the-board. I mean, whether it was the high-end, the middle-end or the lower-end consumer. And that happens. Don't panic. We'll deal with that. So, at the end of today, I can't speak for the future of those two that you mentioned, in terms of store closing, but what we understand is that that's the analysis that led to the 33. But I'm not 100% certain on that, okay?", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question is regarding SpinCo. I mean Simon is going to be the platform for the initial, I believe, 2 years. Is Simon Brand Ventures, the income that's generated from that, is that something that SpinCo will have access to beyond that or is the understanding that SpinCo is going to sort of have to try and replicate that NOI stream after the -- if, in fact, it ends the relationship with Simon as the supporting mall platform?", "David E. Simon", "Well, all of those revenues are at the property level. So they'll continue. Now, ultimately, if they -- remember, just to give you SpinCo, the strip center business will be in SpinCo. SPG will do some back office activity for the strip center business. SPG will act as third-party property manager for SpinCo malls. And all of that revenue that, that group generates goes to the property. So, ultimately, will be the decision for that team to decide whether or not they want to continue after the 2-year period, to continue to use SPG as a property manager. But there's no reason in my mind that they couldn't, if they chose not to do that -- that will be up to the team and the Board there -- that they could replicate the vast majority of that income.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "David, maybe I think you should name SpinCo SteRRETT in honor of Steve's service to you.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "That rolls right off the tongue.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It does, it does. Actually, did I hear you...", "David E. Simon", "Honestly, I probably shouldn't say this publicly. But I'll go ahead, sometimes I get into that box. But the hardest thing about SpinCo is coming up with the appropriate name.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Right. Yes, so if you have any suggestions please send them our way.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I don't have any good ones. But, actually, did I hear you correctly? That you said NOI growth at SpinCo was 4% in Q4? And maybe are you be able to share other operating metrics of leasing spreads and occupancy as well?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, that'll be in the final filing. But the fourth quarter -- we thought you might ask that so we had that number for the fourth quarter. But that kind of stuff will all be in the filing.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And I guess maybe doubling on Alex's question about the Penney's and Sears closures risk. When you look at those two situations, I mean, I think people had kind of ultimately handicapped or call it ultimate exposure. Do you guys have the sense of what percentage of those stores that you have, might not be cost-effectively retenantive?", "David E. Simon", "I didn't catch the last part.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "What percentage of the stores we think may not be cost-effectively retenantive if they close. I would tell you that we're spending a considerable amount of time. And as we've said before on these calls, we have our plans in place, we have identified replacement tenants. For example, we have one tenant already lined up to occupy one of the Penney closures, yet this year, at a positive economic impact on that property and a positive sales impact. So we are as prepared as one can be to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves through the activities of the department stores when they decide they don't want to do it. Over the years we've dealt with over 80 of these things. So, as David said, this is not new to us. We'll just keep doing what we've been doing at historically.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And maybe I can stick with you Rick, on -- sort of following up on Christie's earlier question. Just, historically, retailers kind of wanted the landlord to stay out of their way, as it relates to retail sales. Are you seeing retailers become more receptive to working with their landlord around their e-commerce and retail sales platform? I mean is that part of the leasing discussion or even specifically addressed in the lease or that's sort of a separate conversation, sort of an add-on, if you will?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Well, two parts to that. In our lease negotiations, we're incredibly mindful of the role that our stores play in the distribution of their goods, whether online or store-based. And, frankly, if that store is any part of the distribution channel for that sale, it's going to count in our sales. The retailers understand that, and the retailers are emphasizing the convenience and location of their stores as a significant advantage in their ability to maximize their contacts with the customers and their sales. So they very much view their stores as an integral part of their business going forward and they are working with us in a cooperative way to try and maximize.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I will just say, Jeff, simply, that we have both mobile and desktop, et cetera. We have a system called Retailer Showcase that basically presents offers from the retailers to our consumers. They can get it in mall, they can go on our website or whatever. We do that. I think the last number that I saw, probably 50,000 offers over the year that we present to our consumers. We get those offer -- we don't make them up, we get them from that retailers. So, absolutely, there is a significant amount of coordination, as you would expect, between us and the retailer, to improve and enhance their business. I believe we're just at the scratching of that surface. That is part of our job, to facilitate more productivity for the retailers of stores, and at the same time, trying to do that and increase rent. I mean, it's not the easiest thing. But they know that we want them to be very productive. We work hand-in-hand with them. And I think technology, generally, will be a wonderful opportunity to make that relationship easier to execute.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just one last question. I'm curious, internally, when you guys are handicapping -- I'll call it exposure to anchor closures -- what are the metrics that you guys look at internally? Is it four-wall profit, is it sort of store format or market size or approximated to their distribution centers? I mean is there, I guess, a better methodology than maybe just sort of overall sales productivity that you find in forecasting?", "David E. Simon", "Well, sure, because you don't know how many -- how they cover -- historically, the department stores advertised in a market. They allocate that advertising a certain way. So you've got to have a handle on that. But again, on a specific store, we're going to have a sense as to where that is, based upon lots of discussions over the last few years. Corporately, and where they're headed, we have some insights but it's no different than people that has follow them and covered them. I mean, we're not necessarily privy to all that's going on in what they're doing. I mean we have, obviously, good relationships with our major anchors. But we're not privy to anything that's probably not common knowledge. But we have the several years and years of dealing with them, how they feel about certain stores.", "Operator", "And your next question will comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, David and Rick. As you kind of look at the rent spreads, those dramatically improved over the course of 2013. And as you look at the rollover for the next, really 3 years, your ending base rents are just a shade under $40. And when you add in the CAM, you're probably close to that $53. So, it would seem that you're releasing spreads ought to continue to accelerate. Is there anything that would, outside of a sales decline, which it doesn't seem to be happening, is there anything that suggest that leasing spreads wouldn't continue to tick higher from here?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We certainly anticipate that we'll be able to continue to grow our rents as we have historically. The other thing I would tell you is that we're spending a lot of money making these properties better. And so, when you look at a very gross sales number, that's made up of a whole lot of individual stores. And as we renovate our properties, bring in better tenant, our tenants, we believe, are more productive in our properties, and that gives us some incremental ability to drive rent. So we don't envision that slowing down.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and maybe sticking with you, Rick. Just kind of on the tenants and how you're thinking about repositioning the properties. I don't know if you have a specific number. But as you look at the mix of tenants in the mall today, what percentage is apparel and what percentage do you think that'll be 3 years from now?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "At this point, I think our apparel percentage is going to remain fairly stable. Now, the tenants that make up that apparel percentage could change dramatically. We have some tenants that are reducing the size of their stores, and we have entrants coming in like Czar, H&M, UNIQLO, that are in slightly bigger formats. But there's not going to be a sense of a significant decline in the amount of space allocated to apparel. We are allocating space differently. Look, last year, we opened 36 restaurants across the portfolio. That's a major focus, to be able to extend their stay in our property, give the consumers a wider range of dining alternatives and just make the properties more experiential, which is obviously a focus of our retailers and us. So, the mix may change, but I think apparel is going to stay fairly stable, while the components may change.", "David E. Simon", "I probably shouldn't say this, but it's interesting, as I travel the world and understand -- probably not as much as I should do -- but the occupancy cost that we have in the U.S. is relatively benign compared to when you see it elsewhere in the world. So it's an interesting thing for us, to pause to think about what the opportunities to continue to grow that rent are. But we've got to be absolutely sensitive to the retailer and making sure they profit in their environment as well. So, our occupancy cost, generally, in comparison to kind of where the other shopping centers, owners have in the world, they're relatively below at least what those would indicate the rents are. So we'll see how that evolves over time.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And they have been relatively stable for the last 3 years even though we've been able to drive our rents.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Well, let me ask, I guess, one last question for maybe the newest member of the senior stores, Steve. Hopefully, you'll get your qualifying card here and get something new going. I went to the balance sheet and kind of debt refinancing. So, obviously it's been very favorable. Just how are you thinking about kind of the balance of debt maturing this year and into '15, and kind of what's your thought in terms of kind laddering and kind of where you want to be on the debt curve?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Well, it's Steve, it's pretty well laddered already. As you know, as part of the SpinCo announcement, we did state that we expect to raise $1 billion of debt through SpinCo, with those proceeds coming to Simon before the effective date. So if you couple that with our bond yield in January, that's the majority of our capital raise, in terms of dealing with bond expirations. We also unencumbered Sawgrass Mills as part of the use of those proceeds. So, we're in really good shape for '14. We've accomplished most of the capital plan. And in '15, we're ordinary course of business, we have bonds coming due every year. You should expect us to be a regular issuer in that market. But obviously the secured debt market is also important to us as well, so you'll see us in both.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Steve, thanks for all your help over the years. Given just some of the clouds around fourth quarter consumer activity in the malls. I know you guys don't typically do this, but would you be able to provide a pure fourth quarter 2013 over fourth quarter 2012 tenant sales trend?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. It was flat.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And just a follow-up. I know you've mentioned the SpinCo same-store NOI, but from a tenant sales perspective, how does that look like when you split out the outlets, A malls and B malls? It doesn't have to be the fourth quarter, but maybe the year-over-year, the total trailing 12 months.", "David E. Simon", "I'm sorry, I didn't really understand the question, Ki Bin.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the trend in your tenant sales of 2.5% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, how does that look like, like if you had to stratify it between outlets, A malls and B malls?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, we shared some of that with you when we announced SpinCo. That gives you a general direction for that answer. And as you'll see, once SpinCo is done and effective, you'll have the SpinCo data and you'll have the SPG data. So that'll all be there. That gives you a sense of direction where it is.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and just last point. Should we expect negative sales at all for SpinCo in the fourth quarter?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. I mean, we gave you that at -- whenever it was. December, we showed you that.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Several years of history.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. I can't can remember the exact number. But it's right there, it's public document. I assume it's on our Investor website. It's all there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just want to go back to the retail side here for a second. A lot of talk about the sales trends, but obviously profitability is very important. And just given the number of pre-announcements that we've heard this season, I'm just curious if you think we should be expecting a higher level of seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter here than we've seen over maybe the last few years, where perhaps the plans were a little bit more conservative.", "David E. Simon", "We don't see that at this moment. Things change over the year. But we don't see that necessarily. Obviously we have a good handle on that. The only thing we don't have a handle that could change that is bankruptcies. But based upon our existing status of where we are with our discussion with retailers, we don't see that. Obviously, a bankruptcy here or there may be able to impact that on a faster basis.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And going back to the discussion around e-commerce. We hear a lot about Macy's and Nordstrom and companies like that, that are very forward thinking about their strategies. I'm just wondering how you think the smaller retailers that maybe don't have the same scale or infrastructure can evolve in a new environment, to be able to kind of compete with the e-commerce.", "David E. Simon", "Well, the fact of the matter, and you can see it in technology companies' results, is that it is relatively a lot less expensive to create because of the cloud and the way apps work and so on. It's relatively less expensive to create the combination, become more technology-oriented than it has in the past. Lots of ability to share services in the cloud that you wouldn't otherwise have to invest in. So I think maybe the mom and pop has a harder time. But generally, any retailer that has a kind of a reasonable store base can compete very affectively because the cost of technology is -- you don't need routers, you don't need servers, you don't need a bunch of software guys cranking this stuff out like you used to. The fact is, if we had done MerchantWired today, with different technology, we'd probably be successful. But we overpaid for the hardware. So, I think, as long as they have a reasonable store base, we're going to be able to create the appropriate coordination between their bricks and mortar stores and how they want to deal with online shopping.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And frankly there is no retailer that we meet with that is not very focused on doing precisely that. Some of them are further along in their implementation of those strategies, but every one of them is focused on more affectively integrating their online with their stores.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Just another set of questions. Have you seen retailers expand their footprint in order to better distribute goods than they would be selling online. I'm thinking about, of course, the footprint in the malls.", "David E. Simon", "It's a good point. What I have seen them do is think about their stores as a point of distribution along as a store. So whether they're now looking at stores just for the sake of having the store and a distribution, I wouldn't' say that thinking is there yet. But clearly, existing stores are being thought as a way to distribute and kind of the e-commerce platform. So I do think that thinking -- and that's a different level for many different retailers, but I actually do think they're thinking about it very seriously.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So how many such distribution centers, if you will, would a retailer need in a large metro-area?", "David E. Simon", "Okay, I'm not in a position to say that. But it depends on the retailer.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And the funny thing is they're not talking about using drones to ship their goods.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I'm sure that's going to be an interesting transition. Just getting back on the disposition of 14 non-core assets. Can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of which property tied and cap rates?", "David E. Simon", "I don't have it in front of me. But a few smaller shopping centers, a couple of outlets. So we'll continue to do that as well.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Were any of those considered to be spun out into SpinCo?", "David E. Simon", "The answer is none of those were in the SpinCo because we already had contracts. There is a couple of strip centers that may or may not be sold before SpinCo is done. So, if that's the case, we're going to -- ultimately, the portfolio, as we said to you in December, when we announced it, will change a little bit. Part of that will be because of a couple of fails here and there, and a couple of them will be because we may or may not get a consent. But that could still happen.", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a final question on the relationship with anchors. So, a couple of weeks ago I think Sears announced that they would be leasing space to Dick sporting goods, King of Prussia. It's obviously, by far, the best mall in the Philly area. When you think about your ability to recapture stores from Sears, and Penney in particular, versus the decision that they may ultimately make to lease to what is effectively a power center tenant into what is, by far the best mall, and particularly in the metro. How are thinking about what is the right price for you to pay to recapture that box? And what can you do to influence their decision on the retailer that will come into their center or into their box?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I mean, the simple answer is it depends. Each case is different, to be honest with you. So in that case, we cooperated with Sears. Given the location of that store and what our plans were on the future redevelopment, we thought it was a win-win for us. We're happy to have Dick's in there, and it was a good transaction for Sears. In some cases, because of location of stores, we may want to do the development on ourselves -- by ourselves. In some cases, we'll let them do it. And if -- in fact, we may -- in most cases, we have approval rights, so each case is very different. Believe me, we have understanding of each one to a great level. But in that case, we just saw it as a way to be cooperative with Sears, way to help them all, great for the consumer, and as you know, we think Dick's is great. We do a lot of business with them. So in that case, we said, \"Perfect, let's go. We'll help you, we'll cooperate.\"", "Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So you didn't try to acquire the box back from Sears?", "David E. Simon", "No, we did not, and Sears will continue to operate there as well. So it's -- Dick's is taking the upper level, and Sears is going to actually, we understand, kind of create the store, the future, so to speak, in the lower level, so that's great. And we'll continue to work with anchors like that as well. There's lots of little tactical things that are going on with all of our anchors about getting rights to put restaurants in. On some of the frontage of the -- just to bring up an example, in Briarwood, we're putting a couple of restaurants, and we do that all the time, like in front of Macy's. And so all of that stuff is out there to do. In some cases, we facilitate them if they want to do a lease. So the simple goal is, \"Let's make the property better for the consumer,\" and it will take all sorts of different forms. We wouldn't rule out partnering with somebody on a redevelopment of their box if that circumstance made sense for both parties.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I guess, going to the Mills for a second, I was wondering, can you give us a little more color on the 11% comp NOI growth? And was it a handful of assets? Was it broad-based? I mean, what was really driving those numbers?", "David E. Simon", "Look, they have a -- they're major markets at 16 assets. As you know, the focus on value for them, value-oriented retailers, has been tremendously successful. You've got the outlets at Orange, that conversion from more of an entertainment center to an outlet center has been terrific. Ontario is on fire. Sawgrass, needless to say, is -- continues to be behemoth. Potomac Mills, we brought a couple of restaurants in Opry that's not in the comps.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "It's not in the comp, yes.", "David E. Simon", "Opry has been fantastic.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "You know the run hole.", "David E. Simon", "You can see it on the run hole. So lots of things go there, just a lot of things happening here to make the portfolio -- by the way, we added Macy's at Gurnee Mills as an example, so...", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "But Mike, this is Steve. It is rent. It's really saying it's higher occupancy, it's growing rents.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm sorry. So it sounds like if we're thinking about '14, '15, you're probably still getting above average growth out of that part of the portfolio?", "David E. Simon", "I think it will be good. I'm not going to do 10% -- where not going to do is 10.8% for the year. So don't put that in your numbers.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Steve, also let me add my congratulations. It looks like really you have one year left sort of to finally go shoe shopping before you lose your steady paycheck.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Tayo, if I'm going to go shoe shopping, I'm going to go with you. That's for sure.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Sounds good. Two quick questions. First of all, just to get around commentary, a lot of retailers are saying Christmas was weak. I know David made a couple of comments about what could change your initial outlook for 2014, would be on a potential for more bankruptcies or things of that nature. But I just -- and then for everything you're seen right now, are you seeing kind of on the fringe tenants talking like that about potentially closing shops or things like that just based off the tough holiday season?", "David E. Simon", "Not really. This is always the general time where you may see a few of these pop-up. But no one -- in fact, there's a few that have been in the edge for a number of years and actually turn their business around even last year. Look, I think the consumer -- I read something yesterday on the plane back from Europe that consumer is still under a pretty decent amount of pressure. Higher taxes, more regulation, uncertainty of ObamaCare, spending on durable goods a little bit in the first half the year, higher rates potentially, I would think, and they took it easy in the third and fourth quarter, as you've seen across the board. So we are still in a tepid recovery. The fascinating thing I read, last year, forget the federal government, in the state and local governments, there were 40,000 new rules and regulations in the state -- in the United States of the America. So that is going to slow the growth of America, 40,000 new regulations throughout this country at a state and local level. That's going to slow us down. So we have a tepid recovery, even though some of the broad-based numbers look better. The fact is it's still a very cautious environment. But we're producing terrific results in that environment. And that's the facts. We produced great results in the Great Recession. We had cash flow that was flat. So despite all of that, that noise out there, we can only do what we're capable of doing. We can't control the outcome of an anchor business plan or not. We can just be ready to go to work if, in fact, these things are thrown in our way.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then the second thing is we also heard about Matt Lentz had also kind of left the company. Just wondering if that role was -- there's going to be a replacement for him or if there's going to be any changes around the CIO position.", "David E. Simon", "The answer is we brought someone in to -- help the internationally. We're -- Matt was helping Stanley Shashoua who has been terrific. Stanley is great, speaks 5 languages, maybe 6, unlike the team here who can actually speak English, but he's great and he's helping me. And in the sense, he really took Matt's role on our International business.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Could you talk -- a little bit more about just Stanley's overall background and what he's kind of done in the past?", "David E. Simon", "He worked for both real estate and investment banking companies. So he's been -- he's a young guy compared to me probably, but he's been -- he's got great experience. And he was instrumental with the McArthurGlen deal. I had to put him on that deal because of the complexity, and he really helped us get there with another kind of great guy here who actually came from the Mills, but moved to Minneapolis when did that deal. Brian McDade -- the 2 of them, grabbed that -- along with our General Counsel, grabbed that deal and took it to the finish line. And so the good thing about the -- we have kind of the what I call younger folks that are really taking a lot more responsibility in the organization and doing a great job.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A couple of questions on SpinCo. So several of the SpinCo properties are encumbered with CMBS debt that has near-term maturities, West Ridge Mall in Topeka, Chesapeake Square in Chesapeake, Virginia, and...", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Those are all being refinanced.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "As we speak.", "David E. Simon", "As we speak.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay.", "David E. Simon", "So that is your question?", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Well, I was getting to it, right? So there's 4 or 5 of that list with near-term debt maturities. So should we assume that all 5 are in that list of being refinanced or the candidates for dispositions?", "David E. Simon", "No, they're all going to be refinanced absent -- one may not be -- one is further out there. I don't know, I don't -- yes, but they'll be refinanced.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And you've quietly gone about proving your U.S. portfolio in recent years. I'm just trying to get a sense how to process slows down post SpinCo. How do you think about your U.S. portfolio or disposition strategy after the spinoff of SpinCo?", "David E. Simon", "Well, for SPG, we'll continue to call properties like we have for year-after-year. SpinCo, I think, again, I'm not going to be in charge there. But I think I would expect SpinCo to sell a couple assets here and there. And I think it's -- that's business as usual. I mean, we'll always continue to sell assets at both companies. I can't necessarily -- as a Director, I'll have certainly my point of view on capital allocation and reallocation. But I would expect both companies to continue to sell assets like we have in the past.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering -- I guess, there's been enough questions about some seasonal trends here, with normally season closings in the first quarter. I guess, in the other side of that, at over 96% occupancy here, you're likely to have some sort of backlog in terms of retailers wanting to get in. I just wonder if you can comment a bit in terms of conversations with retailers looking ahead in terms of Del Amo as that opens up next year and just others, just how you think about that in terms of demand, just in terms of -- just if there are to be any vacancies in terms of sort of backfilling or -- adding there.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We still have very strong demand. And in fact, the response to Del Amo has been terrific. We are going to be able to move that up significantly in price point and with the quality retailers. And retailers still want to expand. Retailers still want to have great real estate that will help their brand and we're seeing no real slowdown in that conversation. And in fact, and we've said this in other calls, a great amount of the time that David and I spend are basically dealing with retailers that we cannot accommodate in the size they want or in the space they want at our property. So demand remains high.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Dan, this is Steve. I'll just add one point. We tend not to get into the 27 different variables that go into our forecast for the year, but I will say that our plan in 2014 is that occupancy year-over-year will be up at the end of '14.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "David, you've talked in the past about the disconnect between sales and NOI that for one, you can replace the underperforming tenants. So I was just hoping -- I mean, Steve made the comment about occupancy being up in '14. Would you guys consider at all just disclosing what the same-store NOI growth is as implied in your '14 guidance because it just seems like that could help alleviate some of the concerns surrounding core growth in light of volume sales, pressured customer?", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Let me interrupt you there. We did, actually.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Oh, did you?", "David E. Simon", "I must have bored you by the time I got to that. Our -- that's quite all right. I understand that our opening comments may, in fact, bore some. We are projecting, for '14, to have comp NOI up 4% or above. So I -- if that answers your question -- 4%.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Sorry I missed that, and...", "David E. Simon", "That's all right. I am not offended in any stretch of imagination.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Maybe I missed this one also. Did you disclose the cap rate for the Arizona Mills transaction?", "David E. Simon", "We -- in fact, we said we would not, and we did do -- we did say that earlier. That's okay.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And maybe a final question, maybe going back to Cedrik's comments on Sears. Do you think that the anchor subleasing dynamic will accelerate in the coming year? Is that also -- is this a model that only works at the A malls, or do you think we could see this type of activity ramp up at the B malls?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "I think that there is going to be a concerted effort by Sears. They've done it historically over the last few years, and they're continuing to be focused on it to try and get their stores to where they are most efficient. That doesn't -- and I think that is frankly not specifically limited to any particular quality spectrum of their stores. And as David said, where we think it's in our best interest, we'll cooperate. If we think it is not in our best interest or the malls' best interest or the consumers' best interest, we'll try and influence a different direction on Sears' part. But I don't think their efforts are being focused on any particular quality type.", "Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And are you in current negotiations to do this in any other of your malls with Sears or maybe even at Penney's currently?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "We're having a constant dialogue with both companies about all the real estate. And frankly, as David said earlier, we hopefully -- that provides a lot of insights into what they're thinking strategically with respect to the stores, and we're trying to work with them to come up with positive outcomes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just given Steve's retirement date, I'm wondering if that's a good indicator -- when do you think the debt markets are going to get tougher?", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "I don't know. I see the tenure coming back down. So Craig, I will say that the debt markets are in really good shape right now for us. Now I always caution that by -- I think about the little commercials. Your results may not be the same, but for us, the bond market is wide open, the mortgage market is very good, the bank market is wide open. So -- and having already put away now quite a bit of our 2014 maturities, we can start to tackle the '15 stuff and feel good about the opportunity to continue to roll down our weighted average borrowing cost while increasing our duration. I think it is interesting in a debt portfolio that's $28 billion, $29 billion. We've lowered our borrowing costs 23 basis points in each of the last 2 years, and that's a pretty meaningful contribution to profitability.", "David E. Simon", "With no reliance on closures, yes.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, it was almost no floating rate [ph] here to date.", "David E. Simon", "I mean, that's the important part. I mean, we -- if we want to reduce our earnings growth, we would have 20%, 30% of floating rate debt. We basically have virtually 0.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I guess, one other thought on the cost of occupancy, I know that's been touched on. But 11.5% still seems low, even when it -- considering it's Premium Outlets combined with malls. Where do you think -- and I realize it's a moving target, but where do you think that could normalize out your cost of occupancy? Or do you think it's going to remain sort of in the mid-11s?", "David E. Simon", "Well, this is the $64,000 question. Like I said earlier, I mean, it is interesting to me that occupancy costs outside of the U.S. are much, much higher and -- so answer is I don't know other than it does give us some very good feeling that we still have a way to continue to grow our NOI, because essentially, the biggest opportunity we have is to -- marketing our leases to market and being able to replace underperforming retailers with better ones. Besides the -- obviously, and I know, Craig, you've been out seeing a bunch of properties, and I appreciate that, that you have because you get a good sense of what's going on here, which I do think, because of the size of the company, sometimes people lose focus. But all that's going on -- but that's going to drive our business. That -- but I can't put a number on it and -- but -- and we're here to create the right partnership with our retailers because we believe in repeat business with them. But this is confidence that we still have the ability to execute even with a tepid consumer comp NOI growth.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes. I would just say, in the properties I visited, I've been very impressed, and you sort of forget sometimes that there really is a skill to managing these assets. And some of the things I've seen in the last couple of weeks have been very impressive.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. Look, I mean, you -- I know you went to Del Amo, right? And I'm sure you didn't really believe we were redoing Del Amo. I know you've been asking about this for -- I'm sure you asked the Mills pre-acquisition for years. And then I know, once we bought the Mills, it took us a few years and one Great Recession to overcome, but it's going to be a great, great mall.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "No, I think what you're doing and just bringing in Nordstrom's could be a real game changer because there's clearly an unserved audience there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a follow-up to Craig's question. I guess, when you're sitting down with tenants and negotiating new leases, I mean, is there a target occupancy cost?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The answer is that we're very focused on the maximizing of rents and it's less about a target occupancy cost because it takes into account the size of the space, the use of the tenant, the quality of the mall, where is the space located in the mall, what's the sales projection for that tenant. And all of that goes into setting the rate that we think is appropriate. And believe me, the process is granular and we spend a great deal of time on the nickels, making sure that we try and get it right. But we don't go into any given spacing, we want 12.5% of sales from this space and 18% from this space. All those factors go into how we set the rent.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That helps. And then, Rick, I guess I know there's been a lot of discussion on JCPenney and Sears. But just one thing I was thinking about when I was going through this up on anchor big box openings, it is interesting when you look at the list compared to what, say, years ago when we saw a number of department stores closings. I mean, do you feel better today there's more options? I mean, I really haven't heard yet great evidence if somebody's anchors are definitely a benefit to the mall, but I would imagine, it just seems like a pretty good list, including -- like I noticed Wegmans at Montgomery Mall.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Yes. Well, look, we have a whole dedicated team and frankly, David and I have been pushing all of our people to go out and kept as broad a net as possible, so we have as many options identified as possible to make things work. And frankly, Wegmans at Montgomery Mall has been terrific, Fairway Market at Nanuet has been great, Fresh Market at The Falls, but that's just one category. David mentioned Dick's earlier, Arhaus Furniture. We just have a lot of different users that, as we've said earlier, we've gone through our portfolio and have these users identified, so that if an opportunity presents itself with an anchor box, we can move efficiently and quickly and effectively to get it filled.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. And the difference, Jeff, also is that when we have a significant turmoil in the department store business, say in the late 80s, early 90s, I mean, there's been episodes of -- a lot of turnover. There was also a lot of new stuff that was being brought to the market. In today's market, you essentially have no new -- I mean, of a significant quantity, no new development, whether it's strip centers and malls, they have a little bit in the Outlet business as we all know, but you have no new product coming on the market. And it's -- yes, I know there are a few, but in the real sense of stuff. So -- and you also have obsolescence occurring, which is -- by the way, we -- they've been telling folks for several years that we expect an obsolescence. When you put together the inventories tight and sure, there'll be some headaches associated with that, but that's in a -- that's a better spot to be in if, in fact, there is significant anchor turmoil than say, in the early 90s and a couple other, the episodes that Rick and I have had to deal with.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Then the last thing I'll say on that is that frankly, success breeds success. So once we're able to get one of these new anchors in our properties, they open the store, what invariably we have found is they've been more successful than they thought they'd be, and that makes the next conversation for the next opportunity much more easy to have and finalize.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Thanks. And then I just want to clarify, I know, at the beginning of the call, David you're talking about traffic counts, I think it's important to clarify -- I think you used the word -- you don't participate with the company mentioned. When you say that, are you saying, just to confirm, Simon does not provide data to these companies? Is that correct?", "David E. Simon", "They are -- they -- yes, they -- first of all, we don't use them. We rely primarily on parking counts. We do not use them. I think their -- I'm not sure about their sample base. You'll have to ask them. I think it's narrow. And I don't -- the retailers that use them, I think, it's a small subset. But I mean, look, there are lots of people that make pronouncements and tell you this, tell you that. All we can do is just report quarter-after-quarter what the results of our business produce.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question, I know you may not be able to answer it, but into these things with [ph] Calbman, I guess, did anything -- was there any discussions on the 2 different St. Louis Outlet Centers?", "David E. Simon", "I think, Jeff, everything I've told you about our deal has been disclosed.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just a quick follow-up, a technical question. You mentioned that the online sales fulfilled at your malls will count towards sales. On the flip side, if somebody buys 6 pairs of shoes online and returns 5 of them at your malls, is that a net deduction to sales?", "David E. Simon", "The answer is no because it didn't occur at the POS.", "Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So even if they returned it in your mall, it would not?", "David E. Simon", "Correct.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Correct.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thank you. Sorry, the call dragged on that long. Steve has been a great part of the group. We've got another year to torment him. So I'm sure you'll see him around, and we'll make sure that we'll want to go the extra torment for the next year. So anyway, thank you. Have a good one.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Please proceed.", "Liz Zale", "Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Simon Property Group's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are also joined by Tom Ward, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Before we begin, just a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

We had strong start to the year. Results in the quarter were led by FFO $2.38 per share, up 16.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Once again our FFO significantly exceeded the first call consensus estimate. Our growth strategy continues to generate significant value for our business. Overall business conditions are positive. Demand for space in our portfolio remain strong. Leasing activity is helping. We had occupancy growth of 80 basis points compared to Q1 2013 in the quarter is 95.5%, accelerating releasing spreads to $9.90 per square foot. Our comp NOI growth for malls and outlets was 3.7% despite higher cost from utilities and snow removal. If we normalize this, this affected our comp by roughly 90 basis points and as a point of reference comp NOI including The Mills and excluding the malls to be spun-off as part of WP was 5.3% for the quarter including the high cost of snow and utility removal.", "Now as reported, our retail sales were essentially flat and I would encourage you to look at our revenues as opposed to our retailer sales. As you know, if we had underperforming retailers we have the ability to replace them with better retailers at generally higher rents which generates higher SPG revenues and as I have said repeatedly current retail sales does not correlate to our ability to grow our cash flow and as a reminder, our consolidated revenues, the revenues that I focus on, grew by 8.2% for the year. These results are testament to the strength of our assets and the desirability of our locations.", "Now development construction continues on new premium outlets in Charlotte, Minneapolis, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver, all high quality major markets and that remains our only focus in new development is in those kind of markets. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward. We have up to six additional new outlets expected to start construction in 2014 and 2015. Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at 29 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico.", "We started construction on two important redevelopment projects in our portfolio. They include the relocation of Bloomingdale's at Stanford Mall in Palo Alto and the redevelopment of its former location to add 120,000 new square feet of space for small shops and restaurants and the relocation of Saks Fifth Avenue at Houston Galleria to a new prototype store plus the redevelopment of that existing of Saks and an expansion adding the 105000 square feet of luxury retail and restaurants. We also started construction on the expansion of Yeoju premium outlets in Seoul, Korea. That will add approximately 259,000 square feet and we have a healthy pipeline of other premium outlet expansion projects in the works.", "Desert Hills premium outlets in celebrating the opening of its expansion beginning this Thursday, adding 147,000 square feet and it is fully an example. As an example, the annualized NOI from this expansion will add $17 million to SPG's NOI, as it's a wholly-owned asset. Construction is ongoing to expand and enhance some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Lenox Square and Del Amo to name a few. Overall we continue to expect redevelopment investments of at least $1 billion annually through 2016 that will contribute incremental growth in NOI and strengthen the position of our assets in the respective geographic areas.", "On Kl\u00e9pierre, the transformative Carrefour deal selling 126 smaller assets for nearly \u20ac2 billion closed last week. McArthurGlen, our new investment in the outlet business in Europe is performing well. Our deal signed transactions during the first quarter included our acquisition of the remaining interest in Kravco Simon which held interest in a portfolio of 10 assets including King of Prussia Mall which we now own 100% and the acquisition of Arizona Mills bringing our interest to that center of 100% as well as development land in Oyster Bay, Long Island from the Taubman Centers.", "Just an update on Washington Prime Group. WP spin-off of 98 assets including our strip center business is expected to be completed in the second quarter. Recent activities include announced members of senior management team, an independent Board of Directors including Mark Orban as CEO. We are pleased also today to announce that Mark Richards will be joining WP as CFO. He is well respected and has worked with Mark successfully at Sunrise Senior Living.", "We received indicative investment grade range from three major credit agencies as follows, S&P BBB, Moody's BAA2, Fitch BBB. All three agencies provided a stable outlook. Very strong ratings out-of-the-box and comparable to many REITs that have been rated for a long time. The balance sheet will be ready to enable the company in its pursuit of cash flow growth. Completed financing activities on WP. Nine mortgages were closed in unsecured facility comprised of a $900 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan were completed.", "Now let me turn to the SPG capital markets update. We completed a $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes offering in January with a weighted average duration of 7.5 years at an average coupon rate of 2.975%. The 65 basis point spread over treasuries for the five-year tranche is the tightest five years spread ever for a REIT. On March 14 Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to A. We are now at the mid-A level with all three of the agencies leading the REIT industry. We closed or locked rates on four new secured loans in the quarter totaling $860 million of which our share was $491 million and we expect to generate $1 billion of cash proceeds from the WP spin upon its completion.", "Early in April, we amended and extended our $4 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility to a June 2019 final maturity and we are able to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis points on LIBOR plus 95 basis points, again the best in the market. We raised the dividend again this quarter to a $1.30 per share. That's an increase of $0.05 per share from last quarter and a year-over-year increase of 13%. We will pay at SPG at least $5.15 per common share in 2014 not including the WP expected dividend. As we said to you originally the WP expected dividend will create an overall effective dividend of $5.65 or another at least $0.50 on a one-for-one basis for WP spin.", "Now let's go to guidance. We revised our 2014 guidance upwards to $9.60 to $9.70 of FFO per share. This incorporates our strong performance in the first quarter. It raises both the top and the bottom by $0.10. It's based upon an annual comp NOI growth of at least 4% for combined mall and outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is comparable basis with our 2013 results and ignores any potentially impact of the WP spin. Once the spin-off is completed, we will provide updated guidance through a press release reflecting what the impact of SPG will be for the balance of the year.", "So overall, we had a strong start to the year. We are absolutely focused on creating value for our properties and for our tenants and for our shareholders and now we are ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Thanks. Good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Hi, David. I can appreciate your comment about tenant sales, how that doesn't directly impact your business short-term, but I was wondering if you guys could maybe try and isolate what the weather impact was and if you or Rick could maybe talk about regional sales performance and did you see any differences in places like Florida, Texas and California versus the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest?", "David Simon", "I would refute your first statement, Steve, and I would suggest to you that the most important thing in terms of growing our cash flow is in fact what the market rents of our space are which are not determined by what current retailers are producing out of that space and what our rollover schedule looks like. And in fact if you see our rent spreads of nearly $10 per foot, that would indicate exactly, sure we do have some risk to overage rent as sales ebb and flow, but the fact of the matter is recurrent retail sales generally don't have an impact.", "And take an example, there are a number of the retailers that are really not performing that well for each one have a variety of reasons. That's in our sales numbers for our retailers, yet that has nothing to do with what the market value of that space can be. And so again, you should be obsessed with our sales. I am obsessed with our revenues, the SPG revenues. Retailers come and go.", "If we were worried about retail sales, this company was originally built, we had Kmart as our anchors. And if we had looked at Kmart sales, we would have suggested that our sales or our revenues could never grow, but in fact what we do here is we are able to replace underperforming retailers with better retailers and we are able to garner the market rent of what our space should be and that continues to go up. So this is not a short-term issue. This is an issue that's existed for the balance of this 50 year history of this company.", "So now Rick can mention regional, fact of the matter is, sure the weather, this company will never use weather as an excuse. It certainly affected our comp NOI by 90 basis points because of high utility snow. We often talk about the winter. That's in our rearview mirror. It certainly had an impact on our retailers that exist in our buildings, but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the fact that our business is solid. It has the ability to grow its cash flow. We have a long demonstrated track record of being able to do that and we will continue to do that but the markets that didn't have snow, et cetera, they were not as effective in terms of those retailers are reporting.", "I do remind you that the like to remind that the strip center which don't even report tenant sales, but Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.", "Rick Sokolov", "I do. One thing, not only do we not use weather as an excuse with you. We do not allow our operating teams in any of our platforms to use weather as an excuse and we expect those results to be delivered. You will not be surprised to hear that the better markets where the Pacific, Florida, the Southwest and Las Vegas. And the markets that were most impacted by the weather were the Plains, the Great Lakes and the Mid-Atlantic. No great insights there, but as David said, we are managing through.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Okay, thanks, and then just on the leasing front. I know most of the leasing is done for this year, but Rick can you give us some insight as to what kind of leasing is done for next year?", "Rick Sokolov", "We are right on track with our leasing renewals and leasing the space this year and as we sit here today we are right where we were last year this time for this year, but there is increasing demand. As David said, our job is to curate our properties and bring in the most productive and the growing tenants and eliminate or downsize the tenants that are least provocative. And that's what we do on an ongoing basis.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Yes, actually this is Michael Bilerman, Citi. David, I just had one question just in terms of global expansion. I wasn't sure if your British conference call coordinator was on purpose or not. We are sort of yellow this business is clearly global. You have moved that global on all the regions. How do you feel about traditional retail and where are your thoughts are about that side of the business and pursuing more global expansion?", "David Simon", "Well, look, we have a great outlet platform in Asia. In fact, Stanley is over in Asia, I guess, tomorrow. It's tomorrow, right? So technically, here today ahead of our self. So we are looking at other Southeast Asia markets to expand our platform. We have been really successful everywhere in Asia in the outlet business. Japan, Korea, Malaysia. There is a number of Southeastern markets, not China, that are that are very interesting to us. So I would expect Michael to hopefully be able to build some new centers there.", "We have a good outlet potential in Mexico where we got a couple of new sites that we are pursuing aggressively, including the expansion of our one outlet there. The Brazilian outlet opportunity is somewhat dormant at this point. I couldn't find the right sites in the market know. We were fortuitous in that the market obviously is correcting there. So we have no capital at risk and we have nothing unnecessarily planned there.", "And then we have got McArthurGlen which we are very excited about not just the assets that we have interest in but also the development and management platform as well as some of their new expansion opportunities and new development. I was over there a couple weeks ago looking at one of their opportunities. So we think that that business will become more important to us over time. Turning to the full price, I think our model will continue to be opportunistic.", "We love in retrospect what happened at Kl\u00e9pierre. We went in there before anybody thought about investing in European real estate based upon two fundamental beliefs. One is that the cash flow is very sticky. So far so good, ex-Spain, which in fact was not very sticky but it means less and less to us now that we have sold this huge portfolio the Carrefour. We can help the company from a strategic point of view and get them retail focused and all the other things that we have been doing. Help them become better operators. All of which have, in fact, scarily have gone according to plan.", "So we want to be opportunistic. There is a lot of capital now in Europe. The U.K. is not a real focus for us. Prices are not necessarily cheap and they are not opportunistic and we had a disappointing experience there in retrospect to shareholders and the Board should have thought, the shareholders technically never get an opportunity but the Board should probably thought about it's response a little bit more thoroughly than it did. But that said, we are going to continue to be opportunistic. This is not glamorous and it's primarily the focus is if we can add and export our ability and the number one goal is to make money. I have no interest in building monuments.", "Christy McElroy - Citi", "Hi, David, it's Christy here. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your new Simon Venture Group. Are you spending any time on this personally? How much capital what you anticipate investing over time? What sort of returns are you looking at? Can you give us some examples of the types of companies you are looking at?", "David Simon", "Well, sure. We have just hired Skyler Fernandes, who has early stage VC experience. We have made a couple of small investments before Skyler's involvement, with Jifiti and shopkick, I am sorry, I almost said Shop and Trick, which have been small investments and it's really the primary focus is in areas where we think it's going to apply the investment or the business model will apply to our physical environment. It could be a new retailer. It could be a new restaurant. It can be a new technology that is important to our consumers and our retailer. I think over time we could invest anywhere from $25 million to $50 million. We are going to do it very small. We don't want to have a big staff.", "If Skyler is listening, Skyler, you are going to have to do most of this on your own. I am involved. I met a couple of hours yesterday. We have got a couple of, these are $1 million up to $5 million investments a piece, but it's really trying to of focus on bettering our product, and we can do that through new retailers, restaurants. We can do that through new technology. We can do with through new services and we can do it in a way that can help our retailers who like the live which in fact is on the forefront of ultimately providing same-day delivery services to our consumers which seems to resonate with a number of our consumer.", "So that's the theory. It's going to morph. The good news is we only have really two investment mistakes over time that I called material, not material but, in China we only have got $0.75 on $1, but we learned that in China you have to be very careful. We also investment in technology in the late 90s. We learned a lot from that. The whole model has changed now because that actually had great ideas there but investing in building the stuff, this was before the cloud. We had to buy the routers, the servers. You had to build everything. Now you can essentially rent it all out. The economics is such that you are never going to have that kind of capital at risk to see whether or not a new idea or a new technology can germinate to something that's meaningful to our portfolio.", "Christy McElroy - Citi", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the issue with the tenant sales talking about previously that the tenant sales doesn't matter but it's really the cash flow. Presumably the cost of occupancy overtime does matter. Its highlight of the team retailers. Should we assume that, given the comments on team retailers that ex that you are feeling quite good and confident about cost of occupancy overall?", "David Simon", "Well, yes, look, our business has, over its 50 year history, and 20 years as a public company where we produced unbelievable results, but we ask retailers that get hot, get cold, new concept, old concept. It's just the nature of our business. And again, occupancy costs are determined at a particular point in time, but it doesn't necessarily equate to what the market value of that rent is or that space is, because again that sale that's being generated out of that space is that particular retailer and that particular retailer could not be generating the sales that that particular space should be generating, That's where it relies on us to either relocate them or replace them with a newer better retailer.", "So again, if you looked at our top 10 tenants 20 years ago versus today and if you looked at our cash flow growth 20 years ago to today, despite all of the noise about particular retailers here in near, there is such strong evidence to support my statement. So occupancy costs is interesting but it's not a factor in what our ability to generate cash flow growth is. You have to look at the rollover schedule and how that equates to market rents, and market rents are determined based upon supply and demand.", "So in the office sector, you do the same thing. In the strip center sector, you do the same thing. In the industrial sector, you do the same thing. But here, for whatever reason, the mall industry has gotten away from cash flow growth as the important determinant in what the value of our company is and more what are the existing retailer sales. I don't buy that and I have never run this company based upon that and our track record is evidence of that. I don't know what else to tell you.", "Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rick Sokolov", "The only thing I would add is, that the underlying David's point about supply and demand, there is virtually no new supply. If you look over the last six years, supply has been growing 50 bips a year lower than the rate of our population growth. So we are in a very good supply dynamic for the foreseeable future.", "David Simon", "And again, retailers, it ebbs and it flows. Sometimes there is more retailers that are under pressure than sometimes not but you cannot replicate our buildings. You cannot build it. There is no new supply. And supply and demand is in our favor. Otherwise we couldn't grow our cash flow. It's that simple. And I encourage everybody. I hope this doesn't sound defensive but I encourage everybody to understand how we run the business, where we run it over a long period of time. We are always replacing retailers. Some of toughest calls that Rick and I get are the ones when we move an underperforming retailer out for a better performing retailer and the retailers that are underperforming, the fact that they could be there for five, 10 years and their rents are way under market. And it may look bad in their sales, but the fact is, it's welcome from us because we can replace them with a better tenants.", "Let's take lease settlement income as part of that discussion. The fact is that if somebody, like we had some recent settlement income. Sony is exiting the mall business. Sony is in A malls. If they pay me the present value of being in that space and I get that space back and I can lease it for current market value, you and me, you are not made of shareholders and analysts but you in a sense represent shareholders. You and me, have just done a good deed. We now get the present value of that space obligation. I get the space back. I can lease it for market rent. That's a win for us.", "And again, you have seen that over a period of time with retailers and the lease settlement income is being generated by our top centers. For whatever reason, certain retailers are not wanting to get out of the business or not performing well at this center has nothing to do with that center.", "Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "Thank you, and I guess one question in terms of the cash flow. There is a comment in terms of the NOI growth, ex-WP being 5.3%. Should we compare that 5.3% to 3.7%? And it would seem then that WP had much lower NOI growth but presumably a lot of the assets being in the Midwest and some in Mid-Atlantic would have some impact there.", "David Simon", "Well the real important thing we did was we put in The Mills there, which generated -- one of the things we are thinking about comments are welcome, is that we have not historically put The Mills comp NOI growth in our overall comp NOI but once the spin is done it's likely, we are happy to give input on this, it is likely that we will then put that in our comp NOI because these are big cash flow generating assets and it's probably they are the bigger assets which is consistent with what SPG is doing going forward focused on the bigger assets and it will probably be on our comp NOI pool. So we wanted to give you a flavor of what that comp NOI growth would be including The Mills. And there is some marginal benefit of the fact that if you were taking out the WP assets but it's marginal and you are correct in saying that because of the snow and utility costs and a lot of those centers are located in the areas the got whacked in the first quarter, you are correct in saying that that had some impact on that comp NOI as it did for SPG as a whole.", "Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of MLV. Please proceed.", "Paul Morgan - MLV", "Hi. Good morning. David, I think your comment about market rent for space not being related to what the existing retailer is doing and I think maybe one of those, a great example might be just replacing department store space with small shops, any upside you see there, kind of like what you are doing at Stanford, but give us any sense of how many of those opportunities are in your pipeline? You announced a couple projects. The Phipps and the Pentagon City but is this something you are having discussions with department stores increasingly where they can you maybe downsize and you can recapture space at much higher rents? Any color?", "David Simon", "We are always looking for that and I will let Rick comment on it. It's interesting though while that neither one of those guys are leaving. They are actually getting new stores in that process but we are able to make the economics work because of the supply and demand of those particular assets. They are both antiquated physical plans. So we are able to make a win-win out of it in that we reclaim REIT demise their existing space, turn over to small shops. They get a brand new prototype store and it's a win-win but part of the lease settlement income that we generate in the first quarter was the full present value of the fact obligation for the mall where they paid us. They are leaving shortly.", "Rick Sokolov", "They are under construction.", "David Simon", "And we are going to reclaim that for small shops that's a mall that's close to $1,000 a foot, something like that. But thee is a handful of those. Rick you want to add? There are a handful of those kind of opportunities.", "Rick Sokolov", "And we are constantly mining the portfolio. We just announced literally an expansion at Pentagon. We have announced, David just talked about Florida mall. And both of those are just in addition to all of the things we completed over the last year and obviously we are always talking with our department stores about where they got space that we believe could be better deployed and we are in constant conversations about whether we can put it to better use. And sometimes it happens independent of us. A great example of that is DICK'S that is being added in one levels Sears in King of Prussia that we have basically done inside the Sears store but that's going to make that property substantially more productive by having DICK'S anchor around one level in Sears consolidating in a more productive box on one level.", "Paul Morgan - MLV", "My other question is related, but I think there has obviously been a lot of headlines about not just sales but mall traffic and then we have had a tick up in bankruptcies and store closing announcements and so but what you don't hear as much about is the retailers who are looking to backfill that space. Maybe I don't know, Rick, if you have some color about people who, for example, would be looking to take the Coldwater Creek stores that are liquidating or folks like that who have upped their store opening targets?", "Rick Sokolov", "David always makes fun of me when I rattle of the list of the tenants but the good news is that there is a very vibrant of group of tenants that are looking to expand. Lego, Athleta, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, just a few, and Topshop, we are adding Topshop's in three places in the portfolio. There are, to David's point, historically there have always been tenant that are looking to do business in productive properties and to the extent the space we are getting back is in productive properties and happily that's the vast majority of our portfolio. We have users and we have demand at better rents and the opportunity to rightsize the space.", "Paul Morgan - MLV", "Great. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Yes, and just a comment on traffic. I would suggest to you that when a retailer talks about traffic, that may be their particular stores and may not be endemic of the mall's traffic and I would also caution, throw significant caution to the wind that there are a couple of, one company in particular that holds themselves out as the barometer of traffic in the mall industry and there data does not include any common area or inference data from the Simon Property Group and many other mall owners of a quality real estate and we don't know how and in fact what that traffic is that they report. So I just want to throw caution to the wind when you hear these general statements about traffic. Was traffic affected by the winter? And the fact is that malls, we have some statistic, which I don't even remember but how many days our malls were closed compared to last year was 10x of what it was. So that can happen. It happened. I just want you to throw caution to the wind when the media quotes traffic numbers, understand the source of that and its accuracy.", "Paul Morgan - MLV", "So you are saying your portfolio is doing better than what they are saying for the industry?", "David Simon", "I am saying, our traffic was affected by the weather and I am saying you look at our results and that gives you an indication of what's going on our portfolio.", "Paul Morgan - MLV", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "Good morning, everybody. The Carrefour sale by Kl\u00e9pierre, does that prompt any consideration for special dividend under the French REIT rules, David?", "David Simon", "No. The answer is no, because they have the ability to straddle years a little bit like this as well and they are also unwinding some hedges as part of that because they were over hedged. So there is some losses associate with that. The fact is, it will not end up in a situation where there is an unusual dividend spike. Dividend has been growing. Expect that to probably continue but there won't be something extraordinary associated with that sale.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "So the proceeds will be essentially used to delever the company, at least the initial thought?", "David Simon", "Correct. That's correct.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "Okay. Does that leave you looking for acquisitions in that company now as we go forward? Or are you happy with a lower level of leverage?", "David Simon", "No, I think the company is now in a position that it can look for opportunities, whether new development, expansions, some acquisitions here and there but they are clearly focused on, given the significant change they are very focused on growing the business now which two years ago when we got there, I would say it was a different scenario. So thankfully they have executed extremely well and they are looking for growth similar to what all major retail owners do. Do some developments, some expansion, some potential acquisitions here and there.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "Now your estimable CFO has not yet been given a speaking part, but I just wondered if there is any update on his replacement.", "David Simon", "Well, unfortunately, you have asked a question where he can't respond to that either.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "Well, I don't give great quarter, guys, but I wanted to throw in a compliment.", "Steve Sterrett", "Thank you.", "David Simon", "A pat on the back never hurts from anybody. So in any event, as you know we have been, it's very interesting, this company again, there is lot that gets lost in sauce. On one hand this week, we were going to open Desert Hills. It's going to be 100% leased and it's going to add $70 million of cash flow the company. At the same time, we hired a new venture guy. Europe is doing well. You got all the redevelopment. We are doing the WP deal, right and then obviously I have got the focus on Steve's replacement. So just from a, my point of view here, and this is probably, I am telling the people here, they are probably looking for me to say what I am going to say.", "So I have been thinking long and hard about this and as you know, the biggest focus we had over the last two or three months has been WP. That management team is basically set, done, which is very good news and it's a great team. They are young, energetic. It's got a mix of Simon trained folks. It's got our strip center entrepreneurial group and then it's got the outsider and a couple of his colleagues that I think ultimately will create their unique dynamic company that's really going to be hustling for growth.", "Now that that's said and it looks like the spin is, again subject to Board approval, winding around the last corner. I have been thinking more and more about this and I will probably have an opinion in a month or two but right now I am seriously considering internal candidates as the first line of defense. The good news is, we have got a great bench. We got guys that are savvy veterans, younger people that want to move up. We have a great culture here, and I think we can do it internally but I don't want to rush to judgment. I want WP to get done and then I think once that gets done, something could happen in the next four to eight weeks.", "That's probably news to everybody in this room but therein lies my thinking. So I hope you appreciate the honesty of my response.", "David Harris - Imperial Capital", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Ki Bin - SunTrust", "Thanks. I had just a couple of follow-ups. In terms of traffic data and your tenant replacement commentary, could you just talk a little bit, we are midway through April, almost May now and I wouldn't say it has been very warm, but have you seen some kind of catch up in the past couple months in terms of tenant traffic or sales or anything like that that might be a better indicator going forward?", "Rick Sokolov", "I think we can say that April is off to a much better start. We obviously had Easter moving from March into April. March was better than February. February was better than January and that trend is continuing in to April and we certainly anticipate that we will have some catch up.", "Ki Bin - SunTrust", "Okay and the second question. I am sure you guys get this all the time, but if you had to estimate, how many more outlets do you think in the U.S. that we absolutely could use? And how does that number compare to some of your, like in Europe where you are trying to expand?", "David Simon", "Well, again, if you look at some of the general industry publications, there is a pipeline of 50 and I would just say I don't believe that that whole pipeline will be built. I do think last year, 2013 and 2014 was going to be an active year. So I think you will see five or six or so in the next two, three, four, five years. So if I had to guess I think you are going to see probably 20 or so added over the next three, four, five years. I don't think it's going to be quite as frenzied as everybody thinks. I think we have a really good handle, as you might imagine, on this industry. So that's my own personal view, but I don't control. Developers are always pushing the limit. Whether four or five or six that outlets get built, it doesn't impact our outlet business and what we do. And as you know we are looking to only build in major markets where there really is unquestionable demand for the premium outlet product. If it's a marginal market, we are just going to pass and we have passed on a number of sites. Rick, you can add anything?", "Rick Sokolov", "The one thing that I would emphasize and David talked about in the context of Desert Hills, we are spending as much time and money expanding our existing great premium outlet as we are trying to build new ones. Desert Hills opens Thursday. We opened an expansion in Orlando. We opened an expansion at Seattle. We are under construction on Las Vegas North Downtown 147,000 feet. We are expanding Woodbury. We are expanding Chicago. And these are all among the best outlets in the United States. We are expanding Livermore and all of those expansions taken together are probably two or three new projects but they will be dramatically more productive, dramatically better returns and they have the benefit of enhancing what we already have.", "Ki Bin - SunTrust", "Okay, and a similar question, but how about for Europe? Do you see that potential of it being just a lot bigger?", "David Simon", "Yes, I think Europe, the right to build there is much more difficult but there is a pipeline that we have at MGE that we are going to pursue but it's lot tougher. It's a lot harder to get done. There is a lot more restrictions in terms of how outlets get viewed in Europe in terms of laws there. But if you do get the right to build, it's a terrific, terrific opportunity. So it will be more but I think it will be measured and we will have our share of that, but there is definitely part of what we want to do with MGE. It was in fact build some new centers in Europe.", "Ki Bin - SunTrust", "Okay. Thank you guys.", "David Simon", "Sure", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hi, it's Craig Schmidt for Jeff Spector. I was just wondering if we could spend a little time talking about The Mills. It seems like it has the highest return on redevelopments. Its minimum rents are growing well and it's also seemed to have done the best in terms of sales per square foot productivity since 4Q 2009, in terms of its lift. I know you were doing a lot of things at a lot of different Mills, but what's meeting with the biggest success to sort of drive this?", "Rick Sokolov", "Craig, it's Rick. I think that The Mills have been performing great and I think that some of it, hopefully a lot of it is attributable to us being able to broaden their appeal. What we have been able to do through our relationships is bring tenants that have been successful in premium outlet in The Mills operate off price concepts, and bring tenants into The Mills from the mall business to operate full price concepts. And that combination has been very compelling. So tenants like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works are operating full price concepts and tenants like Michael Kors, Coach, Express are operating off price concepts. That combination has created, as David said, properties that are 1.5 to 2 million square feet doing hundreds of million of dollars of sales and providing unique franchise in each of the markets where they operate. So we have been very pleased with it and we are growing and we have got expansions underway at Sawgrass. We are working on redevelopments at Great Mall. We are working on expansion at Orange and there's a lot of growth runway to open that platform.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Is there any potential for a ground-up development of a Mills project at this point?", "Rick Sokolov", "I think that's going to be more difficult. Frankly there are not many markets left in the United States that can support a 2 million square feet ground up development that does $500 million and $700 million from day one. So I would not look for that.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then the Yeoju expansion, the premium outlet. Is there any direction that you want to take the new tenants that you are bringing into that project?", "David Simon", "It will continue to be the high-end tenants there. The existing center has a great tenant mix. So there will continue to be of all the American as well as European brands and the international companies. It is a international retail mix. There are some Korean retailers, but by and large its all the brands that you are familiar with.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then hopefully this is the Steve Sterrett question. The pickup in other income, will we see that going forward? Will we have as active a land sales and/or the lease settlement? Or should we assume that that starts to resemble 2013?", "Steve Sterrett", "Craig, Rick and David talked a lot about the lease settlement income of and I think we did have a fair bit of that activity in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that level of activity to go through the rest of the year and land sales, as you know, are pretty lumpy but I certainly wouldn't expect that level of activity for the rest of the year.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Hello, good morning. Just two questions here. First up, on the line of credit, you guys now have I think almost $7 billion if you include the accordions of capacity, which seems like an awful lot just given that if you guys wanted to do anything I would assume that you would have a line of bankers outside of Indy and 399 Park in less than an hour. Is more of this insurance? Like as you guys pay the facility fee, is more of this just the comfort of knowing that you have that? Or is there something else, like just preparing for the next credit crisis or something, just to know that, God forbid, you had to put on major mortgages or refinancings that you just had that available?", "Steve Sterrett", "Well, Alex, it's Steve. I do think if you look at our debt maturity schedule, we do have $2 billion to $3 billion of debt maturing a year. We are a large company. We did have, people tend to forget, that we did have an instance, not all that long ago, in this country where the capital markets were pretty dysfunctional for an extended period of time. So we have been operating under a philosophy that we want $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity at all times. Call it insurance. Call it what you want. But I think that's prudent for a company our size.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, and then just a second question is, what are the next steps or what else needs to be done before the Board can declare Washington Prime good to go?", "David Simon", "Well, we just have to become effective with the SEC, which we are getting closer and closer. The Board has got to review all the final things and then we make an announcement. So its moving quickly and so it's just a process, essentially just becoming effective with the SEC and then Board approval and we are off to the races.", "Steve Sterrett", "And you saw, Alex, we filed another amendment to the Form 10 yesterday, the amendment number 3. So we are, as David mentioned, getting down to the short strokes.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, so this is just all the back and forth where they give you comments and hopefully that list of comments is getting smaller and smaller and then it's good?", "David Simon", "Yes.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, perfect.", "Steve Sterrett", "If you are excited, you can read the 600 pages of total documents if you have nothing to do this weekend.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill", "You know, my kids were saying, Daddy, we like you doing boring Daddy work. We don't like playing with you. So I will do that. Listen, thanks.", "David Simon", "All right. No worries. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Busch of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors", "Thank you. David, following the WP spin off of the smaller SPG malls and strip centers, will there be any other remaining malls in the portfolio that you would consider non-core and could be potential candidates for disposition?", "David Simon", "Well, we will always going to be portfolio manage our asset. So the answer to that is sure. We have partners in some assets. Partners may want to sell. We may agree with them. So yes, sure. We are always going to portfolio manage our asset base.", "Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors", "Okay, and it appears like there's a growing number of B and C malls coming to the market. Do you have a sense of what the demand is for that type of quality? Is it similar to the quality that WP is?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't want to -- again, WP's malls are all sorts of the references from the analytic community. My view of WP's malls are there is the one overriding point is that they are smaller. They are just not big malls. I will let you decide whether that's a B-mall or C-mall, an A-mall. I don't think about it like that. I look at the cash flow what's the sustainability of the cash flow. Is that a market where you can grow the cash flow and the one thing that I will bring with is that they are smaller than our average mall. We think those assets because as we have gotten bigger over time and focused on the bigger assets, they tend to lose the day in and day out focus that they deserve. So with that preamble said, look there is a lot of capital in the real estate industry generally for all sorts of assets and money wants to be put to work in the top quality assets in redevelopment assets, in new development across the specter in hotels, retail, office et cetera and I think WP will be able to take advantage of whatever strategy ultimately they put together. But there are buyers for everything right now in any assets. I look at your NAV analysis and I can tell you, our partner is selling a mall and the cap rate is blowing me away in terms of how low it is. So there is a lot of capital for retail real estate in every bucket and to some extent there is product available and to some extent there is less product available but I expect a lot of trades to happen.", "Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors", "Great, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Good morning or afternoon to you guys. I just want to go back to the releasing spreads. On a percentage basis, they have been improving for quite a few quarters here now in a row. I am just curious if you could break that down between sort of what's driving that? Is it more market rent increases? Or is it just the base of the malls that are on spaces that are closing? Is it maybe not growing or is going the other way?", "Rick Sokolov", "Fundamentally, we just have a very good supply and demand dynamic. I would tell you that when you look at our spread calculations, they include almost eight million square feet of space. So it is less susceptible but specific project influences are much more representative of the overall trends throughout our business and we are just able to lease our product at higher rents because frankly I do believe our properties are taking market share and we are having a more desirable portfolio for the retailers to want to operate in.", "David Simon", "But simply put, the expiring rent is just lower than the market rent. So there is a lot of reasons for that. But that's the simple answer. So if you look at our expiring rent schedule and you see where our market rents are, therein lies why we have the spread which therein lies why we have the ability to increase our cash flow year after year after year. Again you may notice I believe Q1 comp last year was 5%, something like that.", "Steve Sterrett", "Yes.", "David Simon", "So our 3.7% was off of a base of 5% that 3.7%, as I mentioned was hurt 90 basis points by extraordinary costs associated with the harsh winter. So you can normalize and do whatever you want with it but that's just how we would look at it and but its that simple. Now notice I didn't talk about retail sales. I talked about market rent.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Right, and that's what I am trying to get at. I guess maybe asking another way is, how (inaudible) market rents for your portfolio have gone up, say, over the last year or so as opposed to the spread, which --?", "David Simon", "The good news is that its clearly gone up because you have seen the spread accelerate.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and maybe just another topic. I know its early days in your ownership there on the Oyster Bay development, but is there any update on how the development planning process is going over there?", "David Simon", "It's very early days. So really nothing to add there other than we are excited about the opportunity. Our partners are excited about the opportunity. We very much look forward to working with the town to fine a win-win. So we think it's a great opportunity for us and it will be a high priority for us over the next year or so as we go through the process.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Yes, good afternoon. Going back to development and redevelopment yields, also noticed that you took up the yield on the outlet development to 10% from 9% last quarter. Just wondering what was driving that?", "Steve Sterrett", "Two things. One, we been able to bring in our cost at a little below budget. Two, we have got a lot of demand and we been able to lease it at higher rents. Hence we got higher returns.", "David Simon", "I would say it differently. I would say typically they sandbag us on the rent they charge but we let it get approved in any event. So it's all about setting expectations. Isn't it?", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Very much so. Were there any particular assets that kind of drove the average up? Or is this kind of happening across the entire development portfolio?", "David Simon", "Pretty much across the board, we are seeing those trends.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay, that's helpful, and then just staying on the outlet side, again there was some news out there a few days ago about Charlotte, North Carolina and the whole process of your development there, some pushback from local residents. Just kind of curious if you could opine on that?", "David Simon", "It's opening on July 31 of this year and it's very well leased and we are in very good shape there.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay, that is helpful, and then last one from me. This one to Steve. Credit provisioning levels also went up during the quarter. Just kind of curious what you are seeing from that perspective and what we should be modeling going forward.", "Steve Sterrett", "Tayo, we talked a lot over the last few years about that expense being really low. I think what you saw this quarter is just a bit of a reversion to the mean. If you look in the context of $5 billion plus of consolidated revenues, I think we billed north of $7 billion a year to the tenants. Having $5 million of bad debt expense a quarter is still pretty de minimis, but I think that's probably more reflective of the run rate that we are going to see this year.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Is that reflective, you are just updating your estimates or are you actually seeing more issues with the tenants themselves that's actually causing an actual increase in that number?", "David Simon", "No, it's a bit of a combination of both. Our overall receivable level is still pretty well but interestingly enough our bad debt reserve is pretty much formulate driven and because you have had more tenant either announce store closings or in a couple of cases go into bankruptcy, we reserve a higher percentage of outstandings against the types of tenants and it generated a slightly higher bad debt expense this quarter.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Great. Thank you very much.", "David Simon", "Tayo, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "Yes, hi, thanks. Maybe just building on the earlier lease spread question, I believe your spreads are based on openings and closings. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about spreads based on signed leases? Maybe what that trend has been? And also maybe how that compares with that 19.5% that you report in your supplemental.", "Steve Sterrett", "Ben, you are right in that the spread is based on cash closing rent compared to cash opening rent, but because the population, as Rick mentioned, is still large, I mean it's eight million square feet at any one point in time. Looking at it on a signed basis relative to the actual opening isn't going to move the number up a lot, but I will echo what Rick said earlier that demand for space is good, deal quality continues to improve overall. We have been pleased to see the continued acceleration in the leasing spreads but looking at it from a signed basis to an actual opening basis isn't going to materially move the number.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "Okay, got it, that's helpful, and then also you talked a little bit about the lease termination income. Was that all Sony? Or were there other retailers in that mix? And maybe also, since it's a lot higher, can you also offer what your guidance is for the full year on that line item?", "David Simon", "Yes, we don't like to do that but we have the Sony and then I mentioned about the other department store scenario. So that gives you the bulk of it more or less.", "Steve Sterrett", "In commenting, Ben, on the volume of it, if you look back over our last several years, we have averaged $20 million to $25 million a year of lease settlement income. We just happen to have a larger chunk of that in the first quarter. Could it be more f significant in 2014 than it has been in n the last of couple years? Well, we are certainly off to start, and as David and Rick mentioned, because a couple of the lumpy things that have occurred in the first quarter, it could trend a little higher but it's certainly not going to trend at the same level we saw in the first quarter.", "David Simon", "Yes, and again, I want to emphasize this is a --", "Steve Sterrett", "It's a good thing.", "David Simon", "It's a good thing because again I don't lose the space. I just get at present value the lease obligation or very close to it. Then I have the ability to lease the space out. So it is not something, we have got to get the right values. We do lots of analysis, as you might imagine. We are very sophisticated on this front.", "Steve Sterrett", "Or typically we don't execute it until we have got our replacement in place.", "David Simon", "But this is not a bad thing at all.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "All right, I totally get it, it's not bad, but could it tick higher to that $20 million to $25 million that you have historically reported in the past?", "David Simon", "It has a chance this year primarily because we did the one big deal with the department store which I would say is somewhat out of the ordinary.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "I mean, was that big deal, was that kind of baked into your earlier guidance? I am just kind of wondering if that was?", "David Simon", "Yes.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "Okay, got it.,", "David Simon", "Absolutely. That's been in the works for two, three years.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "Okay, helpful, maybe final question. You talked a little bit about the other income in your consolidated. Why exactly did the other income in your joint venture also go higher?", "David Simon", "Its part of the big lease settlement that I mentioned was in its of JV property.", "Steve Sterrett", "Yes, the biggest drivers of the movement in that number though, Ben, is the nature of some of the income that flows through from McArthurGlen. A lot of it service related income. As you know, we own half of the economics of the development and management business. So that's the primary driver of that.", "Ben Yang - Evercore", "Got it. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Yes, hi, thanks. Just following up on that real quick. So the $11 million is consolidated. What is the overall pro rata number for lease term this quarter? And when you talked about $20 million to $25 million normally, is that a consolidated number or is that the pro rata number?", "Steve Sterrett", "The $20 million to $25 million would be the annual run rate, kind of on a pro rata basis, Michael.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Got it, and what was the full pro rata in Q1 then?", "Steve Sterrett", "It was high-teens.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Got it, okay, and then last question. I guess historically you have talked about development spend having a bit at least about $1 billion a year for the next few years. As you look out from this standpoint, how many years out does that generally account for at this point?", "David Simon", "Well, we have said through 2016, but it is not set in stone.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Got it, okay, great. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "Yes, thank you. Just one quick question, I guess for David and Rick. The so-called fast retailing tenants have been growing pretty dramatically in your properties for a number of years now and I think it shows up with Forever 21 being now a top 10 tenant and an average store size, just looking at the metrics and the setup of more than 10,000 square feet. Historically, of course, you have excluded stores of more than 10,000 square feet in the sales productivity number. I just wonder if, given the ambitious plans of cohorts like H&M and Uniqlo, whether you have given any consideration to perhaps including the fast retailing productivity and the reported productivity, given how important they seem to be and look like it's going to increase in importance.", "David Simon", "Well, Jim, if you had listened to my --", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "I heard every word.", "David Simon", "Yes, if you listened to my discussion on tenant sales, I would suggest to you, it's an interesting derivative, there's no correlation and the fact is there's no other industry that I know that's focused on retail sales. Therefore this is what's going on with your property. I before saying look at our cash flow and measure us on that basis. And I think somehow the industry is gotten off track here by being the most important metric. I look at the analyst report that came out that even though we beat consensus by $0.14 or something like that, we had unbelievable historical growth. Our comp NOI has grown year after year. It was up marginally in the great recession. The balance sheet is AAA. We are adding all this new development. The one constant dialogue I got was the tenant sales, right. So you want more of that. So I can read more of that. So somehow I am happy have this we discussed with you and other shareholders but somehow we are losing track that retailers come and go. This company was built based upon Kmart leases, okay?", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "No, I understand all that. I just think the point is that fast retailing, as a format, does seem to be, in terms of its size, Forever 21 is an in-line tenant and I have no idea, by the way, what their productivity is. It's simply that they are now a top 10 tenant and H&M and Uniqlo have pretty ambitious expansion plans as well. And I was just, all I am doing is suggesting that the original reason for excluding tenants of over 10,000 square feet, I just wonder if it still applies when we think about that type of retailer.", "David Simon", "I don't think as the mix has broadened in these centers, that metric is probably less and less important. What happens if we bring in service tenants or we take a department store down and put in an office building or an apartment complex. I think we are losing sight of, its real estate and it's about organic cash flow growth and it's not about what particular person is doing in a particular space because again we own the real estate, they don't perform we get it back and then the next question is what can we do with that real estate. So I will tell you what, I will put it in there if you talk about it on page 10 and not on page one. Okay.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "Well, I will just say for my note, by the way, I stressed if people want more space and are willing to pay more for it, what's the key driver. So not guilty as charged here, at least in that respect.", "And just one other question I had for you, and this maybe is a Rick question. The development activity number went up a little close to $300 million at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. Am I correct in assuming, Rick, that as far as the mall category, which is where it all took place, that that number didn't include your announcements on Pentagon and Phipps, number one?", "Number two, that it would be virtually all the Simon post-spin malls that we are talking about there?", "Rick Sokolov", "Well, you shouldn't presume the latter because we are reporting everything in a combined basis so far. So in that regard, there is capital attributable to these post-spin assets we are doing things. Houston Galleria has started. We have also started on Florida Mall. So a number of new ones have come in to that mix but it is not a function of post-spin or pre-spin and it does not yet include Pentagon or Phipps. We just announced those will be starting construction this quarter.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "So the -- sorry.", "David Simon", "Go ahead, Jim.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "Sorry, go ahead. Yes, I was just going to say post-spin, and I just want to make sure I understood the comments you made earlier regarding the level of development activity that we should expect from Simon post-spin. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be the same kind of number as we have been thinking about historically for the company. Obviously the contribution should be relatively greater given that the post-spin company base is going to be a little bit smaller. But is there an opportunity in these malls that there could be an accelerated, an increased level of major expansion spending, given that where you are spending the money and the big money seems to be on the biggest, strongest assets where the demand is really very strong?", "Rick Sokolov", "Certainly that is going to come about and where we got some of the other projects that we are working on that we hope to announce. We have already talked about connection to King of Prussia. So there are other nine bigger projects coming down the road including Copley that are going to certainly continue that level of spend in the post-spin side.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group", "Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.", "David Simon", "And I was just going to add, Jim, just to make sure everyone that's still on the call, all of our numbers that we reported all include the WP assets, occupancy sales, comp NOI, all of the 8-K step is all including the WP all of that. Just to make sure everybody understands that.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay, thank you. Before we conclude today's call for our stockholders that maybe on this call, our annual meeting is May 15 and hopefully you are seeing our proxy statement that we filed on April 10. Your vote is very important to us and the Board has unanimously recommended that stockholders vote for all of the proposals and I would ask you to please vote for all of the proposals.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Simon Property Group Second Quarter 2014 earnings conference call.", "Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are also joined by Andy Juster, our current Treasurer and incoming CFO.", "Before we begin, just a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are also available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "Also due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off during the second quarter we are providing operating statistics for the prior year period to show performance on a comparable basis, excluding the Washington Prime properties which is in our supplemental 8-K.", "And now for our prepared remarks I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning. It was a very eventful and productive quarter. We completed the spin-off of Washington Prime Group. We re-launched our brand to create a whole new way to engage with consumers and most important we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance.", "Results in the quarter were led by FFO of $2.16 per share exceeding the first call consensus estimate by $0.03 per share. Excluding the operating results from the WPG properties and the transaction costs related to that spend, FFO increased 12.8% year-over-year for the second quarter.", "As a point of interest if we exclude the transaction costs related to the spin, our FFO would have been approximately $2.26 for the quarter. And I would like to take a moment and put that number into perspective.", "I\u2019ll remind you that our second quarter 2010 FFO was $1.38 per share. So the quarterly profitability of Simon Property Group has increased by $0.88 per share, or $320 million quarter-over-quarter since then. Overall, business conditions remain favorable, driving the increases in our key operating metrics in our cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, occupancy ended up in malls, premium outlets and the mills.", "The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded increased leasing spreads to $11.06 per square foot. The mills recorded leasing spreads of $12.74 per square foot. And for those of you, who are interested, comparable property sales were up 90 basis points for the quarter and the movement from sales per square foot of $6.12 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $612 a year ago to $608 is solely related to bringing on several new projects totaling 2.16 million square feet.", "Comp NOI, of course, which I\u2019m more interested increased 5.6% in the second quarter and is up 5.5% year-to-date and over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And as a reminder, our comp NOI in 2013 Q2 was over 5%. So that\u2019s 5.6% over 5%. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets, the desirability of our locations, and our ability to execute.", "So let\u2019s look a little forward, Charlotte Premium Outlets is opening on July 31, and is fully leased. Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Minneapolis will open August 14, and is fully leased. Construction continues on new Premium Outlet developments in Montreal and Vancouver, both high quality major markets, and Montreal will open in the fourth quarter.", "Formal groundbreaking at Gloucester Premium Outlets, a new 375,000 square foot center in Southern New Jersey that serves a greater Philadelphia area is scheduled for August 7. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward, but we are being very selective and focus on major markets and where there is clear demand from the retailers and manufacturers that matter.", "Now, in the quarter, just turning to redevelopment and expansion, we did open successfully a 147,000 square foot expansion in Desert Hills Premium Outlets making it one of the 10 largest outlet centers in the world. Lenox had its re-grand opening including the renovation of the exterior and The Fashion Caf\u00e9s and the addition of several new restaurants including True Foods, redevelopment expansions, are ongoing at 32 properties across all of our three platforms in the U.S., Asia, and Mexico, which will continue to expand and enhance some of our most productive properties.", "As a reminder, construction is ongoing in some of our most productive properties including Del Amo, Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center, and St. Johns Town Center. We also started construction on a significant mall redevelopment at Fashion Center at Pentagon City, which will add 50,000 square feet of small shop space including restaurants.", "And as you\u2019ve seen recently, we\u2019ve started the construction of the expansion of Chicago Premium Outlets, which will add 260,000 square feet, as well as a Shisui Premium Outlet in Japan that will add a 130,000 square feet. So put it altogether as we said, it\u2019s over $1 billion through 2016. And it\u2019s affecting some of the most productive assets, not only in this country but in the world.", "Now, capital markets, just briefly we did amend and extend our $4 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility with a June 2019 final maturity at LIBOR plus 80 basis points which is a tighter spread in our industry. We as planned, we retain $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WP assets prior to the spin.", "We also announced a dividend of a $1.30 per share for this quarter, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. We will pay at least at SPG $5.15 per common share at SPG and we revised our guidance that we issued May 29, 2014 to a $1 \u2013 to $9.01 to $9.11 from a range of $8.96 to a $9.06 which raises both the top and bottom range by $0.05.", "Just to turn to management, Andy is here, will be our next CFO. Steve Yalof will join as CEO of our premium outlet business. Andy has been instrumental building the strength of our industry leading balance sheet, will maintain that focus. And Steve is a well respected retail real-estate executive who enhances our team and brings a unique perspective with his diverse retail background. I look forward to working closely with both of them.", "So, sum it up, great first-half of the year and we\u2019re absolutely focused on enhancing the value of our real estate which is being executed on daily, producing the results that we\u2019re hoping for. Questions?", "Liz Zale", "Operator, (inaudible) for questions, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing Citi. Please proceed.", "Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. You seem increasingly talking about potential densification of some of your assets in the possibility of adding non-retail components, if it makes sense. I think, partly you just talked about you also have a 230 unit residential project at Southdale Center ongoing. Probably, it\u2019s sort of fairly intuitive, but can you talk about your views on why it makes sense to add residential to a center like Southdale, what other traditional suburban regional malls of yours \u2013 you considering adding residential components?", "David Simon", "Well. I mean, primarily because there\u2019s demand and we do like the interplay between high-quality residential with our high-quality retail offerings. And it\u2019s an opportunity to continue to add value to the company. So Southdale we\u2019ve had \u2013 and we\u2019ve had very good success in places like Firewheel and Domain, to name a few. We\u2019ve got both the hotel and residential going on at Phipps.", "We\u2019re in discussions with a well known developer in Lenox and then obviously the big mamma is in Copley which all in \u2013 our intention, purposes for that is to start construction within nine months, which will be a landmark for the Back Bay of Boston. We\u2019re very comfortable with demand, the quality of what we\u2019re going to build will have \u2013 we think we\u2019ll be terrific and it\u2019s got the kind of IRR for us to take that risk and then we think it will add to the value of that retail.", "So it\u2019s not going to overwhelm us, but it\u2019s part of our strategy to continue to make our shopping centers the place to be, both from shopping, entertainment, leisure, eating, and then eventually living and spending time on, with respect to the hotel business.", "Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "And then in terms of the larger projects that you have in the mall pipe with meaningful small shop expansion, David, you mentioned Del Amo, Pentagon City, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, Houston Galleria, as you think about adding additional small shop space to your better malls, what\u2019s the composition of new stores that you are putting in these expansions that you didn\u2019t sort of didn\u2019t previously have room for at the mall where you are seeing new demand, so how much is restaurants versus fast fashion versus luxury versus traditional mall retailers?", "David Simon", "The simple answer really depends on where we are adding the space? What that centre lacks? What the demand is? But I would simply say, Christy, it\u2019s all of the above. In Pentagon, to take a simple example, in that case, it\u2019s really restaurants, because it\u2019s out in the exterior of the centre. If you\u2019ve been there, the porte cochere is kind of, really Humpty Dumpty, it\u2019s really terrible frankly. And, we think given its location and the ability to, if you\u2019ve been to Atlanta recently, you\u2019ve seen what we did with Lenox just opening up the centers creating a sense of, this is where you ought to enter, it\u2019s great for the restaurants and we\u2019ve seen a lot of synergy there.", "So in that case, it\u2019s \u2013 and there will be a little bit of fast fashion there as well, because of the customer base. But in Del Amo it\u2019s upgrading the mix and bringing in not the super-luxury but bring up the kind of the better retailers more aspirational brands, because we think that\u2019s what\u2019s missing. So, it depends a little bit on everything. In Galleria, the demand for luxury is immense, so having the abilities to take some of the existing retailers, moving towards the Saks existing store, which will be the new added small shop space will allow us to continue to upgrade, the true luxury players in kind of the Neiman Marcus wing.", "So, again, it\u2019s a little bit of everything and it really, really depends on where and what the demand is.", "Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Thanks, David.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector, representing Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Now that Washington Prime has been spun out, I guess, David, can you talk to us a little bit more about your main goals, what you\u2019re going to be focusing on for the next 6 to 18 months, is it really the redevs and the branding effort?", "David Simon", "Well, we do everything here, Jeff, and that\u2019s why our FFO increased, and again, we didn\u2019t do it by smoke and mirrors by high leverage. But our FFO increased from 2010 to 2014 just for the quarter $320 million, you don\u2019t do that by a little bit of this and a little bit of that, you do it by everything. So, I mean, at this point, we are going to continue to do everything.", "We are going to redevelop, we are going to release. We don\u2019t have industry comp leading numbers, quarter-after-after, year-after-year, we don\u2019t outperform over the last 12 years, over a decade, continuing beating First Call consensus estimates, year-after-year-after-year, not several years, but over a decade without being able to do just about everything.", "And so, we are going to continue to do just about everything. And I don\u2019t want to limit by redev or that, I mean, if you have a good idea, I will take advantage of it, tell me what I should do? But obviously I mentioned and I want to underline it, what we\u2019ve got going on at some of our big mama\u2019s, and I\u2019ve used that twice. Liz just frowned on me. But what we\u2019ve got going on at the field and the Galleria and Del Amo, I mean it\u2019s pretty, pretty big stuff. So that\u2019s hugely important, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added some people to help us manage that, but we\u2019ll continue to do everything we can to drive this business forward.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just one follow-up before Craig has a question. Is it too soon to talk about the \u2013 any response or feedback on the Simon branding effort?", "David Simon", "Well, I can tell you that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the complements we have received have been fantastic. And I think from a retail point of view, the retailers that think of themselves as brands, it\u2019s been very, very positive. And at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t think of your company as a brand going forward, you\u2019re going to miss out on opportunities.", "So \u2013 but \u2013 this is a going to be \u2013 this not a \u2013 it\u2019s an evolution, we\u2019ll try to revolutionize parts of it, but it\u2019s going to continue to be something that we will reinforce with the consumer day-in and day-out, and our people in the field will reinforce it as well. But we are in early days on it, Jeff, but we are very excited about the prospects of continuing to upgrade the quality of our presentations and the quality of our service levels to our properties, and that\u2019s very important to today\u2019s world.", "Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I think Craig had one question.", "David Simon", "Okay.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I just wondered, it\u2019s high, if we could get to some comments on your involvement with digital and then possibly to live [ph] of the extent of your involvement in Holiday-14 [ph] if you\u2019re adding malls or markets?", "David Simon", "Well, we are focused on making strategic VC-like investments in opportunities that we think will add value to our company in both from \u2013 helping our retailers, as well as helping our consumers. So as you know, we hired somebody, Skyler Fernandez, he has been here for three months, we\u2019ve made some investments. And Deliv, we will be bringing to Woodfield, it\u2019s \u2013 we are part of that group. We are not leading that group, which is fine. We don\u2019t have to lead everything we do, though I like leading everything we do, but sometimes we don\u2019t lead. And it\u2019s one of many things that we will continue to experiment with and we\u2019ll see where it goes. We\u2019ve got some expertise now. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we are looking around corners for opportunities, scholars, and covering a lot, we are in the deal flow. We\u2019re doing is smartly through we don\u2019t have 100 people run around, doing it, I think that way we are doing is smart, and like I said, we\u2019ve made some small investments, and we\u2019ll continue to make and then and I like the prospects of what we are trying to accomplish.", "Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, representing SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks. Could you just quickly talk about the Mills lease spreads? It seems like the $12.74 equals 47% of a percent change standpoint. Could you talk about how you are achieving that, and I guess it\u2019s not really driven by sales per square foot changes, so maybe a little more color on that.", "David Simon", "Well, therein lies, again, the \u2013 first of all, I noticed in sales don\u2019t necessarily. There \u2013 as I mentioned you in the past, the fact that sales growth does not necessarily correlate to spread growth. So and the fact is, you can see that from the results that our mills portfolio posted.", "I don\u2019t know how else I can describe that to you, but other than producing the results that we did. So that that\u2019s how I would answer that question. We\u2019ve got an under-rented under market portfolio in the mills, we are upgrading the mix and we are charging more rent, simple as that.", "Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay.

Please proceed.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Hey David, good morning.", "David Simon", "Hey.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about the outlet sector versus the malls, just in terms of how do you \u2013 how would you describe the strength of demand you\u2019re seeing for outlets today versus the strength of the demand for malls, and maybe, how is that manifesting itself in terms of pricing-power for each of those segments?", "David Simon", "I\u2019ll let Rick comment, but I\u2019d say there\u2019s no huge or material difference like \u2013 when we were coming out of the recession there clearly \u2013 there was more trepidation with respect to full price than there was the outlet. The outlets didn\u2019t see the big dip in demand. But I would say, today, it\u2019s pretty consistent. The only difference is that in the outlet sector you do have a number of the people that have not participated in it, wanting to.", "But, I would say the demand is not all that much different at all and it\u2019s \u2013 and the gap between the demand given that there\u2019s been no new supply and the regional mall business is basically on top of each other. Rick, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to it.", "Rick Sokolov", "I just want to emphasize David\u2019s point in the outlets, there just happens to be a number of the mall tenants that frankly back when we got into this sector we started talking to them about the outlet as a desirable channel for their business. And now they\u2019re experiencing that and they\u2019re experiencing great result so a company like Express is now rapidly expanding.", "And the only other thing in the outlet is that the center sections for the most part are a little smaller and the spaces are smaller, so even with the same amount of demand the supply is more constrained and that gives you a little bit more pricing power.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Second question, David, if we look at Washington Prime, I\u2019m curious, the stock is around $19, little under today, where did you think the stock was going to be when you decided to do the spend?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think the advice that we got was right in that range. And I\u2019m not here to talk about WP. WP will be providing that update in the next few weeks about what they\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s right on. This is a \u2013 we\u2019ve been a public company for 20-some-odd-years. It takes time for companies to develop what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019m very pleased with WP from a director point of view and as a shareholder.", "It\u2019s very early days, it\u2019s been trading for what, six weeks, maybe, six weeks, so it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s right where we think it\u2019s going to be and I think they\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities. But they are much better equipped and frankly from a \u2013 just from a fiduciary point of view it\u2019s better that they do it than I do it. But, no great surprises on that whatsoever.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "David Simon", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb representing Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Hey, how are you? David, two questions here, the first, we\u2019ll go back to the branding question. You\u2019re definitely a numbers guy and advertising tends to be sort of a softer metric as far as being able to gauge. How are you gauging the effectiveness on a dollars and cents basis?", "And have you \u2013 in order to fund this are you cutting back other advertising that you used to do or in total this represents an entirely new effort as far as, I mean, presumably you\u2019re advertising it for local level, so just sort of curious have you pulled back from that and focused more nationally or is this incremental too?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think that the \u2013 I mean, your comment about numbers reminds me \u2013 a lot of people said, I\u2019m not a real estate guy yet. I go back to this quarter-over-quarter, then somebody figured out how to grow the business $320 million. That\u2019s not for the year, that\u2019s just for the quarter-over-quarter. So, look, the fact is, we did reallocate spend, took it away from outdoor, put it more toward digital and TV, less from radio.", "I mean, we did that kind of stuff that we tweak every year where we\u2019re getting \u2013 we\u2019re getting that. So the answer \u2013 and there is a little bit of extra cost associated with the stuff that we\u2019ve done but it\u2019s going to be a test to measure business. But ultimately it\u2019s going to be managed within our typical budget every year that we do for marketing spend. But by having branded and in consistency across the portfolio you do get economies of scale, so we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of it.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "So is there a way that you\u2019re measuring the spend or is it just something that you assume as long as you\u2019re getting positive feedback from tenants and customers?", "David Simon", "I think \u2013 you certainly have that ability. I think the initial phase is more what\u2019s the feedback but as we get \u2013 as this progresses we are going to measure our results.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Okay. And the second question is your releasing spreads have been accelerating. Can you just give some color whether either by mall or outlet, or if this is more new tenants coming in or this is just part \u2013 or if this is more driven by remerchandising tenants moving guys from the 50, down to moving new guys to the 50-yard one.", "David Simon", "Well, you know I\u2019ll let Rick and Steve, if he wants to chime in. I would just point out to you that we are under-market rented that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to grow our comp NOI every quarter, where our occupancy cost for better or worse, if you want to focus on that, and you know how I feel on some of these numbers, is low, is very low, look at it and compare to our peer group.", "So it\u2019s low that allows us to increase our rents at the same time doing in a way that our retailers can continue to be profitable in our portfolio, which is important.", "So, that\u2019s \u2013 but it\u2019s continuing to upgrade and it\u2019s marking leases to market and that\u2019s what it is. Rick, you want to add anything?", "Rick Sokolov", "The one thing I would again reemphasizing David has talked about, we keep talking about our re-development program. I don\u2019t think people appreciate how much better our properties are getting as places where retailers want to do business. We\u2019ve talked in the past how there are number of new entrants that want more square footage. It\u2019s a supply and demand business and as our properties are getting more desirable we have more demand, limited supply, we\u2019re able to drive rents.", "Steve Sterrett", "Alex, this is Steve. I just add one comment, because you asked about the differences between new leases and releasing and interestingly enough we have the ability to parse the data and look at it and componentize it. And the spread is pretty much on top of each other, whether it\u2019s a new lease or a release. So, which I think echoes David\u2019s comment about the portfolio is just under market and whether it\u2019s the existing tenant and us reaching an agreement with them to stay in the space or whether it\u2019s remarketing it to another tenant. We\u2019re getting market rent for that space now.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Okay. Listen, thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.

It\u2019s that, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 to build on an earlier question, looking longer than 18 months out, on top of honing the portfolio and maybe executing on the pipeline, do you think there\u2019s a role or a need for something larger to be done in real estate or perhaps even assisting brands of omni-channel retailing?", "David Simon", "Maybe I\u2019m \u2013 that\u2019s I didn\u2019t \u2013 can you reinstate your question, I think I missed it, I didn\u2019t miss the \u2013 I missed it. Can you just, sorry, Jeff, can you?", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "No, no, problem at all. I was curious if on top of your, I guess the blocking and tackling on the portfolio, if you feel if there is a need or a role for Simon to do something larger in real estate or perhaps assisting brands of omni-channel retailing in the next few years.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think, we are always trying to assist the retailers, while at the same time grow our business, so there is this natural tension between the two of us. But yes, I think, we\u2019ve got to continue to upgrade the portfolio and drive traffic, if that\u2019s your question, yes. So, yes, we have a \u2013 we certainly have a responsibility to retailers to make our environments as productive and as exciting as possible. That\u2019s the biggest focus we have. Rick, I think, we feel like we have that obligation, we have it to the consumer too.", "So, I mean, that\u2019s what \u2013 I mean, the amount that we\u2019ve done within the portfolio just upgrading little stuff from restrooms to play areas to seating areas to exterior improvements to doing the \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve done a hell of a lot over the last several years. Right \u2013 we were able to shutdown when the world was ending and start back up, we were able to shutdown better than anybody else. We were able to startup better than anybody else. And all of that\u2019s proven, because all of that\u2019s in our numbers.", "So, we had \u2013 we \u2013 forget \u2013 I hate losing WP because it\u2019s \u2013 now I got \u2013 I lost $1 dollar FFO. But we would have been a $10, roughly, right? You are going to do the calculation \u2013 excuse me, if I\u2019m rounding here and there. But \u2013 so everybody is going to do the calculation, what does that mean, what does mean? But we were going to be $10 per share, $6 in dividends, where were we in 2006 and 2007? Where was everybody else? So those are big numbers.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "Well, I guess, that\u2019s the \u2013 I guess the root of my question is I think you\u2019ve certainly done well in strengthening the balance sheet, and you spun off Washington Prime and there is a big pipeline today.", "David Simon", "Yes.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "And I guess I\u2019m wondering if, going forward, you see more of your capital allocation going to things outside of malls and outlets and maybe into other areas.", "David Simon", "No, we are going to always stick to retail real estate. And we will densify here and there. But and we think we can do that appropriately not get over our skis, but no, we are going to always be a retail real estate company, that won\u2019t change.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "And then I guess for Rick, just a few questions, did you guys see much of a sales impact in outlets in Japan, just because they did a big increase in their VAT tax in the second quarter, did you see anything there?", "David Simon", "Well, let me \u2013 that really should go here as opposed to Rick\u2026", "Rick Sokolov", "I don\u2019t leave the domestic chores.", "David Simon", "But the fact of matter is, actually I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because the answer is no, believe it or not. There was a little bit of a spike ahead of that and our Japanese partner is actually coming at \u2013 the weather here is bad, so I assume they\u2019ll still get in \u2013 but they are actually coming here for the next couple of days. But it\u2019s actually surprisingly held its own, I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but the answer \u2013 the simple answer is no. it\u2019s actually done very, very well even with the increase in that.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "And I think this one is for Rick, because he and I were exchanging phone calls. Could you talk about the replacement you have lined up for the Nordstrom space at Florida Mall, and a maybe a little bit why Nordstrom opted to leave that market, and does that foreshadow anything for that property?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, the property is frankly growing extraordinarily well. And in fact, right now we are in the process of adding a new flagship Zara, American girl. We are adding a completely new food hall with other restaurants. And I\u2019ll let Nordstrom\u2019s statement speak for itself, but we are very excited about our replacement strategy for that box. And, in fact, there will probably be announcements forthcoming in the very near future that will show you what we have in mind there and we believe it\u2019s going to be a substantially positive addition to the property.", "David Simon", "Yes, it\u2019s absolutely, unequivocally not a reflection of the mall at all. So let me make that clear, the mall does a $1000 a foot\u2026", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "Yes.", "David Simon", "And it\u2019s gown its NOI every year and so it\u2019s a great mall, no issues.", "Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "", "Thanks, guys.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste representing Morgan Stanley.

Understanding your views, David, on sales per square foot, I was just curious though on your thoughts on\u2026", "David Simon", "Let me just stop there. What \u2013 my \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the \u2013 again, I\u2019m not trying to tell you that it\u2019s not unimportant. Question is whether we should obsess over it or not. And what I \u2013 and what I\u2019m trying to explain to the market, I obsess over my revenues. I obsess over my comp NOI. I don\u2019t obsess over what the retailers do in my properties unless I\u2019m doing a bad job than I obsess over it.", "So what happens in our industry is, retailers, they get hot, they have great sales, they don\u2019t \u2013 it changes, we\u2019ve got to develop the right mix, sometimes that\u2019s our fault, sometimes it\u2019s the retailers fault. The important thing is where we \u2013 where is our leases vis-\u00e0-vis market? What\u2019s the demand, and can we increase our cash flow? That\u2019s what I obsess over.", "So I\u2019d never had a headline saying sales are up when they are my tenant sales, because I \u2013 my headline is what are my sales up? And, in fact, I think this quarter up 9%, right, roughly looking at my team, they are shaking their head. So that\u2019s what I obsess over, that\u2019s the difference that I\u2019m trying to communicate. And as you know, other retail reach in this \u2013 in the universe of 30 of us, more than half of them don\u2019t even report what their tenant sales are. So, we are just trying to say, yes, I hear you, it\u2019s interesting, but it\u2019s not what\u2019s going to drive our ability to increase our cash flow, because remember, we can take the space back.", "Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley", "Got you, got you, and I understand. I appreciate your views and then again, we understand why you think, what you think. But I\u2019m just curious on your thoughts on potentially creating a new category of sales productivity reporting to perhaps capture the larger in-line tenants, the H&M, the Uniqlo, that pay you rent more like in-line tenants but who\u2019s results are not included are not included in your reported core numbers, especially given how well they\u2019ve been fairing lately.", "David Simon", "Well, look, we track total sales and I think year-to-date we include everything that we don\u2019t get, everybody doesn\u2019t report.

Rick, what\u2019s our total numbers up?", "Rick Sokolov", "It\u2019s almost 3.5%.", "David Simon", "3.5%, so, that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right, if \u2013 now, I\u2019m not going to do that on a per foot basis because it includes department stores but it does show you what\u2019s going on with market share of our property.

Thank you.", "David Simon", "Yeah, no worries.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Tayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Yes, good morning, everyone. Just along the lines of just the retailer outlook, I was wondering, if you could just get some sense from you, how you\u2019re feeling about things like mall traffic and just the kind of general sense of what the mall feels like today and also in July?", "David Simon", "Well, look, the fact is the consumer generally is still very cautious and we see that across the board. There is no denying that, from \u2013 as you know, a number of retailers, both low and medium and even high-end, are all seeing somewhat of a cautious consumer. And that\u2019s certainly is affecting retail sales in our properties. So that continues to be the case. We have our work cut out for us, with respect to that issue. We think it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shift issue going from. We\u2019ve done a lot of research here.", "We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shift from the \u2013 to online from physical. It\u2019s really more of an indicator that the consumer right now is pretty cautious. So \u2013 and I think a lot of that is just all the macro stuff that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve seen it before. We certainly have some retailers that have their issues which will put \u2013 puts focus on us to release their space. But again, I mean, those things ebb and flow, but we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us with regard to just kind of a consumer that\u2019s cautious right now.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "So would you have it to guess that mall traffic is down slightly or down low double-digit or anything of that sort?", "David Simon", "Well, it\u2019s not down double-digits, okay. I don\u2019t know where you get that data either. Now, it\u2019s not \u2013 I would say mall traffic is generally flat, the summer months are not big until late July and August because they\u2019re back to school. June is not an important month. Early part of July is not. So we\u2019ll see what happens.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "All right, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more from me on the outlet side of the business, during ICSC there was a general commentary coming out of the company about some additional developments that could be done in 2015, 2016, like half-a-dozen potential locations that were mentioned. Just wondering if there was any update on that?", "David Simon", "Yeah, we do it, you mean from our company?", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Yes, correct.", "David Simon", "Yeah, yeah, we do intend to \u2013 as you know, as I mentioned in remarks we\u2019re starting Gloucester which is August 7, okay. That groundbreaking that open, basically a year from August, and we do have one other of that we will hope to start this year and then we still have three or four that are in the pipe for next year.", "So, yeah, nothing has really changed on that and again I won\u2019t bore the callers on my comments but we\u2019re being very selective in where we want to go and where demand is. And we are \u2013 let\u2019s \u2013 not that we\u2019re always going to bet a thousand, meaning we may pass up an opportunity that turns out good or may build one that\u2019s not great, but those \u2013 the two options that can happen.", "But generally, I would say we\u2019re experts at understanding where the manufacturers and where the retailers that matter want to build the next outlet, okay. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to bet a thousand but it\u2019s going to be pretty damn close.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Sounds good to me. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger, but clients just keep asking about sales, so I have to shoot a couple in. You mentioned earlier that the re-devs were impacting sales, which kind of makes sense because you\u2019re going to have lower sales as it\u2019s going on. Do you have any idea of what the quantity of that was?", "David Simon", "Well, we go property by property but the fact that matter is, look, sales were \u2013 I will just say this, we added more space so when you look at the $612 to $608 that\u2019s the primary issue there. And also we added some centers that are not quite up to the core average yet. And, and but that, that\u2019s nothing new and out of the ordinary. It does take time for centers to, to develop their trade area and everything else. So, in the movement, because I don\u2019t want to call it the decrease because it really didn\u2019t decrease, the movement from $612 to $608 was really a function of adding additional space.", "And as I mentioned to you the comp sales were actually up 90 basis points which would ignore that impact. We give you total sales, but the comp sales were up 90 basis points and the total sales, just volume-wise not on a per square foot basis was up 3.3%, and that as much as I really want to talk about sales.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I know and I \u2013 and by the way nobody is going to report 5.6% NOI growth of amongst your peer group.", "David Simon", "Nobody, right?", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But this is what I do for a living so the 90 was actually trailing 12 months, not just the second quarter?", "David Simon", "It was Q-over-Q.", "Rick Sokolov", "Yeah, second quarter.", "Liz Zale", "Second quarter.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Second quarter over second quarter true comp, okay. And then let me ask you a sales question that actually does matter.", "David Simon", "Yes.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s part of the Washington Prime spend. You spent some time thinking about what the growth could be on a multi-year basis because let\u2019s face it, if sales really are flat or they are even negative for three years or five years, that actually does matter. And maybe if you could share a multi-year view I think it would be really helpful to the market.", "David Simon", "Well, I mean, you see where our \u2013 I mean, I guess, the simple is just look at where our rent \u2013 our expiring rents are versus what we\u2019re bringing in new rents at today\u2019s sales level and if your \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re focused on you can see that embedded growth is pretty significant.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Well, that\u2019s not \u2013 that easy, right, just even if sales stays flat you can say where it\u2019s going to go. But do you have any thought of where sales are going to go. Any thoughts on looking at the last 12 months, not being representative of what were you really think that the tenants can drive their sales going forward in the next two or three years.", "David Simon", "Look, I\u2019m not going to give you a number, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. But, I do think that the consumer has been cautious and for all sorts of reasons. The sense on the macro side is that \u2013 and part of that was a move toward durable stuff, but the fact that matter is, I do think there is a law here and I don\u2019t view it as a long term role. I do think, the economy sounds, feels like it\u2019s getting better and with that the consumer will move forward.", "But as I said, you have \u2013 the GDP of last quarter it was down 3%. I had nothing to do with that. I did my fair share, I built, I redeveloped, I hired people, I gave raises, I did everything I can to juice the economy, so don\u2019t look at me. Okay?", "Now we\u2019ll see where we feel good about our business.", "Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, sir.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan representing MLV, please proceed.", "Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.", "Hi, good morning.", "David Simon", "How you\u2019re doing?", "Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.", "Good, thanks. On occupancy, so you \u2013 I mean, you are getting up to pretty high numbers already. And based on your typical seasonality and another 100 basis points higher at year-end or more, I mean, do you think you are at the frictional maximum? I mean, it\u2019s a little harder for you guys because the outlets have always run higher to comp you against the rest of the peer group. But if you just think of the malls, is this where we\u2019ll end this year? I mean, do you think there\u2019s much more upside? Is it good to push for that upside or to leave some kind of frictional wiggle room?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I\u2019m always of the view, make the deal, lease the space. But look, I think Paul at the end of the day there\u2019s going to be a little volatility in through it, because there are some \u2013 we have a little bit more bankruptcies this year than we did the last couple.", "So, we\u2019re \u2013 when you get the space back you don\u2019t have it immediately leased, it takes time. So there\u2019s going to be some of that volatility, but I think we\u2019ll maintain that kind of level of occupancy, give or take a little bit here and there.", "Rick Sokolov", "The only other point I would make Paul is that we spend a great deal of time asset managing our space to get the highest yield we can out of that space in terms of rent and sales production. So much of our discussions with our tenants are getting them right-sized which in a lot of instances is decreasing the amount of space they\u2019re in so we can create additional rooms out of the same square footage which drives our sales and drives our rent.", "So there is a lot of levers still left that we can pull to generate productivity even at these higher occupancy rates.", "Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.", "Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so my other question just on development. You got about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, your share in your shop listed for activity that\u2019s under construction. And so that\u2019s basically over the next two years, I guess. And what should we think in terms of annual completions based on kind of what\u2019s in your pipeline for starts over the next 12 months? I mean, is that number going to stay about the same? Do you have some big projects that are going to come in?", "David Simon", "Yeah, I mean, I think the best way to do it is we think on average we\u2019re going to as we said, spend about a $1 billion plus a year so. It will spike in that but if you\u2019d \u2013 and that\u2019s just more or less domestic. But we\u2019ve got \u2013 that might spike when we put Copley in and couple of others. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 there is lumpiness to it, because some of the stuff that we\u2019re finally doing is big stuff, the fields of the world [ph], Del Amo, so you\u2019re going to have some spiky.", "But on average, when you look back on 2016, 2017 it\u2019s going to be a $1.2 billion or so per average, more or less.", "Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.", "And do you think that 8% mall redevelopment yield is going to be consistent even when you add some of those kind of bigger projects?", "David Simon", "Yeah, look, the answer is yes, because we also have new development in there that will be at higher yields than that, so when you put it altogether it\u2019s a pretty good number that we feel good about.", "Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "David Simon", "No worries.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yeah, hi, following up on the last question, if you go out past 2016 and think about the next three years, five years or so, does it seem like you can maintain that roughly $1 billion a year spend based on what you think is in the shadow pipeline at this point?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s so hard to really tell you one way or another. I don\u2019t know, mean, the simple answer is I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think it certainly could extend a couple of years. But we have a very disciplined philosophy about adding because \u2013 an over improvement of center, because at the end of the day you know what \u2013 you know if I go back to this $320 million, you know what drives our earnings is that we think about return on equity better than lot of folks and that\u2019s what drives the business.", "So if you over improve stuff and you don\u2019t get the right return on equity you kind of get \u2013 you\u2019ve kind of done it and that\u2019s great and the architects can pat themselves on the back, but the question is where is the cash flow. So, I don\u2019t know, I mean I think we\u2019re so focused on the handful of big things that we have that\u2019s the key. But Copley is four, five \u2013 unfortunately because I\u2019d rather have it much quicker but that\u2019s a four or five year project.", "So I think the simple answer is that, yeah, that $1 billion to $1.2 billion stretches from 2016 goes to 2017 and 2018 and then after that it\u2019s hard to really tell you one way or another.", "Rick Sokolov", "The only thing I would add to this, are we looking for other opportunities within the portfolio? Absolutely. Do we have a number of things that we hopefully believe we can do to create incremental opportunities? We do, but it\u2019s going to be approached with the same discipline and the same rigor of analysis, so we don\u2019t do something that\u2019s stupid.", "David Simon", "Yeah, and we\u2019re actually not in the \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of new development, not outlets that we\u2019re thinking about. We\u2019re close to one deal and Liz brought Oyster Bay, so we\u2019ve got two deals, thank you. Two deals that are out there to do new development that will not be outlets that aren\u2019t in. So, economy gets better, stronger, maybe there is a little bit more new development going on.", "So, it\u2019s a tough question to really give you any comfort and other than \u2013 the philosophy, return on equity is what\u2019s really going to drive us. So if we \u2013 we won\u2019t waiver from that.", "Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan", "Got it. Okay.

Please proceed.", "Jeremy Roane \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Good morning and thank you for taking our question. And we noticed that tenant reimbursements as a percentage of operating expenses were higher than in the previous quarters before the spin-off of Washington Prime. Is the current quarter a good run rate for tenant reimbursements going forward? And also what led to the increase in home and regional office costs?", "Steve Sterrett", "Jeremy, this is Steve Sterrett. Couple of things, because the income statement has been reclassified and the Washington Prime assets are all in, discontinued operations, I do think the P&L for the quarter reflects a good run rate for the existing Simon portfolio. So I would say that\u2019s fine.", "The one caveat, David mentioned it earlier, is we did spend incremental dollar in the second quarter related to the role out of our branding campaign and that lumpiness won\u2019t occur quite the same way in the future.", "David Simon", "Home and \u2013 I\u2019ll just \u2013 yeah, you want to answer that?", "Steve Sterrett", "Yeah, I\u2019ll go ahead, the home office and regional costs, the variance both year-over-year and sequentially with the first quarter is all one-time stuff. Some of it is related to the Washington Prime transaction, where we vested some equity and recorded the costs for people who are now Washington Prime employees. Some of it was incentive compensation, some bonuses that were paid for mid-level people here in the organization who worked very hard on the Washington Prime transaction. And\u2026", "David Simon", "No, but no, executive...", "Steve Sterrett", "No, and that\u2019s why I used the term mid-level.

Please proceed.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Thanks. Sorry, if I missed this, but did you update your same store NOI guidance excluding Washington Prime? I\u2019m just curious if you think growth can accelerate during the second-half of the year.", "Richard Sokolov", "Ben, the one thing that we did back when we announced Washington Prime, we told you that it would accelerate our same-store NOI by 30 bps, but that\u2019s the extent of the update, we have not given a forecast for comp NOI for the rest of the year.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners", "But if your prior guidance was 4% and now it\u2019s 4.3%, should we assume that growth will decelerate during the second half of 2014?", "Richard Sokolov", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that, no, because we are a little bit ahead of our plan year-to-date.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, got it. And then maybe switching gears, can you talk about why you guys didn\u2019t consolidate your ownership of St. John\u2019s Town Center when your partner was looking to sell? And if it was price which I believe it was a 4% cap rate, was there an opportunity or consideration to maybe selling your stake along with your partner for that asset?", "David Simon", "Well, the answer is primarily the reason we didn\u2019t buy was primarily price, just to cut to the chase, even though we think it\u2019s a great asset long-term. Why would we sell? I mean, it\u2019s a great asset. We built it. We leased it. We managed it. We are adding Nordstrom. We don\u2019t need the capital, that\u2019s the business we\u2019re in, in owning real estate. So why would I sell a mall that\u2019s that \u2013 we are the managing partner. We run it day-to-day. We had a partner in it, so it was no harm, no foul. I didn\u2019t say any real, we don\u2019t need the capital and see any reason to sell it.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Got it. That makes sense. If it was a 4% cap rate for what I believe is a 700 per square foot mall, is that a good comp for trophy assets, or I believe there is some near-term lease roles that could be potentially pushing that cap rate lower. And if that is the good comp, do you think that have any, do you have any thoughts on what that means for the value of your stock?", "David Simon", "Well, let me just \u2013 you\u2019ve put a lot in there. I don\u2019t want to tell you what, I\u2019m not going to sit here and say to you that what the cap rate was. We don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s a private transaction. So it is what it is. Reason we didn\u2019t buy it, we owned it, we controlled it, we didn\u2019t see that, with all the capital that we are putting back in a portfolio, it wasn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in \u2013 we didn\u2019t see that, the real need to do it from our standpoint.", "From a going forward, I mean, look, if you look at the value in the private markets and what\u2019s being paid and look at where our stock is trading. And I think you could certainly make the argument that the private market is certainly more expensive than public stocks. And assuming we don\u2019t decrete from value, but create value, you ought to get a little, maybe $0.20 a share for that. So but Ben, I mean, I would say to you clearly that the private market value clearly is more expensive than the public market value, when you put it altogether. But that ebbs and flows.", "Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Got it, thank you.

Please proceed.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hey, guys, good morning. On occupancy costs, you guys give that in the supplemental at 11.6%.

And I\u2019m curious what would that number be, you think for new and renewal leases you put in place today?", "Richard Sokolov", "It\u2019s going to, look, our leasing trend right now is continuing unabated. And David pointed out, if you look, we are signing new leases at $66. We\u2019ve got expiring leases at $41. It\u2019s going to be around, you are talking about the spread?", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes. I\u2019m thinking, Rick, the actual occupancy costs numbers. So that new rent that you are getting at $60 plus as a percent of sales.", "Richard Sokolov", "Overall, for the body of work we are doing, that is going to basically be right around the same number and maybe moving up a touch based on the\u2026", "David Simon", "I think what Rich is asking is, when we look at new deals, what is our occupancy cost? I would say it\u2019s probably in the 14% to 15% range. And that range, but again, it\u2019s all over the board. But again, if you look at our peer group, we\u2019ve got very low occupancy cost and the ability to drive that, we will continue to drive our comp NOI in a stable economy.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right. I got you, David. Yes, that\u2019s a significant number. I appreciate that. Then the other thing is, you didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on your European investments on the call here.", "David Simon", "Yes, we did that deliberately, not that we don\u2019t love, okay, and not that they are not doing well. We are just \u2013 we are trying to make our remarks shorter and shorter, so\u2026", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "No, I hear you, I hear you. I\u2019m curious how you see that that actually going at this point, if there is a \u2013 how the relationship, I guess is progressing. And then also I\u2019m a little curious, is there anything coming back this way, so are you finding new tenants, are you finding any changes in organizational thoughts, anything like that that comes in the other direction?", "David Simon", "Well, I mean, just to name two great retailers that are from Europe coming here, Primark and Topshop. And just to name, forget H&M and Zara, who have been here. But those relationships are certainly enhanced by our presence in internationally. But Rich, I would say simply this. We are betting 1,000 in Europe and in international. So everything, and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s Kl\u00e9pierre is \u2013 it\u2019s great. The McArthurGlen deal is going to be very good. We think we got in at a very good value and there is growth opportunities. And the outlets business in Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, thank you, Steve, is good, it\u2019s all good.", "So we just figured, I mean, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re trying to shorter the presentation up, and Liz wrote it, and I took it out. Don\u2019t read anything into it, okay.", "Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I got you. On that, on Europe, is it sort of steady as we go at this point, you think, or will there be possibly new announcements coming out of the European venture?", "David Simon", "I\u2019m open to any ideas anybody has, okay. No, but I, look, I think McArthurGlen\u2019s development pipeline is very active, but as you know that take time. And Kl\u00e9pierre, where we get strategic guidance and all that stuff, but they\u2019ve got a good pipeline to in terms of extensions and the like.

And understanding that you have achieved strong rent growth in those quarters, just wondering though that given those occupancy rates is so much higher than typical for those quarters, is that a situation where you may have pushed even harder on those rents, or do you feel that you have struck a pretty good balance between occupancy and rental rate growth?", "David Simon", "Well, I think we are, look, it\u2019s an art, not a science. I think we are pretty good at it. And I think historically, philosophically, we\u2019ve always here on making a deal. So, we are not as \u2013 I\u2019m sure people complain on the other side sometimes. But so I think we are always trying to lease our properties up. I do think, if you are looking historically, you\u2019ve probably got a big compositional change in the portfolio, I mean, depending on how far out you are looking, that\u2019s occurred over the last decade.", "So that\u2019s what maybe causing that to some extent. So, I would \u2013 that\u2019s probably the biggest issue.

But with the free cash flow funding most of the development and the redevelopment pipeline, do you see much in the way of dispositions for the remainder of 2014? And I guess just generally do you have the regional mall portfolio kind of where you wanted after the spin-off or is there some \u2013 still work to do there?", "David Simon", "I would say there is always going to be assets that we\u2019re going to prune and sell. Frankly, it hasn\u2019t been a huge focus given the spin-off. We spent most of our effort of any free time on that. So I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll think about for 2014, 2015. I\u2019m still depressed that I lost $1 of FFO, so I got to get over that. I hate losing cash flow like that.", "So, I\u2019ve got to come to grips with that, but yeah, we\u2019ll continue to sell, but probably nothing that\u2019s \u2013 the rest of this year of any material nature.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great.

One thing that we haven\u2019t talked about is that you have about $7.5 billion of debt coming due within the next 2.5 years at like 5.5%, so 30% of your debt, a big chunk of that being unsecured bonds, a bunch of that secured debt on balance sheet, and a bunch in the JVs.", "I guess how aggressive can you be to pull any of that forward without paying huge charges or make holes to bring that cash flow because, David, I know you love cash flow, to bring that cash flow forward?", "Steve Sterrett", "Did your liability management people prompt you to ask that question? Are you allowed to talk to them?", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "There\u2019s a big Chinese wall.", "Steve Sterrett", "Okay. Just checking. Well, Michael, I mean, it\u2019s fair and I do think if you look at the expiration, the debt maturity schedule, one of the things you see is that the next couple of years out, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to continue to roll down rates. It is something that we look out on a regular basis. But listen, it\u2019s essentially trading dollars, because there are make holes or yield maintenances in virtually every debt instrument that we have.", "So, but there are other ways that you can potentially hedge your bets a bit, whether it\u2019s going out and doing treasury locks or whatever. So we do look at it. And we are as aggressive as we can be. Andy would tell you that we pay every debt instruments that is open to par date and we\u2019re managing that as aggressive as we can.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Understanding that there is a curve aspect of this, but what is your sort of contemplate as you think about the next 2.5 years in this debt rolling? Where you sort of want to move that in your schedule? Because obviously it\u2019s like 100 basis points is over $0.20 a share, right? And clearly where you are on a 10-year basis today, you would be at probably 3% to 3.3%. So how should we think about how you want to roll that debt? Are you going to \u2013 what is that average term, 5 years, 7, 10, 15\u2026? I\u2019m just trying to get a\u2026", "David Simon", "The simple answer to it will be \u2013 it will be across the spectrum.", "Rick Sokolov", "But I would also say Michael, one of the things that we focus on a lot is the asset liability match and ours is primarily a 10-year lease business. So 10-year debt is primarily the sweet-spot of where we\u2019re going to do most of our financing. But I\u2019d also tell you, go back and look at our weighted average cost-to-debt over the last four years, it\u2019s come down 15 basis points, 20 basis points a year. That opportunity is certainly still out there for the next couple of years, the markets are in really good shape right now.", "And I would also tell you that one of the reasons that you\u2019re hesitant to do a large liability management trade is that the forward curve tends to overestimate where rates end up about 90% of the time. And David mentioned in his remarks the fragility of the consumer in the economy. It\u2019s hard to envision a scenario in the near-term where rates are going to run crazy, because I don\u2019t think the economy would continue to grow in a substantial rising credit environment.", "David Simon", "I \u2013 Michael and I will just say this. One of the things that\u2019s interesting, our floating-rate debt percentage is absolutely well below our peer group. It is 7%, if that, 5%, somewhere in that range. So we\u2019re really not juicing our FFO by playing the floating-rate debt game.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Well, your debt also is materially lower as a percentage of your enterprise value. So it\u2019s even a lower percentage. And you are sitting on $2 billion of cash.", "David Simon", "Yes. So what do you want me to do?", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "And you\u2019ve got $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So what are you going to do?", "David Simon", "I don\u2019t know.", "Richard Sokolov", "I don\u2019t know.", "David Simon", "Come talk to me, I\u2019m lonely.", "Richard Sokolov", "We saw that Apple has still got $120 billion of cash, so we\u2019ve some \u2013 we\u2019ve got ways to go.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "So question, David, on Kl\u00e9pierre, BNP had to pay the U.S. government $9 billion fine. They are still sitting with a big stake in Kl\u00e9pierre and I\u2019m just curious, whether you as Simon, you as Kl\u00e9pierre, or you in conjunction with the third-party investor have gone to them and sort of said, hey, look, you are sitting here with $1.5 billion in this company, we can provide you some liquidity to pay your fine.", "David Simon", "Look, they\u2019ve been a terrific partner with us. We have a very good relationship. They\u2019ve been very helpful on our involvement with Kl\u00e9pierre. So, beyond that I can\u2019t really say, Michael, anything more than that, other than they have been a pleasure to work with. And we \u2013 I have no \u2013 absolutely no indication at all that it\u2019s been a good investment for them, they like the investment, other than that, I can\u2019t really say one thing or another on that front.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Should we expect status quo out of your ownership, I mean, how should we \u2013 I mean, it was clearly a good investment, where Europe has recovered. You are able to manage through their sales process and focus them, simonize them a little bit.", "David Simon", "Well, I do want to learn French. I think right now that\u2019s status quo, so\u2026", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "You\u2019ve got to learn French to go up to Quebec.", "David Simon", "That\u2019s true. That\u2019s a different kind of French. Look, I think, just from that company, and they really are better off to speak for themselves. But they have done a great job turning around, they are starting to get mojo on the property level. The balance sheet is in good shape. So, the focus for them clearly will be on external activity going forward. And I\u2019m there to help them in any way I can or and \u2013 but that\u2019s the focus. Things are going well there, and they\u2019ve done a good job.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Okay. And just a clarification on the 3.3% total sales number you threw out, that\u2019s a quarter-over-quarter or trailing 12 number?", "David Simon", "Trailing 12.", "Liz Zale", "Yes.", "David Simon", "Trailing 12.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "Do you have that number of what it was quarter-over-quarter, by any chance, total sales?", "David Simon", "We could, but I don\u2019t have it\u2026", "Richard Sokolov", "Don\u2019t have it in front of me\u2026", "David Simon", "We have it, but call Liz. She will give it to you.", "Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.", "All right. Thanks, bye.", "David Simon", "You bet.", "Liz Zale", "Thanks.", "Operator", "With no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "All right. Thank you for your interest and your questions and have a good rest of the summer.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Ward, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Thomas Ward", "Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Tom Ward, Vice President, Investor Relations. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer; Andy Juster, current Treasurer and incoming Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.", "Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. Also due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off in the second quarter, we are providing operating statistics in our supplemental 8-K for the prior year period to show performance on a comparable basis excluding the Washington Prime properties. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon", "Okay, thanks. Good morning. We had a productive quarter. We opened 2 new Premium Outlets in Charlotte and the Twin Cities, and in Minnesota nearly 100% leased. They're both off to a great start. We successfully tendered and redeemed approximately $1.6 billion of notes. And we currently issued $1.3 billion of new notes, which extended our average duration and reduced our weighted average interest cost. And we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial paper program. We agreed to buy 2 high quality assets from the recently announced WP Glimcher deal with great growth opportunities. And most important, we continue to produce strong and operating and financial performance, both industry-leading.", "Now let me talk about the results. FFO reported was $1.90 per share. For those of you who updated your estimates to include the $0.35 per share charge related to our tender offers and redemption, the $1.90 exceeded the consensus by $0.05 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the charge related to the debt distinguishment in the third quarter and the operating results from the WP properties in the prior year period, FFO diluted per share increased 14.2% year-over-year to $2.25, from $1.97 or $0.28 in total. And on the same basis, it's been increased 14.5% year-over-year to $6.48 from $5.66.", "Overall business conditions remain favorable driving increases in our key operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for space across the portfolio. Occupancy increased across the portfolio. Leasing activity is healthy. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.67, an increase of 17% comp. NOI increased 5.3% in the third quarter, 5.4% year-to-date, again industry-leading. And over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation.", "Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.8% in the third quarter compared to last year, and increased 2.6% for the trailing 12 months even with major redevelopment occurring at several of our Premier properties. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets and their locations and the ability to once again continue to execute new development.", "As I mentioned, Charlotte and Twin Cities, both opened July 31 and August 14, respectively. Premium Outlets in Montr\u00e9al will open in October 30. We expect that to be another great deal, very similar to what we built in Toronto, which is doing well, doing great. Construction continues on new Premium Outlet developments in Vancouver, and in Southern New Jersey's Gloucester Township, where the center will serve the Greater Philly area, both high-quality major markets. In Canada, a year from now, we will have centers in 3 of the best markets Toronto, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver. And we started construction just recently on 2 new Premium Outlets in 2 great markets, Tucson and Tampa, and both scheduled to open in October of '15. And we'll continue to focus our outlet projects in major and selective markets, where we know there's a clear demand from the retailers that matter and provide solid returns to our shareholders.", "Redevelopment, just quickly. We opened a residential complex [indiscernible] We also opened Nordstrom and additional square footage at St. Johns Town Center and a new Bloomingdale's at Stanford Shopping Center. We also announced plans for the addition of luxury residence and an AC Hotel by Marriott to Phipps Plaza to open in -- both open early 2016 and construction for the residence will commence tomorrow.", "Additions to these mixed use will make our great real estate even better, and continue to make our centers the places to be from shopping, to dining, to living. Redevelopment expansions. Projects are ongoing at 31 properties across all 3 of our platforms in the U.S., Asia and Mexico, which expand and has enhanced some of the most productive properties.", "We started construction on 2 expansions, one at Livermore Premium Outlets in the Bay Area, that will add 185,000 square feet and is expected to open in August of 2015 and an expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass, expected to open December 2015 that will bring 56,000 of high-end luxury retailers to this productive mill center.", "And as a reminder, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive mall properties, including but not limited to, Roosevelt Fields, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center and our Premium Outlets, including Woodbury, Las Vegas North and Chicago. When you put it all together, we have a total committed spend of $2.2 billion over the next 3 years all committed to, and all under way.", "Now turning to acquisitions. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, concurrent with the closing of the Glimcher acquisition by WPG. We're excited to add these 2 great properties to our portfolio, when the deal closes in early 2015. We're also pleased with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. And as their largest shareholder, we're excited for them and their proposed transaction to acquire Corio. Both of these transactions will be accretive to SPG's earnings. And again, demonstrate our industry-leading creativity to find unique opportunities.", "Capital Markets, again, very busy. I told you about the $1.3 billion notes. And we retired average duration of 1.7 that were at interest rates of 5.6%. We also redeemed another $250 million of notes at 7.875% coupon rate. Concurrently, we issued $1.3 billion of notes with an average duration of 16 years and an average coupon of 3.6.4%. This takes our senior notes from 6.3 duration to 7.6 duration and lowers our average interest rate from 4.64% to 4.4%.", "In addition, as I mentioned, we are the first U.S. REIT to establish a global unsecured commercial paper program. We received an A1/P1 rating from S&P and Moody's, respectively. The program has $500 million. We can issue CP in dollars and euros. And in fact, we already have. So we placed $100 million of U.S. CP, which we are borrowing at LIBOR plus 0 to 2 basis points. And our euro LIBOR, we also placed EUR 100 million at a Euro-LIBOR rate of 0 to 7 basis points. That compares to our revolving credit of 80 basis points above LIBOR.", "We announced our dividend of $1.30 an increase of 8%, including the November dividend, we will pay to Simon shareholders $5.15 in '14, which is an increase of 10.8% compared to, what, 2013, and does not include the dividend that if you've maintained your WP investment which is, essentially, on a share adjusted basis of $0.50 per share. We expect to raise our dividend again, of course, subject to board approval in the first quarter of 2015.", "Guidance. We raised our guidance to a range of $8.84 to $8.88 per share. The midpoint of this raised range is an increase of $0.15, from our prior guidance, after given effect of the charge related to the debt extinguishment.", "Now, let me take a deep breath, because obviously there's a lot going on. I wanted to just give you a real brief update on management team. When we announced Steve Sterrett's retirement early this year, we also said that we would source both internal and external candidates for the CFO job and that Steve would remain the CFO through 2014. We then announced our current [ph] Treasurer, Andy, would become our new CFO. Since Andy's announcement, Andy, Steve and the rest of our financial service team who, by the way, have on average of 20 years of experience with SPG, have paved the way for a smooth transition. And since that transition is now complete, effective in December, Andy will become our CFO and Brian McDade, now our Assistant Treasurer will become our Treasurer. Steve, will be available to us as needed for specific tasks.", "So summing it up, we had a great third quarter. We expect a strong year end. And of course we're very focused on continuing to enhance the value of our properties. And we're open for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Michael is on the line with me as well. David, just to follow up on your comments around opening outlets centers in major markets. In buying a center like Jersey Gardens, in what type of markets do you think indoor outlet type of concept could work? And can you also provide you, mostly thoughts around the growing number of outlet centers and stores opening [indiscernible] what that means for [indiscernible] the outlook versus the overall in terms of future obsolescence?", "David E. Simon", "Well, Jersey Gardens is, we consider it more of a Mills as opposed to an outlet center. It was essentially modeled after The Mills. So it appeals to broad consumer base, but it's got the entertainment, it's got the big boxes. It does have a smattering of pure outlet retailers. But I wouldn't -- Christie, I wouldn't consider that an outlet center, so to speak. You're -- unfortunately, we did have a not such a good connection on your question. But I think you mentioned about the potential about outlets coming closer to major metropolitan marketplaces, is that -- was that the question?", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. Yes, and what that means for obsolescence, future obsolescence of existing outlets?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, outlet business is very competitive. We have a good portfolio. Our results speak for themselves and I think we'll continue to be able to grow our comp NOI and our portfolio. I think in all of retail real estate, you can never stand still. You've got to invest in the products. You've got to make it better. Whether its outlets, full-priced, lifestyle, et cetera, that's what we're all about. That's what we're grounded in. Our -- we focus on lease-by-lease, market-by-market, deal-by-deal and we'll -- we live in a very competitive market. We'll continue to hopefully do well.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. There's an echo I guess, when we're asking the question. I don't know if that's partially why you may have cranking.", "David E. Simon", "Sorry about that. We'll check in to see if we can change that by the time the call is done.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No worries. So I also have a question on global. Obviously -- you have Kl\u00e9pierre 2.5 years ago, you went into -- you're leveraging Kl\u00e9pierre now effectively to buy Corio and consolidate in Europe. You've McArthurGlen that you've made an investment in. You obviously have the outlet business that you're growing internationally. All the Australian journalists think that they've spotted your plane in Australia which you denied. We just had a doubt there. And then, just I'm curious, how much time are you spending U.S. versus non-U.S.? As you think about the growth of Simon, how important is that international aspect going to be?", "David E. Simon", "You mean me, personally?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes. From -- as strategic growth initiatives. How much time are you spending outside the U.S. versus inside U.S.?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, generally, roughly our outlet business represents 10% of our -- from Asia to Europe to McArthurGlen. So let's say it's around 10%.", "Ross L. Smotrich - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "International.", "David E. Simon", "I'm sorry, our international business. And honestly, other than -- where you had the episodic nature of deals, I would tell you that I work very hard and don't feel sorry for me okay? But, so I would say to you that generally, other than episodes of deal making, I spend around the same amount of time. But we have a great team in our international. I have added a colleague that you probably haven't met that's done an unbelievable job to relieve the [indiscernible]. But I wouldn't say it's abnormally different than what the international business represents in terms of our investment. At the end of the day, we haven't made a huge -- the good news is we're in the money and everything that we've done. But when you put it in the scheme of our roughly $90 billion asset base, we haven't made this huge unbelievable bet internationally. And I spend roughly 10% of my time.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. And I was thinking more. So into the future whether that's changed at all and we see that percentage go up in well [ph] quarter of the company or 30% or 40% of the company.", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think the -- given that what we're doing in the U.S., it's not -- that's probably not likely in any short- or medium-term horizon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the development and redevelopments. This seems like -- with the supplements for this quarter that released, the yield on expected development and redevelopments came down slightly for the mall redevelopments [indiscernible]", "David E. Simon", "I'm glad you're very perceptive. And I'm glad you asked the question. So King of Prussia is now a go-deal, it's a big deal. And it did drop our redevelopment yield a little bit because it's -- I know you grow accustomed to Simon having 10% returns on every deal we do, sometimes a little lower. But it's still very accretive when you look at where that property is valued today. But we don't hand out or give out returns. So that -- but that, it is a major development, redevelopment, I should say, and that did lower the return. On the outlets side, I'd say 2 things: we've taken out Charlotte and Minneapolis; we've added Tucson and Tampa. Charlotte and Minneapolis were very high double digits. Tucson and Charlotte -- I'm sorry, Tucson and Tampa are on average 11. The others were higher than that. So when you bring that 2 together, it dropped it a touch. Now I will say to this, we're very conservative on our new development, both Tucson and Tampa are double digits. But the way they're coming in and the other 2 that are coming out, dropped it, oh, so small.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's really more of a mix...", "David E. Simon", "Let me be perfectly clear. We have no execution issue. We have no cost overrun. It's just the mix, changed by the addition of the plaza, the King of Plaza, and then the 2 outlets opened and the 2 new ones coming in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV.", "Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division", "The re-leasing spreads is also just fixed on a bid . I mean, I know there's some noise. But you've kind of been in an upward trend and it is a rolling 12. So I just wanted to maybe get any comments on spreads, your outlook for them, whether the changes and -- whether the sales volatility has had any impact? And that's the question.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, it wasn't that long ago, say, less than a year ago where the spreads we're 14%, 15%. So I will just tell you, from our standpoint we are pleased with basically having 9, 9.5-plus-dollar spread. And 17% -- I mean, I wouldn't -- we have to look at this a little bit on a longer-term basis. So I would say, we're very pleased with 17. It's higher than it was a year ago. Yes, it this a little bit lower than the Q1 and Q2. I certainly wouldn't overreact on that on any basis. The re-leasing spreads are driving our industry-leading 5.4% year-to-date comp NOI growth. And we're -- we are executing this in a clearly, a cautious consumer oriented environment. And obviously last year, the consumer shut down a little bit because of weather, this, that and the other things. So I'm pleased, I'm happy. And I think we're executing very well. We're going through our -- in terms of how we look at that next year, very simple, as you know, we've been doing this 20 years. We had the pleasure of starting November 10, I believe, going through each and every mall, lease-by-lease, deal-by-deal, which rolls into our plan which we'll share with you in early next year. And so until that's done, I don't have a prediction about what our spreads will be other than we continue to believe we're -- our rollovers are under market [indiscernible] in the future growth of our business industry-leading opportunities, in my opinion has been reinforced by year-after-year-after-year of continual unabated outperformance.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing that I would also add is that our occupancy cost remains very moderate, which shows you that we still have plenty of room to grow those rents.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes. Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add one thing. If you look at our 8-K, over the last 8 quarters we've consistently signed new leases between $63 and $67 a foot, and if you look at our lease expiration schedule you can see that they're still in the mid-40s for the next several years. So we still feel very good about marketing the expiring leases to market.", "Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I know you haven't giving guidance, but that kind of high teens number is -- there's no reason to think that that's not sustainable it's not maybe potential upside.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, we -- we're -- I know you're, Paul you're smart and you want us to talk about next year. We have tremendous confidence in our business and our platform and the thing that I would have you rely on is what we've done year-after-year. And as I said to you, we'll share our guidance early next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm also here with Craig, who will have a question after me. My question was just focused on Sears' decision to lease space to Primark. Also, Amazon's announcement to open a store in New York City, we've been getting a lot of incoming calls, questions on those announcements, and what that could mean. If you could just provide some thoughts on those announcements and maybe where you think things continue with Sears in their leasing efforts?", "David E. Simon", "Well let me -- I'll have -- I'll give you 2 quick top of the head remarks and then I'll let Rick add whatever he wants. Look, on Amazon, leasing space, I'm not -- it's, all the details aren't out, but there's clearly a benefit for the overused word, omnichannel bricks and clicks, however you want to describe it, there's a real benefit. In fact, it's very interesting when I see Sears as a online retailer, depending on which study you look at. I mean, they're anywhere from -- they're clearly in the top 10. They may be as high as #5. And I would argue it's because of their physical presence that allows them to be so important in the online presence. And you've heard it from retailers that the synergy between having the physical and the online presence and now the move toward mobile, and how its all been integrated. So -- and clearly, we've seen a number of pure online retailers going to physical stores. So the -- it's got to be in the equation for a retailer to have a physical presence. I don't think there's any question in that. And as our retailers have gotten more sophisticated in the online world, I think that's going to play to our benefit. On the Sears leasing, we have one that we've consented to in King of Prussia. That was part of their agreement to consent to our ability to expand the 2 centers. We worked very collectively to do that. I think Sears would be the first to tell you that in certain markets and certain stores they don't underperform, or in fact they have too much space. And they will look to release some of that space or sell some of the real estate. We still think they have a physical presence that's going to be important to them. And we'll continue to work with them on a collaborative basis that meets our needs, and our shoppers' needs and theirs. And we expect to, at the end of the day, for both of us to benefit from that.", "Richard S. Sokolov", "And what I would add is that focusing on the Primark side, they're a highly productive iconic retailer in Europe and the U.K. We have been working with them for over 6 months. We have already visited them at their headquarters and toured their stores, where they operate. And we're very excited about their entry into the U.S. We anticipate that there will hopefully be several other opportunities, both within our portfolio or others Sears stores, which they have already alluded too. And I would also point out that we got involved with Primark early on as our Kl\u00e9pierre team already had a preexisting relationship with them.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Craig has one question.", "David E. Simon", "We've all concluded that we are all just [indiscernible] so we just want to go on record for that. Alright?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "Us too.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. I was just going to ask what were some of the take aways from your shopping block events? And just maybe some general thoughts on the millennials in the malls.", "David E. Simon", "Well, look I think, they're an important customer base. I think they represent a unique opportunity for us. The millennials represent a bigger population than the baby boomers. So it's very important for us to connect with them, the way they want to be connected. I think they like mall shopping. And we're going to experiment and do lots of things oriented around them to continue to make them an important consumer base, in our properties. But we're not going to ignore the baby boomers either because they have a lot to spend. So I think as millennials get older and we can continue to offer them entertainment, restaurant and the right retailers in that -- in the properties, and connect with them the way they want to be connected, it's a great opportunity for us. Rick, do you want to add anything?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "The only thing I would say to echo David's point, the research that we've done has shown that the millennials are, in fact, very supportive of the mall channel and are very much focused on going on there. And so it's a natural thing for us to try and exploit and enhance.", "Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was also noticing, you used 2 outlets to do the initial rollout, with Refinery29. How did those go?", "David E. Simon", "Very well. So that relationship is early, but I'd say generally we're very pleased. We're creating buzz in that whole marketplace. And are -- along those lines, Craig, we're making some initial investments in early-stage companies to really to enhance the environment. But, I think, all the good news is that there is a lot that we can do to enhance our environments and we are as committed as anyone to do that. We've got the balance sheet, the capital the -- hopefully, the creativity and the willingness to take risk to do that which all companies, I think, need to be in this position to do. It would be easy for us to rest on our industry-leading growth. But as you know us very well, that is not in our DNA. And so, we're going to do it from marketing, to leasing, to development and everywhere in between.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Caitlin Burrows. Retailers have been open about the needs for a physical presence to showcase, even though much of their sales are generated online. Can you talk about how you capture the economic value of a store that doesn't necessarily run through that store's cash register?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, there's -- it's -- that's -- in our leases, even if it's done in the store but fulfilled online that's part of our sales. That's not really too much of an issue. And I think for all physical retailers the important -- and even with their online business, they have a multiplier effect, that's very important, that they see when they have a physical presence with their online consumers. And they can describe it in great detail on it. And it's anywhere from 3x to 4x. So the convergence is there. It's happening. And the good news is our retailers are combating effectively the pure online retailer. And the online retailer understands for them to, beyond the first mover advantage that someone like Amazon had, in order for them to really grow their business, I think and many, many believe, they need to have a physical presence because of the way it's moved to mobile and the way it's -- the multiplier effect that the omnichannel world is presenting itself in. So that bears, I think, extremely well for us in creating the next wave of retailers. We don't -- we see that just beginning. So, the -- the interesting thing is, the online retailers have still got this unbelievable advantage and we see it ourselves in [indiscernible]Nexus. And giving that benefit, even though they should be collecting that used tax instead of sales tax, but taking advantage of that benefit that the consumer's not necessarily are entitled to. As that has begun to swing, because a lot of them have Nexus now with warehouses and the like. As that has balanced, that's going to level the playing field, obviously, it would be great. We can get Congress to level that playing field which they should be doing, that I think that's going to reinforce the advantages of bricks and mortar. Because at the end of the day, when you're looking to shop, the mobile device or even the desktop really can't present the goods and services that are available with that retailer that a physical environment can. Yes, they can save you the sales or use tax, yes, they may have an advantage in convenience, which is slowly being dealt with by our retailers through pickup-in-store, ship from store, but once that's sales tax, use tax advantage is eliminated, which I think it will be through Nexus for the government, we'll see that. I think our retailers can be really damn competitive.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just on the topic of equal playing field. So Amazon now charges sales tax in 23 states. And what else is remaining to be on topic of tax parity? Is there anything that you guys are doing?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're trying. But there are roadblocks in Congress and we're not here to complain about the government, believe me. But we just want a level complaint -- level playing field and then the consumer is going to make that choice, but they shouldn't be -- they -- and we should let the states decide how they want to deal with it, but it should be level. And at the end of the day, the best retailer, the best mall operator will come out ahead. I think it's got to be level, it's just not right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So a couple of quick questions. First, about going back to the Sears topic. If Sears decides to lease their space -- sublease their space on their own, do you guys generally have veto power or do other anchors at the center have veto power and is there any chance that you can partake on the upside assuming they granted us prior money anything upside [indiscernible].", "David E. Simon", "Well, there's 2 questions there. We certainly have substantial ability to control what Sears can do with their stores based on existing leases or reciprocal easement agreements, so that is, yes. With respect to the upside, to the extent the transaction is being done by Sears within their store, with their capital, it's their transaction, but we certainly benefit in a position like where you're adding a Primark in or a Dick's in King of Prussia, that certainly will strengthen our overall offering for our shoppers, but not financially if it's being done inside the Sears store with Sears capital.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Do other anchors have a stake?", "David E. Simon", "It depends on the documents and depends on the scope of what Sears is contemplating with their building.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just last question for me. On Kl\u00e9pierre, if I understand the deal correctly, it's going to be a full stock deal, between Kl\u00e9pierre and Koreo [ph] which would in effect dilute your equity stake from the 29% roughly to sub-20%. And I'm sure you'll let me know if I got this wrong. Any thoughts on re-upping your equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre?", "David E. Simon", "Well, you don't have it wrong, but I'm not going to answer that question. We like the investment. It's been a very good investment for us. We think as a reference shareholder and as -- and being on the board, we've added real value and we are in a -- obviously, we do believe in the merger or acquisition of Koreo [ph], and we support it and we believe that scale in our business is really important because it -- on all sorts of fronts, capital, retailer relationships, ability to invest in the consumer experience, et cetera. So we're optimistic that, that investment will continue to be good for us and grow in value. But I really can't tell you about whether or not, going forward, we'll increase our stake. But we're pleased and we think there is still opportunity going forward with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I mean, the reason I asked is it seems [indiscernible].", "David E. Simon", "I understand.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "[indiscernible]", "David E. Simon", "And I hope you understand why I couldn't answer it.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "No, I got that. It just seems like a nice area where we could put maybe $1.5 billion of additional capital at a very attractive -- well roughly a cost capital for a very attractive yield. So that's why I asked.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. It was in the yield on our investment in Europe in both at Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen and in Asia they have been fantastic. I mean, they've been yields so -- and that's what helped drive our industry-leading growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Steve, congrats on the even earlier retirement. So a question on Japan, I mean, I try to channel my inner David Harris. If we read the headlines correctly, retail sales in Japan have been impacted because of the increase in sales tax and yet your productivity over there is actually up year-over-year. So is it just a nuance of when the tax hit or is there a difference going on from what the newspapers are reporting versus what's going on at your outlets?", "David E. Simon", "Well, I think our outlets are just so uniquely positioned and with the increase in VAT -- there, clearly, you have some forward spending and then it did have an initial monthly impact, but then it's kind of leveled back. I just think the consumer there is going to look for even more value given the higher VAT rates. So we just have a unique portfolio that will continue to perform, but it's affected retail sales generally, but it's really good to be in the value space there with great product and a great retailer line up. But don't kid yourself. I mean, when you increase your VAT, you're going to affect consumption. We're just a little bit better positioned to deal with it than some other property types.", "Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then as far as the Sears transaction goes, did the fact that Ed [ph] is going direct with retailers, does this sort of indicate that basically the gap is too wide versus what he thinks his boxes are worth and what the mall landlords think it's worth and therefore, he's just going direct or do you think that we will see some more trades? Because it would seem like the value of his boxes is maximized if you guys can get control of it and do what you want to do with it versus him doing something with it?", "David E. Simon", "Well, look, I keep -- look, there is a long -- we've had a, let's see, 50-some-odd year relationship with Sears through a lot of ups and downs and good times and so on. We expect to continue to have a excellent relationship. I don't think any thing is off the table, buying, selling, leasing, subleasing, working cooperatively, nothing's off the table there. Again, I think the market wants to take one scenario, extrapolate it, I appreciate that. Just like they want to take one Amazon space. It's in fact, they're doing it and extrapolate it. I don't think you're going to extrapolate anything like that. And we will -- they were -- on the Primark of King of Prussia given where they are situated in the mall and what they had already done with the one level which we cooperated, and we felt like Primark would be a very good replacement where they're situated plus we needed their cooperation. What we are trying to accomplish and it happened to be that we were absolutely aligned and that set of circumstances, and we think we created a win-win. Now I would expect given the 55-year history that we'll continue to find those kind of situations with Sears in most cases.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to just follow up on the Primark situation. We understand in Europe and London, there are kind of primarily 35,000-foot boxes. And I think the initial 7 they're taking much larger footprint. So I know you haven't announced direct deals with them, but do you anticipate or would you envision sort of more Sears sublease space? Or do you actually think you could do direct deals with them? And would you envision them kind of being an in-line tenant if [indiscernible]?", "David E. Simon", "No, and obviously I won't. It'll depend upon the set of circumstances. And just because the King of Prussia is one deal that we consented to doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be the model on all the others. So Steve, like I said, it's going to be a case-by-case scenario. I would be -- if their model is a success here, which certainly by every indication of the presence they have in Europe, you would potentially anticipate, but others have come here and have not done as well, but let's -- if it is, then I think it'll be a combination of all the above where there will be some consent with Sears on subleases, we'll lease directly. We'll redevelop pads and the like. It's all going to depend upon the set of circumstances that present itself from that property.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, part of your first answer got cut off. So I apologize if I didn't hear the whole thing. Just in terms of kind of the type of tenent they are, the price points, do you envision that they could sort of fit into a large part of the portfolio? Or do you see them in different kind of segments within the portfolio?", "David E. Simon", "Well, they're certainly not a luxury. So our higher-end properties probably not a great fit, but I'm going to wait and see and see how what their store looks like in the U.S., how they're -- what kind of consumer they're delivering and we'll go from there. In that King of Prussia was relatively a simple decision for us because of where that Sears box is and I think again, it's going to be dependent upon the circumstances. And I hope you can hear [ph]. I guess we're having serious problems with our communication, but I hope you can hear it, Steve.", "Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "No, I did. And just last question. In terms of kind of the home delivery [ph] how was that sort of progressed with mall lease in general? Are there changes you're making for this upcoming holiday season and just kind of what's been early I guess maybe coming up on one year? How do you think that system and service were working?", "David E. Simon", "Well, the lift is one of -- just one of our efforts along those lines. I think, we're pleased as a group. They've signed up a couple of major, major retailers. And they're starting to do shipping this holiday season. And I do think, over time, there clearly is going to be the ability to deliver or pick up a lot of mall goods at the mall environment. And I think we're, as an industry and individually, we're just scratching the surface there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremy [indiscernible] from EBS Security.", "Unknown Analyst", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one, it looks like you sold an asset this quarter and recorded a close to $80 million gain, just any color on that sale?", "David E. Simon", "No, just a couple of assets that didn't fit the portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "David, I wanted to get updated read from you on the upcoming holiday season. You like some of your peers noted last quarter that consumers are in a bit of a cautious state. How would you assess that mood today? And in conjunction with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this year's back-to-school shopping season materialize your expectations. And what you read on the consumer pulse today and your expectation for the approaching holiday season.", "David E. Simon", "Simplistically, consumer, I believe, is -- continues to be somewhat cautious. The good news is, there's an environment, where I think, at some point in the near future, they will be less cautious, lower oil or lower gas prices, better job environment. Hopefully, wage growth, continuation of lower interest rates, just some of those out there. But they're still cautious. And that's how we're planning, so we're running our business. I don't like -- I am not equipped to make a forecast on the holiday season. Others might, I will not. There's lots of forecasters out there on the holiday season. The ones that I see are generally feel like it's going to be a [indiscernible] last year. Weather, hopefully, won't replicate itself the way it was, longer season, to name a couple, but I don't -- I'm not in that business.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Care to share any comments on this year's back-to-school shopping season?", "David E. Simon", "The -- I think it was generally spotty. I mean, I think, it was certainly wasn't robust, and I think it still represented the cautious consumer.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And just one or two things here. First, at the recent Jersey Gardens and UPV acquisitions will hit the same store in 1Q '16. And then any color on the lease termination fees? I was wondering if there are any other nonrecurring items in the quarter beyond because it looks like $0.02 of our lease termination fees and the debt prepayment charges.", "David E. Simon", "Typically, on Jersey Gardens, they wouldn't be in our comp NOI for '16, that's correct. And, look, listen. We've got -- given it's complicated, we are a big company. So we're always going to have other income that could be higher or lower quarter-to-quarter, same thing on the expense side. The -- but as far as I can -- having examined the financials, extremely closely, nothing jumps out at me. Lease income, lease settlement income, probably in the scheme of the total years. It's not all that different than some other previous years. It does ebb and flow. We've always got a little bit of extra income here and an extra expense, year in and year out given the nature of our business. But nothing to highlight frankly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I've question about, I guess, I call the value proposition of SPG Asset Management. If you were to benchmark the in-place rents to the 2 malls that you are buying from Glenshire [ph] to similar malls that you already own. What do you think the delta is at revenue or NOI per square foot that you could realize under your management? It there a way to estimate or quantify that for us?", "David E. Simon", "Well, a very good question, Jeff. I would say to you generally, we don't buy any asset if we don't feel like we can improve it. And there's -- so that's kind of a thing that we have regardless of what we do, whether it's new development, redevelopment or importantly, acquisitions. What can we do to beat the growth rate that may exist. If that asset is -- just sits there unowed [ph], but the fact of matter is, I'm not going to give you a number on that. I mean, I -- people are, again, not to put this in context, but Sawgrass is a unique animal, but when we took it over, I remember the numbers more or less correctly. It was around $55 million of NOI. And next year, we did add a little bit of space here and there and stuff but next year, generally, I think it's going to do around 130-ish. Now we haven't gone lease-by-lease. There we might skip lease-by-lease because it could take us 3 days. But I think the fact that we were able to do that, not only helps our investors, but also helps the consumers and the retailers because I think they did a lot more business with it in our hands. So we invested more in it, we drove the tourism. We've got better retailers. We've got more consumers. The retailers did more business and everybody was copacetic even though Mills have done a good job at $55 million or whatever the rough number was. So, we think, we can drive more traffic to Jersey Gardens though I firmly believe Glenshire [ph] has done a great job with that asset. So that we're experts in tourism. It's right by Newark Airport. I think we can figure out how to get a few more buses from Newark to go to Jersey before they go to -- Rick and I will flag them ourselves if we have to make the numbers work.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe, Steve, that could be your next career move. Actually, a follow up also, David, as it relates to the products you're looking at Copley Place in Boston there's a lot residential product in the pipeline in Boston for sale, as well as for rent. Does that give you any pause with proceeding on that project? Or are you sort of passed the point of no return? Or are you not as concerned about it?", "David E. Simon", "Well, we're always focused on supply. We are not passed the point of no return. And we're still working on approval rights, both within the appropriate agencies in Boston, but also, we have to work through some of the retailer issues. So we are not at the point of no return and we studied the supply [indiscernible] similarly. And it's going to be a gut check decision here, I would say, Jeff, in the next 3 or 4 months. Generally, we still feel very, very confident about it, but that the -- this is a little bit different than what we've done historically, as you might imagine. We are really good experts on supply, understanding supply and retail, what's going to get done, what's going to have an impact in competitive world, very competitive world in retail. This one is a little bit different. We hired a couple of great experts to do comp lease. And we've got the in-house expertise. We also obviously hired the right people in Boston to help us go through that exercise, but it's a good question. It's going to be a gut check time, but we have not passed the point of no return. And, as you know, in real estate, whether it's office, retail, whatever, there's always announcements of some supply. The real question is what gets built and who gets there first and who's got staying power. I will tell you this, it's an iconic asset, it's only getting better. The design is fantastic. Boston is a great long-term city and that Lord I hope -- we have staying power. So we've got a lot of stuff on our side of the equation that gives us confidence that if we do pull the trigger, we will execute.", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And maybe just a last question for Rick. I know you touched on spreads and on sympathetic to looking at it over long-term. But someone had asked earlier about the pullback in the dollar spread and that came back a little bit slightly this quarter. Is that just a function of mix maybe in the quarter? Or was there any kind of pushback from retailers in light of the softer retail sales?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "There really has been no pushback from the retailers in terms of their demand. And it's basically a function of mix. What yields come in, in a given period of time. So we're still seeing a very focused retailer, the one space. And candidly, you can look at that with our occupancy and with all that activity that we have going on in the portfolio.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. And let me -- because, again, this is a good question, it's a good focus, but let me -- let you -- I want you to understand how we think about the business. If we owned 1 property, we could absolutely maximize rent to the last penny because at the end of the day, that's all we would care about. Jeff, we believe in repeat business with our retailers. So we're always calibrating -- and we don't -- we're not perfect at this. Believe me, we make mistakes all the time. But we're always trying to calibrate the win-win, all right? How do you keep the retailer who is our -- is our customer in addition to the consumer happy? How do we reach our financial goals? But we are not getting the last dollar because we do multiple deals, multiple business with them, year-after-year, day-after-day. And so we're never going to maximize rents if we just owned 1 asset. And -- so I -- you just need to have that lens on. Yes, even with that lens on, we still out produce everybody else, but we're not trying to get to the point of no return. We're trying to find that balance. And I'll be the first to tell you, sometimes we don't do it, sometimes we make mistakes, but we're always trying to find that balance for future positive relations with our clients going forward. Just like any other business. So let's put that in that perspective, okay? But that's why we have the opportunity to find other opportunities that even though we may not maximize the spread being $9.67, is that the right number?", "Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "David E. Simon", "It could've been $10. Maybe that $0.33 we picked up because they're going to do this and that and the other thing for us. So there's always that balance. And you've got to put it in that lens. And it's important to understand that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up to Jeff's question on Copley and I understand it's not at the point that it's finalized as you explained. But can you give us kind of a ballpark number that the project would entail in terms of total cost?", "David E. Simon", "Yes, sure. It's around -- the total cost, Jim, is around $5.50. And again, the vision that we have on the -- the top roughly 10 floors would be condo sales. We're also expanding Neimans as part of it and other retail. So we look at it gross, but then we have condo sales to net. And that differential, well it's an art, not necessarily a science, that differential and then we own the multi-family. That differential is roughly, don't hold me to these numbers, it's roughly a $300 million-ish differential. That puts it in this kind of financial consequence box. And that number, from a return, as we look at it, that return is acceptable given what we're doing there, okay? And I don't want it -- I'm not going to give you that number just yet, but when we go it'll be in our 8-K, but that's essentially how we're thinking about the deal.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a kind of follow-up question on the earlier discussion about Primark as well. I know you had mentioned Primark, ZARA, H&M on the second quarter call. And, obviously, the European retailers, they're kind of categorized as fast session apparel, I guess, Primark this more promotional. And all 3 have already have sizable market shares in Europe where they operate alongside smaller higher-priced, higher price point apparel retailers. Also, we obviously have, for every 21 UNIQLO growing aggressively here, I'm just curious, if we assume that these large-format retailers continue to grow their share of apparel sales, do you view that as a positive or a negative regarding the same property NOI growth prospects of this domestic Simon portfolio?", "Richard S. Sokolov", "It's Rick. I think that we price our real estate based on what we believe is the value of the real estate. And everyone is going to have to compete for that real estate. The bottom line is that it has taken H&M a very long time. They are now happily established and growing substantially. We're working with ZARA, but frankly, we have a lot of very established domestic retailers here that are very competitive and continuing to grow. So the more people we have are interested in our properties, the better off we are will enhance this demand and our job is to do the right tenant mix and to price the space right, and I think we've been doing pretty well so far.", "David E. Simon", "Yes, but it's a good question and its again, it's a little more art than science. You've got to weigh the traffic that they may generate versus the competitive nature they may put certain retailers under. And whether or not they're bringing a different consumer in. So you put it all together and you got to make judgment calls day in and day out. So -- but it's a good question and it's an art. You got to be very, very thoughtful about that, Jim.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Then finally for me, and I maybe asking you to repeat yourself, David, but, I think, you did cut out on this. In terms of the Primark deal at King of Prussia, you mentioned it was, I think, is an easier decision because of the specific location. Can you just clarify what you meant by that?", "David E. Simon", "Well, if you've been to the mall, they're -- in this case, the Sears box is not as well located as if it were in the middle of the mall. And our decision may have been a little bit different had it been. And it just -- so it's really a location issue. And the power of that mall is shifting in terms of kind of a focal point given our expansion is now -- we're actually under construction and it was really -- we felt good about it, and we've got Sears' cooperation on what we were trying to accomplish to improve the mall, and we did think that because of their position, Primark would be great to drive traffic down to that wing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a quick question. On last quarter, you guys talked about a couple of deals on the development side that were not outlets. I'm just curious if there's anything to update on that front.", "David E. Simon", "You mean on full price?", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right.", "David E. Simon", "Yes. We are getting closer, not quite there, but we're working diligently on 1 ground-up full-price development that, I'd say over the next short period of time, that we'll be making an announcement on. It's not quite everything is done, but we are optimistic that this will be a partnership that we're looking forward to, to working on, but it's not quite all done, handshakes in place, but stay tuned on that. We think it'll be great and it will be besides the redevelopment, it will be our first full price now in quite some time.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And do you have a rough size sort of size?", "David E. Simon", "The total investment will be north of $200 million. And we're going to be around the 50% owner.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JP Morgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm curious, if you would weight your sales based on mall NOI, how different would that number be compared to the $613 that you report?", "David E. Simon", "Great question. It would be much higher. But that's a great question because -- it's a great question and in fact, because every dollar is the same, it doesn't really -- it doesn't, obviously, doesn't do that. But the fact is we could do it, but I don't have the [indiscernible] about 10% higher.", "Stephen E. Sterrett", "Yes, 10% higher.", "David E. Simon", "10%. Steve Sterrett -- he's leaving so I wouldn't count on any numbers that he said. Steve Sterrett says its 10%, but, I think, we could probably do a little bit more work and get a better number, but is a very interesting question.", "Operator", "There are no further questions so I'll turn it back to David Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon", "Okay. Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you in the future.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to the Vice President Investor of Relations, Tom Ward.", "Tom Ward", "Thank you, Lauren. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning. We had a productive quarter we completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced even more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We identified additional avenues for growth through our two new retail partner joint ventures. And most importantly, we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance.", "Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which included a $0.22 gain on a sale of marketable securities. Excluding the investment gain, FFO per share was $2.41, which exceeded First Call consensus again by $0.06. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to a strong dollar against the Euro and Yen.", "On a comparable basis excluding the contribution from WP properties in the prior year period and again the investment gain, our FFO per diluted share increased 14.2% or over $0.30 year-over-year. Occupancy was 96.1%, leasing activity remains healthy. We recorded spreads of $10.87 an increase of 18.4%.", "Comp NOI for the quarter increase 3.6%, which was coming of a 5.6% comp increase in the second quarter of 2014 and for those of you that are interested, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI or new deals such as Jersey Gardens or our recent joint venture activity and we also do not include the impact of recently developed or expanded centers.", "And finally, we continue to produce strong comp NOI increases year after year as well as continue to operate at the highest margins in our industry. Total sales across the portfolio will increase 2.2% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis, the sales per square foot increase for the 12 months ending June 30 was 4.2%. And as a reminder our sales per square foot metric is not adjusted to remove any tenants who have vacated their spaces and includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open during the trailing 12-month period.", "Redevelopment is ongoing to 28 properties across all three platforms for total spend of $1.7 billion. We opened significant expansion activities at Las Vegas North and Shisui Premium Outlets in Japan started construction on several new and strategic projects during the quarter. Construction continues on some iconic properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets are expanding in Chicago, San Francisco and Woodbury. This is my opportunity to develop my list, as opposed to Rick's.", "Our Chicago and San Francisco outlets open \u2013 expansion open in August and the rest of those kind of expanding of those iconic centers open in the next 12 months. We also announced plans for further expansions in Sawgrass, The Mills at Jersey Gardens, La Plaza Mall, and the shops at Riverside. And we expect our redevelopment investment to be at least to $1 billion annually through 2017 substantially funded with our annual free cash flow, which will continue to contribute incremental growth in our NOI and reinforce the positions of those assets in the respective marketplaces.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to new development, construction. It continues on three new outlets all in very major markets and they are scheduled to open in the next three months. Gloucester in Southern Jersey in Philadelphia in fact opens in two weeks, August 13.", "Tampa and Tucson open in October. And finally we opened Vancouver on July 9, with traffic that exceeded expectations. Construction continued or in fact started in Columbus with our partner Tanger, and we are slated to begin construction in one new domestic premium outlet, which will be announced for year-end. We also started construction at the shops at Clearfork, our new full-price development in Fort Worth anchored by Neiman Marcus which will open in early 2017 and we are pleased to partner with Swire and the Whitman family on the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which will open in the fall of 2016.", "We own 25% of its project and will manage this center upon completion. Kl\u00e9pierre continues to progress according to plan. Their integration of Corio is proceeding well, they continue to recycle their assets and in fact announced a deal to sell a portfolio of Netherlands assets for \u20ac770 million, and which will continue to delever their company.", "We also purchased 2% of Kl\u00e9pierre from the BNP offering. We\u2019re now over 20 point \u2013 we\u2019re at 20.3%. We purchased those and the stock is obviously trading higher than where we purchase that additional 2%.", "Balance sheet activity continues strong, we did several secured financings in the quarter, continue to lower our borrowing cost, increased our debt maturity. Our liquidity is $5.5 billion. Our industry-leading balance sheet continues to get reinforced and separates us from our peer group.", "Our unencumbered cash flow is well over $2.5 billion as Andy shakes his head affirmatively. And finally on the balance sheet we, as you know, announced our $2 billion share repurchase we in fact in the quarter bought $505 million during the quarter of both common and units which is disclosed.", "Now the dividend and let\u2019s not lose side of the dividend. We have announced yet another increase sequentially at 3% through $1.55 and the year-over-year increase of 19%. We will pay at least $6 in 2015, which is an increase of at least 17% from 2014 and well above where we were in the great recession at the height of $3.60 in 2008. So finally guidance has been increased again up to $10.02 to $10.07.", "And we are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will be coming from the line of Ross Nussbaum. Your line is open.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Here with Jeremy Metz. Hey, David with the repurchase from the OP unitholders, who were the sellers of those units? Did you approach them? Did they approach you? How did that work?", "David Simon", "A little bit of both, it was associated with the prime transaction loss that we completed in 2010 and they were the sellers.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay, so no members of the Simon family sold\u2026", "David Simon", "That's correct.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. Okay, and then on the buyback as well, how should we think about it from a balance sheet perspective? If I look at your funding needs against your after-dividend free cash flow, my math is basically you can fund your entire development program with, call it $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So if you continue to buyback stock at this rate, obviously, the leverage of the company would tick higher. So how should we all think about continued buyback versus balance sheet?", "David Simon", "Well, it\u2019s a very good question. I think the first \u2013 we want that in our arsenal. We are sensitive to \u2013 it\u2019s part of our capital allocation strategy. I think you should look at this first step is a trade from one, from our other marketable securities that we had held with no reason to hold those we basically took that capital and reinvested in our business as we wanted to signal the market that we believe and the continual growth of our enterprise.", "I think it should also signal, we are out of the big deal business. So I think no ones picked that up, but we don't see any big deals on the horizon for us. So we are obviously very focused on the development, redevelopment as you know I mean I stumble I\u2019m not a very good reader of a text, but you look at our activity in the redevelopment and new development it\u2019s astronomical, it\u2019s industry-leading lots of great stuff going on and I think that's the way to look at it.", "We are price-sensitive, we wanted there. REIT stocks have been very volatile, but I think if the signal that we took one investment and reinforced that we\u2019re out of the big deal business. That's not to say we might find a deal here or there, but the balance sheet is sacrosanct to us, we haven't worked 22 years to do it, we survived the last great recession with flying colors, we quadrupled our dividend and earning per share and all the other stuff that I won\u2019t go through it all, but I think it's a more of a signal and the belief in our business and also signal the market that were out of the big deal business.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman. Your line is open.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great. Hey, David, good morning. Just continuing in terms of the buyback, you talk about your business and having confidence in your business. You didn't talk a little bit about discount to NAV and the arbitrage that exists between public and private. I take your comment exactly in terms of flipping out of Macerich that $450 million, putting it into your own stock, which I think has great prospects. But would you think about accelerating or selling interest in any assets to go further into your stock and narrow that discount that exists between public and private?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think the reason - it's more than just NAV. It\u2019s what your enterprise can do in terms of growing your earnings and cash flow, and then ultimately increasing your dividend. I mean as you know I mean, if you strip out the gain in that WPR, our quarter-over-quarter growth was 14.3% which as you know, a lot of people have criticized our size yet we continue to be industry-leading earnings growth.", "So you\u2019ve got to look at, whenever you invest in something, what's that yield going to get you? And as our earnings grows you know that\u2019s not a bad investment. So it\u2019s more than just the NAV analysis. We also - we will continue to sell what I call lower quality non-important assets to us. We don't publicize it until after it's done, but we\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio. But we\u2019re not a big believer in selling our top assets to reinforce the value of our company for external purposes I mean we know what we\u2019re worth and we operate - I mean, that\u2019s why we are in this job. We\u2019ll operate accordingly.", "But selling the top assets at the end of the day those top assets tend to grow the most. And I'd rather have our shareholders own more of it than less of it. We have the free cash flow to take advantage of the arb that may exist between private and public values, and it\u2019s just another tool that we have available to us to take advantage as we look for investment opportunities.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great. Just one quick one for Rick. The popular press wants to focus a lot on shrinking retailers and closing stores. Can you just give us an update in terms of who are the fastest-growing retailers, the most exciting retailers that you're seeing pick up stores? And maybe just break it up between a larger format and a smaller format store base.", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, thank you for the opportunity to talk about my list. I think there\u2019s four categories of retailers that we\u2019re really seeing a lot of business with. International retailers, the e-tailers that are looking for a presence in our properties. We recently just announced and have opened Blue Nile and Bauble Bar, and we\u2019re working with a number of others that want to come into the properties.", "Our existing retailers that are looking to grow through brand extension. Maybe you just saw Dick\u2019s announce the Chelsea Collective this fall. L Brands is rolling out White Barn Candle. And the last are just the new retailers that are coming online and just to - we\u2019ve done deals recently with Mont Blanc, Frye Boots, Jo Malone's, Suitsupply, [Aritskina]. All of these are really exciting concepts that are relatively unique in the number of stores, and that\u2019s going to separate our properties.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great thank you.", "David Simon", "And I would just say this, Michael, what\u2019s exciting \u2013 yes, we have had bankruptcies this year, it does take time to replace them. But the amount of new concepts and new entrepreneurs coming into our environment, whether it\u2019s restaurants, the e-commerce going to physical brand expansion is really at a \u2013 is that high and our leasing folks. If you seen what we\u2019re going to do at Roosevelt Field with some of the new food operators as well as some of the e-commerce with physical, I mean its good stuff. So I mean in that sense it\u2019s comforting to see that there is whole host of new entrepreneurs they want to be in our own environments.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yes, thanks.", "David Simon", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Morgan. Your line is open.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Paul Morgan", "You talked about how your same-store numbers don't include your redevelopments. I'm just wondering. At this point right now it seems like you have a very large share of some of your top centers in redevelopments. Is that a drag, having that excluded, given the strength of some of those?", "David Simon", "First of all, we don\u2019t consider to drag, you have to put comp numbers in a \u2013 Paul you have to put comp numbers in a historical perspective. And you can\u2019t look it one quarter over quarter, you\u2019ve got to look at it over three to five-year period upon. And if you look at our comp NOI increases over that three to five-year period of time, there clearly you would conclude that we have significant outperformance. And I don't look as much as everyone wants to focus on a quarter here and quarter there.", "I want to reinforce we do have the highest operating margins in the business. We also have the lowest overhead in terms of however you want do it enterprise value \u2013 percent of EBITDA, percent of revenues in the business. And that\u2019s why we have the best balance sheet in the business and that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to grow our dividend 15% to 20% a year. So again certainly there are \u2013 yes, we\u2019re remerchandising Houston Galleria, and Copley, and Stanford, and Roosevelt Field, and King of Prussia and we\u2019re moving tenants left and right.", "We encourage everybody to go see the properties and yes, from a quarter perspective it's going to \u2013 it's not going to impress some, but I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re doing I\u2019m really impressed with internally. But I would encourage you and others to look at comp NOI over a more of an extended period of times than comp quarter-to-quarter.", "Paul Morgan", "So I mean if I do that\u2026", "David Simon", "But again long story short, yes, we are having some impact on all the remerchandising going on in our portfolio.", "Paul Morgan", "So I mean if I take that longer view and look back over the past, say, two or three years in your numbers, is there any reason to think as I look forward two or three years that you wouldn't be able to do kind of the same type of numbers, I guess deeper into the economic cycle?", "David Simon", "Well, listen history is a good indicator of what you might be able to do in the future, but we would hope that all the stuff that we\u2019re doing will accelerate the growth profile of those assets. We have to execute, believe me, we are not out of the execution phase, but I would think Paul at the end of the day that these assets are going to grow very, very nicely and we\u2019ll increase our comp NOI growth and meet our historical growth.", "Now the fact is we\u2019re subject to economic cycles, we\u2019re subject to tenants going bankrupt, we are subject to downtime, we\u2019re subject to sales of our retailers, volatility. So we don't control everything, but we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record. I would hope that would continue, but it's not you don\u2019t follow-up a lot for this stuff. You got to do it each and everyday and our team was pretty good at it.", "Paul Morgan", "Thanks. And then just my follow-up on the Sears joint venture. How far you into the process of going through and saying: well, here's what we're going to do near-term, here we\u2019d like to do longer-term. And kind of how \u2013 the size of the potential redevelopment and the timing and when we might get some of those details?", "Richard Sokolov", "Hi, it\u2019s Rick. We are very far along in that process, we\u2019ve already had multiple meetings with Seritage. We have developed, redevelopment plans for each of the assets they are in the process right now of being priced and as they become mature, we will announce them and proceed forward, but they include the addition of specialty stores, mall expansion, adding restaurants, adding boxes and appropriately sizing Sears. Bear in mind in our venture it\u2019s almost 850,000 square feet of additional space if you are going to be able to redeploy along with those TBA auto centers. So it\u2019s a great opportunity and we are well into it.", "Paul Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector.", "Jeffrey Spector", "I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the redevelopment pipeline. David, I believe you said that $1 billion through 2017, and I know it's been going on for a number of years now. I mean what are your thoughts I guess at this point beyond 2017? Is that \u2013 by 2017 you are really at this point touching those top-producing assets? Or do you think you can expand that program beyond?", "David Simon", "Well, I think as Rick mentioned I mean I do think Sears gives us whole host additional redevelopment opportunities. We are closer and closer to starting \u2013 in fact we are actually starting the Southwest Corridor and Copley, which is not in those numbers yet. We are absent something really out of the expected, we are going to start Copley very, very shortly, we've got fail safes in that investment, but we are moving with speed to deliver that, we think that's great Sears presents a lot of opportunities. We've got outlets that we've done the big ones, we\u2019re doing a bunch of small ones that we need to look at. Rick, you want to add to it.", "Richard Sokolov", "I would also tell you, we\u2019ve already announced the expansion in Jersey Gardens that\u2019s going to be a major redevelopment, we have announced the expansion of Sawgrass. Right now we're finalizing an expansion of Colonnade, redeveloping the Oasis. And I can tell we are continuing the mine this portfolio and I believe we\u2019ll have a continuing series of pretty substantial value add opportunities across all three of our platforms.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Okay, thanks. And then one of the other focuses that Craig and I have been paying attention to, of course, on the technology front, the winners in the Simon Launch and in particular the SKU IQ. So from where we sit I guess it's just been hard over the last year to really keep track of exactly what's going on here on these different initiatives. Can you discuss either the winners or SKU IQ in particular and where you think this may go?", "David Simon", "Yes, look I don't get mad at me Jeff, but I believe we are happy to do \u2013 I think we are close to putting together with Skyler and Michael and investor, I don\u2019t know what you call them investor, not roadshow but investor meeting to kind of layout all the investment we made and maybe with not exactly you maybe with somebody else, but well-respected peer of yours and we\u2019ll lay it out for the investment community all that different investments we've made and why.", "So I think we\u2019re shooting for sometime in October but there's a lot of neat stuff here. These are little - in the scheme of things, little investments, but they run from creating energy efficiency with all of our LED lighting to helping retailers to actually new e-commerce ideas that may go to the mall. So it\u2019s a lot of different categories, different levels of investment, in the kind of the A, B, C rounds. We\u2019re happy to share that data. It\u2019s a lot, though, to do it on a call like this. But we will be sharing a lot of that stuff with our investors.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Okay, thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thank you. A quick follow-up first. Have you bought any more shares post the quarter end?", "David Simon", "We operated - if you are familiar, you have to operate under a 10(b) 15 rule once your quarter is completed. We gave guidelines because you can't be in the market during that period of time and the guidelines that we gave to the broker were not met. So the answer is we have not purchased any further.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay. The second question, is there any incremental change in trends you're noticing in the outlet business? Maybe not the premium, at more infill outlets, but maybe more secondary, where maybe the pricing gap between full-line mall retailers and outlet businesses or retailers are maybe narrowing? You've seen like T.J. Maxx and Ross doing better. Have the secondary type of outlets - do you notice any less importance or less traffic or any kind of incremental trends?", "David Simon", "Not really, I mean I think not really at all. I mean I think our outlet retailers are very focused on finding the right balance between full price in outlet that\u2019s why they are very focused on not overexposing the brand. There have been certain retailers that have had disappointing sales both in full price and in outlet. Outlet\u2019s no different than full price in that if a retailer is not hitting it, it will affect their sales in full-price and in outlet. But no trend in that at all. We have outlets in Cincinnati, Columbus, Indiana, St. Louis, that are all doing just fine. They are affected by retailers that may not be doing as well as they were a year ago, but that's similar to the full price small business as well.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey, good morning out there.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Hey, how are you? Just a few questions here David, first just going back to the dividend and stock buyback, certainly as you guys outlined where you want put your money, redevelopment and development seems to be the first and foremost. And then when you move down from there, once you've solved for paying out appropriate with the taxable income, it sounds like your bias is still towards increasing the dividend versus buyback. So I just want to see if that\u2019s the proper interpretation from your comments or if you are thinking that any excess cash may now go more towards buyback versus the strong dividend growth.", "David Simon", "Well, the dividend - listen, this sounds weird, but we're highly profitable, right? So as our earnings increase you know our taxable income increases and therefore our dividend increases. Very simple that\u2019s the REIT model. We\u2019re great believers in the REIT model that\u2019s why we are all here. And so our dividend is going to increase.", "There is just no two ways about it, because we have created a very nice earnings machines as long as we don\u2019t make mistakes about where we invest capital, we\u2019ll be in good shape. So I always like increasing the dividend more than stock buybacks, we had this unusual situation where we basically took one investment and felt the most immediate interesting return would be buying our stock back.", "I think having the flexibility to buy it in a volatile market, when there is a big disconnect is what will be focused on. But I would continue to expect knock on wood that our earnings continue to move up, we\u2019re going to be focused on increasing our dividend. And it\u2019s under appreciated in the REIT sector, but if you look at our dividend yield compared to our peer group and you look at our dividend growth in the expectations of a higher dividend growth. We look like a cheap stock, so I mean do what you want with that. I guess I don\u2019t know.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Well, which as an analyst we can't do anything with it because we can't own it. But obviously it's good to cash dividend checks. Moving over to Europe, you guys announced the JV with HBC in Germany, and it involves a lot of High Street retail. In the U.S. you've shied away from doing High Street retail. You've stuck to the malls and outlets.", "So just sort of curious, do you have a different view with High Street retail in Europe that you don't share in U.S. or it\u2019s really again just a pure credit play in focusing on retailers, and you're not trying to do something as far as potential to get at High Street retail in Europe.", "David Simon", "Look I think the market in the U.S. with respect to High Street retail is sophisticated expenses, there are lot of guys that have been added for a long-time. We think Europe is a little bit different in that maybe there is more opportunity for us to do that just like the opportunity that we saw with Kl\u00e9pierre at the outset a few years ago.", "So that\u2019s not to say the HBC thing is a little bit of credit play, it's a little bit accretive to grow vehicle, it\u2019s betting on. I think extremely talented CEO and team in HBC. These guys are entrepreneurs, they are smart, they are sophisticated, they want to grow their business.", "We are happy and pleased to be their partner and I think that entity ultimately will look to create a broader portfolio. High Street Europe is a little more interesting maybe from evaluation point of view. U.S. is a little more pricey, got a lot more sophisticated players, but we\u2019ll see how it evolves, but we are making I think a good bet where we\u2019ve got very strong partner, strong assets, strong credit and between the two of us that have the nose and instinct for good deals we should find some opportunities.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Listen, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Chao.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to the Sears JV. Just curious in the context of investment opportunities, there's a lot of chatter about different retailers doing something with their real estate. Just curious if you are having more conversations with others on structures like the Sears or the HBC deals that you have.", "David Simon", "Well, I think there's got to be more than just marking or financing retailers real estate. So for instance I can just contrast \u2013 the reason we did Sears is because partnered with them is because it\u2019s all about redeveloping over time those boxes. Sears\u2019 store of the future may be part of it, they may not be, but that\u2019s basically a redevelopment play.", "HBC that contrast it was, yes, they got a mark out with real estate, but to me we created \u2013 if HBC only wanted to just mark the real estate and do credit we wouldn\u2019t have played, we saw an opportunity to bet on a very accomplished entrepreneur great brands and low and behold we did the deal and they are buying the German department store, but we are entering in German real estate in a big way.", "If it's just marketing real estate or just a credit that\u2019s not really exciting for us. So we\u2019re happy to talk strategically with our retailers about it, but there's got to be more to it than just that. And so I think this world will present opportunities, but there's got to be more than just marketing the real estate whether it's redevelopment or creating a growth vehicle to go do something there's got to be more to it than what is just said.", "Vincent Chao", "That makes sense. But I guess I would just \u2013 it seems like there would be plenty of redevelopment opportunities beyond just Sears, although Sears offers plenty of opportunity in itself, I guess. But maybe just thinking about other areas I mean can you just comment on the McArthurGlen pipeline? I think there's one project that you were expecting to start here this year. But how does the rest of the pipeline look like for potential additional developments there?", "David Simon", "Sure, there is \u2013 in Provence, we are in fact we just bought the land, we are starting construction in September after the growing season, believe it or not, is finished and that\u2019s an all systems go deal, we are in the final throes of expand \u2013 about to start the expansion in Roermond, which we'll be a partner in with other partners in that project.", "We have pipeline in Normandy, in Spain with \u2013 we are partnering with [Sonali] and we got \u2013 we are looking, we are not quite there, but we\u2019re looking seriously expanding Venice. So I would say it's a very active type in terms of new development and obviously to be able to build starting in September in South of France is very, very exciting, very pleasing.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Just one last, one cleanup question in terms of the guidance. Assuming that does not include any future buybacks, just what's closed already?", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, Tom and I had this philosophical discussion today. We are a pretty large company, we are going to earn $10 a share this year thereabouts. We have so many ins and outs, we\u2019re just not a portfolio we\u2019ve got so many things going on. That\u2019s our best guess, we put it all on the blender, we give it you and it\u2019s all subject to change quarter-over-quarter. The good news is we hit our numbers, knock on wood. Hopefully we'll continue. We don\u2019t isolate one particular thing over another and we\u2019ll see where it shakes out.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carol Kemple.", "Carol Kemple", "Good morning.", "Richard Sokolov", "Good morning.", "Carol Kemple", "At this point with your other department store tenants are you seeing any of them want to right-size space like Sears?", "David Simon", "Not really, we are constantly in conversations with them and we are doing a number of other potential things involving relocating department stores. For example at Stamford we had a Bloomingdale's that was oversized, we worked with them they built a brand new store, and now we\u2019re redeveloping the old Bloomingdale's into small shops. Did the same thing with Saks at Houston Galleria. So it\u2019s a very dynamic process. We\u2019re constantly in conversation with them, and we\u2019re doing a lot of things as a result of that. But there is not another store out there that has the kind of focused, programmatic approach to decreasing their footprint size.", "Carol Kemple", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Mueller.", "Michael Mueller", "Yes, hi. Just going back to Sears again, what's a rough idea of the dollars that could be invested in those 10 or 11 boxes over time?", "Richard Sokolov", "I think we\u2019re going to use that on a project by project basis but obviously as we\u2019ve articulated, it\u2019s a substantial opportunity and it would certainly be in a larger amount as opposed to a lesser amount. But it depends on the scope of the individual projects, but that is to come.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it. Okay. So it sounds like it could be in the couple - in the hundreds of millions of dollars.", "Richard Sokolov", "Potentially, yes.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it. Then I guess, how does it work? If you demolish a Sears box and do a major expansion well beyond the footprint, do they participate in that? Or is it just to the scope of the footprint?", "Richard Sokolov", "Each project is differently. But in the Sears venture, they own a part of the Seritage, our venture owns a parcel of land. So the venture would be focusing its redevelopment efforts on the parcel of land that is owned in the venture. And that would be the extent of the activity in the venture.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Hi, good morning. Just quick question on occupancy and the impact of bankruptcies from earlier in the year. I think we were pretty happily surprised to see that your second-quarter occupancy and same-store NOI were actually somewhat stronger than the first quarter. I was just wondering if you could go through some of the progress on re-leasing that space and when you expect to have made up for the lost occupancy and NOI.", "David Simon", "I will just say our goal we are going to \u2013 we still think we will come close to our year end occupancy of last year, but its going to be - its not a no-brainer. It could slip what I\u2019d say immaterially, but others may have a different view of that, so I respect that. But we\u2019re trending up we are making progress, and I think we\u2019ve got momentum but it takes time. So our goal is still try to get back to last year. But we lost, what Rick?", "Richard Sokolov", "940,000", "David Simon", "Yes, 940,000 feet, so that\u2019s a lot of work. So we are little bit on the treadmill, but we're a fit athlete and we're running...", "Richard Sokolov", "David is speaking for himself.", "David Simon", "I wish.", "Richard Sokolov", "I would just add one thing that we are making very good progress going through it and it is an opportunity its hard work it has the short-term impact but the tenants that we are brining in are certainly higher productivity tenants from the sales perspective and so far the rents that we\u2019ve been able to generate or in excess of the rents that we are being paid by the former tenants that when bankrupt.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Got it. Then just also is there anything you could say on the difference you're seeing in re-leasing the space at, say, your trophy properties versus whatever you would call the next tier, and the next tier of your properties?", "Richard Sokolov", "Look, it's axiomatic that the higher-productivity properties have a broader band of interest, but that\u2019s what we do and happily we're also blessed with a portfolio that is predominantly those strong properties.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Great. Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next comes from Linda Tsai.", "Linda Tsai", "Hi. I'm not sure if this is something you could comment on deeply, but when you look at your redevelopment plans for Sears, do you think you're approaching your plans any differently from GGP or Macerich? Or is it relatively straightforward in terms of figuring out what the property is missing and splitting boxes and adding entertainment?", "David Simon", "Look, I think they\u2019re very \u2013 they are both very confident developers, redevelopers. So at the end of the day my guess is it\u2019s not going to be all that crazily different. But it\u2019s so much of that dependent upon the location and the local market, but they\u2019re both confident developers. I would probably venture to say it will be similar, but if they are better than us we intend to copy immediately, okay.", "Linda Tsai", "Then retail is cyclical and while there's been a recent wave of closures you also noted that there's also a lot of entrepreneurial concepts popping up. Do you think there's anything different about the cycle time around as it relates to maybe omnichannel selling or bifurcation amongst brands catering to high-end or low-end consumers?", "David Simon", "Well, look would you say generally there is obviously the whole movement towards value on one hand and luxury on the other continues. The general \u2013 the good news about that is we\u2019re positioned in both of those barbells extremely well. But that\u2019s not to say people lose sight of that, that's not to say the middle American mall isn't doing well.", "Its part of the community, it\u2019s ignored from a media point of view, there's assumptions made about those assets, there is extrapolation because one mall went out of business that all malls are going out of business. But I would say to you that the solid middle malls throughout America continue to do well, serve their purpose. But you\u2019ll clearly see a movement in a lot of retailers from either aspirational higher end goods or value. There is no question about that.", "Richard Sokolov", "One comment I would make to you on the new retailers we are dealing with is that they are substantially more sophisticated than the crop of new retailers we dealt with say 10 years ago, better financed, much more focused on their niche and it\u2019s been much easier to deal this new crop of entrepreneurs than might have been the case.", "David Simon", "Look in today's world we\u2019ll have to be better, we\u2019ll have to be on our game better. So that comes with \u2013 okay what industry it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say I mean everybody, the rapid changes in the world is putting pressure on every industry, every operator and that\u2019s why you got a strong, people, strong assets and strong balance sheet to deal with it all.", "Linda Tsai", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. Rick, if you look at kind of the sales and leasing trends, is there anything that you can talk about regionally? Any big differences that you see?", "Richard Sokolov", "Look, there are a couple of differences across the thing in our business. The Great Lakes, Southeast and Pacific are stronger; mountain and New England were a little weaker. The better categories were home furniture, food, personal care, jewelry, and athletic shoes.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay.", "David Simon", "I mean, I say Steve you clearly \u2013 the stronger dollar and the economic upheavals in growing markets, but with wealthy people Brazil, what's going on with China and their focus on obviously Europe with the stronger dollar. I mean it has impacted sales in the high tourist centers and we\u2019ve got them. I mean there is no question. We've got them in South Florida. We've got them in Orlando.", "We don't have New York City, we have Woodbury which is been relatively flat and that's usually a center that grows every year I think that\u2019s more of all the stuff going on with the center and the tourism, but the tourism centers have had a little softness you see in the hotel industry. So we are not immune to that.", "Steve Sakwa", "I presume that's not having much of an impact on leasing, just given their long-term nature. Or do you actually think it's impacting leasing at all?", "Richard Sokolov", "I would say it had no impact on leasing.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. And then, David, any just update kind of the Copley kind of residential project?", "David Simon", "Well, I mentioned it briefly earlier which is look we\u2019re doing the Southwest Corridor. We\u2019re finalizing the permit and there which is more administrator. So it is all shaping up to, we start to dig down to support the foundation going up that's all moving should start the Southwest Corridor should start in the next month.", "So we have certain fail safe, the way that building is being constructed we have fail safes so for instance we are going to do the Southwest Corridor first which is because we\u2019ve got to create a new entrants to create the way to build. We have to go down into the Turnpike so we have to create new entrance first. That\u2019s happening, that\u2019s been approved by us then we go down into the Turnpike then we go up to support this field going up. So we will be making that incremental decision, but once we do the Southwest, we will do that.", "And then building the podium is where it's really guts poker that\u2019s a year decision from now, but all systems are go and we are cranking, we don\u2019t see any reason to stop. So we \u2013 the kind of nice thing about this is that we can stop looking this for the market a year from now and yes we would have an investment in it, but we\u2019ll always be able to go up. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't go up, but we are certainly going to go down and build our way up to create the platform to build the power.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay and then just last question. Anything on Deliv? That kind of system just seems to have taken a backseat. Haven't heard much about it. Any thoughts about that or how it's working or\u2026?", "David Simon", "I would comment on Deliv that Macy's just recently announced that they are expanding the footprint of stores in which Deliv is going to be working with them. So that is certainly a positive sign and we continue to believe that there is a significant role for all of our properties to play in the fulfillment aspect of an omnichannel retail business, and it's moving a pace.", "Steve Sakwa", "So Rick, do you think it\u2019s more a function of just consumers not really realizing it exists to kind of get more critical mass?", "Richard Sokolov", "I think it\u2019s just the function of getting the systems right, getting the retail so the point were they are ready to fulfill from their store that there is a big systems upgrade it\u2019s going on right now across the entire industry. And ultimately there is going to be a seamless integrated experience for our consumers and certainly fulfilling from the store to their home has going to be part of that and Deliv can be part of that solution.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from DJ Busch.", "DJ Busch", "Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on Sears. Given the potential size of the capital spend for some of the Sears projects that you were talking about earlier, if Seritage can't meet its share of the capital requirements, is there an opportunity for you to put up a disproportionate amount of the capital to potentially grow your interest in the joint venture?", "David Simon", "Well, that have to be a negotiated \u2013 that would have to be a negotiated part of the deal, but it seems to me they have got the balance sheet to be able to do that, but I\u2019m sure we could figure it out as they didn\u2019t.", "DJ Busch", "But is it correct to assume you guys are controlling kind of the process and the strategies at each of the center?", "Richard Sokolov", "We\u2019re joint venture partners, it\u2019s both \u2013 it\u2019s approval on both sides. I\u2019d say we are taking the lead on coming up with the plans and the redevelopment and the different uses. But they are riding copilot with us.", "David Simon", "And I would also say to you that we have significant another number of Sears stores that are not in our venture that are in Seritage. And when we meet with Seritage, we\u2019re actively working with them, as we have done in the past to help them redeploy those phases in a productive way and an example of that is King of Prussia, where Dick's now opened and Primark is opening this fall. And between the two of them they will 100% occupy the former Sears store.", "DJ Busch", "And just a follow up on that, Rick. With Seritage kind of taking control of the Sears space and the talks of other department stores potentially monetizing the real estate, do you see any difference in the operations? I know it's early, but do you see any potential impact to the way you negotiate or lease or deal with the anchors if the landlord is no longer the retailer?", "Richard Sokolov", "No.", "DJ Busch", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Yes, they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to get stuff done like we do. So I don't see the dynamics changing.", "DJ Busch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. I know most of the conversations are always circling around upgrading quality and reinvesting in your better assets. But given that you do have some of your walls tied into WPG and the history there, and just because the stock price has gotten cheaper over the past year, is there a certain point where a lower-quality portfolio might look interesting just because it's so cheap? Or should we just basically consider this like a permanent divorce?", "David Simon", "I don't know even how to interpret your question. We spun off WPG well over a year ago. They are separate independent company, they are focused on the strip center and the B mall business. You can hear that directly from them, we do services for them that ultimately will go away mid next year and their growth opportunities are better discussed with them.", "I think our focus as you seen over the years, is to buy the bigger assets or assets that we feel we can improve upon, but the primary focus is on our redevelopment or finding different vehicles for growth, whether its Europe, whether its HBC et cetera and continue to grow our business. I said the amount of the big deal business we are not going to buy B assets I think that\u2019s better for others to do given what\u2019s on our plate, but I\u2019m not sure I answered the question, but I tried.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Yes, you kind of did. I was just basically asking if there's a certain price where something like that would be interesting again?", "David Simon", "I think that this is better for others to do, but that\u2019s not up to me to.", "Ki Bin Kim", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Moore.", "Rich Moore", "Hey, guys. Good morning. My question, David, was kind of on the flip side of that. You have 200 assets. If you rank them all, does it make sense to get rid of 190 through 200? That kind of thing?", "David Simon", "Well, we are always doing that, we just do it \u2013 we don\u2019t do it ahead of that so we have a deal that\u2019s closing mid-August that was a lot work and we just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. We are closed on another deal so we do that all. Rich, I know if you looked at our history sold a bunch of stuff so what we get, we\u2019ll always sell assets, always part of\u2026", "Rich Moore", "Okay, so are you marketing things actively, or is it just sort of an opportunistic? Yes? Okay.", "David Simon", "Yes. We market. We've marketed - the two that I am referring to were marketed, yes.", "Rich Moore", "Got it. Okay. Then on the lease term income you guys got this quarter, it was kind of big. I'm curious; I know you can't tell each quarter what's going to happen. But is that something that's going to pick up here you think in the last two quarters of the year? Are there more discussions you're having on this kind of thing?", "David Simon", "There could be a few deals here or there. But if you look at it year-over-year, year-to-date it\u2019s not all that different 2014. So it\u2019s lumpy towards lumpy but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be all that different, Steve right? From", "Steven Broadwater", "But the same as 2014.", "David Simon", "Same as 2014 that\u2019s the business that\u2019s lumpy in terms of quarter-to-quarter it actually relatively consistent year-over-year.", "Rich Moore", "Okay great. Thanks guys.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to David for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Okay thank you. Have a wonderful last few weeks to summer. Sorry to have ruined your Friday on a summer Friday. Enjoy.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

For our prepared remarks, I am pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning, we had a productive quarter. We opened started and completed several new projects and closed our joint venture with HBC including the acquisition of certain cop-op department store which will serve as another avenue of growth for us. And most importantly we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.54 per share which exceeded the first call consensus by $0.07. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to the strong dollar. On a comparable basis excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the prior year period FFO per diluted share increased 12.9% or $0.29 year-over-year.", "Key metrics, occupancy was 96.1%. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and outlets recorded releasing spreads of $11 per square foot, an increase of 18.4%. Comp NOI increased 4.3% in the third quarter of 2015, an increase 3.8% year-to-date keeping us on track for full year guidance of 4% comp NOI growth. This is on top of our industry leading growth of more than 5% in 2014. As a reminder we do not include lease settlement income in comp NOI disclosure or new transaction. We also do not include the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers.", "Total sales across the portfolio increased 1.8% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis the sales per square foot increased for the 12 months ended September 30 was 2.7% positive. They were strong in the mall, but effective in the outlet business due to the strong dollar as had on sales activity from the international tourist in property zone; the Canadian, Mexican borders as well as traditional tourist markets.", "At the end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at thirty properties across all three of our platforms with a total committed spend of $1.7 billion. During the quarter we opened significant expansion at two of the country's most productive outlet centers, San Francisco premium outlet centers and Chicago Premium Outlets. Following the expansion the outlets in Chicago and San Francisco are the largest respectively. In Illinois and California we have recently opened the Fashion Wing at Del Amo. The Wing includes a new Nordstrom, and more than a hundred exceptional brands, many of them exclusive to the trade area. With this transformation we have completed Del Amo is just another example how we continue invest in our proven assets to enrich the shoppers experience and enhance the value of our real estate.", "We have started construction on several new strategic projects during the quarter including significant redevelopments at the shops of Riverside, the Westchester and our progress is excellent with our Sears boxes at Seritage. As we move forward, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects. Some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria and Houston Stanford Shopping Center, the King of Prussia Mall, Sawgrass Mills and Woodbury Commons; all of these projects we expect to be completed over the next 12 months.", "In terms of new development, we opened two new in the quarter, Vancouver and Gloucester. We also opened Tucson Premium Outlets on October 01. And we are opening Tampa on Thursday of this week.", "During the quarter we started construction on a new premium outlet center in Clarksburg which is projected to open in October 2016. We are also with our partner McArthurGlen. We started construction on a new outlet and Provouge Spranz which is scheduled to open in March of 2017 which will be the only designer outlet in the south of France. And our share of investment at new outlets in full price is currently 725 million not including the recently completed Gloucester and Vancouver.", "And let's talk quickly about the balance sheet activities. We issued $1.1 billion of new notes with the weighted average duration of 7.8 years and an average coupon of 3.05%. We completed several secured placements during the quarter as well as the U.S. and German loan facility financings for a joint venture with HBC. Our current liquidity between the revolvers and cash on hand is approximately 6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us in a very positive manner. We exercised caution during the third quarter with respect to our common stock repurchase program and did not repurchase any stock during the period due to the increased market volatility and the dislocation in the debt markets. We remain committed to our buyback efforts, of course subject to marking into conditions.", "In addition, we announced our dividend of $1.60 per share for this quarter. That's an increase of 23% year-over-year and in fact that's the fourth consecutive quarter that we've increased our dividend. We will pay $6.05 in 2015 and that's an increase of 17.5% compared to $5.15 of last year. So with all that said, no one is as active as we are in terms of redevelopment and new development. And I'm pleased, based upon the performance to date. Once again we raise our guidance of 2015 of $10.10 to $10.15 per share. This compares to our original FFO guidance of 9.60 to 9.70 per share or approximately $0.48 higher from the respective midpoints.", "We are now ready for question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead sir. You are live into the call.", "Michael Bilerman", "It's Michael Bilerman here with Christine Kilroy. David, your comment about the stock buyback, being I guess it's a volatile stock market and some uncertainties in the debt markets; isn't that exactly the time where you should be exercising your fortress balance sheet and significant cash proceeds to be able to buy the stock. I know high insight is 2020, watching the stock go up $27 but I'm just curious about the mentality at that point in time about not being aggressive at that point.", "David Simon", "Well, Michael I think stock buybacks, in terms of the marketplace reaction to the may be overstated. What I'm most interested in at this company is growing our earnings and our dividend and maintaining our balance sheet, improving our properties and enhancing our relationship. So I don\u2019t look at it quarter by quarter basis. We are more focused on growing our earnings per share and our dividend. And the fact is that in August the market was very volatile as you know the debt markets gapped pretty significantly. We chose for one quarter to be cautious. I have no regrets about that because our number one priority is to grow our earnings and our dividends. And that to me is more important and I think that's what the market should value more importantly than what one's buyback activity may be from one quarter to the next. We remain committed to it while we're going to be opportunistic about that because we continue to believe. I'm terrible at reading from the script. I can barely get the words out. But as you know our activity in redevelopment and new development is not hypothetical. It is ongoing and I think prudence in that category of the buyback is appropriate. And again I think our number one priority is earnings growth and therefore dividend growth. And then buy stock back when we feel like it's a real opportunistic time.", "Michael Bilerman", "And that Christine has a question as well.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Christine Kilroy", "Hey David, just thinking about the Simon venture Group stuff and we appreciate the in-depth look at that business earlier this month, beyond just sort of the small financial investment you've made, what do you view as the primary benefit of this business to Simon, over the longer term as consumers shopping habits continue to evolve and maybe you can sort of give us a sense of how big you think that your investment in this business could reach over time?", "David Simon", "Well, let me just talk about what I think the goal is, ultimately it's to help connect with the consumer. The mall business is historically as always felt like the, our job was to get the box reach to the right retailers and let the retailers do most of the connecting and driving most of the traffic but I think the industry has a evolved, where we've got to become the driver of traffic and we've got to connect with the consumers. So what I'm looking for in that, those investments and that connection with technology is, how do I connect with the consumer to drive traffic and make their shopping trip more enjoyable or more effective, two: how do I help the retailer do that as well and then maybe third, is there some new concept or new retailer that ultimately can proliferate our portfolio through these kind of connections.", "And if we can accomplish those two or three goals then I think we will have succeeded. And it's all about trying to take the mall box making a smart connected box to help our retailers and the property owner connect with the consumer so that their trip is better, more efficient and more productive which we think will lead to sales growth. So that's the goal.", "We may do a little bit here and there that's a little far afield like funding the new retail or restaurant concept because we think maybe that has potential down the road and in terms of size, we're not going to get carried away but it's really hard to pinpoint right now exactly how big that can be but we have a sense where we're kind of, will ultimately be in the mid-20s by the end of this year, maybe we'll do another type of investment like that next year.", "So it wouldn't shock me if we are in there 50+ range by the end of next year but that's just a swag.", "Operator", "Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead sir, you are live into the call.", "Jeff Spector", "Great, thank you, good morning. I guess, just thinking about the bumps throughout the year, David what exceeded your expectations and how were you thinking about the budgeting process for 2016? I guess can you compare year-over-year, your mindset?", "David Simon", "Well, I think what's interesting before the end perspective, first of all is that as you look at our earnings growth we have had an increase in lease settlement income but we've also had the negative of the currency negative from our foreign operations. If you put the two together over \u201914 we've actually had a negative $0.05 variance. So, the increase in the lease settlement income from \u201915 to \u201914 offset against the reduction in earnings that we've taken from our foreign investments due to the strong dollar, net-net year-to-date has been a negative $0.05. So you have to put that in perspective.", "We've had good rental growth, good leasing spreads. We are obviously had a lot more bankruptcies in \u201915 than we did in \u201914 and the other impact we've had on the negative side is that we've lost certain amount of percentage rent from the outlet business because of the fact that the strong dollar has also heard tourism shopping and we've seen that impacted more in the outlet business, the outlet tourists centers then we had in the mall business.", "The mall comp sales have been a better than our expectations and our leading portfolio in terms of that. So the fact is we always though year in and year out, that's what makes us a little bit unique, we always had some positives, we always had some negatives and we somehow manage to hit our numbers, exceed our numbers, produce very strong industry leading results.", "I'd also say to you as we look into next year, I mean the key focus for us frankly is we have anniversary the stronger dollar. So that will not be, the negative it was this year and the big focus obviously is going to be leasing up the bankrupt tenants were probably 60% to 70% on our way there, a total loss score footage is the [million three]. So we've got our work cut out but we've seen this movie before. The good news is we have quality real estate that allows us to do it and we have other leverages to continue to have industry leading comp growth.", "And I think the big exciting thing that we've got in \u201916 which won't show up in our numbers, is all of the major redevelopment that we've done between King of Prussia, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, I want Craig to go see Del Amo, it's unbelievable what we've started there, of course we're still finishing it. It's a big complicated projects but we've got Woodbury Common coming on board, we've got the extension of Sawgrass colonnade, new development et cetera is going to be really terrific to open up in the latter half of \u201916 which positions us \u201917.", "The model is reinvest, generate excess cash flow, pay high dividends and I should, of course remind you that our dividend [indiscernible] was $3 and actually $2.70, it\u2019s $6.05 today , we'll have significant growth in next year as well but we've got to show up and we've got to go work every day.", "Jeff Spector", "Thank you, that's helpful. Good timing on the, yes?", "David Simon", "I hope it answered your question but I'm not, but we've got work to do and we have one thing about comp and alike, if you look at nine, I'm sorry, if you look at \u201913, I don't know 5%, what we have guys 5%, \u201914 we had 5%, this year we are going to have 4%. So we are building it up a pretty strong base and we didn't have any down years of non-performance to build it off, right. So it's great to build also base if you had non-performance but we haven't had that frankly and in the great recession our comp and ally was relatively flat which was industry leading as well.", "Jeff Spector", "No, it's very helpful, thank you and good timing on the Del Amo because I know Craig has put in a request to visit it.", "David Simon", "Come on down.", "Jeff Spector", "Great. And then my only, my one other question was just on your previous comments on the redevelopment pipeline. We believe you've mentioned through \u201917 or you at the point where you think that pipeline could continue a billion plus beyond \u201917? Are we correct on that?", "David Simon", "Yes. I feel pretty good about that. Yes.", "Jeff Spector", "Beyond \u201917 or not yet?", "David Simon", "Yes, no, no.", "Jeff Spector", "Oh beyond? Okay.", "David Simon", "No rest for [indiscernible], so this morning, we're going through our budget cycle now which is a lot of fun but this morning we were going through our capital plan through \u201916 and \u201917 and \u201918. And we don't see it abating, it\u2019s actually in\u201917 it will be higher probably around $1.5 billion, and in\u201918 in that range. And the big unknown is how fast the Seritage things happen.", "We are not, it\u2019s a joint venture. So it's not just the question of how fast we can go but also how fast Seritage can goes and how fast Sears can go which is clearly we're trying to influence but we don't have complete control in that but we certainly have a lot on the drawing board to do there.", "Jeff Spector", "Great thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you feel question. We do have another question it comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead you are live into the call.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Hi, good morning. Earlier this year, mall REITs were of course impacted across the board by retailer bankruptcies but your same-center occupancy was down 80 basis points this quarter which is actually more than the first and second which seems surprising. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove that year-over-year decline in occupancy to remain in the third quarter and how you expect it turn going forward.", "David Simon", "We had more bankruptcies in the third quarter. So, Jones went out, just more bankruptcies and then we've also opened up a few centers which had some decrease. We just saw people understand, we don't, in our statistics we put in new centers. The minute the rent in terms of occupancy or new expanded centers. They're not in our comps, NOI growth but they are in our sales per square foot and they're in our occupancy. So part of that decrease was also that we added some new centers and some new expanded centers which actually drove our occupancy down, [flat plenty depth] as well.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Got it and then like you're mentioning before, you guys have had consistent pretty strong same store NOI growth but do you think that this creates some easy occupancy comp for 2016 and that should be able to help you even more?", "David Simon", "Nothing is easy, if you see my grade here recently. Nothing is easy. Well, I won't say anything about gold but we did read this retail report; we found your list of 100 malls curious, so I assume the real estate folks didn't have much to do with that but we're happy to help you.", "Caitlin Burrows", "It will. Our retail team that put it together.", "David Simon", "Right and you quoted traffic statistics which I would encourage you read the footnotes from your source.", "Caitlin Burrows", "We will do. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you. Happy to help.", "Operator", "Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord, please go ahead.", "Paul Morgan", "Good morning. Just on the sales trends, I mean could you talk a little bit about it, I mean whether and to what extent the tourist markets were drag due to the dollar or maybe looking at any differences between the Mall and the premium outlet portfolio.", "David Simon", "We're not going to run from this. We're just going to tell you reality. We have unbelievable tourist centers. In our outlet business, Orlando, Woodberry, throughout Las Vegas and those generate a lot of tourism dollars and the tourists because of the strong dollar, you know was quiet. The high end luxury retail market in say New York City and Miami has been hurt as well and we saw that have an usually, it has very little impact but we saw that a little bit more in the outlet business and very little in the mall business.", "We think it's more or less temporary these are great assets, has no impact on retail demand and we've seen a space that comp NOI growth but that\u2019s why the sales metrics are a bigger reaction from you than they are from me, but we tell like it is. So they had an impact on our retail sales per square foot but we don't think it's going to have an impact on our ability to continue to grow comp NOI growth.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay that give some other question I guess which is just, if you look at the public retailers a lot of them or at least stocks have gotten hit pretty hard over the past several months and as we head into the holidays I mean as you talk to them engage with them about, they're open to buys for next year. I mean how is their sentiment? Is it been shifting at all? Is this just kind of sort of the shift in market share between different retailers or is there anything more kind of systematic in terms of, maybe how they're approaching their growth over the next year or two?", "David Simon", "I'd say this, it\u2019s retail dependent but they are better retailers who are dealing with the stronger dollar which has it short term impact on them and second, the fact is our GDP growth is anemic I mean we are growing our general economy 2% below, I think retail can\u2019t avoid that fact. The good news is we outperform not because we cater to generally the better consumer and what I think we've seen from the better consumer this year is a little bit move toward which happens in cycles, a little bit more toward durable goods than non-durable goods which has the impact of making kind of a flattish comp sales growth increase but like I said the mall business, we had very strong comp NOI, I'm sorry comp sales, retail sales growth this year and which was offset as I said only by the tourist centers in the outlet business.", "So net-net we are up 2.7 but if I isolated just the mall, we'd be up much higher than that and that is a testament even though in the anemic GDP growth the better consumer is spending even though there's been a significant increase in durable goods purchases but retail right now is generally a challenge but we're producing results and we intend to continue to do that.", "Paul Morgan", "I mean would you Would you say it kind of hasn't translated into a meaningful shift in the appetite for space in your centers as people talk about next year?", "David Simon", "Not really. I think the opportunity to growth their business in good real estate for better retailers is strong and I don't see the current environment affecting that.", "Paul Morgan", "Great. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Ross Nussbaum", "I am here with Jeremy Metz. Hey David, when we met the other day, you talked a little bit about the amount of money that consumers are spending in your mall for every minute they are there saying there's like a one-to-one ratio, I am curious if you've done any work to think about spending of millennials and teens versus say their parents to sort of further dig into whether the impact of the internet and technology is going to be a growing problem just from a generational perspective?", "David Simon", "I don't have in front of me but yes we've looked at, you know the typical generational gaps, that you would see Baby Boomers Generation X and so on, yes I don't have that in front of me but those numbers are-- it's not it's not what you think it. I mean in other words, there was not a big differential between Generation X and millennials.", "The one thing we're starting to see is the Baby Boomers probably more of a trend on their decreased expenditures than anything else. Again, I think the millennials offer great opportunity for us because they're looking for, they are generally going through their increased income opportunity over the next decade. It's a huge population base, greater than even the Baby Boomers. These folks will get married. They will have children. They will move out of urban environments, especially with, the more difficult living conditions that's going on a lot of urban environments. They are, we believe loyal mall shopping consumers.", "And we're making the mall generally a better experience for them to be at. So I don't think there's a big differential. I don't have the numbers in front of me. It did grew up in the mall environment. They're comfortable with the mall environment.", "And as their income grows and as they aged and have kids, I think they'll be loyal mall shoppers, especially given the environment we're creating.", "Ross Nussbaum", "I appreciate that. I think Jeremy has got a question as well.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Jeremy Metz", "Just two quick ones. In terms of the lease cancellation income, it was the high suspend long time. David, earlier you mentioned Jones. I was just wondering if there is any other tenants in particular to maybe drove, I think Forever 21 was in a few supersized locations. They were looking to downsize, not sure if they were a part of it this quarter?", "David Simon", "No Forever 21. It\u2019s basically, the big one was Jones. There were couple of others that year to date that we dealt with but I hate going through retail. Retailers on that it's somewhat confidential. The good news is lease settlement income does have been slow, the good news is that it's not any time we do that we still have this space.", "So if I get three years of rent and then I get the chance to lease the space back again, I mean that\u2019s a good business, there is nothing wrong with that and to put the earnings in perspective I mean may not have caught the original response to the earlier question, net-net when I look at the stronger dollar from our foreign investments versus the increase in a lease settlement income from \u201914 to \u201915. I'm in the whole $0.05 year to date. So please keep that mind as you think about our business.", "Jeremy Metz", "And then just switching gears quickly, Highwoods recently announced they were looking to sell Country Club Plaza. I was just wondering is that something Simon would be interested in or any thoughts on where that process is at?", "David Simon", "I understand that there is a process. I think it's a good real estate. It's got a good position and it's marketplace. But beyond that I am not informed in terms of numbers or anything else or profit but I understand there's a process and it's always been very good real estate, good market.", "Jeremy Metz", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Good morning. Just may be sticking with leasing, I'm just curious, David, do you think the increase in lease settlement income you are getting foreshadows potentially more space coming back to you guys after the holiday season through bankruptcy?", "David Simon", "I actually think it\u2019s tailing down. As I look at what generated the list it\u2019s a couple of odd things and our watch-list is actually the guys that we were worried about is kind of happened and done that.", "So it's out there it's possible but I actually think next year it will be less, it will be less impacted by bankruptcies than we were this year.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Okay and switching gears, I'm just curious for your take is Macerich has taken to joint venturing some assets at a low to mid four cap rate that we've been told are fairly middle of the pack for them. Does that pricing in the market maybe lead you to feel there might be pockets of your portfolio where you are open to JVs or even selling out of some assets entirely to expand your repurchase initiatives?", "David Simon", "I don\u2019t really, I want to rephrase it. I only want to comment on what may switch did so.", "Jeff Donnelly", "I'm just curious as a comp for transactions in the market, does something in the 4s compel you to say, gee, maybe you'd look at selling your assets to fuel repurchases?", "David Simon", "I don't know. I mean the fact to the matter is where we are very comfortable with what we're doing. We sell our assets, there generally is complexity when you go to joint ventures. We like to do joint ventures when there's new opportunities because there is, it's easier to justify.", "So for instance, just to take a few with that, we're pleased to be part of a new joint ventures on a couple of the new developments, like Brickell and Clearfork, very good partners. Great real estate. That was the only way we could do that. I like those kind of joint ventures where it's more new opportunity than otherwise we sell assets, we sold a bunch of assets, don't forget we did a significant spin off of our strip centers in our smaller malls.", "I don't I don't rule it out. I don't think we necessarily, it's not our priority to do. The priority for us is to grow our innings, grow our dividend, execute our redevelopment development pipeline. And we have the buyback and I don't think we necessarily need the capital from existing properties in terms of a joint venture that execute on the buyback.", "Jeff Donnelly", "Speaking of JVs, I guess you teamed up with Hudson Bay to acquire, was it Galeria Kaufhof Stores? What can you tell us about those properties and just maybe what are your plans of those locations down the road?", "David Simon", "Well, it's great. Mostly city center real estate in Germany, which is a very strong market, very little retail space per capita as compared to the U.S. as an example. It's got built in growth even if it just stays kind of the credit lease that it is but we think there is some ability to redevelop some of the stores take back some of the front edge, much like we are doing with some of the department stores here in the U.S.", "And it's a strong cash flow business appropriately valued with some redevelopment upside.", "Operator", "Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thanks. Just going back to your retailer watch list comments, last year when we had RadioShack, Wet Seal and Deb Shops and Delia's and some others, how early did you have a read into that they would go BK overall?", "David Simon", "Those particular ones?", "Ki Bin Kim", "In general. I was just curious how much of an early warning sign does the watch list provide to you?", "David Simon", "Pretty early.", "Richard Sokolov", "We certainly can see this coming a long way away based on the trends of what their leasing activity is or sales activity, when they probably reported they are looking for new equity, so none of these are surprises but as David said the ones that want to away, they had been on the ropes for years and years and they just ultimately ran out of the incremental equity sources and out of file.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay. Maybe if you could put it in an easily digestible number. You mentioned 1.3 million square feet that was impacted this year. In broad numbers, what does that look like next year?", "Richard Sokolov", "It\u2019s hard to predict what next year is going to be but as David said we anticipate that the next year will certainly not be as large year on bankruptcies as we had this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Vincent Chao", "I know we spent quite a bit of time on the impact of the dollar and tourism sales, but just curious if you could maybe give some more specific color about Miami and then specifically Brickell Center.", "David Simon", "Well, Miami is feeling some of the heat from obviously Latin America but actually the leasings at Brickell.", "Richard Sokolov", "Brickell is doing very well. It's opening fall of next year. We've been announcing periodically the tenants that are starting up with the wonderful mix of designer tenants and restaurants and it is anchored by Saks with the Cinema. And if you have been down there, it's a very incredible project with two condo towers, the East Hotel and two office buildings in addition to the retail in a market that is really the financial center of that market. So we're very excited about it going forward.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, so safe to say no impact on demand despite some of the maybe tourism impacts in the near-term, so similar to your comments for the other overall.", "David Simon", "I think what I said earlier is consistent with that retailers. Now look, that's going to attract the better long term thinking retailers. So the fact that tourism is a little soft right now; doesn't detract the better retailer. When I say better, I'm not just talking mix, but just they're better retailers. So I was just trying to explain to you, what's been reported in our sales per square foot but I also made the comment to you, I don't think that is going to detract from the demand of our real estate and our ability to drive comp NOI because we're going after the better retailers. And the better retailers will work through a quarter or two of sales volatility for whatever reason. And that's the point I've been trying to make to a lot of folks a lot of time over retail sales. Retail sales is interesting, but not a predictor comp NOI growth and we've done all sorts of regression analysis. I've talked about this ad nauseam, but we report the facts for you to have, but it doesn't detract from the ability to generate increased cash flow, because that's more supply and demand oriented and what the market rent of our space rolling over is, and what that particular location is, and we got a good space and a good mall, you're going to be there to generate, given that rent will lower, that rent has been there for seven years. You go look at where that rent was rolling over seven years ago. So and that's why we are re-leasing spreads of 11 bucks a foot. That's the focus. The volatility of retail sales is more interesting from a retailer point of view less from the landlord. So, take New York City street retail. There is volatility in that retail sales there but has the market value of that real estate changed. Probably if you talk to a lot of people, they would probably tell you, no. ", "Operator", "We have another question from the line of Mike Muller from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Mueller", "A couple of questions here. One, you may have indirectly answered before but what was your share of the lease term that you booked this quarter?", "David Simon", "It\u2019s in our supplemental.", "Michael Mueller", "The share of it is because I thought that was the consolidated amount?", "David Simon", "Well, if it is consolidated, that's our share. We may have a little minority interest in that. But if it is consolidated, it's our share, right?", "Michael Mueller", "And then secondly on the outlet development side, can you talk a little bit about the returns you are seeing when you compare Europe starts to US to Asia and how you think about the pecking order of opportunities?", "David Simon", "I would say that the due development in Europe tends to be a little lower than -- our developments here around a 11% return on cost generally. In Europe they may be a touch lower, say 8 or 9 to start with. And in Asia we really don\u2019t do unless they are double digits because you got tax impact and we want a better risk adjusted return. I would say they are probably around the 12% or 13% range.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it. Okay. And I guess as you are thinking about opportunities going forward, is it more skewed towards the US for new starts at this point or do you think you're going to see a little bit more pickup in Europe?", "David Simon", "Europe, like I said, we're really excited on the Provence deal, 90% of it's -- it's a big project and a big market that hasn\u2019t seen a quality outlet like that. So that's good news. There are two or three others through McArthurGlen that were making good progress, and one in Spain that we hope to start construction in '16, as we go through the permitting. So that's up there as well. Another one in the western part of Paris that we are making good progress on, other one in Belgium where we are making good progress on. And in Asia, we've got two or three others that are a little more difficult to predict but we've got our second one in Malaysia that we\u2019re confident that we will get started as well as Mexico. In Mexico we expect to start one next year as well. So we're making progress.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.", "Carol Kemple", "How does your volume of temporary and pop-up tenants for this holiday season compare to the recent past? And then historically do you know what rate of those tenants convert to a longer-term lease once their temporary lease expires?", "David Simon", "The pop-up, generally, they don\u2019t convert -- the main pop-ups to decide whether they want to do a longer term deal. But I would say, generally there is an increase this year, primarily because we have a little bit more space from the bankruptcies that we've had this year. But Carol, just to remind you, we don\u2019t include that in our occupancy. It's got to be a year in that, but there will be more activity in pop-up stores for the season just because now we have got a little bit more vacancy due to some of the bankruptcies.", "Carol Kemple", "And I was thinking of your American Girl Store that's open in Castleton, I've seen where they are basically doing that to test the Indianapolis market. Are you seeing more retailers not just doing a pop-up store for the season but more so to actually test the market?", "David Simon", "You are starting to see a little bit more of that. I think that's safe to say.", "Operator", "We do have another question that comes from the line of Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill, please go ahead.", "Ryan Peterson", "I just wanted to ask about the Houston Galleria and the Houston market and if you guys have seen any change in the shopper demographics there or the retail sales trends more generally and what your expectations are going forward?", "David Simon", "In what sense?", "Ryan Peterson", "Just whether you think that Houston will be hit, whether retail is kind of the second impact of oil prices there?", "David Simon", "Our Galleria is such a great asset. It tends to -- it's kind of the unambiguous number one. For market of that size, it's kind of unambiguous number one shopping center. So it tends to whether any economic downturn generally, but I will say this. Our retailers are not immune to a little bit of a down economy and Houston is also a big tourist market for the Mexican nationals. So there might be some slight sales, retail sales impact. But it will have no impact to the long term great asset that Houston Galleria is as well as we're doing a significant amount of transformation of that asset with the new Saks store, the new Saks Wing, the new Webster's which is going to open in the next thirty days or so. We have a lot of phenomenal stuff going on there, but sure because retail sales be marginally impacted there. Sure, but Houston Galleria tends to continue to way outperform just because it's such a great asset. Rick I don't know if you want to add anything.", "Richard Sokolov", "I think it is very well positioned and as David said, it's got the unique mix of anchors, restaurants and small shops in that market and it's been very enduring over cycles in the energy belt for decades. And if anything, well I think Houston generally has become less of a -- I would certainly say twenty plus years ago, was more boom bust. But with the medical, it's with the universities, the medical facilities there, it's much more diversified economy than just oil and gas.", "Operator", "We do have another question that comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ", "Steve Sakwa", "Just two quick questions. I know you've talked a bit about the weakness in the US and all that business. But just what about stuff north of the border, south of the border? Just how kind of are the international assets performing?", "David Simon", "I'm sorry I didn't hear your first part.", "Steve Sakwa", "Sorry, is that better?", "David Simon", "Yes that's better thanks.", "Steve Sakwa", "I know you've talked about the weakness in the tourism markets for the outlet business here in the US. I'm just curious how the assets in Canada, Mexico, over in Japan, the few that you have over in Europe, how are the non-US ones performing from a sales and leasing Perspective?", "David Simon", "Again I don't want to overreact. I mean there is a little bit of softness due to the strong dollar U.S. tourism. You're seeing that in all sorts of businesses, hotel business whatever, maybe we are dealing with it. But the fact is the international properties are actually performing very-very well. Europe retail sales is actually relatively impressive, in the Klepierre portfolio, the outlet sales that we have with McArthurGlen are very impressive. Japan, you see that's in our 8-K. They are very impressive, up about 7%. Korea, a little bit soft, I think the only market that's a little soft is Korea, a little bit because they are not the stars, but whatever the last version was. Mars whatever and the Chinese consumer they're probably going a little bit less to Korea for the time being. But I would say Mexico sales are, we've go one asset. Canada is great. Toronto is terrific. Montreal is finding its market increasing. So generally those centers are very-very, we've been very pleased with those results.", "Steve Sakwa", "And I guess the second question, you sort of briefly touched on Klepierre. I didn't really hear much on the call but just how has the integration gone? If you had to kind of rank on a scale of 1 to 10 of just all the things you want to do, where are you guys in the process of transforming the combined company? ", "David Simon", "You mean with respect to Corio?", "Steve Sakwa", "Yes Klepierre Corio and just kind of overall business [multiple speakers].", "David Simon", "I just want to -- look, they brought Corio, we don\u2019t know and then so we are not integrating with them. I just wanted to distinguish. I would say, look, they've gone, over the three years we've owned it, they have done a lot of transformation, selling a bunch of stuff, buying a bunch of stuff. That's pretty much packed them. The big focus next year is really operationally which they through osmosis or improving their capabilities of doing that, and that's been the big focus, I'd say in '16. Now that the integration with Corio was pretty much done. The sale of the big Carrefour portfolio was done and so I think it's going to be an operational story. But we are not operating the business, we're providing strategic input and I think they've done a very good job of gleaming whatever nuggets of strategy we are able to impart and ignoring the ones that have no value. What, sometimes we don\u2019t have the right strategy. So they are doing a good job. But I think operationally there is, I would say they are the first to admit, they can continue to improve just like we can. And I think that's a big focus for them in the upcoming years. But we are not integrating. I they are running their business.", "Steve Sakwa", "No-no, I understand that. I'm just saying sitting as Chairman you kind of can sit at the top and look at what they are executing strategically and just trying to figure out how much of the playbook has been done and how much is left to do?", "David Simon", "Well, there is always a gap in terms of how we might do things versus how they do things there. I still think there is room where they could be operationally better and that will take longer for them to achieve, but I am confident that they will get better. And we will help out as much as we can. They are pretty good and they are doing a good job.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of DJ Busch from Green Street Advisors , please go ahead.", "DJ Busch", "Just a quick follow-up on the Hudson Bay partnership. Is the opportunity set to do deals like a Kaufhof greater abroad versus here in the States? I guess how do you see that investment growing from a geographic perspective?", "David Simon", "I do think perhaps the international business may offer a few more opportunities, but they are very creative folks along with our resources dedicated to it, so I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities but I would say maybe marginally more opportunities internationally than here. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities as well.", "DJ Busch", "And then is the joint venture open to kind of retail leaseback opportunities outside of the traditional department stores as well?", "David Simon", "Yes.", "DJ Busch", "Okay. And not to belabor the point on international, the softness in international tourism, but the mills operating metrics were pretty impressive again. I think those are obviously greatly influenced by Sawgrass. Is that similar to your comments on the Galleria? Is Sawgrass one of those assets that kind of bucks the trend?", "David Simon", "Yes. But we did feel a little bit of softness there as well. So all of these asset is about to trend, but they might have again the retail sales, not the cash flow may have some short term impact. But Sawgrass had a little bit of softness as well. It is not immune.", "Operator", "Thank you for that. We have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the call over to David Simon, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.", "David Simon", "Thank you so much and we will talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Lauren and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Ward, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Tom Ward", "Thank you, Lauren. Good morning everyone. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, our Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I am pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a great year. We opened, started, and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest cost. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.", "Our full-year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86 which peaked our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss reported during the year which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $0.22 gain on the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year, as well as $0.12 negative impact from foreign currency devaluations. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact from WPG spin-off in the prior year, and the net loss mentioned above, full-year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last five years. For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.", "Now, let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014, due to the timing of lease up of more 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments, as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year. Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.", "By the end of the year we replaced more than 70% of the space loss to tenant bankruptcies and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the two together, and that's a 100 basis point differential. Leasing activity remained healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets reported leasing spread of $10.62 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96 which was up more than 4% compared to last year reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.", "As I mentioned retailer demand per space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business were adding brand extensions, and creating new brands, and pure-play retailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. Retailers who opened bricks-and-mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition cost. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When the retailer opens a physical store in a market they see their online sales increase, and likewise, if they close the store they see their online sales in that market decline.", "Successful omnichannel retailers are increasing their buy online and pickup in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers, but also facilitates incremental purchases and upsell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.", "For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619 a foot. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at the Mills and we were down slightly at our tourist oriented premium outlets, and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales as these unique centers which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter.", "I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. But let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year including the Holiday season, traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays, and traffic at the Mills increased slightly for the year as well.", "Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full-year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points.", "I will strongly remind you we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions, or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number. Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014 and this includes any NOI contribution from Kle'pierre.", "Now let me quickly talk as we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter, but I'll give you some highlights, at the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion.", "During the quarter, we opened two significant expansions and completed number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo which includes the new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands, expansion of The Colonnade Sawgrass where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops and two restaurants, and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall, and Menlo Park. We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including The Shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16 and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well.", "Now not to be ignored we continue to be active on new development. We opened two new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa both off to very strong sales start. Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg both scheduled to open later this year, as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul, Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017, this will be fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge developed a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport which will be our fourth outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017. Two new full price developments are ongoing as you know one in Miami, a Brickell Centre opening this fall, and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017.", "Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks; Clearfork will be open air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.", "Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place and we recently completed the sale of Columbia George outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner McArthurGlen the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value added expansion opportunities.", "Let me run through the balance sheet, two senior offerings and totaling $1.9 billion was done last year with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed four series of senior notes totaling 1.7 with an weighted average coupon of 6. We closed 23 new mortgages with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5%, or I'm sorry 4.5 times, and recently we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.", "Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last five years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60 which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. Okay, that's pretty busy.", "Now, let me talk about our guidance, for '16, it's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and again will be industry leading. Our range is based on the following assumptions: comp NOI for our portfolio malls, outlets, and mills, of at least 3.5%; and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio; no additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed; continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015; and importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so an average diluted share count of $362 million.", "We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "David Simon", "Hello, operator?", "Operator", "Yes. Can you hear me?", "David Simon", "We don't have any question ma'am. Let's go to the next.", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, UBS. Please proceed.", "Ross Nussbaum", "David, you touched on the link between retailers having stores at your Malls and Internet sales in that local market. One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy cost being measured as a percentage of sales just at that Mall store. When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical Mall? Because to me that seems like an important shift in the business going on.", "David Simon", "Well I don't -- again I -- let's separate media narrative to reality. But we're including anything, any sale that comes from their store and it could be driven by the Internet is in our sales that come from that store. So we're getting the benefit of that. And so I still think occupancy cost is still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed.", "However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to affect evaluate what their decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market and that is a benefit to us -- not that we have a lot of stores that are risk for closures other than through bankruptcy.", "So at a 12.3% given our productivity and given where our rents are and what you've seen from the history, I mean we've got, we still have a very good run rate to continue increase our rents.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. And then a second question. Can you touch on your interest in Macy's real estate now that they are clear that they want to do something there? In particular, I guess in theory, it would be with your Hudson's Bay joint venture. But may be just touch on your interest level there. Thanks.", "David Simon", "Well look they've been a very important partner of ours and obviously they have very good real estate. So I can say nothing really is happening that's material or meaningful other than our normal ongoing business and that's been very productive and we have a excellent relationship with Macy's both from a real estate and a corporate point of view. They've been very supportive in our efforts to enhance the quality of our real estate through our expansion and redevelopment activity and if they've got ideas on how they want to look at the real estate, we're happy to do it either as part of the HPC JV or on our own. But nothing really is happening other than day-to-day business.", "Rick Sokolov", "And the only thing I would add in the course of that day-to-day business we acquired a Bloomingdale's store at Stanford demolished it creating small shop, they build a new Bloomingdale's store. We combined three Macy's stores into two at Del Amo to facilitate our expansion. So that day-to-day business does involve activities with respective of their existing stores.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thanks guys.", "David Simon", "And, look, I think it's very interesting that the market needs to understand on these retailers Macy's and the Penney and down the list. I mean does that vast, vast, vast majority of their stores have four-wall profits. And Rick and I just did a tour in Texas this week and I'll let you guys figure out who the retailers are, a major note in Texas are, and we hear that repeatedly. So, Macy's, I'm sure that vast, vast, vast, vast majority of those stores that they have four-wall profits. So I don't anticipate there to be significant changes but we will see and I think it will give us the opportunity. I think Rick made a great point in that. We can pickoff a Bloomingdale's at the Stanford in the middle of the Mall and release it to high-end shops and they can build a new store that's a win-win for everybody involved. So I think there will be a few of those as well.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure. Operator?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy, Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Just a question about the balance sheet and as you think about your very conservative balance sheet with exceptional cost of capital and access to capital. And I'm curious as you think about maintaining that really strong balance sheet, how much of it is thinking about opportunities down the road -- and I don't know how quickly those opportunities will come into view -- and how much of it is that your concern perhaps about the macro environment? And I recognize that use of capital you can buy back stock, which you haven't really done in the back half of the year, and you have a very large development and redevelopment pipeline which is funded by free cash flow. But your overall leverage metrics and access to capital are -- never been better in the Company's history. And I'm just trying to think about what's driving that in your mind as you run the Company?", "David Simon", "Well I think it's a great point and it's ignored a lot in terms of how people look at our company. But I love the fact that our interest coverage is 4.5 times given the size of our, I should say fixed charge coverage, not just interest coverage. And I love the fact that we can fund our development and new development from our free cash flow, and yet at the same time have a compound annual growth rate, dividend increase of 18%. I mean you can't put those kind of metrics against anybody and they can't issue in a day paper at under 3% when the CMBS market is cracking and the life company market is cracking and the high yield market is cracking, and yet we're able to go whether it's in the Euro market or the U.S. fixed income market but to place that kind of paper in that kind of speed and it's undervalued by the equity markets.", "So me that is sacrosanct. And I have been very reluctant enter the big deal business, I continue to be. And where we are so busy, I mean, I -- as you know, I have a hard time speaking generally and I -- when they get -- when we write our script, I can barely get the words out because I didn't take elocution classes in high school. But the fact of the matter is we are extremely busy building and adding value to the portfolio using our external free cash flow that remains the focus. I think we'll be very conservative on buying our stock back in today's market and my view on the big deal business really hasn't changed.", "Christy McElroy", "Hi David, it's Christy here. Just following up on some of the stats that you mentioned earlier, with traffic in the malls flat, but sales up 5.7% which is encouraging. I'm wondering if you have a sense for what's driving that differential, are people staying in the Mall longer, visiting fewer stores, are conversions higher, just several retailers out there commenting that Mall traffic is down and the impact that that perception is any share prices, just any information that we can get from your data, would be helpful.", "David Simon", "Yes, I think it's a very important point to make the following distinction. So remember we get the overall traffic number and yet most of the folks that quote -- most of the folks that quote numbers are based on algorithms, so it's not real necessarily data like we have, and number two, is it is derived from certain stores. So it doesn't, it necessarily equate the mall traffic and it gives you store data but not mall traffic data and that's the distinction that I really important to make. And I will tell you the trend though with mobile technology is that the consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment more educated, they're doing less browsing and they're going to less stores.", "So we think that the store data that you get is in fact maybe it's a little bit not that far off but it doesn\u2019t represent mall traffic and I just think the consumers go and do a few less stores because they\u2019re doing less browsing because they\u2019re more informed prior to their visits.", "But overall the mall traffic is what we say it is, our comp sales are what they are, and its so operator driven, you could be in a category where one retailer is selling and another one is not and it's not tied with all boats but it's really retail and operator driven. And the good news is overall given the size of our portfolio, we have a pretty good handle on this -- overall we're having pretty good comp sales increases.", "Christy McElroy", "So the bottom-line is the same number of people are coming to the mall, but sales are up 5.7% there are just spending more while they are there?", "David Simon", "That's the bottom-line and they may be going to few less stores. I think, yes, you're probably right, I probably could have shortened the explanation but that's the bottom-line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt, Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Craig Schmidt", "Thank you. It's Craig Schmidt.", "David Simon", "I hope that's Craig. I hope that's Craig.", "Craig Schmidt", "Yes it is Craig.", "David Simon", "Right.", "Craig Schmidt", "No transformation. My question is really on the future role of anchors at regional malls. How is your view changing of the anchors? I mean, there seems to be a lot of repurposing going on, such as the JVs and Seritage. And I'm also thinking about what you've done at Florida Mall and what you're going to be doing at Shops at Riverside: it seems like you're taking a somewhat different view of what the anchor's role is.", "David Simon", "Well, look I think it's such as and I'll let Rick weigh in here. I mean it's such as real estate specific equation but in a lot of cases you know the vendors that go into a department store in certain cases would rather have mall stores. And when we feel as that's the case while we'd rather just have the mall, we just rather have the vendor as a retailer and we don't necessarily want to rely on the department store to bring those vendors.", "So again it's specific and it's all about creating the right environment and experience and in some cases having this department store as part of that is vital, I take Del Amo with Nordstrom. They built a fantastic store it is so complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment and that Nordstrom store and the environment is helping us create.", "In other cases, the vendor, we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey all at all. And we feel like those vendors that were in that store actually would have a better experience in our redone environment than they would in the Saks box. So it's and Florida Mall is a great example of just taking underperforming Saks that was not attracting the consumer, we went from, I think at $10 million Saks to $50 million of revenue generated after repurposing that that box, and that's what it's all about. Rick?", "Rick Sokolov", "Yes, the only thing I would add is that every mall has its own story. So for frankly at Roosevelt Field the addition of Neiman Marcus is going to be a fundamental expansion of the market area that's traditional fashion anchor. At Florida Mall, we added the Crayola Experience that in that market is just doing great business and expands the trade area of that property. What we're all about is trying to put in the appropriate retailers to maximize the importance of our properties in the markets that they serve.", "Craig Schmidt", "Okay. And how is some of the progress on your JVs with Seritage?", "David Simon", "Pretty good I just had breakfast with Dan. I think, hopefully we\u2019ll get four or five started this year Rick, right? That's the plan.", "Rick Sokolov", "Yes, we literally we've got performance, plans done. That frankly the most interesting timeline is working with Sears is to how their store is going to be reconfigured and that just takes some time. But we've identified the replacement tenants, we've identified the performance, and as David said we anticipate having developments underway in at least half the properties we have in our joint venture this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Hi, good morning. Just on the topic of occupancy cost, it has been steadily increasing over the past few years, as you've done a good job of really being able to push the rents despite slower sales growth. But I was just wondering: Is this something we should be concerned about? To what extent are retailers pushing back, or are the higher occupancy costs just a part of doing business in a strong mall now?", "David Simon", "Well look I mean at 12.3%, I would not worry at all. And I think we have to put into perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean we are in a, I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations to pick up the extraordinary gain and losses that I mentioned. But if you just look at our numbers and the fact that we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that move towards durable goods and increase in healthcare cost and taxes and general economic malaise, we overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here and then obviously the strong dollar.", "If you look at our outlet business I mean traffic was up across the portfolio yet sales were down there because the international tourist spent less, it's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3% the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continue to well outperform GDP growth, and, if it were up 15%, 16% maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got rate insurance to continue grow their cash flow.", "And if you look at our comp NOI which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5% and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman get the conservative economist to Goldman. Not the bullish one get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%?", "Caitlin Burrows", "Okay.", "David Simon", "Well tell me what do they say, Caitlin. I want to say 1.5%; I mean we're 2.5% --", "Caitlin Burrows", "Sure.", "David Simon", "We're 200 basis points above that and part of that is because we do have leases that are under market and we will be able to continue to push that. At the same time our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for investors at the same time we want our retailers as strong as possible it's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it and I\u2019m confident we can continue to do it not completely, sometimes we screw up, on -- it's all the various ends there.", "But at the end of the day we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors that's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increase the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time industry leading. We try to find that equilibrium we have an insurance policy.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Got it, okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't be concerned yet there. And then just --", "David Simon", "I will let you know okay.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Okay. And then just regarding your current share price, the market appears to be supporting other mall REITs that might have some take-out potential while perhaps punishing you as a potential buyer. So the stock's down today. Can you comment on basically turning this argument over and by buying yourself and repurchasing shares -- I know you mentioned before that you'd be very conservative with doing that in the future?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think what Bilerman said earlier, asked earlier, I mean we are out of the big deal business. So people can speculate all they want. And I do think the market should understand and as our plan that we will be conservative on buybacks. As some of the higher -- I understand Tom that some of the higher estimates out there on first call were due to the buyback number. So that's part of the issue there.", "We're going to be conservative there. I love having a great balance sheet. This is not a short-term game here. This is long-term. But I'm out of the big deal business, somebody wants to call me up and talk to me and show me how to make money, I'm all happy to have that conversation.", "But my opinion hasn't changed since really last Spring. So I don't really know what else I can tell you on that front. And we won't be afraid to buy back stock, it's just we're not planning right now. We have the authorization to do it. People are betting against that for whatever reason that's the markets but we have a growing dividend and growing earnings and that's usually a bad thing to bet against.", "Caitlin Burrows", "I agree. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Good morning, David.", "David Simon", "How are you doing, Alex?", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Doing well, doing well. So just quickly, I'll go to the second question first and then I'll go to my first question second, because you mentioned dividends. Last year you guys to raised the dividend quarterly. Obviously it was up almost 20% for the year. This year should the expectation -- you didn't raise it from fourth quarter. So should we think about just more normalized sort of annual increase? Or do you think that we'll see a steady state of increases throughout the year? And part of that is just trying to read into cash flow use. May be with what's going on you guys are trying to husband more cash; or maybe it was just how you raised it a lot last year and now you want to go back to an annual increase.", "David Simon", "Yes, I think what we were, we've always -- we've been chasing our taxable income, as you know, and there is a lot that goes into that equation. If we kept it at $1.60 that would be 6% growth year-over-year, I would think that that would be at the bare minimum of what happens but I would start to like to get into a normalized once a year raise. So we don't do it sequentially, sequentially like we've been doing at quarter after quarter and I think that should be your expectation going forward.", "And we'll probably assess that at near the end of each year now as we had in the past. But that's subject to change obviously with the input of our taxable income calculation as well as obviously our boards input, but at the very, very least 6% growth, over 6% growth. I would like for it to be annualized and -- I'm sorry once a year when we evaluate it, which would probably most likely be in the back half, so we can position it for the proceeding or the subsequent year. But as you know with our NOI growth of least over 6-plus-percent, our taxable income is going to be increasing. And so that will be driving our dividend increase up as well.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then the second question is, on -- I think it was in your response to Christy's question, if shoppers are getting more selective and visiting fewer stores: one, it sounds like a merchandising issue from retailers; and then, two, does that mean that we should expect higher retailer turnover? Like we should see more stores closing if they can't get their merchandising right? Or your view was the retailers that had trouble attracting shoppers last year are quickly addressing their merchandising issues?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think the retailers clearly are in that boat, and they're not as, what there is, we did experience in '15 a number of bankruptcies of kind of the really poor performing retailers. There was clearly a slowdown in retail sales in the back half of the year. And then when you couple that with the tourism issue, you couple that with the normal weather, I mean it was so to speak a perfect storm, and it took a lot of retailers out. I mean we've seen this movie and I don't know if it's Rocky 7 -- I'm ready for Creed. Okay. So we don't have to keep seeing this movie over again.", "I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated adapting very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic for more stores is -- the onus is on us. I mean, we've got a great environment which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on in the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and that they at least did in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think clearly as our retailers sneak up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean all of that is going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores.", "So it's all the work-in-progress, we've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know we're doing a lot of that, we're at the forefront of lot of that activity to try and figure out how the best way to communicate to the consumer, so they go see eight or 10 stores as opposed to four, five, or six.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And then just for your -- I know how much you love your Crooked Stick suggestion box, but as you guys do a lot of the development and redevelopment, it would just be helpful from our end to have a table in the supp that just sort of quantifies the amount and quarter that developments and redevelopments will come online, just for a modeling perspective.", "David Simon", "Yes, we're happy, well, I think I'm happy to do that, it doesn't -- now I will say this. I know there was a comment or two that said about our returns going down absolutely not, our mix changes every quarter which we probably, Tom, could do a better job of pointing that out. And I assure you that if we are doing to deliver; I mean we do have to have a materiality threshold for the size of our company. But I assure you and the market that if we have a major development or a major redevelopment where we're going to lay an egg, we'll let you know.", "That's not what happened in today's supplement. We had some things come off and we had some things come on, just like we do every quarter and Tom is happy to walk you through what went in and what went out. But I assure the market if we're going to lay an egg on anything that's new or whether it's new or redevelopment we'll let you know with some materiality threshold obviously. But that's not the case with the changes in our development pipeline and redevelopment pipeline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore. Please proceed.", "Steve Sakwa", "Just I guess two quick questions. You mentioned that, I guess, comp sales were up. I think you 5.7%. When I look in the supplemental and just looked at total sales it's basically flat December to December. And I realize that comp sales are only a piece of the overall sales. But as you replace weaker tenants with new ones I would think there's an uplift. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the strong comp sales.", "David Simon", "Remember our comp you got to be in place for 24 months. So that's not the case, that's number one. And number two, I mean we did have our -- that the -- we did have slippage in our tourist oriented centers not just the outlets but in a number of the malls that were I mean that we had to deal with. And again it wasn't a traffic issue and it's not anything other than and I know we've seen it from the retailers, but the tourism that is important to the economic growth of the United States of America may have come if they spent less and we have unbelievable great properties that in the long run are fantastic.", "And the sales have come out. I mean we have small shops and medium size shops that do $30 million, $40 million of volumes in some of these places. But the tourism affected that. And as you know we've got a lot going on in some of our major properties moving tenants in and out. So we put it all together and total sales were relatively flat. We don't view that as a big deal.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. Any sense as to what -- of the overall sales, comp sales make up what percentage of that total sales number? Is that two-thirds of the bucket, three-quarters, a half?", "David Simon", "70%.", "Steve Sakwa", "70%? Okay. And then I guess as it comes to -- or in terms of bankruptcies this year, I realize you guys got hit pretty hard last year. You're working through. What is your expectation for bankruptcies this year? And how is that impacting that sort of 3.5% NOI number that you're giving us?", "David Simon", "Well, look at, it is. I mean, we still have lease-up from last year, and we're -- we've budgeted in some of the weaker tenants whether they go bankrupt or we do, we renegotiate short-term deals while we replace them with strong tenants I mean that\u2019s all factored in there. So we have been conservative on overage rent. I mean these -- we're not a perfect science model I mean, nor is the U.S. economy. So we do the best that we can, budgeting the best that we can, being as conservative as we can.", "We clearly thought in '15, we would hit 4%; we didn't because of the overage rent thing that we did mention. And that was, as you know, overage rent you hit breakpoints or if you're over the breakpoints there is a lot of volatility the fourth quarter is important in total sales. And I mean that's hard to necessarily model. But we took a very conservative approach in how we look to the books at year-end. And we're taking a reasonably conservative approach; we still have work to do. But conservative sales, conservative lease-up, conservative restructuring at certain tenants whether in or out of bankruptcy is all factored into that number. But importantly Steve and this is the true distinction. I mean our number is -- our 3.5% is different than most people, okay. So you have to put that into perspective.", "Steve Sakwa", "No, I do. I appreciate that. I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you think the 1.3 million will go up or down in '16? Is that -- do you think you have similar amounts?", "David Simon", "I think it will go down, I think it will go down, '15 was a big year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord. Please proceed.", "Paul Morgan", "Just in terms of the impact you mentioned, if I understand correctly, in terms of occupancy from the space that was added but wasn't -- and is leased but wasn't occupied at year-end. Was that, I mean was that sort of part of the budget that may be we just didn't fully understand going into the quarter? Or was there any openings that may be kind of slipped into the first quarter that were expected for the fourth quarter?", "David Simon", "I think when you open a new project and you get the 90%, what was it 90.7% or whatever it was? I mean when you open a new project and you're at 90.7%, year one that's pretty good it\u2019s not just as 96% or 97% and that creates a little bit drag on the overall occupancy. So that's just real estate development. I mean I don\u2019t know of any project that opens a 100% occupied I mean may be a few do.", "And as I think we mentioned in the third quarter, we did put a lot in the system last year. So our resources were maxed out between all the redevelopments and all the new stuff, I again it's not like we're delivering these things at 60% occupied or 50%. I mean 90% after, 90.7% after at the end of year one is pretty good. So I think that's pretty good execution.", "Paul Morgan", "Yes, okay. And then you've got a lot of your kind of A+ assets that are under construction right now with expansions and redevelopments. I mean is there any dislocation that takes place either in the numbers or just in terms of traffic? I mean if some of the malls are kind of getting torn up in pretty major ways as you're doing the expansions. I mean does that trickle through to sales in your expectation or CAM or anything that's material?", "David Simon", "Well, I -- look, I mean I -- we don't want excuses, but, yes, I mean we ripped up Roosevelt Field, we ripped up King of Prussia, and we -- those were in -- we didn't take them out of our sales numbers and those things. You move tenants around. We had a number of that -- of those scenarios this year, which is investing in the future and it's not an immediate return.", "So I would tell you that all of those we had a setback in Copley, because we're ripping Copley to shreds, moving tenants around, making room for the potential of the apartments/condo tower. So that's clearly affecting us. But at the end of the day I mean that's just -- we're just not going to -- we're not going to use that as a basis to say, here is a little bit of a slippage, but yes it clearly is affecting -- it clearly affected '15 both from a NOI point of view and a sales point of view. And -- because a lot of these were moving traffic around, were closing entrances, and there is absolutely dislocation going on.", "Paul Morgan", "Thanks. Then just lastly, I mean any update on your kind of current thoughts about mixed-use? You've got obviously some of it in your redevelopment pipeline. But is it -- as you think about your shadow pipeline, both with your own properties and then specifically with some of the Seritage opportunities, I mean, how big a piece of your portfolio is residential or other mixed-use? Sort of something we could see over the next decade?", "David Simon", "I still think it's going to grow, but selectively. I mean, I kind of view this as the good news in that it's almost like our international investments. We've had such great results from our international investments. I mean, if you looked at what's on our books and what the value of this real estate is it's a homerun, a homerun. If you look at the yield on cash flow returns, a homerun. That gives us -- the only wrinkle on that is we lost $10 million in China.", "But if you look at Kle'pierre, McArthurGlen our own development in Japan, Korea, Canada, homerun. We've also had great experience. And I can't think of a problem we've had, Rick, in your mixed used development. So I -- as we gain more confidence in that business I think we'll continue to do it. But as you know that's so driven by supply and demand and it's so specific to the real estate. But we like it, we have had good success in it, we'll continue with it assuming we can continue to produce the results that we produced in that area.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Paul Adornato", "Hi, good morning. Was wondering if you could compare the performance of your top-tier properties, minus the noise of any redevelopments, versus the bottom tier. The market seems to dislike Class B properties. I was wondering if your lower tier is subject to some of those same risks.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think our portfolio is the -- our results and our averages kind of the indicate -- indicative of kind of what results were. So I don't think there is any unusual trend. I think market sometimes may be overreacts to the only game in town mall. We think that business is good and very viable. If that's the only game in town market, have too much retail, it's going to be heard, but that could be in an A market too. I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and the not exciting markets that we still own.", "The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tour of spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact, not a long-term issue I hope. And -- but the tourist reined in a little bit, they rein in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, North and South of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. We have Mexican Nationals to shop at our -- some of our premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds I mean, that's -- that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town which is -- we are in some of those markets but they continue to perform very well.", "Paul Adornato", "Thanks. And as a follow-up, could you talk about rent growth at the luxury side of the retail business? Which we expect, given the dollar.", "David Simon", "I think it's good, because as you know a lot of that even with the growth, even with that the tourism spending down most of those leases are well below market and -- number one. And number two is, they are still unique enough properties that when the opportunity presents itself that the demand is still there for that real estate. So very few people -- I'd say very few retailers don't -- that are of that nature that we want in those properties don't look at the long-term opportunity. But if it -- if there is a difference it's on the margin. But we still -- we're still pretty insulated from that, demand is good and our leases are under market there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thank you. So, David, hypothetical question. Given that we know a little bit more about the market and what the equity markets are doing versus last spring, all else equal -- and I know Macerich has sold some assets -- but in your mindset today and what you know about the world, would you still be a buyer of Macerich, all else equal, if it was back in the market today?", "David Simon", "I'm not going to comment on that.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay.", "David Simon", "All I can -- all I'm going to comment on is where we are today. And I've explained that a couple different places, okay.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay. Okay, and then the second question on your Outlet business, you've already talked about the traffic or tourists being down a little bit. But does that eventually translate into lease spreads? Where it's not just the overage rents that are taking a little bit of a hit, but if this continues are your lease spreads that the tenants are willing to pay eventually become more at risk?", "David Simon", "Well, the reality is I wish they were at market, because then the volatility -- so just say, when we roll over a lease we try to get effective rent, which is base rent plus overage rent and the reason we have a little more volatility is because the lease hasn't expired. So the good news is as these leases expire we're going to be able to get them at market rent. I mean that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter, because we're not at market rent, we're not at market rent.", "So even with today's decrease in tours and spend, the important point though also is that the traffic was up and so that's an important point. I mean the traffic was up, it was really just the spend was down. And I think that's just going to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are a little more stable and anniversary these sales. But the -- it's our intention to make that overage volatility go away and that's marking the leases to market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Vincent Chao", "Yes, good morning or good afternoon. Just curious, going back to the 1.3 million square feet of bankruptcy space that was taken back, I thought I heard earlier that 70% had been re-let as of the end of the year. And apologize if I'd missed this, but I guess how did that stack up relative to your expectations? I mean, would you have expected to have more of that re-leased by now? And just I'll leave it at that.", "Rick Sokolov", "Hi. This is Rick. In fact, we were doing very well with that releasing. What we are going to do is we are not going to put our space on sale, we are holding margins. In fact, the rents for foot of the space that has to lease are above the rents of the tenants that left because of bankruptcy and we're making sure that we are getting in the right tenants at the right price, at the right space. So we're on track with that, and there you'll continue to see the benefit of that coming into this year as more of those leases open.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks. And on a slightly different topic, just going back to the -- sort of the changing profile of the mall and may be the decreasing importance of the anchors, particularly as a traffic driver, just curious if this -- or if you think about shortening lease terms from the traditional leased deals, five years or so, just so you have more control over how to control and create that experience, given that tastes change pretty quickly and things like that.", "Rick Sokolov", "When we do our leasing every space and every tenant has their own situation and we are strategic about our terms. If we feel that it's a tenant that is underperforming the mall, may be we'll do a shorter-term, if it's a tenant that were higher desires of having in the mall, we want them to remodel, we may give them a longer-term. So there is no overarching strategy on term, it's really a lease specific strategic decision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund, Jefferies. Please proceed.", "George Hoglund", "I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the trends in asking rents. Because what we've been hearing is that asking rents are down year-over-year in the A malls as it's getting a little bit tougher to back-fill space, and the balance of power may be shifting a little bit towards the tenants. Just wondering if you could just give some color on that.", "David Simon", "May I ask where do you hear that?", "George Hoglund", "Hearing it from brokers out there.", "David Simon", "And what cities are these brokers from? Are they talking about like city street space? Or they -- I mean is it mall space?", "George Hoglund", "It's mall space.", "David Simon", "Well, I think you could -- I would put more faith in what we would tell you and the answer is that we don't see that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Muller, JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Mike Mueller", "Yes. Hi. Just a couple quick ones here. I guess first, where do you see occupancy ending at year-end '16?", "David Simon", "We are projecting an increase from where we are this year.", "Mike Mueller", "Okay. Any shot at narrowing that down a little bit?", "David Simon", "No, no, because look the end of the day -- we're -- listen, we made our FFO this year, was $3.6 billion, right?", "Andy Juster", "Yes.", "David Simon", "So we -- which happen to be more than certain technology companies, I won't name names, okay. And -- I mean I know everybody wants all these metrics, but you've got to look at what we're all about, which is growing earnings, growing dividends, investing for the future. And I do think there is this move on metrics that I just want to put it in overall perspective, that it's not how we -- we don't stress over metrics the way others might. We're just focused on increasing our cash flow, investing for the future, making our properties the best they can be in a particular market for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers. And we will just tell you that we -- as we model all this we are expecting an increase in occupancy, it takes a lot of work. How many leases did we sign this year my friend?", "Rick Sokolov", "Over 10 million square feet.", "David Simon", "10 million square feet, right? So you know it's hard to model. But we've had a pretty good track record. But certain things were out of our control bankruptcies, tourism spend and so on. So again, it's a slight uptick and we hope to be able to achieve that.", "Mike Muller", "Okay. And then may be a quick Andy question. It looks like interest income tripled in the fourth quarter relative to the third, just wondering what's driving that?", "Andy Juster", "Now --", "Mike Muller", "I know it's not a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but still.", "Andy Juster", "Yes. We can get back to you on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum, Boenning. Please proceed.", "Floris van Dijkum", "David, Floris. Quick question on your NOI growth. You posted 7% this year. If you do that for 10 years you've basically almost doubled your NOI. Is it reasonable to expect that kind of growth going forward, sort of the 3% on top of your same-store numbers that you're expecting to post?", "David Simon", "Well, it's a good question. I can't -- 10 years is a hard time for me to project. But look, I think the redevelopment and development pipeline that we've got I mean I think we've got a pretty decent shot of continuing that as we go forward. I mean, I think fact is of course, as you know a lot of people who have doubted our ability to grow our earnings because of the size of the company and obviously math does make it a little bit harder, but the fact is nobody in our industry -- and when I say industry, I -- I'm talking about retail real estate, nobody in our subsector of our industry, retail real estate has been able to do that over a, sure a quarter here or quarter there, a year there, or year there. But over the life of our company nobody has been able to do this. I mean we started out with I think, if I can remember the math $200 million of earnings, we're at $3.6 billion, okay. That's not too shabby.", "As I said in my annual report quoting Adam Sandler, but nobody liked but I kind of thought it was funny. But point is I don't know, I -- but we got a good runway for the next few years, Floris.", "Floris van Dijkum", "One follow-up question may be, David, on Aventura. I noticed there it's not in your supplements, but there are potential plans for, I guess an expansion that Seritage is suing Turnberry over. Can you make any comments on that?", "David Simon", "No, we're not named in that lawsuit, so we have no -- and we haven't seen the complaints, so we've got nothing more to add.", "And the one question on the other income was the cash flow that we got from our investment in Value Retail, which tends to happen year-after-year, but it -- we -- since we only -- we cost account for it. For those of you old like me, you know what that means? We don't equity account for it. So we only book the income upon receipt of cash and it happened to be in that quarter, but it tends to happen year-after-year.", "Operator?", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference over to David Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay. Thank you. Very, very good questions. Appreciate staying with us and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22 year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first six months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period.", "Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our mall and premium outlet occupancy was 95.9%. The 20-basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%, and our base minimum rent was $50.43 which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location.", "And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date. Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period.", "Let me put a couple things in perspective. Reported retail sales continue to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously and is important to reiterate and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our premium outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the premium outlets was flat. In fact, our traffic in our outlet business thus far is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types.", "At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments including the completion of the connector at King of Prussia that will link the court and the plaza, creating 50 new specialty stores, a comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, a densification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott and multi-family residential units. We're also underway with the transformation of La Plaza in McAllen, Texas where we demolished the former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, four junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza, all of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability and construction includes among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria in Houston and on.", "Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger Outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland which will open in the fourth quarter of this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet Norfolk, Virginia which will open in mid-2017.", "We've got exciting projects in \u2013 outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France, South Korea and Canada, all will open in 2017, also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects. And we're also continuing construction with our high end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by Neiman The Shops at Clearfork.", "Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also bought our partner out in our Naples and Venice outlets. So we now effectively own 90% of these two great assets. We completed \u2013 turning to capital markets. We completed a successful euro senior offering, \u20ac500 million at 1.25% for nine years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry leading balance sheet as we hope you know.", "We increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-year, 3% from the second quarter and we'll pay at least $6.50 which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance.", "Questions are available.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, thank you. David, you referenced that there was a pickup in June relative to some of the other months. Do you think that we will start to see the annualization of the international shopper pullback? And will that have less of an impact in the numbers going forward?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look I think it's hard to predict, Craig. It's good to see the June sales for our retailers were up. We're starting to see the stronger dollar anniversary, so it'll have less impact on the metrics, but I think more importantly, we're seeing other than the anomaly I talked about in the one \u2013 with the one state, our sales were fine and the portfolio outside the tour centers, sales are fine. And we're operating pretty effectively in a very slow growth U.S. economy. So the anniversary impact is coming up in the next few months. We're starting to see it stabilize, but it's very hard to predict.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then you've expanded your presence obviously in Las Vegas with Crystals, I just wondered if there would be differing strategies going forward, where you might take Forum Shops one direction and Crystals in another?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think they're \u2013 as you know, Vegas, there's so much tourism there, I mean 50 million visitors a year. Each has its own distinct separate marketplace. They, obviously Forum Shops is bigger. It caters to not only a high end consumer, but also a broader consumer. Crystals is more luxury oriented. So I think they both have distinct markets. We'll continue to take advantage of those great assets, and continue to drive the income up in both. So I don't think there'll be a huge change in strategy, but a continuation of improving operations in both assets.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Good morning, David.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Look, I know a lot of the metrics were fairly positive. I guess the one that just sort of jumped out was sort of the rolling 12 month leasing spread which had a noticeable drop from 17.5% to just under 15%. Is there anything that sort of happened in this quarter that would have pulled that number down, and what do you think is a reasonable expectation going forward?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look, again, I respect that everyone loves to focus on operating metrics, as you \u2013 you know me pretty well, Steve. What's the one operating metric that I focus on? Is this the question?", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "I know you \u2013 total NOI growth and total sales?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I look at cash flow growth, my friend, okay. So the other thing that I'd like to point out on that is that we put our entire bucket of activity in that number. I don't know what others do but \u2013 so, if we have as an example lease amendments, let's say we have a retailer that we have to restructure because we figure, well, let's keep him in, and operating while we'll ultimately release the space. That amendment goes into that spread. And, if there's anything \u2013 again, I'm pleased with the spread. I think we've so much outperformed on our spread that that number of 15% is pretty damn good, $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good.", "But put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we have amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we've been dealing with over the last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread. $9 is a good number in a flat economy. I also \u2013 you look at our comp NOI which is where I'm focused on cash flow growth. You look at our comp NOI, we haven't just had a couple of years of good numbers, we've had a decade of outperformance versus our peer group. And as you know, when you comp over a comp over a comp over a comp, that's pretty damn good.", "So we're very pleased with the number. If you want to point out something which I know is your job to do, I would say it's more the amendments which we view is something that we're doing in a very slow economic growth environment in the U.S. And we're dealing with that effectively and yet we're still producing very healthy spreads.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess, just secondly, in terms of sort of recapturing some of the department stores and the JVs that you got with Seritage, can you just sort of provide an update on sort of where you stand and the opportunities that you see over the next couple of years to maybe recapture some more boxes?", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Steve, Rick Sokolov. We have continued to work with Seritage and Sears. We've got users identified for our properties in Seritage. As we mentioned last quarter, we're working with Sears just on how to downsize their stores, and that process is ongoing. I will tell you, if you look over the years, we recaptured 93 department stores and we've done a very effective job of deploying them. If you look at our anchor schedule, we have been going on right now, it's an ongoing process. We have a whole team dedicated to it. And the good news is we have substantial demand identified in each of our properties, so we know how we're going to deal with any of these stores that we do get the opportunity to recapture. David talked about La Plaza which was a Sears store. We got a Sears store back at College Mall. Now demolished and we're adding 365 Whole Foods, Ulta, small shops and restaurants. We're making money and making the properties better.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.", "Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "As you look at the development and redevelopment pipeline, you've got $2.1 billion your share of cost for the projects that are going now and almost that in CIP (17:33), how should we think about kind of beyond the projects that are kind of in place right now, what the shadow pipeline looks like? I mean you talked about it is a tougher environment. I mean do think that this could be a peak that would slow going forward as some of these project completions roll off looking into next year or do you think you've got a shadow pipeline that's going to keep it going at around this level?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me answer it this way. We actually had a meeting yesterday on Sawgrass Mills and Jersey Gardens is just two examples that together would be $500 million to $600 million of redevelopment. So we're very comfortable and confident, Paul, that even the retail \u2013 the retail sales have been anemic this year that when you have properties like that that can't be expanded. We have the appropriate amount of demand to make financial \u2013 make the financial consequences very positive for the company in addition to making those properties even more important. So I don't think we're backing off at all or redevelopment and expansion of portfolio. The good news is we have such a good number of high quality assets that we'll continue to find opportunities to expand them. And I like I said, I mean Jersey Gardens and Sawgrass are just two simple examples that pope to mind, but that's going to be $500 million to $600 million spread and will be hopefully delivered in 2019-ish, maybe 2020-ish. And we'll continue to enhance their marketplace position.", "So we haven't really changed. I think if we've changed anything is \u2013 and I mentioned, I think the last call or call before that, we put a lot in the system and that's kind of a little bit about \u2013 you saw the 20-basis point getting out. You might react to 20 basis points decrease in occupancy, I assure you I do not, okay. I assure you I do not. But let's \u2013 but we put a lot in the system over the last whatever six months, primarily in the outlet that we've decided to spread some of those new ground up developments out a little bit so that we don't stress the system. And we get the lease-up that we want in those. But our strategy really hasn't changed. And I think we've got plenty of opportunities continue to enhance our portfolio.", "Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And then my other question, you've talked about and you provided a list of, pretty long list of e-retailers who are looking to open stores in your malls. And I wonder if you have an update on kind of how those rollouts are being received, whether some of these retailers might be initially opening three or four, these could become 20 or 30 or 40 or kind of how it's been playing out so far?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well. I'll let Rick do his list, and I appreciate you giving him the opportunity because he loves to read his list. I will say this though, there's so much creative stuff going on with new ideas, new concepts that as a simple example, we did a pop-up store with Woodbury Commons with Rent the Runway, where they actually sold some of their existing inventory. And it had unbelievable success. I'm not going to tell you how much they sold because I don't frankly know if I'm allowed to or whatever. But there's a lot of creativity and a lot e-tailers that want access to the physical world, and that's just a small example of a unique idea. I actually happen to meet with the CEO and said, do a pop-up store at Woodbury, okay. They did it, they had a great success. But now I'll turn it over to Rick to give you the list.", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "The other thing I would tell you is there have been a number of them and we listed them. Obviously, you've \u2013 we talked about Fabletics, Birchbox, Yogasmoga. Everyone understands what the dynamic is going with Amazon. We just made a deal with UNTUCKit. The most important aspect of this is that all of these retailers that have Internet presence understand that a bricks-and-mortar presence in an essential part of their strategy. They get much higher conversion in their store. Their customer acquisition is frankly cheaper, and it's something that we're seeing more and more. We're working with frankly scores of them to come to our properties. It's certainly going to be a source of growth for us going forward in the out years.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And the condition on doing that deal was that Rick could not wear the UNTUCKit shirt, okay.", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "All brand negative (23:33)", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. And so it's in the lease.", "Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.", "Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning. David, earlier you mentioned lease amendments having a bit of an impact on releasing spreads. Obviously, you're taking a selective approach here. But I was just wondering if \u2013 more generally are you seeing an increased level of tenants coming to you, looking for lease amendments or would it more or less be consistent with the prior couple years?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's really \u2013 I mean obviously there's some high level news out there with certain retailers. And it's really more of that category than just the person here and a person there. So it's kind of what you've seen. We have less year-to-date bankruptcies than we did last year, but so some of that's just rolling through the numbers that we had to deal with last year.", "Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just sticking with leasing here, obviously, more sales moving online and not maybe getting captured in your sales or occupancy cost figures. I'm just wondering, are you exploring any changes to your lease structures at all at this point to better capture and monitor those sales?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, again, our view is to get the market rent that's appropriate for that space. And retail reported and I underscore reported retail sales does not necessarily, as we've had this discussion, correlate to what the market rent for that space is. It's more of a function of location, property, location in the mall, property type, position in the marketplace and so on. So our focus is getting market rent for each and every space and doing it in a way that does not put us at risk with their sales and what we get paid for that space.", "And that's not changing. Now there's a lot of things going on in the lease in terms of getting credit if they \u2013 the sale \u2013 again this is only a case when you have overage rent and we're hopefully marking at the market where overage rent, they've got to really outperform to pay us overage rent. But in order to \u2013 in their reported sales number, we're negotiating including if it's something fulfilled from the POS system and so on, that it be included in their reported sales number. But again, our focus is more on what the market rent for that space is as opposed to necessarily what the tenants' sales are going to be out of that space.", "Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC", "Good. Appreciate the color.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, good morning. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you guys have two ground-up outlets in process now for being developed in Virginia and Maryland and a number of full-price mall expansions going on. So how would you describe the demand for that space either outlet versus full-price or either one versus itself a year or two ago?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say to you that the only \u2013 first of all, Clarksburg is going to \u2013 I mean Columbus, where we partnered with Tanger was 100% leased I think, maybe there's a couple of vacancies. So that was not impacted at all. We've got Clarksburg, where I think, it's going to be a great development, opens up in Q4. We've got \u2013 in that case, we are bringing in a very, what I'd call a high end mix, because we really kind of want that to be ultimately kind of the Woodbury \u2013 this is an over exaggeration, so don't hold me to it, but we wanted to kind of be the high end fashion outlet for the mid-Atlantic more or less.", "And so there's \u2013 those retailers sometimes getting them to commit to a new outlet is a little longer process, because in a lot of cases, they don't manufacture for it and it's a function of their full-price strategy. I won't bore you with all the ins and outs of that, but that's going to deliver \u2013 we're going to deliver a great mix, and I think the demand has been excellent and we're going to hold a couple of spaces just to fill out the kind of the unique mix there and I'd say that the \u2013 I'd say the outlet demand for new product is good. It's not \u2013 it really hasn't changed.", "The only thing that I would say for new projects is the luxury-oriented folks are taking a little bit of a more \u2013 a little bit of a breather \u2013 a lot of that because of what's going on with tourism. So that's a little bit what I'd call softer than it might have been a year plus ago. But not material as evidenced by the mix that we're producing at Brickell which is going to be a great project that the three partners have worked very hard to produce.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then it seems like over the past couple years, some kind of bright spots at the mall in terms of who's been opening and who's been doing well that you and your peers have talked about includes fast-fashion and restaurants. So was just wondering if those types of mall tenants are still generally looking to have larger stores or more stores or just generally doing maybe better than the other apparel type guys?", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hi, this is Rick. We are continuing to very much focus on the addition of restaurants and food throughout the portfolios. There is still a considerable amount of demand. Just to let you know, last five years, we've added almost 200 restaurants across our portfolio. We had 25 last year. We have another 53 scheduled to open this year and next year. And so they're also finding substantially increased productivity when they are associated with our projects as opposed to a freestanding pad and that has certainly helped that demand.", "In terms of the other tenants you alluded to. Certainly, the international tenants are continuing to grow. We've got and we've already talked about e-tailers, we've got brand extensions. There is still considerable demand for our space, and we're doing okay.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, as Rick said, the restaurant demand is great.", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good morning out there.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. We are out here. We are out here in the Great Midwest.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Increasingly important part of the country this year.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet, you.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "So just a few questions here, David. First, you guys obviously disclosed your rent spreads, and those sort of stats, and stay up (31:55), but can you give a little bit more color on sort of same-center ancillary income growth. As you guys have rolled out that program, is it still growing, is the growth really coming from rolling out more and more ancillary at each mall, or is it more or that maybe you've maxed out individual malls, so that more of the growth is coming as you roll out different programs to new malls and outlets too?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would \u2013 let me give you just a big picture view. I would say, it's actually in the \u2013 when you ancillary a lot of \u2013 put kind of our SPV effort to a side, we've actually reduced it pretty significantly in our high end portfolio. So we've cleaned out what I'll call a lot of stuff. And again, we think that's the right thing to do. It's maybe, it's clearly costing us some income, but at the end of the day, we think it's the right thing to do. So, if you look at kind of our high end portfolio, we've cleaned a lot of stuff out. And we're very sensitive to creating the environment where those retailers can do the most business. So, if anything, we've suffered dilution, and you know how I love cash flow but I've got to do \u2013 I've got to balance that. So we've actually reduced that and that's hurt us over the last few quarters. In the outlet business, it's probably picked up a little bit. So there again \u2013 there is an answer for everything, but I think we've done a \u2013 we put in some, what I'd call, veteran mall people to kind of run that business over the last couple years, and they've actually done a pretty nice job, increasing those ancillary. So, up in outlet, down in the high end malls, pretty significantly, and I think the rest of it's kind of commensurate with the marketplace.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Can you \u2013 but as far as the reduction at the high end malls, can you just give sort of a magnitude like a percentage like if you had a \u2013 was it a 5% reduction to overall ancillary income, 10% when you look in the aggregate what you guys do?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's enough for me to notice, but we put it all in our numbers and our numbers are our numbers, so I don't want to get into what amount, but it's been \u2013 it could be \u2013 let me frame it this way a little bit. It could be, at a big mall, $1 million bucks, how's that? How's that if you really want to pinpoint the \u2013 on something.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "$1 million...?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, at a big mall. At a big mall, it could be $1 million.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "So $1 million going away?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. At a big mall \u2013 at one big mall.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. So we've done it at a handful of malls, but at a big mall, it can be $1 million.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. That's helpful. Second question is, just looking at your European portfolio, obviously, a lot of unfortunate tragic events that have occurred, what has been the impact at the retail level? Have \u2013 is it people are going forward and life goes on or have you seen any impact to either tenant openings or sales or anything like that or maybe just increased expenses from things that have to be done?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in our ownership interest again, we have basically two ways we operate in, in Europe. We own properties through \u2013 primarily through McArthurGlen. And then we have our ownership interest in Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre is a public company. I think they reported today. And their numbers have been pretty good, look at retail sales. The only country that I'd say which is not insignificant here that's a little bit underperforming, but still up, is in France. And I don't know that I'd necessarily equate that to the \u2013 what's happened terrorist-wise, but just France general economy is a little bit behind, say Italy, Spain and the Netherlands and Scandinavia and so on. So but that's \u2013 all that data is out there for you. I think their business is actually pretty decent and they chug along. We see no impact whatsoever in our McArthurGlen portfolio.", "Look, they have \u2013 their assets are in a lot of cases tourist-oriented. And so if tourism changes they'll have that you'll see that impact a little bit. But we haven't seen it so far. Their numbers have been pretty impressive year-to-date.", "Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. Thanks a lot, David.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, Michael Bilerman as well.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Just a follow-up on the department store recapture. To what extent do you think we'll continue to see department store closings? And how do you think about sort of the economics of redeveloping a box like that in terms of the cost per square foot of the redevelopment and then looking at sort of the rent that you can get on new tenants versus the increased rents of the department stores currently there?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Christy, first off, all of our recapture activity has been included in all of our development yield tables. And I think we've said that we work it out and we get comparable yield that we can get in the rest of our development projects. There's a range from the high single-digit, low double-digit. We've identified the boxes and every deal is unique as to what the costs would be for redeveloping the box. Is it a full box user, are we splitting the box? How the box is configured? But all of those yields are in and the most important thing is that we've been able to produce our results and we've had a great deal of activity in that sector as witnessed by all the anchors that we continue to add across the company.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage deal?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage projects that you've discussed...", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're again working with Sears on the economics and configuration of their downsizes. As soon as we have that in place, we'll be able to proceed. We have identified and have firmed up commitments for the vast majority of those boxes.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, David, it's Michael Bilerman. I had a quick question on the balance sheet. Back at our conference in March, you talked about wanting to sort of hoard more capital at this stage, rather than spending a lot of capital. And if you look at the balance sheet today, it's the best it's ever been in your entire history. You talk about $6 billion of liquidity and significant amount of balance sheet capacity and unbelievable cost of capital. How should we interpret that position? And is it gearing up to be able to be opportunistic in the next cycle or still within this cycle? And how should we think about the capital that you have?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look, I love being in the spot that we're in. We have no plans. As you know, we said it publicly, we're out of the big deal business. I mean I reserve the right to change my mind I guess. But if you ask me today, I'm out of the big deal business. Eventually, as we all know, there's going to be cycles in our \u2013 in economic world that we live in. And Rick and I are grizzled veterans, when it comes to real estate, recessions and stuff.", "I mean so it's always good to be in that spot. Obviously, Andy is here. We've worked very hard to be in that spot. It allows us to grow our dividend. It allows us to put capital back into the business that feeds on itself. So I think pretty much nothing's changed, Michael, it's business as usual. We have no intention of really doing anything with that other than continuing to build that. And I don't if there'll be a cycle. I have no idea, but we are out of the big deal business and we're going to maintain that kind of liquidity and capital, primarily to \u2013 that's the balance sheet we want. We think that should be valued by the market. I'll let you decide whether it is or isn't. I don't know and it allows us to reinvest in our portfolio. I think the one thing that that we all talk about physical retail and we talk about physical real estate and I don't care of what, whether it's an office, a hotel, a mall or strip center, if you don't have a good looking product and you're not, your customer's not going to show up.", "And if you're \u2013 if you got an apartment building, you got an office building, you got a mall, you got a strip center, you got a physical retail store, if it doesn't look good and then it's not, doesn't have the right services, and it doesn't have the right tenant mix or clientele, you're going somewhere down the road, that's the competitive society that we live in. And I think our capital allows us to try. We don't execute this the way, I think we can continue to be better, much better in this. But our balance sheet allows us to have a really, really, really good looking physical product and we've got a lot of work to continue to make it even better, better, better. And I would encourage anybody that owns physical real estate or leases physical real estate, that's our goal, that's our job. You got to have \u2013 I mean, just like if you're Boeing, and you're manufacturing airplanes, you go to their manufacturing facility, I guarantee it's state-of-the-art beautiful, and that's what they do with their capital.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right. And you're still earning very good returns on that incremental investment so it's creating a lot of underlying value as well?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And that's why we have the balance sheet that we've got today.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right. Well, then the question is whether you think there's going to be something bigger from an investment perspective at your assets that you want to position for, right. So being able \u2013 Christy asked about the department stores, whether you'd become much more aggressive at putting a lot of capital and being very aggressive in the near-term to sort of attack that, right, having to \u2013 it's not being out of the big deal business buying someone else, but you can certainly produce something internally with your own space that may require above average capital spend for a period of time?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, look, I think with all the activity there, I think we see that kind of continuing at the pace that it's been. I mean we've been obviously very active the last few years doing that, and lot of this good stuff is coming online. So I think, if outlet new development slows, I mean that's more capital that we can dedicate to getting the box money back. So I kind of see that as a steady state frankly. So, but I don't \u2013 we're not warehousing capital to do some big transaction. It's basically to continue to be a appropriately rated company and continuing to have the capital to invest in our products. That's the goal.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. Good morning. Was wondering if you could provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of traffic at your properties, appreciate your comments on the tourist visits, but what else are you seeing in terms of traffic?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you may have missed this. In the outlet business, our traffic is up 2.65% year-to-date, even though spend is down in some of the tourist-oriented centers.", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "On the malls, what we're finding is that the traffic is stable, and interestingly, I know a lot of retailers have reported decreased traffic. What we're seeing is that the consumers are still in our properties, but they are visiting less stores on each visit, and it gets back to David's point about the physical presentation. Our retailers need to have stores that present compelling reasons for these consumers to visit them as they're walking our properties. So there will be less traffic because they're stopping in less stores, but the measures that we look at, the traffic in our properties overall is stable.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And so, as a follow-up, whose problem is that when it comes to leasing? Does that fall back on the retailer or ultimately you need to attract that retailer as well?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, listen, we're going to take responsibility as well. The retailer needs too. I think we're all in this together kind of deal. So we've got to have the right retail mix. We've also got to be able to introduce technology in the mall that gets people to visit. I think what Rick was really saying is that with all of the research that's done by consumers and when they go to the mall, they're not probably doing as much window shopping as they probably have done historically. They're more kind of on a mission to \u2013 they know they want to go to these three stores. It's our goal, and obviously the retailers' goal, but it's our goal to get them to spend more time, more time means more spend and visit more stores. We have to take some of that responsibility as well. We're certainly not shirking that. And I think that's where technology can help us do that.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great. And so what specifically are you rolling out and how is that going in terms of...", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we got \u2013 we have much too long of a conversation to do that, but there's a lot of communication that we're doing directly to the consumer that we will hope, we'll hope that it will get the consumer to stay longer as well as visit more stores. The communication helps visit more stores. Staying longer I think is on ambience, a diverse \u2013 more mix, restaurants, entertainment, et cetera, that will help in that cause.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I know we've talked about the rent spreads earlier, but just curious in the context of the commentary about the overall economy being soft, that's been your commentary for quite some time as well as...", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "By the way, have I been accurate in that? I just want to know.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No, you have been accurate. No question there. I guess the question is just around sort of pricing power with your tenants, I mean however you want to define it if rent spread's not necessarily the best metric. Just curious if there's been any change there?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I said rent spreads, somebody asked me a question, I explained to you that we put amendments in our rent spreads, okay. And if I had to isolate \u2013 again, I think the $8.88 is pretty damn good, but if you had to isolate, why wasn't it 17%, it's because of certain amendments where we're taking the decision either to work with the retailer or do it more of on a temporary fashion while we re-lease the space which makes economic sense.", "And again I would also point out that year-to-date our comp NOI is up 4%, 4.1%. The economy is growing at 1%. I don't know, you tell me what it is. You got a bunch of people on your payroll that will tell you what the economy is growing. Maybe not on your payroll, but on the bank's payroll. And we're outperforming 300 basis points which is not \u2013 You got to put it in perspective, so what's your question?", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I guess the question was regardless of the spread, I mean how are you thinking about pricing power with your tenants today versus maybe six months ago or a year ago?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think every \u2013 we don't have a cookie cutter commodity product. So every deal is different. In some cases, we have pricing power. And frankly, in some cases, we don't because of whatever, competitive situation, bad space, mediocre asset. In some cases, we have great space, great asset, high demand. We put it all in the blender, we produce the results that we produced. And I don't \u2013 I can't answer \u2013 I don't have a cookie cutter answer for you. I mean it is deal-by-deal. We are driven deal-by-deal, space-by-space, lease-by-lease. We've been doing it for a lot of years and that's what we continue to do. And there's just no easy answer I can give to you. Other than all of that dynamics of what I just described, funnel into our numbers, that funnel into the results, and then we declare our results.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's fair enough. Another question just \u2013 in terms of the investment side of things, I know you're out of the big deal business here, and you also said that, you're not really seeing any real impacts in Europe as of yet. But I was just curious if you \u2013 do you expect to see some opportunities open up over there particularly in the UK, obviously, the dollar is strong right now, so it would help the investment case, although I know that's not your focus, but just curious how you're thinking about the investment opportunity over there?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look, I think all of those transactions are very difficult. I mean I \u2013 here is my short answer on the UK, so I offered a company who bought an asset, diluted the company's shareholders down by 25%, I offered \u00a34.25, they told me the company was worth \u00a36.50, and the stock today is trading at \u00a32.70, okay. So I'm not enthralled with \u2013 I think the UK \u2013 it's impossible to make deals happen unless somebody wants something to happen. So I'm out of the big deal business. The UK, I've no interest in the UK where \u2013 other than I have a affinity to a football club there that I really love, okay. But, beyond that, I doubt that there'll be any great opportunities in those markets...", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, no worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Go back (53:55) if I could to the Seritage stuff that a couple of people have asked about. The first thing, Rick, I'm curious, I thought when these were all set up originally, each of the boxes, there was a specific plan laid out for which part Sears would get and which part Seritage would get. And so are you guys negotiating to try to change that or try to take more of the space, I guess from the Sears... (54:23)?", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "The primary discussion is just on the cost of implementing the agreed upon downsizes. In a couple of instances, the way that we've been able to procure users would make it more efficient for both Sears and us if there were slight reconfigurations, but that's not the issue. It's just a process of, you talk about loading docks and separating air conditioning systems and vertical escalation systems and entrances, it's just a complicated process that we're going through.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Then I find also then on that, you hint at some point the landlord has to provide Sears with a six-month notice to vacate and then they have six months to actually leave the property, have you guys given or I guess has Seritage given or the joint venture given notice to Sears yet to vacate those various assets?", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "We have not and we will not until we have a firm understanding of what our capital requirements are and what our returns are going to be, and we can't do that until we finalize these discussions.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. So none of the stores have been given that six-month notice?", "Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "No.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then the last thing guys is, do you still own the Seritage stock that you got as part of this whole transaction?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And you plan to keep that I guess, is that the idea?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean the plan, plan is a funny word, right. Hard to say, Rich. No real \u2013 just hard to say.", "Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. All right. Good. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, no worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you. So just a broader question about market rents for A malls, if look back at a couple two years of leasing activity, you roughly signed rents at $68 of square foot to $70 a square foot, I would think over a two-year period or more, the noise of good spaces versus bad spaces probably gets out of your away with law of large numbers. So just curious, do you think market rents on average for your product has grown recently and what do you think will happen going forward?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we don't \u2013 we give you every year our earnings estimates, our comp NOI estimates, and that's made up of a lot of things, and including our view of what certain spaces are worth and what we think there'll be \u2013 the rents are. So I mean I don't know what else \u2013 I mean, that what else I can tell you that other than what I've already said earlier.", "We haven't backed off or \u2013 if anything, we've increased our guidance. We haven't backed off our comp or portfolio NOI. We've actually outperformed so far. All that kind of ultimately shows itself kind of our view. And, again, we don't have \u2013 it's not like we can \u2013 it's \u2013 we're not a hotel, so even if we \u2013 our market rent view changed up or down, I don't control the \u2013 they have a lease there. So, again, it's only going to impact, what, 8% of portfolio per year. So we always \u2013 take an example, let's say we got nervous and we cut all these bad deals, wouldn't really impact us at the end of the day because it's only 8% of the portfolio per annum. Now, if you did it several years in a row, we catch up with this. So, again, market rents, it's not \u2013 I don't mark my portfolio up or down every day like I do a hotel business. That's why we have stability of cash flow. That's why we can withstand cycles. That's why we've had this history of comp NOI increases, and I don't know what else I can do other than answer it in that fashion.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean the reason I ask is just trying to gauge the difference between the NOI growth from \u2013 stemming from favorable vintage releasing which is any real estate company versus market rent growth. That's why I asked that question. But my second question is more on leverage. You've always done a little mix of European denominated debt or euro denominated debt versus U.S. I'm assuming that spread has gotten more favorable towards the euro. Any change in larger plans of how to refinance from debt coming due, maybe more geared towards Europe versus here?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean we're pretty much hedged on the margin, and so we're not going to get over allocated to euro. We're only going to finance kind of what our investment base there is and we are pretty much hedged. So, if we \u2013 even though there may be a rate differential, we'd have to swap it back to the U.S. dollars because otherwise we would be over allocated and we are, as I said, we're hedged. And that could be something we would look at. But we \u2013 to me, it's a little too cute. I'd rather finance my U.S. assets in U.S. dollars, and my European assets in European dollars, and my Japanese assets in yen, and the currency fluctuations are the currency fluctuations and we have the natural hedge with our investment base. And that's been the strategy. I don't think it'll change.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Hi, just have a couple quick numbers question. One, are there any material Crystal acquisition costs in the quarter? And then, secondly, your occupancy cost was $12.7 million in the quarter. How does that compare to the combined levels that you had in say 2007, 2008?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean I don't have \u2013 the answer is no, and the first one, and then Tom will get back to you on what our occupancy costs in 2007, 2008 is. I don't recall, frankly.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning. Two quick questions from me. I'm sorry if I missed this previously, but you mentioned about the anomaly with some sort of sales restrictions in a particular state, and again, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you elaborate on that?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, secondly, I know you've said you're out of the big deal business, and you said that there's not necessarily opportunities in Europe. But I look at Kl\u00e9pierre and it does look like it's performing well as you mentioned. Would you consider increasing your stake there?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we're very pleased with the position that we're in.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "No more questions from me.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. No worries. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Yes. Good morning. Just a quick question around the lease amendments that you talked about earlier on that has some impact on releasing spreads. Is there any other detail you can kind of share about those amendments, kind of how they come up, why the decision was made to actually do them?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's a lease-by-lease, store-by-store, mall-by-mall analysis. And I mean we make judgment call, that's what we do every day, judge. Do we want to re-lease it, how, what's the downtime, is \u2013 does it give us time to re-lease it, on and on and on. So it's 50 years of experience that goes into that.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And there is a mix of tenants like large national guys and local guys, and it's like a whole mix of people, that are kind of impacted by that?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's just the nature of our business for many, many years about what the right thing to do is with that retailer in that specific space.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. No worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you. I'll keep it very short because I know there are some other calls coming up, but David and Rick, quick question. Your vision of the mall in five years, how is the tenant composition today going to change in your view in terms of the percentage of, for example, entertainment as a percentage of the overall mall tenant base?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look, the simple answer is there's no cookie cutter answer, and it's all going to be \u2013 the mall business and the retail business, you can have these big overwriting things, but the reality is how it gets executed really focuses on trade area-by-trade area, layout-by-layout, physical configuration-by-physical configuration. And so therefore, there's no overall answer to that, other than simplistically, I think the mix will be more diverse. There will be more entertainment, more food services, more other services, and there'll be technology in it to enhance the shopping experiences. There'll be more services, but how that all gets computed into one particular scenario will depend differently on the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis. So that's just the nature of our projects, and the good news is we've got an organization that can figure out, I hope the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis and what's right for that trade area. That's simple answer.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Just curious, what's your favorite football team?", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Crystal Palace.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.", "David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you and have a good rest of the summer.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed opened several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. And we continue to achieve strong financial results.", "Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full-year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87 which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.", "Our increased range also reflects the potential charge of $0.08 per share with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower, due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.", "Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest Corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston and will be completed by summer of \u201817.", "Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant.", "Now let me turn to the quarter. FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year, for the first nine months our comparable FFO per diluted share is at 10.1% compared to the prior year period. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our mall and premium outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year.", "Leasing activity remained solid. The mall and premium outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share per foot, an increase of 10.9%. Given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads.", "And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases, where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations pre or post-bankruptcy such as PacSun. Base minimum rent was $50.76 up 4.5% compared to last year reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.", "Now, just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community focused on. Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter, third quarter.

On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio of NOI.", "The diversity of sources, fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter, our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists spending at our centers are active in extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly, of our very high-end portfolio.", "Total retail sales per square-foot at our malls and premium outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailer centers continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and premium outlets, reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers.", "Our stable reported sales also include initial dilution from newly opened space and importantly we\u2019re beginning to anniversary some of this decline as you can see, recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.", "The end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1, we opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected to the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon City. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas. And in the next several weeks we open 60,000 square-foot expansions at the Outlets at Orange. And we also are opening our expansion in Venice Italy with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio.", "Now, on new developments, just so happens tomorrow, we\u2019re opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets. The center will offer great retail line-up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington DC metro area. We currently have five, that\u2019s right, five outlets under construction, one in North Virginia, four in the international markets including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all of these will open in \u201817.", "And even though we\u2019re opening a new outlet next week, the week after we\u2019re actually opening Brickell City Center in Miami, its anchored Saks. It\u2019s got a great retail line-up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and it\u2019s part of a landmark mixed-use development. We look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder we\u2019re only investing in the retail. Construction continues on the full price development at Fort Worth, the Shops at Clearfork, anchored by Neiman Marcus, opening in the fall of \u201817.", "And these eight new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share.", "And let me turn to Aeropostale, we\u2019re pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco and Gordon Brothers to acquire Aeropostale in addition to the existing management team, the ABG Group will add significant operating experience to Aero.", "We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions.

It\u2019s also important to keep this investment in perspective.", "You\u2019ve all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group of which, our share is $33 million including working capital.

And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment. And for some of you who don\u2019t know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, just to name a handful.", "Also during the quarter, we acquired our partners\u2019 interest with McArthurGlen in our two outlets in Naples and Venice.

We continue to lower our borrowing costs, increase our debt maturity, a term or current liquidity of $6.5 billion.", "And finally, on our dividend, in 2016 we will have paid $6.50, that\u2019s an increase of 7.4% compared to 6.05% that we paid last year, that\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask on the leasing spread topic. I know you touched on it and it\u2019s been a popular point of conversation here. Since it\u2019s a trailing 12-month number, are the results we\u2019re seeing now in terms of lease spread just a pull forward and extension of something that happened to slow down in Q2 or did the third quarter slow too, realizing that it does include lease amendments?", "David Simon", "Well, we have had, look, let\u2019s just put this number in perspective number one. We do include lease amendments and that\u2019s having the biggest impact of the growth slowing. Yet if you look at our average base rent, you can see we\u2019re doing new initial terms where we\u2019re doing very well. And some of the expiring leases also are a little bit expiring at a little bit higher level.", "Now, our investors know that over a long period of time, we\u2019ve always felt like the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always part of our model. The fact is we\u2019ve done a tremendous job of outperforming that. But the long-term we\u2019ve always kind of felt that $5 to $6 spread it\u2019s kind of where we think the market is.", "We had a couple of years of significant outperformance. But we\u2019re not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll-over. And we\u2019re just getting back to kind of more of a normalized environment. But for us, I don\u2019t know about our peers but for us, we include lease amendments. And the bottom line is that it\u2019s having some impact on leasing spreads.", "But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve told investors year after year after year. And we feel very good about that.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Okay. And then just also you mentioned that right now as you lease space, given the high occupancy, the remaining space might not be as well located. So I guess my question is since you have that high occupancy, what are kind of the thoughts behind making these, lease amendments and working with companies such as you pointed out PacSun?", "David Simon", "Well, it\u2019s literally a case-by-case analysis. I think we\u2019re as sophisticated as anybody. I think when Aeropostale is a great example of our ability to analyze what the right trade is in these deals. And in some cases, we\u2019re going to take the space back, in other cases we\u2019re going to help the retailer go through the hard time.", "And it\u2019s really a case-by-case - it\u2019s a case-by-case analysis. But there is nobody I think in our industry that\u2019s more sophisticated in our ability to kind of maneuver through those situations. So, its case-by-case, anything can happen. Well, sometimes we work sometimes we get the space back. And certain in the Aero case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing.", "Amazon makes vertical investments the cable industry makes vertical investments. And again I would encourage, we decided to make vertical investments, when we decided to franchise Starbuck locations two or three years ago, that\u2019s the nature of our company is that we\u2019re going to be nimble, we have the right judgment win to make a deal with its retailer, when not, when to make a vertical investments, when not, when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley, and when not. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re already in today.", "And each and every case will be one-by-one. Now, I do appreciate and I hope I\u2019m right with you, Caitlin. I do appreciate you waiting to write until we have our call. And I do think that\u2019s important because the reason we have these calls is for not every - there is not every scenario where you can understand the nuances about what\u2019s going on in our business. So I do appreciate the patience, to hear our story. And then obviously you write whatever you want to write.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Great, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Good morning, David.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Steve Sakwa", "I guess is there a way for you to try and help separate out for us the impact of these amendments on the numbers? Meaning if PacSun and Aero were having as big an impact as they are, is there a way to sort of strip them out and give us a sense for kind of what the remaining lease spreads look like? Because obviously this is kind of the biggest number that people are focusing on, and if these two leases or tenants are having a disproportionate impact, it might help to separate out those figures for us.", "David Simon", "Well, I don\u2019t, look, our business Steve, I hear you. If we need to, we might. But the fact is you got to look at our business in totality. You can\u2019t look at it on one operating metric or not. Because what I would ask you to look at is, let\u2019s talk about the - we have grown our portfolio NOI $300 million year-to-date. Let\u2019s talk about that. Do you want to talk about that?", "That to me is more material than any one operating statistic quarter-by-quarter. So, yes, we can slice and dice this any way but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI, there are many REITs that don\u2019t have $300 million of NOI yet we grew that in nine months.", "So, I would rather talk about that that\u2019s more material than the fluctuations that have, that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales - sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s going to last forever.", "And but again, there is this high desire to make that the be-all of all these metrics. And again, our number is clean, the results we can\u2019t speak to anybody else how they do it. But I, as I said to you, if you want my opinion on what\u2019s important, it\u2019s the $300 million NOI growth. If you don\u2019t want that I got it. But that\u2019s what I focus on.", "Steve Sakwa", "No, I get it and I don\u2019t think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital, whether it\u2019s through developments or expansions. But clearly there has been more pressure on the mall business, so I just think anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward. And perhaps it\u2019s just that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rent means that normalized leasing spreads should be 10%. And maybe that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to head to. There\u2019s a new normal in the business. That\u2019s okay; I think people are just trying to get comfort with that.", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think that\u2019s a good point, so let\u2019s talk about that. And I mentioned that a little bit in the first question. I think if you asked our investor group, we would have told them for 15 to 20 years that our re-leasing spreads are $5 or $6 a foot, okay. We have had a long period of outperformance on that. We\u2019ve gotten better at what we\u2019ve done all sorts of reasons that we don\u2019t have to bore you.", "And you are right we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don\u2019t think from our standpoint we ever guaranteed outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said look, it\u2019s $5 or $6, one year it might be $8, one year it might be $4 but that\u2019s kind of what we see the long-term trend.", "And I still feel comfortable but that\u2019s the basis. Now, it\u2019s no surprise that retail generally has come under pressure, lots of different reasons which we could go into but let\u2019s - unless you want to let\u2019s not. But the fact is, and we are impacted as I said to you before by our general GDP growth.", "And to date, our retail generally is there is no inflation and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we\u2019re growing our comps timing. And if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is I don\u2019t know 50 basis points. We\u2019re still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI that\u2019s not that. It\u2019s not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it\u2019s still in the scheme of being able to grow our business, that\u2019s not bad.", "And I\u2019m not defensive about it. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what I think we should expect when we have essentially a real GDP growth of 1%, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more. And I think that\u2019s what you got to put in perspective.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for the time.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Bilerman", "Thanks, Michael Bilerman here with Christy. How are you?", "David Simon", "Good, thanks.", "Michael Bilerman", "So, David, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about putting capital into your stock. Last year you had bought I think it was like $350 million at about 180. Obviously the stock, with some of the sell-off as well as some of the retail headlines, has come off 20%. We spent a lot of time talking about something you spent $30 million on. I was wondering you got a $2 billion share repurchase program, how you feel about putting money into your stock?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think at the end of the day the best thing we can do is invest in our product, okay because the stock will go up and it\u2019ll go down by investing in our product. And I think what unfortunately what I think a number of retailers, they\u2019ve not invested in their product, okay. Or they\u2019ve chased the holy-grail of internet sales to the determent of what they should be doing with the physical product, as still people want to go physical shopping.", "And when they go physical shopping, you\u2019ve got to have a nice physical environment. So we have spent a lot of years wanting to invest in our physical product. And I think that\u2019s our number one focus continues to be we\u2019re well through that. The good news is we have been contrary in that and we started that in \u201810. And as you know we\u2019re finishing projects, that\u2019s not just talking about projects but finishing a lot of projects.", "So, I think if that wind down then the opportunity to buy stock back is always there. And I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a high priority but that could change depending upon kind of where the world is and what the stock does. But I think my job is, the number one job I should be doing is, invest in making my product better. And that\u2019s my number one focus.", "Michael Bilerman", "And you talked in your opening comments about your deal-making over the years and always taking a proper risk-reward and thinking about the capital committed to whether it\u2019s a project or whether it\u2019s a venture investment. As you think about investing in Aero, putting $30 million in, is there sort of a house limit that you would want to have in those sorts of investments relative to the whole? And where would it sit within the Simon organization? Is it more within the venture side or is there another sort of area? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the David Simon bucket. Where does it sit within the organization?", "David Simon", "Well, look, even though I\u2019m older I can always learn new things. And I\u2019ve learned a lot actually going through the Aero-deal. We\u2019re going to act as an investor we\u2019re going to give strategic direction as a board member. Authentic brands, I\u2019d encourage you to look at the brands in the history of that company, they\u2019ve done a great job of, they are brand builders. They are entrepreneurs.", "So, we\u2019re not going to be running the business, we\u2019re going to help strategically like we did. It will be, but we\u2019re - so I\u2019ve got my IT guys helping with their IT Systems. We\u2019ve got our lawyers helping with their license agreements. So we have a lot we can bring to the table. And that\u2019s what makes us unique.", "And but it\u2019s not going to overwhelm anybody\u2019s particular time, they\u2019ve got a good management team that with our strategic help I think will continue to make that profitable. And look, based on the numbers, I think it\u2019s going to be a compelling investment. But it\u2019s not without risk. I mean, it is, there is risk out there whenever you make a venture like investment but I can\u2019t think of a better team between Gordon Brothers, Hilco, ABG, General Growth to all put a collective judgment to bear to make this a profitable investment.", "I don\u2019t think going back to your first question I don\u2019t think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T, I mentioned vertical because I just try to put certain things outside of real-estate in perspective, okay. So, AT&T was buying, going vertical. They\u2019re spending a $100 billion, okay. I go vertical, I spend $33 million, okay, million not billion, $33 million.", "And again I\u2019m not comparing, I\u2019ll just try to put these things in perspective, I\u2019m not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what\u2019s made Amazon great is they\u2019ve had the latitude to go vertical. They\u2019ve gone vertical, they\u2019ve gone content, they\u2019ve gone distribution, they\u2019ve gone retail, and that may be the future of corporate America is that you\u2019re not going to pigeon-hole these comps.", "If we want to just talk about leasing a Sears-box that we get back, I mean, that\u2019s okay for some companies but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. So, again, there is no, we have no bucket, it\u2019s not going to take away from what we\u2019re doing, my number one priority is to make our product better any way that we can, technology digital investments look and feel, better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, however that transpires.", "And making a vertical investment here or there, not going to overwhelm us. But I want the latitude to, and I think the investment community should want us to. By the end of the day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we\u2019re buying a business that ought to be valued at six times EBITDA and we\u2019re buying at a 1 to 2. And I think that\u2019s a pretty good trend. But we\u2019re not there yet and that\u2019s the goal, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.", "Christy McElroy", "Hi David, it\u2019s Christy, sorry about the three questions. Just bigger picture, the consortium has talked about 300 to 400 store-based count for Aeropostale, there has been a lot of talk about store-count rationalization among national retailers generally in how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like Aeropostale?", "And what does that imply for your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you\u2019re looking at this issue through that Aeropostale lens?", "David Simon", "Well, look, and it\u2019s very - I think you\u2019ve pointed out something is very unique, is that we\u2019re getting a lens at a much granular level on retail. So it\u2019s very interesting.", "Sourcing, look, there are five or six things that really make a retailer click, sourcing, obviously rent expense, store expense, the merchandize all of it, packaging, all the stuff that I think at the end of the day we\u2019re going to make us better real-estate owners. But that remains to be seen.", "Aero, look, I\u2019m probably going to get in trouble for this but since I like you, I\u2019m going to tell you. Right now, we\u2019re looking at around 500 stores in the U.S., as kind of a model. And based upon we expect every one of those stores to be profitable. So, it\u2019s a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment.", "We were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store-base the fact of the matter is we found out there is a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So, it\u2019s going to be around 500 give or take. But I think store closings, it is - the pressure for that retailers\u2019 to invest in the internet to close stores from their investment community is great.", "I would question whether that\u2019s the right strategy because some of these stores are very profitable. Yet, they feel like the headline closing stores, is the answer and then all of this investment into the internet is going to pay all these dividends.", "The fact of the matter is there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think all of us can\u2019t lose sight of that. And that\u2019s where we should be investing.", "So, I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately over our history, we\u2019re pro to that I don\u2019t need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in \u201893 no longer exist in 2016. And we will be able to deal with it, it\u2019s much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it\u2019s the soup of the day.", "And so, I don\u2019t think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500, I think there are lots of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure they\u2019ve got to do something. And I would like them to invest in their stores it\u2019s something I would like them to do. But I don\u2019t always win that argument.", "So, we\u2019re equipped to handle that, that\u2019s what we do. And but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. Firstly it is up, so put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in \u201816, it is down. We had much greater in \u201815, and we\u2019ve basically more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in \u201815 in a flat-to-tough retail environment. And I think everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay.", "So, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doing cartwheels here. It is, we\u2019re grinding, word is good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that\u2019s the environment that is presented to us. And we\u2019ll have to deal with it.", "Christy McElroy", "Thanks so much for the color.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Jeff Spector", "Great, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m also here with Craig Schmidt. I guess, David, if we could just talk a little bit more about the current environment. Let\u2019s say it continues; it persists through \u201817, even \u201818. How should we think about these rent amendments? How are you thinking about it when you\u2019re laying out your budget for next year? Is this just something that we should get used to as we transition here as the retailers invest more money in their stores, we see more store closings? How should we think about that?", "David Simon", "Well, look, I think again, it\u2019s a retail-by-retail perspective. We\u2019re seeing stabilization in our sales business, if you want to go focus on retail sales Q2-over-Q3 is basically flat. And if you take out tourism, you take out one retailer that\u2019s had decreases in sales, that\u2019s actually up. So, we\u2019re not like - there is no huge concern here. But we just, we\u2019re a product of the overall U.S. economy.", "Jeff, what\u2019s the real GDP growth, you tell me. So, in that environment what do you think it is the real one? Real GDP growth, what would, Merrill\u2019s got a bunch of smart people, what would they say of this?", "Jeff Spector", "I think we\u2019re saying around that 1%, 1.5%.", "David Simon", "So, I mean, we\u2019re good, I\u2019m not that good but I got a lot of people around me that are good. That\u2019s a constraint. So but it is what it is. We\u2019ll sort it through and I do think in that kind of environment, we\u2019re going to have certain deals where we will go back and then we\u2019re going to have a lot of other deals, frankly, we\u2019re going to take the space back.", "And my moods changing a little bit that maybe we\u2019re better off taking the space back. I think we did play ball a little bit more with the bankruptcies in \u201815 and the early \u201816. And that\u2019s showing up in the lease spreads. And I\u2019m thinking sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of this stuff that\u2019s going on out there maybe we stabilize. A lot of people feel like we\u2019re headed for growth. So maybe we take more space back.", "But we\u2019ve kept the buildings full, as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We\u2019re on our target for top-of-the-line increase. So, it\u2019s not all that bad. So, just put in perspective, \u201817 will transpire and will do a combination, sometimes will play ball, other times we\u2019re going to take the space back. And it\u2019s all a function of retail-by-retail decisions, space-by-space, retailer-by-retailer.", "Jeff Spector", "Okay, thanks. And I think Craig has one question.", "Craig Schmidt", "Great, thanks. Maybe I could do a little bit of a pivot here. Looking at your new developments for the outlets, four of the five projects are international. Can we expect to see continued good growth in new projects on international scale? And then maybe more specifically with your longer-term plans are with McArthurGlen?", "David Simon", "Well, we just had a meeting with - I had a meeting with our partner last Friday. Their business is very good, very solid. Provence is opening in spring of next year which will be fantastic. We\u2019re very close on getting the potential to build Normandie, which we think will be a great, which will basically cover the Western Parisian market. That could be fantastic.", "We\u2019ve got a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019re working on, extensions that we\u2019re working on. So it\u2019s all good there, it\u2019s been, the team are working well together. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the investment. And I think it\u2019s Craig it\u2019s just kind of business as usual. We\u2019re still seeing new development growth, very pleased just that we\u2019ve been able to create that partnership and create that relationship going forward.", "In Asia, the team is working in a couple of other markets that I\u2019m hopeful over time that we\u2019ll be able to build the premium outlet product there. We\u2019ve got couple of big expansions in the works Gotemba is an example that could be a landmark extension. So that business is, we\u2019re not slowing by any stretch of imagination internationally in our outlet business either with McArthurGlen or with our Asian partners.", "Craig Schmidt", "Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Good morning, David.", "David Simon", "How are you doing?", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Just fabulous; it\u2019s earnings season, life is great. So, just a few questions here, let me start with an easier one before I ask one on the favorite same-store topic. Here in New York, obviously, a lot of - sorry, the demand for street retail has gone down a lot, so a lot of vacant spaces; articles about global brands rethinking their street retail needs, especially with where rents are and store profitability.", "Have you seen as those brands have dialed back, have you seen them, I don\u2019t want to say shift back, but have you seen more interest in going in malls where they are profitable? Or from your perspective, they\u2019ve always been running street retail, their investment there, separate from their decision to open up in malls?", "David Simon", "I don\u2019t think there is a generic answer to that, I think its brand-by-brand. And generally on the luxury side of those brands, their business is actually, they\u2019re starting to anniversary some of the strong dollar stuff. And obviously we are as well. And I meet with a lot of the folks, I mean, there are certainly some brands here and there that are pulling back but I\u2019d say generally and you\u2019re starting to see the numbers like from LVMH and Kering that have posted recently.", "Their business is good, pretty good. I think New York is - this is a novice because we have no street retail. But New York is a little confusing to them because you got 5th, you\u2019ve got Madison, you\u2019ve got Downtown, you\u2019ve got different - you\u2019ve got new developments, you got West 57th Street, so they\u2019re all trying to sort that out. I think in our business, it hasn\u2019t changed. And if anything I\u2019d say the mood is generally better than it was six months ago, if you want a generic statement.", "And I think New York City itself is just different because they\u2019re all trying to figure out where they need to be given what\u2019s going on in New York. But we don\u2019t have a dog in that hunt. And I think Brickell is going to be I mean, we have a little delay with the hurricane and I guess it really, technically wasn\u2019t a hurricane or not, I\u2019m not really sure. But Brickell I think is going to be lot of the retailers rope-in in the first quarter of next year. But I think that mix there is really going to be great, cool.", "I think the stack-store is going to be great. And the demand on that just continued to pick up, right Rick, over, month after month. And I think that\u2019s a good indication that if you have a good product or you have a good scheme, retailers are coming. Rick, you want to comment on Brickell?", "Rick Sokolov", "I think Brickell is certainly going to show that there is going to be a great mix of designers, food, international retailers and right now we\u2019re 91% leased. And as David said, the opening is going to take place over. We\u2019re going to have a big slug over the next few weeks and another big slug over the first quarter of next year.", "The only other thing I would say to you is that we are seeing the international retailers like Zara, like H&M accelerating their focus on our properties in the United States because there is demand to grow in this market. And we are seeing that.", "David Simon", "And I would just say, we\u2019ve got just to finish the whole thought and then you can ask me, if it\u2019s on comp NOI, it\u2019s not a tough question, it\u2019s going to tell you exactly what I\u2019m thinking.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "You don\u2019t know the question yet, David.", "David Simon", "All right, all right, bring it on.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "We don\u2019t give our questions in advance.", "David Simon", "All right, okay, good. Thank you. That\u2019s what I like about you Alex. So, but just to finish the luxury, people that would populate street retail in New York, we say luxury, not that it\u2019s easy but we\u2019re making progress with Clearfork and that\u2019s in Fort Worth, Texas. We\u2019re going to have those kinds of brands, not a lot of them but the right ones.", "We opened King of Prussia with the connection and again, a lot of those are opening. But the results from those high-end brands have been fantastic. So, that part of our business is different, I think it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s actually starting to do better than maybe what you\u2019re seeing and whatever is being talked about in New York street retail. But I really, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really have a dog in that hunt.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Then the second question is it sounded like you said that bankruptcies and the issues really peaked last year and that you guys were more accommodative with retailers trying to restructure. And, therefore, it seems like this year we\u2019re seeing the impact in the same-store metrics. At the same time, I think you said that the tourism impact strong dollar is also anniversarying.", "So it almost sounds like next year we should expect same-store metrics to get a positive bump as these trends sort of anniversary. Is that fair? Or as you guys look into your leasing for next year, we still should see some of this impact, whether it\u2019s on re-leasing spreads or same-store NOI etcetera? Should we still see that in \u201817 or is \u201817 going to be a little better because this stuff anniversaries?", "David Simon", "Look, I think the big unknown is just what\u2019s going on, all you have to do and you\u2019re smart financial guy, look at our P&L right. You could see, put the leasing spreads aside, put all those other stuff aside, I mean, the reality is, the comp NOI is really a function of our overage rent which is right there on the financial statement, okay, it\u2019s down.", "Can\u2019t help it, I mean, and it\u2019s really a function of the fact that we got these great tourist centers we\u2019re having, we\u2019re suffering from that impact. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term impact. But it\u2019s starting to anniversary and it shouldn\u2019t continue to get worse, okay.", "But Alex, it could get worse because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen with the dollar. The international tourist market is volatile. At best, we live in an uncertain time. But I think we\u2019re doing, to deliver this 3.5% and deliver over 6% portfolio growth is I think is reasonably good, it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s reasonably good given some of the constraints that we\u2019re dealing with that are a little bit out of our control, a little bit. We\u2019re going to take responsibility for a lot of that stuff, but a little bit out of control.", "So, I think it\u2019s too early to tell you on \u201817. Unfortunately I say this because it starts not next week, the week after, Rick, property budgets?", "Rick Sokolov", "Yes, week after.", "David Simon", "Week after where we go one-by-one, space-by-space and we\u2019ll report back early next year what our view of that is. And it\u2019s a little, there is a little more volatility in being able, the standard deviations probably little bit higher than it used to be just because of the environment that we have that we\u2019re operating in.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. And just confirming you\u2019re taking an, $0.08-charge, that\u2019s in guidance for Copley?", "David Simon", "I\u2019m glad you asked that. And the answer is yes. That is in guidance. So if we had not taken that charge, our guidance would be up another $0.08.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay. Thanks, David.", "David Simon", "No worries. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi, good morning. Just to follow-on on that, so that would be $0.13. I mean is there anything you could point to as a driver of that kind of guidance increase in late October?", "David Simon", "Well, generally we\u2019re producing the results we want to produce. So I know the operating metrics on that, perfect, we\u2019re not going to deny that. I mean, but we told at the beginning of the year, this is the plan, 3.5%, 6%, and we\u2019re producing a little bit better on that front overall. And that\u2019s where it rolls up to.", "And so, we\u2019re being very cautious on Copley, we have made the final decision on that. But I think it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to do that. But we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got to run it through the board and - but I want the market to know that that maybe off the table going forward at least for the time being.", "And we could - look we could have kept it on our books and waited but you know what, I think the right thing to do if we in fact decide to do it will be to pick that hit.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay. And then you mentioned in terms of the same-store number not just PacSun, but then also I think you said intentionally kind of reducing the specialty leasing program in the common area at some of your high-end malls. Is that a material impact? And kind of what\u2019s sort of the thought process behind that? And kind of maybe - if you have a number, you\u2019ve given us in the past kind of what that program is as a percent of NOI?", "David Simon", "Well, I think it\u2019s material and that it does affect the comp number. The comps would be higher had we not chosen. But look, part of what we have to do is, listen to our clients. Our clients to some degree especially in certain areas of the mall very concerned about that. So, we want to be receptive, we\u2019ve got competition in some of these markets that we\u2019ve got to be responsive to. And we just think it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "We did a lot of research on the consumer. Consumer really doesn\u2019t care but on the other hand, we have two - when it comes to the property business, we\u2019ve got to listen to our clients i.e. the retailers, etcetera. And we obviously have to be listened to the consumers, they diverge here but in this case we want to be as sensitive to the clients as we can. And some are very sensitive to us and we don\u2019t want to keep that from bringing the right mix into some of these centers. And that has hurt us over the years. We\u2019ve thinned out in the very high-end properties. Yes, go ahead.", "Paul Morgan", "I was just going to say, has this strategy been kind of accelerating recently is why you mentioned it in terms of the same-store number this quarter or has it kind of been ongoing over the past period of time?", "David Simon", "I think it\u2019s been, look, we didn\u2019t really do it last year because a lot of these projects were in the state of development. But it\u2019s clearly been - it\u2019s clearly been throughout \u201817.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay.", "David Simon", "And remember, this stuff builds, it has more of a...", "Rick Sokolov", "As you go later in the year it has more of a back-end impact, okay. So it kind of builds, it\u2019s less important in Q1 and Q2 just because seasonality of our business.", "Paul Morgan", "Great. Then just last question; I appreciate all the color on the Aero-economics. And just wanted to ask, there\u2019ve been dozens of similar bankruptcies over the years and you probably could\u2019ve had opportunities to do something similar then. Maybe could you point to anything outside just the economics of it that makes you think differently about this? And then just going forward, I know you had the macro view about vertical integration, but anything more, kind of your narrow business driven where you didn\u2019t do this for years and now it looks interesting?", "David Simon", "Well, I think that\u2019s a very good question. And I would say this, I think as we\u2019ve gotten to know authentic brand group we now have, for us to have done this without their involvement on how to stabilize and then grow the brand, I mean, that would, I might have that expertise a couple of years from now, maybe, I mean, I\u2019d say, we, I doubt it, but maybe, you never know.", "And I think having and we have talked, it\u2019s very interesting. I\u2019ve been talking to authentic brands over - for a year about another, brands that might fit into this model that we are creating. But they didn\u2019t come to fruition for whatever reason. But I think we finally, we have, over this last year been able to develop kind of an operating model and platform.", "They\u2019re great at brand building, having general growth as part of that. And their ability to bring their real-estate and their thoughtfulness to the table in terms of how you operate the business was very helpful. So having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really the long - in a nutshell it was really, because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so much to the table that this was the right deal.", "If it were just us on our own, I\u2019d be the first to tell you I don\u2019t know that we would do it, we\u2019ve done Starbuck franchises but that\u2019s we did by the way. And I encourage everybody that goes Del Amo, goes to Pink\u2019s Hotdogs, that\u2019s owned by your company, Simon Property Group. I\u2019m so, excited about that franchise as we own. It\u2019s great hotdogs. It\u2019s an institution. That\u2019s - we\u2019ve got a small group that kind of runs that business, this is a little bit out of the ordinary.", "And I would say simply put, the fact that we had this partnership that was able to navigate all of the complexities of this. And so, I think that\u2019s the important determinant of why we did this versus not doing others.", "Paul Morgan", "And the partners see it as not necessarily just a one-off, but something that could be replicated?", "David Simon", "Yes, but we\u2019ve got to walk, crawl before we run.", "Paul Morgan", "Great, thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Rich Hill", "Hi guys. Thanks for the time this morning; and I always appreciate the transparency. I wanted to just ask a quick question about the lease amendments, maybe in the context of your broader portfolio of malls. You have obviously the luxury of seeing across the productivity spectrum.", "So when we\u2019re thinking about lease amendments in maybe your higher-quality malls, is it may be the case that some of these tenants are paying above-market rents to get into the best-quality malls and, therefore, you might still be incentivized to make a lease amendment? Maybe reduce their rent, but recognizing it\u2019s still a pretty attractive rent overall? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Then maybe if you could provide some color, if any, about how you\u2019re seeing lease amendments on malls doing $700 a square-foot versus maybe those doing $350. But I do appreciate that it\u2019s mall-to-mall.", "David Simon", "Well, I mean, that\u2019s the bottom line. Certainly we have some of those cases. But it really is mall-by-mall, space-by-space. And what the retailer relationship is and what we think the retailer future is. I wish there were simple straightforward answer but there is not. We try to use our business judgment in figuring out what the right is.", "It\u2019s also we want to be conservative or do we want to be aggressive what\u2019s our mood of the future. As you know last year, we had a lot of bankruptcies. And we gave direction to like okay, we\u2019re starting to change our attitude a little bit, I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s going to be a complete reversal. And we try the right we make the right judgment call.", "Now I will tell you lease amendments are like anything else. Once you do it for one retailer, don\u2019t kid yourself, you hear about it, and it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And but we\u2019ve experienced this before, we did do is in other economic times. And again, our business is fine but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s - we\u2019re trying to be accommodating but we could shift our strategy pretty quickly. And we try to evaluate it one-by-one. Rick, do you want to add anything to it?", "Rick Sokolov", "I would say to you the most important consideration to realize this - these are lease amendments that are not forever. One of our considerations is do we have a better replacement tenant but that tenant won\u2019t be ready to open for a year or where it is in the project and what is the project. So all of those factors come into play as to how we want to deal with this specific room and how we price the room and how we interface with that tenant.", "And the only other point I would make is that, and it gets lost some times. But today our portfolio has never been stronger, never been better physical condition, never had a better mix of small-shot tenants, better mix of boxes, better mix of restaurants better set of amenities.", "So, we are on a continual basis taking share and that\u2019s our focus to make our properties as compelling as they can be. And that helps us in dealing with all the things you\u2019ve been talking about.", "David Simon", "And again, the business we are 96.3% occupied. And as an example, Macy\u2019s announced 100 store closing. Their closing, Macy\u2019s is leaving one of our malls, they\u2019re leaving one of our malls, we think. And a very small mall that has basically no financial impact to us at the end of the day.", "So, there is this narrative and the mood. But the fact of the matter is, go back to 7.3% NOI growth that\u2019s $300 million. Let\u2019s put it all in perspective, okay.", "Rich Hill", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Great, thanks. Could you give a brief update on what\u2019s happening with your Seritage JV?", "Rick Sokolov", "We are basically in the same position that we articulated in our last earnings call. We have identified users for our boxes. We have plans for our boxes. We are not going to proceed with that redevelopment. And so we have a firm understanding of our returns and the costs of downsize from the Sear stores.", "There are conversations going on right now regarding those costs. And as soon as we have a clear understanding of that we\u2019re in a position to proceed to try next year on some of those redevelopments.", "Floris van Dijkum", "And that would include the Primark at Burlington Mall?", "Rick Sokolov", "That is independent. That is proceeding as is the addition of Primark at South Shore in a portion Sears which is not in Seritage. The Primark lease at Burlington was, existing at the time we did our joint venture. And that is proceeding.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Great. Thanks, Rick. David, a question for you in terms of how sustainable do you - I mean, you\u2019re talking about the 6.6% to 7% NOI growth, but if you put that in perspective, you do that for a decade you\u2019ve doubled NOI. I mean is that realistic for a $100 billion company?", "David Simon", "We\u2019re working to achieve that, okay. I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not that clairvoyant to look out that far.", "Floris van Dijkum", "But do you see anything near term that\u2019s going to break that streak?", "David Simon", "Well, I think we\u2019re going to lead our industry and portfolio NOI growth as we\u2019ve done it for so long, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t continue.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "David Simon", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Mueller", "Hi, I guess going back to Aero for a second; you discussed this as being more of an opportunistic investment. But out of curiosity, when you first thought about it and got into it was it more a defensive play to control store closings? How did you look at it initially?", "David Simon", "Not at all, as I said in my opening comments, I mean, no one would put new money into a business that we didn\u2019t think would have exciting future. And that\u2019s evidenced by kind of the group that we have bought the companies. So we certainly get the benefit of Aero paying rent. But that\u2019s not a reason to invest in a business. We could re-lease those spaces. And that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not a factor in putting new money into investment.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it, okay. On the outlet side, you talked about international expansion. Can you just talk about the U.S. and what the opportunities are that you see over the next 5 years, 10 years, just what does that pipeline look like?", "David Simon", "In our outlet business?", "Michael Mueller", "Yes, outlets.", "David Simon", "I think, the pace may not be as hectic as we\u2019ve done over the last three or four years. But Norfolk we open next year, we\u2019re going to actually start another outlet in the spring of this year, spring \u201817 in a very good growing market. We\u2019ve got another one under serious examination. So I don\u2019t think it will be as maybe as active as we\u2019ve had over the last two or three years, but we\u2019ll selectively do some stuff one, at least one a year on average, maybe two. We\u2019ve got some I think some unique opportunities.", "We\u2019re also very focused on expanding with the Allen deal. Adding 120,000-square-foot to a center that does, I don\u2019t know $600 plus a foot, and the outlet business is very attractive. So there is a lot to do with domestic portfolio as well.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it, okay, that was it. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thank you. So David, I just wanted to go back to something you just said just a minute ago. As you deal with retailers like Aeropostale and PacSun and go through your lease negotiations, how do you really contain the risk that somehow leverage doesn\u2019t move more towards retailers that might be in trouble, that might come back to you and try to do similar deals going forward?", "David Simon", "Well, as I said when this happens, you get, you do get a - it does tend to spread. On the other hand it\u2019s very simple, so we\u2019re not going to do it. So that changes the dynamics pretty quickly. So, look, again, we don\u2019t, this is a space-by-space, retail-by-retailer decision. It\u2019s not pervasive throughout.", "But this and again I explained to you our rationale as to why we kind of did it \u201815, \u201816. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll reevaluate every day with every retailer. And my instinct is that we could be changing how we dealt with kind of the \u201815,\u201916 stuff already. But it will be a case-by-case basis.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay. And just going back to your development pipeline, you have about $3.5 billion worth of projects. Just given that some of those projects or a lot of them were probably started at time where maybe the view of the health of the retail environment might be a little bit different, how should we think about the overall arc of capital deployment? Is it reasonable to expect that number to come down going forward?", "David Simon", "Look, there is nothing in our redevelopment that we\u2019re not doing other than potentially Copley. And Copley was I mean I would encourage everybody to study what\u2019s going in construction cost and what\u2019s going on in supply and demand there. We did not want to be, unfortunately the build there is longer than it should be because of the nature of how we have to reinforce the structure.", "And we spent a lot on it because to get approvals and to make sure we had the engineering to do it. But the reality is, when we started seeing the construction cost, it just not the right time to do it with all the supply and the cost there. We don\u2019t see that anywhere else in the portfolio.", "So, we\u2019ve got a lot of very interesting stuff to do beyond what we\u2019re doing now. And like I said we\u2019ve done some really good work in the field and King of Prussia, being part of Brickell, Clearfork, we\u2019ve got plans to expand Fashion Valley and I could go through the whole list. But that part of the business is unabated because we think investing in our great real-estate is what we should do for a living and that\u2019s not changing.", "But we do have to worry about supply and demand. And I\u2019m not worried about supply and demand in our retail portfolio. In the case of Copley I got nervous about it. Be the first to admit.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.", "David Simon", "All right, thank you for your questions. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

We successfully executed several capital market transactions, further increasing our liquidity, extending our average term, and reducing our average weighted \u2013 average interest cost, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.", "Our full year 2016 FFO per diluted share was $10.49, which includes a $0.38 charge for the early redemption of our 10.35% notes. On a comparable basis, full-year FFO per share was $10.87, and increased 9% year-over-year. We once again delivered compelling FFO growth and we have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 11% over the last three years and 13% over the last five years. The $10.87 exceeded our initial guidance range of $10.70 to $10.80, even after the impact to our FFO of the $0.08 charge we recorded in the fourth quarter due to our decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower.", "We are excellent project managers and had obtained 14 out of the 15 required approvals needed to proceed with the tower and expected to get the last one, but unfortunately, the goalpost kept moving. The change in the project approval dynamics and the uncertainty of receiving the last approval, combined with the rapidly rising construction cost and our heightened concern about supply in the Boston residential market, prompted us to postpone the project and take the charge. While write-offs of development costs can occur in the real estate business, it is rare for us to experience a charge of this size and we're not pleased about it.", "For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.53 per share includes the $0.38 per share loss on the extinguishment of debt. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, but including the $0.08 charge of the Copley Residential write-off, FFO per diluted share increased 6.6% year-over-year and comparable FFO per share growth would have been 9.5% without the Copley charge.", "Moving on from our results, now could be the time on the call where I could go into a lengthy philosophical discussion on the popular misconceptions about the mall business, created by the never-ending current public narrative. And I could counter that by pointing that we have 434 department stores in our portfolio, and only one is vacant, and how in the recently announced department store closing, we have only one closure in our portfolio, or how we have added more than 275 sit-down or quick-service restaurants, more than 20 entertainment concepts, and more than 80 big box tenants across our portfolio over the last four, five years, or how we've added mixed use components to our centers in the last several years, we have built 10 hotels and residents representing nearly 3,000 units, or how according to a recent survey a Generation Z members, a group that outsizes Millennials, 70% of those surveyed visit the mall at least once a month and visit more than four stores during the visit, or how the consumers still like to shop in stores, because they want to touch and feel the products before they make a final decision, or how online retail sales have grown to less than 10% of total retail sales, and that the retailers who occupy our centers represent approximately two-thirds of those total online sales, or how leading e-commerce retailers, like Warby Parker, Blue Nile, UNTUCKit, Shinola, among others, are opening physical stores, because the inherent advantage a physical location provides as well as being a natural extension to the digital world, or how basket sizes are higher, return rates are lower in stores compared to online purchases, and margins are much higher in the store than they are in the Internet, or how emerging brands like GUIDEBOAT, NIC+ZOE, Peloton, to name a few, continue to see the mall as the launch pad to build their brand awareness, as a result of the significant traffic they experience being at the mall, much like Apple or Microsoft did several years ago, or how we are making all these changes and enhancements to our center, even though Congress has tilted the scale towards e-commerce by not implementing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which not requiring the sales and use tax to be paid by consumers who buy products online, even though they are required to do so under existing laws.", "But I could do that, but I won't, because we've talked about that all before, so I'd rather focus on what we do and how we do it, and that is we reinvest in our properties, making them the best centers in the respective markets. We grow our earnings, we generate excess cash flow, we pay higher dividends, and we achieve all of this while maintaining the industry's strongest balance sheet. That's our model and that's what we do for the benefit of our shareholders, our communities, and our retailers. We continue to record solid key operating metrics and grow our cash flow.", "Over the last six years, we have doubled our dividend from $3.50 in 2011 to an expected payout of at least $7 this year and increased our annual cash flow after distribution by more than 20% from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion even after having taken into the account the loss of cash flow from the spin-off of WPG.", "We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio. Our malls and premium outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.8%, 70 basis points higher than year-end 2005 and near historic high levels. Leasing activity remains solid, the malls and premium outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.82 per square foot, an increase of 12.7%.", "In our supplement this morning, we have provided new information regarding our leasing spreads. Our new disclosure is based upon an open and closed methodology, excluding less than one year terms and captures a higher percentage of our leasing activities than our previous calculation with over 8 million square feet of annual leasing activity included.", "Our base minimum rent was up to $51.59, which was up 5.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations. Total portfolio NOI increased 6.7% or more than $380 million for the year. Comp NOI increased 3.8% for the quarter and 3.6% for the year.", "Comp NOI growth was impacted by more than $30 million decline in overage rent for the year due to the lower sales volume at our tourist-oriented centers. This lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI growth by approximately 60 basis points for the year and to put this all in perspective, which we think is important. Over the last five years, our comp NOI has increased an average of 4.4% per year and our annual comp NOI has increased by $1.2 billion since 2012.", "Now let's talk about reported retailer sales at our malls and outlets, were $614 per foot compared to $620 per foot in 2015. Sales per square foot for our combined malls and outlets increased in each successive months during the fourth quarter, reflecting consumers' strong interest in holiday shopping at our centers. Reported retailer sales continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Excluding the impact on those centers, sales per square foot was flat for the year. We are the industry leader in gift card offerings and productivity.", "In 2016, we achieved record gift card sales with a 14% year-over-year comp growth. Consumer interest in our gift card program is a really good indicator of traffic to our centers. And these sales support our view that traffic was up in our centers for 2016.", "Quickly on redevelopment, at the end of the fourth quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three platforms, with our share of the net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. We completed a number of strategic developments in the fourth quarter and we'll complete a number of transformations throughout 2017, including The Galleria and La Plaza Mall, College Mall and a new development we opened two new projects in the fourth quarter, which promise to be great additions to our portfolio.", "First of all, Clarksburg Premium Outlets had the strongest open of any premium outlet in a long time, shoppers swarmed the D.C. area's new premier home for outlet shopping and Brickell City Centre in Miami opened in the fourth quarter. We believe it's a landmark mixed-use development offering unparalleled shopping, dining and entertainment experience.", "Construction continues on another full price development in Fort Worth at Shops at Clearfork, which is anchored by Neiman. We also have five new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia; four in the international markets, France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all scheduled to open this year. At the end of the fourth quarter, our share of investment at these six new development projects was $506 million.", "Now let's talk about our fortress balance sheet, which continues to differentiate us compared to our peer group. 2016 was the first year that our annual fixed charge coverage was over 5 times.", "We completed three senior note offerings during the year totaling $3.8 billion, with an average weighted coupon rate of 2.86% and weighted average term of 11.4 years. The $3.8 billion is a record amount of notes we have ever issued in a single year.", "We also retired five series of senior notes comprising $1.9 billion at a weighted average coupon of 6.5%. We completed 27 mortgage loans with a weighted average interest of 3.67% and 9.4 years respectively.", "Our share of these mortgages was $3 billion, another record amount in a single year for us and contrary to media reports about the inability or ability to finance malls. Our current liquidity stands at $7 billion. We also repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $255 million in the fourth quarter. Dividend, we have paid a record dividend in 2016 of $6.50 per share and have achieved the compound annual growth rate of 12% over the last three years. Today we announced a dividend of $1.75 per share for this quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9.4%.", "As I mentioned previously, we expect to pay at least $7 per share in 2017, which will be an increase of 7.7% compared to 2016. Finally, guidance, our 2017 guidance range is $11.45 to $11.55. This range represents approximately 9% to 10% growth compared to our reported FFO per share of $10.49 in 2016 or 5.3% to 6.3% compared to our comparable FFO per share of $10.87, which, without question, will be the high end of our peer group.", "Once again, our range is based on the following assumptions, comparable NOI growth for our combined mall, premium outlet and mills platform of (16:31) 3%, no plans or disposition activity, a rising interest rate environment, the impact from a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2016 levels, including the translation impact of our international operations and the impact on domestic spending by international tourist and a diluted share count of approximately 361 million shares.", "And we're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I was wondering, your redevelopments, you have previously said, you think you can spend $1 billion through 2018? Does it look like if you go past that 2018 and still continue to spend that $1 billion a year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Craig, I think the answer is most likely. Obviously, we do expect to redevelop a lot of the Seritage joint venture projects over time. And there may be other department stores. But I think, we feel reasonably good about that kind of number but we're going to also \u2013 look, I think, the most important thing that we've done for ourselves and probably I could say for the industry is we've invested in our product. We are in the physical real estate business. And by having a good product, well tenanted that looks and feels good, we think drives traffic and we think helps our retailers and our consumers. So we'll continue to invest in our projects because we know it does pay dividends literally and figuratively.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then you touched on the international shopper, I mean, is that shopper plateauing \u2013 not plateauing but leveling out, stabilizing? And should we think of 2017 increase in percentage rent relative to the amount collected in 2016?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we're being relatively conservative. I mean it's impossible to project what's going to happen with tourism and the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the yen or the euro or the real in terms of \u2013 down in South America, so we're taking our best estimate. Obviously, we've experienced a lot of volatility in that area. These are great assets that we want to own for the long run. But we are suffering a little bit of extra volatility. I think we did see a plateau in the fourth quarter, Craig, on that as evidenced by our sales increase in each and every month. It was below the 2015 levels, primarily because of that tourism spend, but it is starting to get a little bit better. I think you've seen a number of the luxury players announcing better results, but it's just a volatile world, volatile market and we do our very best at projecting what we think it is. And that's our number and we're kind of more cautious than anything at this point.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Just on the lease spreads, you changed the reporting and I get your reason in terms of it being a bigger chunk of the activity. I mean, it still kind of shows a drop year-over-year. And I'm wondering, I mean, if you were to have reported it on a kind of the same basis, would it kind of have been comparable to the 10.9% you had last quarter and how should we think about next year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I figured it would \u2013 you would ask that and it would be a 11.7%. But let me take a step back, because I think this is really \u2013 so Paul, it would be a 11.7% spread, okay. That's the question to your first \u2013 that's the answer to your first question. But let me take a \u2013 let me explain to you how we think about our business. We run our business for cash flow growth, NOI growth. Okay. And the metrics spit out but we don't manage our business for metrics. So, when the market reacted to our leasing spreads, we said, well, we kind of have a feel for them, but that's not how we run the business, we run the business for cash flow growth. Obviously, that's been a pretty good strategy because we've grown our comp NOI by $1.2 billion over the last four years, five years, guys. So, that strategy that I've had about growing our cash flow and focusing on comp NOI has been pretty damn good because $1.2 billion is bigger than most REITs. I don't even know how many REITs have $1.2 billion of NOI. So, put that aside.", "So, we were looking \u2013 boy, the market react to these spreads, what is it? So we did some research. And I'll give you a small example. So, we have a \u2013 because it's same space to same space is how we historically calculated our spreads. So, we're picking up, as an example, a \u2013 taking back a Forever 21 box in St. Johns mall, okay, which was, I don't know, 15,000 square feet thereabouts. We split it up into three rooms, Tesla, Apple, what was the third?", "Unknown Speaker", "Tory Burch.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Tory Burch. We had huge rent spreads, but because it wasn't same space to same space, for whatever strange reason, it wasn't in our numbers, okay. So we said, look, one of the goals that we're going to do to run our comp NOI is try to downsize as many of the retailers to increase their productivity and to put in as many tenants as we can and in these great malls because we'll get \u2013 we'll actually get more productivity, which could lead to higher rents. But because it wasn't same space to same space, it wasn't in our numbers. So we said, well, timeout. We've got to do this on a basis that gives you a better perspective of our strategy.", "Again, we are not overwhelmed about lease spreads, and it's all about getting the best retailer in the best space at an appropriate rent. And we're going to be downsizing tenants where we can, upsizing them where we can. And if they're not that same space, it's not going to be in the spread. So we went back to 2015 and did it based on the new calculation.", "We're going to be doing \u2013 we did it for 2016 in total. And I gave you the number for what it's been under the old methodology, but we think, this is better. And it will pick up the ability for us to do what we do best, which is grow our comp NOI. As I mentioned to you, that's what I focus on, that's what we \u2013 when we sit and go through the mall, we don't talk lease spreads, we talk about how we're growing the cash flow.", "And we've had this discussion, we had this discussion on tenant sales one year, we had the discussion on occupancy one year, now, it's lease spreads. My friend, we focus on cash flow growth. Now that's allowed us to increase our comp NOI by $1.2 billion and increased our dividend from $3.50 to $7. I don't know, what else I can tell you.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "That was very helpful. And just a quick \u2013 a follow-up on Sears. You mentioned how you have almost no anchor vacancies in the portfolio and a little exposure to the closings that have taken place. Obviously, there is kind of speculation about maybe a larger volume at a faster pace coming back. Maybe you could just give a little bit of color on kind of how something like that might play out in terms of your portfolio even if it's maybe a longer-term positive, what would kind of be the short-term dislocation and kind of what do you think it would look like in terms of backfilling space?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, let me just \u2013 without \u2013 let me tell you why we've been able to grow our comp NOI is because we believe in our product and we invest in our product. And I think what we have seen from some in the retail world is, they're not investing in their physical stores and they're investing more online and the margins online are not what they are in the physical environment. And so, if they're not keeping up with our \u2013 the bargain that we're doing, we have \u2013 we'd love to get the space back and redevelop it. And so, we're prepared for any and all scenarios. Hopefully, they will invest in their stores, but if they don't we'd rather take them back and redevelop it. But Rick \u2013 I'll let Rick add to that as well.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "One of the things that we are doing, have been doing and will continue to do is we have a constantly updated grid on all the boxes that are interested in each of our properties and we know exactly where we can accommodate them based on the opportunities that present themselves. David mentioned in his comments, we've replaced over 80 of them in the last five years. We're ready, we've done it on a disciplined basis. All you have to do is look in our 8-K in every quarter, you're going to see all that activity, it's continuing and we are ready to do it. And in virtually every instance, where we have replaced an anchor, we've increased our sales, increased the number of reasons that people come to shop our properties and we've made good returns on our capital.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great, thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "David, just related to your comments regarding managing the business for cash flow, in terms of your approach to the leasing environment today. On one of the last calls you talked about your experience with A\u00e9ro and PacSun and maybe not offering as much rent relief going forward as you did in 2016 and just letting stores closed. And so with a lot of retailers out there today talking about store closures, just wondering what your thoughts are on managing that process today and are you seeing more request for rent relief than you did a year and two years ago. Just trying to piece together the noise and versus what you're actually hearing.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Sure. I think that it's \u2013 Christy, I think it's safe to say we're seeing more request for rent relief. And I wish there were like \u2013 we're certainly prepared to look at it as leases expire. However, we're not going to go into 2018s, 2019s and 2020s for retailer who wants to do that. And the fact of the matter is, our view of it is, a lot of times they ask and you certainly don't lose anything by asking.", "So we do \u2013 we deal with it at, at least expiration and it really is a case-by-case basis. But I'll tell you a fascinating thing that I've learned at A\u00e9ro \u2013 with the A\u00e9ro investment. So and it's just the dynamic of Wall Street, retailers, chasing Internet sales, there is a whole philosophical discussion that will take too long on this call to do. But one thing at A\u00e9ro that I learned is that that management team could produce higher level of profitability, higher gross margins if they didn't have the Wall Street constraint on worrying about comp NOI or comp sales growth i.e. they could generate more cash flow because they're not worried about posting a comp sales number that's below market expectations.", "Well, I'm a business guy, okay. And I kind of like cash flows. So we've got this A\u00e9ro and we're still in a turnaround and I don't really know, how it's all going to work out. But it's like the management team has been unleashed in terms of how to run their business for profitability because they have no concern about posting a comp sales number that Wall Street wants to see.", "I'm not damning Wall Street, but the reality is sometimes it's okay, just to think about cash flow. And obviously, there is other metrics that people are more interested in. But we sat down and we focused on return on equity, cash flow growth, I mean, I think we'd see different dynamics from the retail community than what we have. But getting back to you, so the point is, if there is a lease action, i.e. a expiration, it's a case by case or more people are asking about it than in \u2013 than they were maybe a couple of years ago, the answer is yes. We did experience less store closures last year than we did in 2015, the way we had suggested we would, that's why our occupancy went up, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it, retail environment is not \u2013 it's not robust, it's doggy dog right now.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, with percentage rent still trending down a lot year-over-year, I'm just wondering is that decline still only being driven by sort of the pressure from international tourist spend or is there another point of weakness there? And as you think about 2017 and your 3% store NOI growth, what impact are you expecting from any further decline in percentage rent, should we start to see that impact to be?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I'm hoping it would stabilize. The reality, it's only because of this \u2013 the strong dollar and the tourism spend. It's \u2013 we've studied it. Look, there could have been \u2013 we have \u2013 I think the other thing to keep \u2013 I mean, we have energy oriented assets, Oklahoma, Texas, we have the peso, so I mentioned the euro, I mentioned the yen, but you throw in the peso, you throw in the Canadian dollar, I love that all, again, the energy market, that all had an impact on overage. I'm hoping the energy market is a little more stable. Obviously, the dollar, the currency is going to be a volatile year. We did our best guess by \u2013 we estimate every tenant and whatever, we have a formula that does it. But I mean, it's more of an art, not a science, we'll see but that's the sole impact, it's only because of the dollar and tourism.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then just one final point of clarification on the re-leasing spreads just because we get asked about it a lot. With the change in methodology, is the rent relief that you granted last year still in the calculation or no?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey, good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good morning out there. Just a few questions here, David. First, obviously, we all read Internet, newspaper, whatever median it is and you hear all the retailers making noise. But in practicality, in your experience, you mentioned fewer store closings last year than 2015, how much sabre-rattling is there among the retailer to say hey, we're closing stores versus when you guys get in there, their talk is different?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well I think, it all depends upon what point are they in their financial equation. Look, I think \u2013 and again, this is more philosophical, but what we'd like to see from the retail community is a dedication back to improving the store environment.", "We think a lot of the capital that has been put forward has been to chase Internet sales, a lot of that has been done through promotional efforts. And between that and the promotions required to get them to buy online between the cost of shipping and the returns, it's not a great model for them.", "And we think it would be and we've done so much to drive traffic in our centers, we've got decks that all these retailers, we've sent out to them. We did a couple of tests in middle market malls about what we can do, we put an ice skating rink, we did concerts, we've done so much to drive traffic to the mall, to the store. We think, if they could pivot somewhat, it would do everybody a world of good.", "And at the end of the day, it is more profitable for them by and large, I'm sure there is a retailer here or there that would argue this. But it is much more profitable for them to have that transaction happen at the store, okay. And I just think there needs to be a pivot back towards that. And then I think it would be better for everybody's business.", "With that said, I mean there is a lot of noise, we're going to have to kind of go through the noise, I won't tell you though, Alex. I mean, the business is \u2013 we're growing now, we're pros at grinding, nobody does it better, nobody has ended up at the end of that grinding in a better spot than we have. We've done some of our best work in those grinding moments. We've got the group and the management team and the personnel. We don't have turnover, where Midwestern roll up your sleeves folks and it's not as much fun but we get the job done.", "I mean look at our balance sheet, $7 billion of liquidity, a 5.0% no floating rate debt, we did the most financing ever last year, so we got to deal with it. Don't really know how it will all shake out while we've been relatively conservative on our comp NOI, but that's not to say we don't have work to do to achieve that. Because I don't want to sugarcoat anything here, I mean we're in a \u2013 the retailer have to pivot in my humble opinion, what do I know, but in my humble opinion, they need to pivot a little bit and we're trying to encourage them to do that, but we'll see if we have any success in that. You know what I'm saying, Alex?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Yeah. No, absolutely, I don't think anyone would ever say that you sugarcoat stuff. So, no I think it's clear. More to that point, though, the department stores seem to get a lot of headlines when they announced \u2013 Macy's announced (38:45) et cetera. You guys mentioned 80 boxes backfilled and that you have plans for basically all of them.", "Do you think that there is an ability to see just acceleration of conversion of department stores or based on supply and demand you actually don't want that many back at any one time, the pace that we're seeing right now, whether it be a Seritage or Macy's or whoever the department store chain is, the current pace that we're all seeing is actually the right pace to maximize supply and demand or do you think that you can increase that to get at more?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Alex, this is Rick. First, let me underline one point, which is we've analyzed all of our department stores. We know their sales, we know their occupancy cost, we know their market position. And these stores have \u2013 witness the fact that of all the closures that have taken place, virtually none have been in our portfolio and that's because the productivity of these stores in our portfolio and the profitability of these stores is in the higher quartiles of all of these operating fleets. That said, we are ready to take them back should the opportunity present itself, where we can make money and do it on a cost effective basis.", "We know what we will do with these stores if we get the opportunity. We are, in fact, marketing them now and going ahead with redevelopment plan. So we know we've got tenants lined up and what we would to do stores if they become available.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay, Rick. Thank you. Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Alex.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.", "Jeremy Metz - UBS", "Hey. Good morning out there.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's out here. We are out here.", "Jeremy Metz - UBS", "As you've got more of these anchor boxes back, F&B has played an increasing role (40:53) in terms of some of the re-tenanting of those spaces. I was wondering can you talk strategically about your desire to add more F&B. How do you weigh the credit risk versus doing more traditional in line, maybe just framing out how much of the portfolio is F&B today versus where you see it growing?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well I would say \u2013 yeah, one of the best things that we've done, we \u2013 the industry has done is add a lot better restaurants over the last five years. And I think, we've added, what, 275 was the number over the last five years. So we think, that's a trend to continue. We think one of the best things that we've seen in terms of our entrepreneurial focus has been on the F&B side and not only that, but also on the entertainment side. Like what we're doing at Clearfork, what we've done with some of the mills boxes. I think, that's a trend, I don't have the exact percent that we've increased it from X to Y. We can get that for you, I don't have in front of me. But it's clearly been a meaningful increase. And we do think, as some of these like Seritage joint ventures and even if we get some of the other department store boxes back, part of that will be to add F&B, to add entertainment. But also and I said a lot in my remarks and I'm not very eloquent, so I stumble over most of my words, but I mean we did add 3,000 units. I actually had us double-check that because I said, let's add that in our text, between apartments and hotels keys, we added three units over the last few years.", "So we do think, it's also, we know we failed at Copley and I'm not happy about that, is a mea culpa there. But the fact is we've added 3,000 units, which is not all profitable other than the Copley experience. And we think, a lot of that, that this stuff will be mixed use, as well. So it will be probably generally away from just pure apparel. If you see what we're doing in McAllen, when we took the Sears box down, we are adding like traditional retail, but the front of that will be five \u2013 is it four or five restaurants?", "Unknown Speaker", "Five restaurants.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Five restaurants kind of front of the mall there. So I think that's going to be an absolute \u2013 continue a trend and we're seeing more and more exciting concepts like \u2013 look, Shake Shack came out of nowhere four, five years ago, great operator, great company, great people to do business with. But we're seeing more and more of that creativity coming in that whole category.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And, Jeremy, let me just say, it's not only just adding restaurants, but I encourage you to go out and visit the Westchester and Roosevelt Field and King of Prussia, and look how we are transforming the environment in which these food operators are conducting business in our properties; greatly enhanced seating areas, entertainment areas, play areas, you name it. So with a much more sophisticated environment, which we know will extend the stay of our shopper and attract a more affluent shopper, because they are more inclined to spend time in the environments we're creating.", "Jeremy Metz - UBS", "Appreciate it. And would that include adding grocery stores at any point?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure. I mean, we added Wegmans recently. We're under construction with 365, which is a Whole Foods product, and there is a bunch of other activities in that whole area. So we think that's a nice mix to add to.", "Jeremy Metz - UBS", "Appreciate that. And if I could ask one more. I mean, in the opening remarks you mentioned no dispositions in 2017. Just given some of the commentary about the increased pressure in retailers, there is a secular change we are seeing in shopping online. Does this alter your view at all on the appropriate size of the portfolio long-term and strategically make you think about possibly considering for any more assets from you?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, I think we've always shown that we've \u2013 we'll prune. So, it is very likely that we'll sell additional assets throughout the year. But we're not \u2013 I do not believe in selling. You have to understand, I'm maybe a little bit different. But I look at the present value of the cash flow stream first when I decide whether we should sell or not. Obviously, we think the mall or the asset's going away, then that present value, you can get a \u2013 if you can get it for \u2013 you can get a little premium to the present value of that stream, it can go away.", "But we don't sell assets, because of my help or sales per square foot go up or down. I look at cash flow. That's worked for us, because \u2013 I mean, look at our balance sheet, look at our NOI growth, look at any metric you want to compare us against, nobody in this industry has done that. So that kind of strategy has worked, but we still have assets that probably don't fit in our long-term view point and if we can make a decent trade, we will. But we're not going to be \u2013 we're not going to give away stuff just because we think it might help our metrics.", "Jeremy Metz - UBS", "I appreciate the color. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys. Just, David, I guess, I'm curious to build on your earlier remarks. What's the catalyst that you think is needed to allow retailers to make that pivot? Does it require more privatization of retailers, like you've done with A\u00e9ro? Is it we need e-commerce sales to slow, so that refocuses Wall Street maybe on profits? I'm just curious how that never-ending narrative converges maybe with the perspective of the mall owners, because it is a wide chasm and it \u2013 I'm curious what your perspective is.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think it takes leadership and courage. And I think they have to believe in the product that they are selling, and if you believe in the product, then you should invest in the product. And if you are a physical retailer, then your product is stores. And if you believe in the store model, you should invest in the stores. Just like we're in the mall business, we believe in the malls, we're going to invest in the malls, and it takes leadership. It's contrary to what Wall Street wants, because they want Internet sales and, I don't know, maybe Wall Street is right. But I think it is very easy to shop on the Internet. So, if you don't have a good looking physical store and good looking service, quality service, and if you don't have inventory in the store and you're promoting more online than going to the store, in my humble opinion \u2013 I don't know a lot, but in my humble opinion, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I would like a little bit more conviction in what they do.", "Let's talk about the casino business. You could say the gaming could all go online. But if you're Steve Wynn, you build the best product, you have the best service, and lo and behold, people show up, they gain, they participate, they stay there, and he gets great returns on equity. He has got unbelievable conviction and he puts his money where his mouth is. We need that in our business. What's hurt our business in retail, frankly, is that there has been too many leverage buyouts with too much debt, and we all know no matter how good a retailer you are, you're going to run into ebbs and flows. And lo and behold, when you run into that scenario, you've got a balance sheet that can't withstand it. I can't tell you how much pressure is because of that as opposed to because of the Internet. We can go chapter and verse, and what that also does means they don't invest in the stores.", "So there needs to be a complete shift. I don't have any influence with how they think and how they operate, but we have conviction in our business. We're going to invest in our product and we're going to drive traffic to our malls. And that's everything that we do. So you're going to see that from our stand. We're not going to starve our malls. We're not going to starve our marketing. We're not going to starve our personnel. We're going to try to be as efficient. We're going to look for return on investment to be as high as possible. But at the end of the day, we believe in our product, we have conviction in it, and we're going to invest in. And that's not to say the internet doesn't play a very important role. And we've all talked about the omni-channel and the seamless and this, that and the other, but my friends, it's more profitable to get the consumer to shop in your store. That's what we'd like to see a little bit more of.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And when you talked to the leaders at other retailers and your tenants, I mean, do you find that there is broad conviction of what the end game looks like for them, that mix they want between online and store based or is that still being felt out and that's really kind of the root of this uncertainty, the never-ending narrative?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think it's a lot more uncertainty than it should be.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And I'm just curious because you mentioned...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "In a sense, we're at their mercy, but we've been at their mercy before, but we'll figure a way to deal with it. I mean, that's what we do.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Has the way you asses tenant risk changed at all? Because like you kind of referenced is that transition to maybe more of an e-commerce or omni-channel platform is putting a lot of stress on these guys. So you could have a great experience for the retailers in your properties, but chain-wide they could be having issues, because of debt or other issues. Have you guys changed how you assess tenant health for people you sort of select for your properties?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we haven't \u2013 I mean, we're very \u2013 we're probably as conservative about tenant improvement or tenant allowance, given the balance sheet and for long-term than anybody. But I don't think that's changed. I mean, we have a great credit department. They do an analysis and we listen to them. That's not to say we won't experiment here or there, throw some spaghetti against the wall. But, no, I don't think that \u2013 I don't think, Jeff, that's changed at all in terms of how we'll underwrite that.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And I'm curious just on the share repurchase. Off-hand, do you know how much capacity you have remaining under your authorization? And, I guess, how are you thinking about future repurchases?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "$1.4 billion \u2013 look, I think we'll continue to do that, given kind of where the world is. Obviously, until you do our earnings, we -- there are some restrictions on that, I won't bore you with that. Look, we believe in that, but on the other hand, I think you've just got to be thoughtful about how you do this. I do think \u2013 I've seen retailers run into problems, because they brought stock back, because that's what they thought Wall Street wanted. And, again they did it. They did it because \u2013 and they did it \u2013 they didn't invest in their stores, because of that in some cases.", "And again, I'm not trying to be overly critical. I'm just \u2013 we've got to \u2013 our industry has to invest in its product, just like Amazon. What a great company. But, are they making investments? You betcha, in more ways than I can even keep track of. If we don't have that same conviction, or any industry, -- look at the drug companies. They invest in R&D for this drug. It's not that complicated. We don't invest in the physical product. We got no shot, and so you got to be careful. You can't buy so much stock back, and we've seen a little bit on the retail side that at the end of the day take the capital away from investing in your product. And so, we'll do it kind of like \u2013 I think we -- what did I say, we had $1.4 billion left. So we'll continue to take advantage of market imperfections.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's great. Thanks, guys.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Yes, good morning, everyone. David, you guys have a track record of kind of consistently beating your initial guidance, and I was looking for signs in your commentary about if guidance could be conservative in any way. You did mention that you might possibly have conservative same store NOI guidance for 2017. And I was just kind of curious why the conservatism and where could the potential upside come from.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think I outlined it in my talk, which was basically, first of all, Tayo, as you know, our FFO per share is higher than anybody in our peer group that I know of. If there is somebody in the retail that's \u2013 real estate that's got a better per share FFO growth, I would like to know it, but I've looked at all, everybody's numbers and I don't think anybody is out there. But put that aside, we are a large \u2013 and we are, obviously, the largest company in that space. So that puts even more pressure on a per share number than if you are a smaller company.", "But put that aside, I mean it's basically translation. Why are we being conservative? Translation, the retail world is squishy. We have the potential on the stronger dollar based upon what all of the stuff that's going on out there. And we think we are projecting in our numbers the highest \u2013 higher. We have very \u2013 not a lot of floating rate debt, but we do have debt that matures and stuff that we refinance it, and then our floating rate debt is the lowest in the industry, again. Right, Andy?", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Right.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "So it's about 6%, less than that?", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Right, 5%.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "5%, see, I'm always more conservative. 6% \u2013 5%, so we're projecting a higher rate environment, we've got translation, strong dollar, we've got the impact on tourism, and a squishy retail world and that's our number. I mean, we've always beaten in the last \u2013 I don't even remember the last time we missed our numbers. I mean, does anybody here in this room know? It's a long time, it was \u2013 Rick was -", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "In 42 of the last 44 quarters (58:39).", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. All right. So it's been a long time. I mean, over 10 or 11 years, that's a pretty damn good streak. I think Rick was 35 back then. The number is the number.", "Unknown Speaker", "In diapers.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Got you. Then one more for me, if you could indulge me. Just in regards to the share repurchases, again, you guys have authorization for up to $2 billion. You've done about $600 million so far. Did a decent amount in fourth quarter, but doesn't seem like you have any share repurchases built into the 2017 guidance. Just kind of curious why not and kind of what decision process you go through to determine when it's best to kind of execute with the share repurchase program.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we want to take advantage of any market volatility and we're going to be conservative on it as well, and I explained to you, I think the most important thing for us to do is invest in our product. But the simple way to look at is we were planning this big Copley investment. It doesn't look like it's going to be, so I'm kind of thinking like, okay, let's reallocate that within reason towards share repurchase, because now we are not going to need the capital to build this tower, but at the same time, I've been more philosophical than I normally want to be on these. We're going to invest in our product. So it \u2013 we expect to do it over a period of time. It's hard to pinpoint exactly the number, so we think it's better just to tell you what the reality of our guidance is at this particular moment.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Got you. All right. Thank you very much.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, no worries. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, good morning/afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask a question. Sandeep on the GGP call earlier today talked about an increasing \u2013 tenants being more agnostic today about the type of retail that they're located in and more focused on just the overall quality. I am just curious if you guys share that sentiment and if so, how that is or may change the dynamic between your conversations with traditional mall guys that may be looking to go out of mall and vice versa, traditionally non-mall tenants that may be looking to get into the mall?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, certainly, I agree with that statement. But we've been a retail real estate company since we went public, as we've had a very diverse retail portfolio. We started with malls and community centers. We ended up participating in The Mills product. We ended up, obviously, participating in the outlet product. We spun-off the strip center business, the small mall business. So we think we have very deep relationships with all the retailers and we always have thought of our company as a retail real estate company, if you go back, from the get go. But I agree 100% with Sandeep's comments that \u2013 and that's why I do think the product, whether it's an outlet or a mall or a big power center, retailers are going to gravitate towards the best location with the most critical mass.", "And we do think that that \u2013 if, in fact, we do get some of these department stores back, we're probably going to have the ability, we're probably going to have some supply that will allow us to bring \u2013 create more critical mass with more diverse uses, and I think that will very much compete effectively with other products around the mall environment. We all know how retail has evolved. I mean, the mall location has always more or less been the central hub of retail in that community. So the fact that we're going to get potentially some of these department stores back, I do think that \u2013 and the critical mass is already a real advantage to the mall, that should bode well to increase the uses.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And I will tell you that we have already been in conversation with a number of retailers, whose predominant footprint is in power centers, and they are very anxious to come into our properties. The only constraint, as David has said, is being in a position to afford them enough square footage that meets their requirements with parking and visibility from the street, well, that's what all these department store boxes provide. And frankly, I alluded earlier to all of our conversations about redeploying these boxes. A lot of those conversations are being had with retailers that are now predominately in community and power centers.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We did an analysis, I won't name a name, but a well-known retailer, big retailer. I think we have 30 leases with them, and given where their rents are, we felt like we would only have to lease four boxes, four out of the thirty, to replicate the income stream. And I don't want to sit and name retailers and who knows whether we'll get those back.", "But, I mean, that's the opportunity. So you've got 30 leases, but they were done a gazillion years ago, and the quick and dirty analysis that we had is we had to lease four boxes to replicate that income stream. So the rest of the 26 or thereabouts, don't hold me exactly to these numbers, but it gives you the order of magnitude, that's exactly kind of the potential upside that we have, and now if in fact we get those leases back, we're going to have more product available, but we're also going to have, I think, great opportunities to increase our income stream.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks for that, and maybe just going back to A\u00e9ro. You sounded pretty positive on the ability of the management team to unleash some additional cash flow now. I was just curious if you could share some of the things that they're doing differently today than they were prior to the bankruptcy in terms of sourcing or merchandising or branding or even the price points that they are targeting.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I mean, they're doing all of that. I'd just say the simple thing is they're focused on \u2013 it's a different mindset. It's a more efficient company. It's a smaller company. It's more focused on gross margin, and it's got better relationships with its suppliers and they don't have to chase, unless you guys make us report what their comp sales are. But since it's a completely immaterial investment from us, don't expect me to provide it to you. We're focused on cash flow, which is liberating to that team, and frankly, liberating to us and the partners and I mean, it's great. It's interesting. We're learning a lot. We've still got ways to go. It's never easy to take a company out of bankruptcy, but we've got a shot at doing it.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And just last question on the FX headwinds that you mentioned that are embedded in guidance. Is there any quantification you can provide in terms of FFO per share impact or maybe just what you're assuming for yen and euro for the year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean, obviously, we have, but I would focus on $11.55 times 361 million shares, which gives you our total FFO close to \u2013 what?", "Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "$4.2 billion.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "$4.2 billion. Within that $4.2 billion of earnings, there is always going to be $100 million, thereabouts. I mean, we are a big company. I mean, I could give it to you, I have it here, but it would bore you. You don't need it.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Well, thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, don't worry about it, we'll do our best.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Carol Kemple with Hilliard, Lyons. Your line is open.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Good afternoon. It sounds like your investment in A\u00e9ropostale has been a very educational and rewarding experience for you all. How is your appetite for doing a similar investment in the future?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, given how the market reacted to the A\u00e9ro deal, it's probably not high on the list. But I don't know, look, I think we've got to prove to ourselves that what we're doing there we're going to be able to accomplish. So, I would never rule anything in or out. It's not high on the list, so.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Okay. It'd probably be several years down the road.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's just not high on the list.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Okay. And then in the quarter, your G&A expense was up a little bit from last year and from the third quarter.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Was there anything one-time?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes, there was. Our General Counsel retired, as you're aware, and so basically the pop is also associated with that retirement.", "Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. I know we're over an hour, so I'll just try to be quick with two here. The first was in terms of The Limited, there one of the retailers that we've heard are going to be closing stores and we counted about 75 in your portfolio back in December. So, I was wondering if you could comment on your plans and any progress so far in backfilling that space.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Obviously, that has been on the horizon for a while. We have been actively leasing their spaces there across our platforms and we've already got a significant number of those spaces, where we are processing leases and our proposals out to a lot of tenants. And we will deal with it just like we've dealt with all the others that have come down the pike and the ones that will come down the pike tomorrow. The best defense to all of these things is having great properties. And as David's been articulating, we're spending the money to have great properties. And when you have great properties, you have demand, and the downside is just the downtime while we replace them.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then in the prepared remarks earlier you guys touched on the gift card sales and traffic being generally up, and that being a good indicator. I'm just wondering since we get asked, is that how you judge traffic, by the gift card sales or is it by a number of things meshed together?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we have traffic counters in a handful of malls that supports that statement. We also have parking counters in all of our outlet business, which I think was up 1.5%. Right, guys? So it's a combination of what we have invested in the mall \u2013 in the mall thing with basically our camera technology and then the traffic parking counters in our outlet business.", "Unknown Speaker", "And just a quick follow-up on that, up 1.5% in the outlet, was that for the year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon. Just two quick questions here. First of all, on how you're classifying the same-store pool, I think it changed to comparable for the period compared to at the beginning of the period for past quarters. Is my understanding correct? And if so, is that so you can sort of better capture redevelopment, development projects that might be included in the same-store pool that come on during the course of the year, but might not have been there at the beginning of the year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No. It comes in the year that is after a year, so it comes in that quarter after a year, so it's not a change at all.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So no change in how you're reporting the same-store pool?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Correct. I mean, that pool changes, because if it's been open a year, it goes into that pool.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "No, no, no, I get that.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "But \u2013 yeah, no, no, no.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then just maybe more specifically Bangor Mall, I recognize that was a property with Macy's in it. I did notice it was classified under other properties, whereas previously it was malls. Any sort of thoughts as to if that's meaningful or how we should think about that?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Extremely immaterial. Our FFO contribution from Bangor Mall is $1 million out of $4.2 billion.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I recognize it's immaterial. I was just wondering, it moved to other properties, at least from a CMBS perspective, is that...?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's immaterial.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great, thanks. Just wondering, are there any updates on the Kl\u00e9pierre stake that we should be thinking about or how the McArthurGlen investments are progressing?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Generally, the business on both fronts is decent. Kl\u00e9pierre reports next week, so I can't add much more than that, and McArthurGlen has been a terrific investment for us. We open a big mall in Provence in April. And it's actually gone better than we anticipated and a great partnership.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay, that was it. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess, we've just passed the 12:00 hour. Quick question, David or Rick, you mentioned 434 department stores today, one vacancy. How many department stores in five years' time do you expect to have in your portfolio?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "You want a number? It would be just a guess. I mean, my guess, it will be \u2013 if I have to guess, I don't know, maybe \u2013 it really depends on the one big guy out there, so I can't \u2013 I don't want to guess. It will be less than that, but I don't want to put a number on it.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Is there potential where we could see maybe a halving of that or 40% reduction of that, in your view?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No. No, no, no way, no way, no way.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I don't see it. No, I don't see that.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "And then maybe a related question, your $278 million investment in Hudson's Bay, what are the plans for that and is that company mulling a potential IPO similar to Seritage?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean, it's always the possibility. I don't think it's been a huge focus at this point. The investment's going according to what we thought it would be. We're looking to grow that partnership with some redevelopment of that portfolio and potentially some other transactions. But at this point pretty stable.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Great. And then last maybe, but not least, you mentioned there is a weighing in your capital allocation between buying back your stock and investing in your real estate and always trying to maintain a healthy investment in your real estate. Do you have sort of a target of how you think about that per annum, in terms of reinvestment versus the obvious attraction of buying back your own stock right now?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look, I think the investments that we make at this point are extremely accretive, because the redevelopment, new development I think on average is 8-plus percent. So, that's had a multiple that is lower than buying our stock back. And, obviously, as you know, we've always \u2013 the most important thing we can do besides that is have a balance sheet that can withstand whatever craziness that maybe out there.", "So \u2013 and those are the two priorities. And then as well \u2013 and then frankly, we'll dabble in the other one when the markets \u2013 when we're out of favor and the market, for whatever reason, doesn't believe in our product, we'll try to add to that. But we still have a number of accretive investments. We're at 8% plus and we want \u2013 we, obviously, want a balance sheet that continues to \u2013 I would not look \u2013 I would not overlook the fact that our coverage is 5.0. I mean, I know people rather talk about leasing spreads, but that's something to mention.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Agreed. It's very few of your peers have that.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes. But we'll dabble, but it's not going to be a priority.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Floris. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. Just a follow-up in terms of capital allocation, could you comment on tenant allowances in new leases? What should we expect going forward? Is that you're at the point at which you have some leverage over their capital allocation in their space?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The TA has been very constant year-over-year and it's right in line. It's right around $40 a foot, and that's what it's been for the new leases.", "Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks. Just had a related question to that. You talked a lot about reinvesting in the malls. So, besides redevelopment towers, should we just longer term expect to maybe a change or increase in operational CapEx overall? And then maybe you could talk about how that differs for different quality mall spectrum.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I don't think, Simon. I think we've been pretty active. We still have \u2013 we're about to start on a major redo of Boca Town Center, this \u2013 once we get all the permits. We've done a lot of work. I mean, the good thing about what we've done is, once we kind of felt like the world \u2013 we had a big pike, we had 2008-2009 hit. We chased a couple of deals. We got a couple, but we didn't get everything, and in 2009, at the end in 2010, we've been very active on redevelopment. In fact, we've done a lot of good stuff. So we still have a lot to do, but we've done a vast majority. So I don't think there's going to be this significant change. But we have got to invest in the product. We will continue to do so. Certainly we still have a reasonably stable economy. And let's also put in perspective about everything, and the economy grew, the GDP was 1.6%. So if you take out 1% of inflation or thereabouts, I mean, that's pretty pathetic. So we're holding our own in a very, very non-real growth environment.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And just a quick one. There is some volatility or decreases in management fees and operating costs. Any comments around that?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, it's all related to WPG and losing those management contracts.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, hi. There was a Journal article not long ago discussing how Washington Prime has Amazon Lockers in 50 of its centers. Do you have any of these in your malls, and if so, has it shown to be an additional traffic driver or a source of conversion at the other stores?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We do not and better luck for them, to answer that.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our last question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy, and thanks for staying through lunch time. David, in your opening remarks and the list of things you said you were not going to talk about, but you talked about, you mentioned Main Street Fairness, and I'm curious where things stand with the administration on trying to get that through. And at the same time, how much time you're spending with your retailers on border adjustability and how that could impact them, and is this the year in terms of how all the stuff will unfold?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, listen, on Marketplace Fairness Act, I don't think it's an administration issue. It's really a Congress issue. The Senate's ready to go. What I gather, the administrations understand it. It's really being held up by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He's actually had \u2013 his district has actually come under \u2013 had some tough retail news that's come out of his district. Frankly, I don't understand it. I don't get why there has been no progress there, but I don't believe it to be an administration issue. It's really just one committee in Congress that's sitting on it, and it's a travesty. And we've all lobbied, but \u2013 I mean, it needs to change. It's just not fair. And if anything, the government should be about fairness and not picking winners and losers. At the end of the day if the consumer wants to shop online as opposed to bricks and mortar, that's life in the fast line, but they shouldn't choose that because they can save sales and use tax that they already own. And I mean it's a sad state of affairs that hasn't been done.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Well, I guess if we have a new President that's focused on jobs and if online is stealing sales away from bricks and mortar, that's affecting profitability of some of them, one would imagine that's a job issue.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, yeah and not only that, but what the courts \u2013 there is a number of states that are going to basically overturn the Supreme Court decision anyway, in our opinion. So it's just \u2013 they are taking it out of Congress' hands and it's just going to end up in litigation in every state, and it's silliness. It ought to be done, but \u2013 I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "You also mentioned gift card sales as a predictor. How much of the gift card sales are coming back and being spent in Simon Malls? And are you able to determine what that activity, where \u2013 what type of retailers is it going towards in terms of the people who are actually using the cards?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We actually can't keep track of it. But I think in \u2013 we think, just anecdotally, that there is a good percentage of that, very high percentage.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And then just lastly, we've seen a number of retail locations bring in the Amazon Lockers. And I'm curious more so on the logistics companies and I don't know if you listened to UPS' call this morning, but the fourth quarter they saw 10.5% increase in deliveries to residential homes, which was the largest increase that they've seen in 10 years, and that they are wrestling with how to deal with that volume of packages that are needed to go. I'm just curious if you've had conversations with the FedExs and the UPSs of the world to leverage the significant amount of parking field (1:26:55) that you have for that last mile delivery, if perhaps retailers are shipping from store, doing other things, where you create a little bit more of a vertical perspective.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean, look, we've invested in Deliv, which basically is \u2013 the mall group is basically invested in that. There is couple of other concepts out there that we're looking at clearly. We do think shipping from store, picking \u2013 delivery or pickup at the stores is all very important and the mall, we think, will play a big role in that. But, again, we think lot of the online activity, on the research that we've done, one of the highest things is price and saving the sales tax. And that equalizes and we do think a lot of retailers are promoting a lot more to get online business than they are in the physical world. I mean, all that can balance out pretty quickly. We'll have to see.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Right. I guess, is there a probability you put on Main Street Fairness this year or (1:28:14)?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Honestly, I don't understand it. It's the most frustrated thing we've had to deal with. You've got jobs at risk. You've got \u2013 it's not fair. You're going to have Congressmen in certain districts where retail facilities close, because of it potentially. You're going to have less sales revenue in those states, in those jurisdictions. It is one of the most confounding things I have ever seen. The courts are going to take it out of Congress' hand, and it makes no sense to me and I'm hopeful the administration knows that. But I don't think their \u2013 I don't think this is their issue. I mean, I think it's stuck in one particular area of Congress and it makes no sense to me.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Right. But one would hope the administration potentially can use blunt force and some other things (1:29:26).", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I can't comment on that other than, obviously, I'm encouraged by the focus generally on business being part of the equation to get this economy growing. That to me has been very encouraging to see. What can we all do to make this economy grow better and faster. And I \u2013 that to me has been encouraging.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yes. Okay. Thanks for the time, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. Okay. I think, operator, I think that's it, right?", "Operator", "That is all the questions. Yes, sir.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "All right. Thank you. Sorry to have kept everyone so late. But as you know, we want to answer any and all questions that you may have. We appreciate your support, your interest, your questions, and I'm sure we'll talk to you all soon.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Tom Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We had a very productive quarter and are pleased with our impressive financial results. We started, completed and opened several significant new development and redevelopment projects that will further enhance our portfolio. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted average interest cost. And most importantly, we continue to achieve impressive operating and financial results.", "Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.47 per share, which included a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our 5.65% notes. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, FFO per share was $2.83 and increased 7.6% year-over-year. We continue to report solid operating metrics and grow our cash flow.", "Our mall and premium outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.2%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to occupancy at the end of the first quarter. Tenant bankruptcies processed during the second quarter for retailers including, but not limited to, Rue 21, Payless, BCBG and BB impacted our occupancy by approximately 100 basis points.", "Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.10, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand. And for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.13 per square foot, which was an increase of 12.9%.", "Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was $618 compared to $607 in the prior-year period, an increase of 1.8%. And for those of you interested in how our international centers are performing, we reported retailer sales were up across the portfolio.", "Total portfolio NOI increased 5% or more than $70 million for the second quarter and more than $150 million year-to-date comp NOI increased 4.4% for the quarter. And as a reminder, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI.", "On an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retailer sales on an NOI-weighted basis was $770. Average base minimum rent was $68. Leasing spreads would have been 14.1%. These metrics demonstrate the health of our portfolio.", "The type of operating metrics and returns I mentioned are the result of disciplined investments and focus on our operations. At the end of the second quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing in 25 properties across all three of our platforms, with our share of net cost at approximately $1 billion. We completed the Galleria in Houston in the second quarter and opened up the former Saks space for a small shop, tenants and restaurants.", "Construction continues on several major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive projects, including La Plaza, The Shops at Riverside, Aventura, Allen Premium Outlets. We expect most of these to open within the next 12 months. On new development, we had another busy quarter, opening four new outlets, three international; Provence, France; Siheung, Seoul, South Korea; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; and, of course, we love the U.S., one in Northbrook, Virginia.", "Construction continues in our mixed-use development in Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which will open in the fall of this year. We also commenced construction on a new premium outlet center on the north side of Denver, scheduled to open in September of 2018.", "Kl\u00e9pierre, as you know, reported strong financial results last week. They are positioned well to continue to capitalize on the strength in the Europe, improving economic conditions and increasing consumer spending.", "Now, quickly on the balance sheet. Another active quarter. We completed a dual-tranche senior offering, a total of $1.35 billion with a weighted average coupon of just over 3% and weighted average term of 7.8 years. We completed the two early redemptions of our senior notes totaling $1.85 billion. And during the quarter, we closed six mortgage loans totaling $1.1 billion, of which our share is $573 million with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5% and a term of 8 years. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 billion shares of common stock for $244 million. Our current liquidity is more than $6.5 billion.", "We also increased our dividend for this quarter to $1.80 per share, a year-over-year increase of 9.1% and a 3% increase from the second quarter of 2017. We will pay at least $7.10 for the year of 2017, which is an increase of 9% compared to last year of $6.50 last year. So, we also raised our guidance to a range of $11.14 to $11.22 of FFO per share. This \u2013 the midpoint of this range is an increase of $0.04 from our prior-year guidance after giving effect to the charge relating to the debt extinguishment of $0.36.", "Finally, to conclude, while we don't like to promote, we would like to remind those investors who are interested, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and operating metrics. There is no company in our industry that has our breadth and quality real estate is as diversified by type of retail real estate and as active in the mixed-use development of real estate and has built and operated successfully in Europe and Asia, has consistently increased earnings cash flow and dividends, has the access to capital with an A-rated balance sheet or as innovative in terms of operations, including connecting with the consumer in deal making from retail to entertainment to venture capital or various corporate transactions like we have.", "We're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. Given the re-leasing you're doing in the face of this challenging retail market, are you starting to decrease your exposure to apparel?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes. Rick?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Let me just give you a couple of metrics. Literally, our apparel now is down to the low-40% as an allocation of our GLA. More importantly, when you look at our new deals over the years, (09:52) we're literally having almost 20% less in terms of allocated to the apparel and shoes and food services, allocated is going up substantially.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And the new tenants coming in, are they able to match or even perhaps beat the rents that the exiting apparel guys are paying?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Absolutely. As you see in our spreads and our average base rent increases, we're able to continue to drive our growth in rents.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Now, I would just add, Craig, the list of new tenants is as interesting as we've seen in quite some time. If you would like, Rick is absolutely prepared and, in fact, excited...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Enthusiastic.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "To give you the list. However, that's entirely up to you. But I...", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I would love to hear the list.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. I will tell you that it \u2013 from restaurants to new retail concepts, to e-commerce, to street, to malls, there's a lot going on. Now, Rick, without further ado, without further ado, please, please list off some of the ones that we're talking to and in fact doing some business with.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And these are all tenants that we have in fact executed leases with and are opening stores in both our mall portfolio and our premium outlet portfolio. In the mall, UNTUCKit, Eloquii, b8ta, Peloton, Juice Generation, thredUP, Tommy John, Indochino, Flying Tiger, Calzedonia, Muji, Deavaley (11:34) Rituals. And these are from international, and Shinola, Nespresso. We've got \u2013 and frankly, I could keep going for another 15.", "On the premium side, we literally have Dockers, Cody, Basler, Hackett, Havaianas, Hickey Freeman, Karl Lagerfeld, Schua, (11:55) Lafayette 148, Marmo...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I told you, once you get him started, it may never...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And frankly, I could go on for another 30 names. The important message is, these properties are vibrant, there is a lot of demand and we're able to execute leases that are growing our rents.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just one last thing for me. Just maybe some commentary on the Mills, the leasing spread of up 24.9% what's driving that?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We frankly have done a very good job of bringing over to the Mills both our full-price mall tenants and our premium outlet tenants. So, the Mills now encompasses value retailers, full-price retailers, off-price retailers and they're very vibrant environments.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. The sales there have done very well. We've added a lot of restaurants. It's just been a very good, solid business for us.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "David, I think your prior same-store NOI growth forecast was 3%. You've now trended well above that in the first half, so it would indicate a deceleration in the second half. Has that forecast changed at all, given the year-to-date performance above that level and in the context of the current retail environment? And to what extent did maybe expense controls contribute to that pace?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well. Christy, we don't \u2013 our industry gives out a lot of information, as you know, lot of operating metrics. We have always taken the position where we don't update our comp NOI. Obviously, if we didn't feel like we could hit the number that we give at the beginning of the year, we would tell you. But we don't update it every quarter. We have \u2013 we're not going to get into that issue, but we're always trying to outperform the guidance that we give to you and we'll see how it goes.", "We are \u2013 have a little more volatility maybe than some other folks because of our overage rent given our tourism properties, and that's trending in the right direction. We love the dollar weakening. But we got a year to operate, and we'll see where the number is. The most important thing is, if we felt like we weren't going to hit the number that we told you from the start, we would tell you.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just given all of the list of retailers, there appears to be a lot of still demand for space. How are you thinking about in this environment with more store closings, but in the context that there is still demand? How are you thinking about \u2013 in your conversations with retailers around store closings versus providing rent relief, how are you thinking about rent relief versus just letting those stores close?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look, I think if I could take a step back and just talk about the company in a sense, I mean, we \u2013 Rick and I are like, I mean, we're \u2013 I hate to say it, but we're like really experienced in tougher times, okay? We actually do our best work in tougher times. I think a lot of that is because we have the judgment of when to fish or cut bait, when to help a person restructure, when not. A lot of these are judgment calls. But as you know, I mean, we have always more or less outperformed when all boats aren't rising with the tide. So, that's what we do.", "I will tell you it's not a very fun environment. We're working extra hard. We're pounding the pavement more than ever. We got to go get deals. We got to figure out. We got to restructure some. We got to do all that. It all goes into a blender. We'll use the best judgment we can. And hopefully, we make the right decision. Some of which we do a lot of times. But sometimes, we make the wrong decisions.", "We operate historically. And we can go through chapter and verse, but we operate historically when things are a little bit rocky at the very best of our industry, and that's what we're all about. So, there's no set answer. Every situation is case by case. I'd rather it we weren't dealing with this environment but we are, so we just deal with it head on, do the best we can. But I think we'll be leading the charge within our own industry.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe a follow-up question on that and tying it into (17:06) results. I was just curious if you guys are using more short-term leases at this point in the cycle.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think that basically is a case by case basis. In this kind of environment, you do tend to do a little bit shorter-term deals because you are betting that the market or the environment will get better, but I wouldn't call it dramatically different. Less than 1% of what maybe our volume is in that category. But again, these are judgment calls. It makes all the sense in the world, frankly, in a lot of cases to do short-term deals, if you feel like the environment's going to get better.", "I know, in my own personal view, I could be wrong. But I do think that our environment is going to get better. But that's just my instinct. I would not necessarily bank on it but \u2013 so, in that case, I think doing short-term deals makes \u2013 it could make sense. But a lot of that is also \u2013 the thing about us is that we make the \u2013 unbelievably, given the size of portfolio, but we make decisions space by space, mall by mall, retailer by retailer. We put it. And so, every \u2013 we just don't \u2013 it's just not like, okay, you stamp it out. It's every deal is a little bit different, and that's where our judgment historically has at least allowed us to do okay in the tough environment.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then, maybe going back to an earlier comment that you made out liking the softening dollar as it relates to tourism. I was just curious if you could comment on what, if any, benefit that had on 2Q FFO results, as well as the updated outlook.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think it stabilized some of our tourism properties. But it hasn't had what I'd call \u2013 I haven't really seen it big time yet. But we had a real benefit. We've been \u2013 I mean, we've been, as you know, for the last two years we have, as remarkable as our growth has been and industry leading. We have had an Achilles heel of a strong dollar and a reduction in tourism spend. So, again, you have to put that in perspective. I know we're a little bit bigger company. I know we all want to get granular to the last detail. I assure you, we do run that way. We have a lot of moving parts, and we've been suffering from that. And if we get to the point of stabilization and, in fact, an increase in tourism spend, I think, that's really good for us. But I think it's too early to call that yet.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "I was just curious. Obviously, you guys had a very strong comp NOI number in the quarter. And I'm just curious. The occupancy decline that you incurred sequentially, was that mostly kind of an end-of-period sort of occupancy decline, or did that occupancy hit kind of happens throughout the quarter and that quarterly run rate is a bit more of a normalized number? Should we look for a little bit of a step-down in the Q3?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, a step-down in occupancy or comp NOI...", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "A step-down in the kind of run rate of NOI going from Q2 into Q3.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We don't \u2013 as I said to you earlier, we gave you our view of what our comp NOI will be at the beginning of the year. We do not update it quarterly. I don't think we should ever get in that business. I think, when you look at our business, you got to look a little bit long term not quarter-by-quarter. If for some reason we felt like we weren't going to hit what we told you at the beginning of the year, obviously, we would tell you that. We're not in that position. And the reality is that the occupancy dropped because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we flushed through various bankruptcies. We still have more to do and we \u2013 some of these things are negotiated as we speak.", "As an example, you've got Gymboree, which is in bankruptcy. We're negotiating now. Those things have deltas. The good news about our company is the size, the different avenues of growth, the different levels of real estate, the different product type, the international exposure, the way \u2013 the other step that we're going on and we'll be able to manage that, and we're \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. But we do not, Steve, do it by quarter. I'm sorry to inform you that. But as you know, that's been our \u2013 as far as I know, I don't think we'll update our guidance every quarter, but there's a lot that goes in that, but we don't update comp NOI guidance.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "That's fine, David. I wasn't looking for an updated number. I was just trying to get a sense as to where the occupancy fell and when the shortfall kind of came. It was end of quarter, beginning of quarter, but we'll...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean, I really don't know. But I'd say \u2013 and Steve Broadwater is here. He's telling me throughout the quarter.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay?", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. And I guess, maybe a question for you or Rick. When you just sort of look at kind of your watch list, and we've obviously had a lot of tenants that have either restructured leases or filed for bankruptcy, how would you sort of characterize kind of the length of the watch list in terms of stores today versus maybe six months and a year ago?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look, I mean, there are still others out there. But we're dealing with what I'd call the material, bigger accounts now as we speak. So, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. I don't know if you play golf. Do you play golf, Steve?", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "I do.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. So, remember, Ben Crenshaw at the Ryder Cup, when the U.S. was down and they had that feeling, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. But what we're dealing with some of these troubled guys. I would \u2013 it's very interesting. A publication just wrote about kind of the biggest problem in that area. As you know, I wrote about it in my shareholder letter in 2015 that I saw the handwriting on the wall from some of these leveraged retailers, can't have too much leverage in any business frankly, let alone the retail business. You're talking to a guy that has done workouts in the early 1990s. Rick is a workout guy, too. We're \u2013 I think we're getting through most of it, but there are still some out there that may or may not hitch.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. The only other point I would make and it's really lost in a lot of the dialog by the by Payless, Rue, Gymboree are all restructuring, all of those lenders are converting their debt to equity and they're going to emerge with very substantial retailers with much better balance sheet. You compare that in 2009 where the REIT creditors did not have the confidence in the sector, and they were taking a liquidation bid instead of restructuring and that seems to be missed in all of the other conversation out there.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. And I guess, just last question. As you guys think about kind of future redevelopment opportunities, has anything really changed in terms of kind of the taste or the ability to get some of the newer, larger redevelopments kind of underway at this point?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Not really. I mean, obviously, the big potential pipe that we're \u2013 will happen is the big department store recapture. We're being very methodical about it. We are being very focused on paying the right price for the real estate. We're also very focused on how we manage it internally in terms of resources. But that pipeline will be big. It will be material. It will be beneficial to our real estate, but we're going to be reasonably methodical about it.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey. Good morning out there. So, two questions. The first one is, in thinking about Ascena and other brands like that, how often are you guys surprised about which retailers either declare bankruptcy or which \u2013 or if a retailer just wants to close stores, which stores they actually close? Do you guys find that you generally have a pretty good read on it, or do the retailers sometimes surprise you?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I don't want to comment about any one particular retailer. But generally, if a retailer is in bankruptcy, obviously, that gives them flexibility to basically cancel the lease. We kind of know. I mean, it's not \u2013 it's \u2013 sometimes, we're surprised. Obviously, there's a lot of games of chicken played. They hire workout guys that are meaner and tougher than Rick. We have stare downs. But you more or less know, in bankruptcy, kind of what's going to shake out.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. And then, the second question is, in last quarter's earnings calls, your \u2013 one of the bigger peers said they want to explore options. Obviously, if nothing happens, how do we interpret that as anything other than sort of not good for retail outlook or mall value? So, if nothing happens, do we say like, hey, retail is actually going to get a lot tougher or malls aren't worth what we think they are? Or is there a way to think of it in a different way?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I'm not really going to answer that question, okay? So, that's \u2013 we're very focused on what we're doing. I'm not going to really get into that debate, Alex. I'm sorry. And we're \u2013 that question is better addressed not to us.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. I appreciate that, David. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "On your same-store NOI growth rate of 4.4% in 2Q, I think this was stronger than the market was expecting, which is encouraging, especially considering GDP growth was maybe 2%. But people often talk about differences by quality. And it seems, just looking at the results and what you guys quoted versus other retail peers, that portfolio mix including property type is becoming important.", "So, I was just wondering if you could discuss to what extent you see levels of strength vary by mall versus outlets versus mills or if it's by region or help us otherwise try to understand what could be differentiating the Simon portfolio.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I do think property type plays a role into that, for sure. I mean, there's no question about that. But I also think the depth and breadth of the organization plays a role in that as well. And I think we're an important vendor to a lot of retailers because we have good real estate where they make money and we do a lot of things to improve the portfolio. We're doing a lot of stuff on the marketing front to drive traffic. We're here to help our retailers with all sorts of programs. I'm always somewhat surprised on the ones that do participate and others that don't. We can help drive traffic to their store. But I think it's just part of \u2013 we've \u2013 I would say we've pretty much outperformed year-over-year.", "I'm looking at Steve and Tom. They can give you the numbers. But we pretty much always had really leading comp NOI growth, so it doesn't surprise me that we're leaving the pack again this year, including the strip center guys. We're \u2013 we've outperformed them as well. So, I don't know. I just \u2013 it's just something that we take pride in. There is no guarantee that we'll continue to do that. But it's \u2013 that's what we've done historically in terms of strip centers, malls, retail or whatever.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, along those lines, again, the 2Q result was pretty impressive. I was wondering though, if you look at your income statement, and I totally get that this is consolidated and it doesn't include JVs, revenues rose 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter and expenses were up 2.9%. And when you get outside of malls, other sectors regularly break out same-store NOI between revenue and expense. So, I was just wondering if you could give any color on how the two lines, revenues and expenses, would look for Simon.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I mean, the \u2013 I think part of the issue is that we've consolidated some assets with our European outlet business. So, you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the revenue growth. Now, on the other hand, expenses there, they don't operate probably at quite the margin we do. But there is no \u2013 we are such a size (32:12) that there's just nothing that you're going to point to that's that out of the ordinary. And we try to run very efficiently.", "I mean, we kind of knew, as you know, what we did on the corporate G&A front. We knew this was going to be a tough year. Rick and I and a few other executives are taking some reductions in comp. We just think it's a right thing to do in this environment. So \u2013 but the one thing that we will not do is run these properties so that they are not \u2013 we think of our real estate as hotels. And that's not to say we perform this. But if we \u2013 we have to have a good product, and the product has to feel good to the consumer, and we're not skipping on that side as well.", "But you had some movement...", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We had some movement in these numbers from what's consolidated and what's in the JV and some portfolio movement which my guess is more of the answer to your question than anything else.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, just last one. Would you say, on NOI, it's fair to think that margin is continuing to expand?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We're focused on it. We're not miracle workers.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about your views on usage of CapEx to close on deals and, more in particular, if there is any noticeable trend in the CapEx you're using for new rental value that's on a percentage basis, if there is any noticeable trends going forward?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "This is Rick. There is absolutely none. If you go back over the years, our TA per foot has been in a very tight range, and it remains in that range for this quarter.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, okay. It's hard to kind of account for the timing of when you spend the CapEx which is why I asked that question. And...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Did you \u2013 I think you broke up there. Could you restate what you just said? I'm sorry.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "I just said sometimes it's hard to triangulate and to account for the timing when you spend the CapEx versus when you're doing lease \u2013 doing new leases.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well \u2013 but again, CapEx is \u2013 yeah. We show you our tenant allowance number, okay? CapEx is basically associated with redevelopments in the portfolio or new developments. So just want you to understand it kind of \u2013 if it's a tenant allowance, that shows up as outlined in our 8-K, okay?", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And second question. In 2016, you guys capitalized internal leasing costs of about $49 million, still a very efficient number compared to the size of your company. But just going forward, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the new accounting rules that are coming out that might require you to expense most of that.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, we're going to follow GAAP. So, it is what it is.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So, do you actually have an estimate of that $49 million? Is most of that going to be expensed or a portion?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Not at this \u2013 when it comes into force in 2019. In 2019, we'll give you that number. But we don't at this point. But I'm sure our number will be comparable to anybody else's.", "Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Good morning. On the store openings that you talked about, Rick, at least, when you look at where some of the newer concepts are going, some of the e-commerce retailers and others, it seems a little concentrated in the kind of A-plus malls and outlet centers. And I'm wondering, as you have discussions with some of these chains as they're rolling out the first 20 or 30 stores, I mean, how do you think the pool of malls is ultimately going to be for these concepts, if they're successful? I mean, do you get conversations starting where they see themselves as potentially having 200 stores or 250 stores, or is it maybe going to be more limited than that?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, in fact, as we talk to them, it's not unusual for them, when they're opening their first store or their second store, they're going to want to do it in properties that they have the highest confidence in. But I will tell you that when you look at the e-tailers as a class, there are now over 280 stores in the United States from the pure play e-tailers that are opening stores and you go through in UNTUCKit, Warby, Bonobos, Blue Nile, Eloquii, Fabletics are all raising incremental rounds of capital that is dedicated to opening stores. So it's going to be a process, but I believe they have all recognized that having a well-positioned fleet of stores is certainly necessary and optimal for them to grow their business.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Do you think we'll see kind of this next wave \u2013 I mean, obviously, they're raising capital for this. But in your conversations with them, they're planning for sort of a deeper wave of growth within the mall space.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We've seen it. So, for example, Eloquii opened their first store. They're now opening three more with us. Blue Nile opened their first store with us. They're opening four more with us. It's going to take time, but it's absolutely happening.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think \u2013 look, I think, Paul, here's what I would say too, and Rick said it but let me just say it as well. The retailers always will tend to go, as Rick said, to the no-brainers early on. But then they realize the profitability they make and then they will grow. Depending on what kind of retailer they are, that could be 400 stores, 200 stores, 50 stores, 20 stores. The news that's important is that, in this cluttered world of trying to get people focused, we are seeing more and more brands that want to gravitate toward where traffic is, and traffic continues to be in a number of centers. And I do think, from the e-commerce folks, there is \u2013 not all, but there is a limit to attracting eyeballs online that they can't get in the physical world.", "Now, I mean, malls are getting a bad rap, but the reality is we see it in media, we see it in the entertainment world, we see it on the food side, we see it with the theaters, they \u2013 we see it with the fitness guys like at Life Time. They all want to congregate in the best location and where the traffic is and by and large in communities throughout the country, that's the mall. And that has not changed.", "So, I know the narrative might be a little bit different and I know, obviously, retail is under more pressure than it has been in the past, but I have my own theory on that, which I've explained to you in a few shareholder letters. But that's the good news here. Now, that doesn't mean that there's \u2013 you have to cycle some of the poor performers out with some of the better ones. And by the way, we've been doing this for quite some time.", "We all remember Woolworths or W.T. Grant or Steve Roth is on the phone doing his thing, Corvettes. I mean, you go down the list, Caldor. I mean, that's just the way it works. But between media, virtual reality folks, they want to be where the traffic is and where people want to hang out and that's by and large the kind of stuff that our industry has. Please don't lose sight of that.", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. My other question is just on the buyback, you continued to exercise it in the quarter. And when it came up last quarter, it seemed like you were suggesting that it is something that we should view as an ongoing kind of part of your business, at least on a leverage-neutral basis. Is there any update to that? Is it something that maybe people should think of as just, when they look at their models, something that should be incorporated on an ongoing basis?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I still think it's in our arsenal to give back capital to shareholders. Obviously, we're more focused on our dividend growth because that is testament to the cash flow that we generate from our properties. And as you know, I mean, we're going to have at least a 9.1% increase this year, which, my favorite guy, I've quoted Ben Crenshaw, now I'll move to Adam Sandler, that ain't too shabby. Okay?", "Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Right, all right. Great. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi. I was wondering, are the batch of newer tenants on the shop side that you've been leasing space to over the past couple years, are they taking the same-size stores as a lot of the legacy retailers that they've replaced?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Totally a function of the retailer. Some of them want a larger format like Muji. Some of them want smaller formats like Eloquii. And frankly, our job, and we've talked about this in other calls is to basically be able to manufacture space. And in our great properties, getting back space just enables us to drive our NOI by bringing in more tenants and raising revenue and raising productivity.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And I guess on the restructuring side, I think a few tenants were mentioned. I know you don't want to talk about specific tenants. But generally speaking, when you see a restructuring and these tenants come out and they're in a better financial position, are they typically doing something different on the operating side too to drive sales or it's just better overhead, better ability to pay rent. I mean, what have you generally seen over the past few years?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think the biggest issue is they don't have any debt. So, they can \u2013 I mean, without the debt, they can invest in their business. And it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You have too much debt, you obviously have to service that debt. So, how do you service that debt? You reduce your investment in the stores or your investment in technology, you reduce the inventory in the store, right, because you can't afford to have the inventory in the store and you reduce the service. You put it all together and it is self-fulfilling, without question. And unfortunately, we've seen that.", "And so, the most important thing is, when they are restructured, they have \u2013 they now have the cash flow to do those three things, hopefully invest in the store, hopefully invest in more inventory, hopefully invest in better service and, to some extent, technology.", "So, that's the model. And unfortunately, we've seen it go in different direction. But we're hopeful that, as Rick said, we're seeing some of these folks restructure. We're here to help them within reason to do that. But it's not our fault that they're in the spot they're in. And let's not lose sight of that. We are, on the other hand, been investing in our product, we've been investing in our services, we've been investing in our marketing. We have not run from our responsibility to make these physical asset better and to communicate with the consumer directly to get them excited about seeing what we have to offer in our \u2013 in the physical world.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. That was it. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to drill down into the numbers a little bit. It looks like you had a nice rebound in Aero this quarter, maybe $15.2 million versus the $5 million headwind last quarter. How should we think about that going forward? And, David, I know you mentioned some seasonality with Aero last quarter. Is that $15 million how we should be thinking about that going forward?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "You have to look at Aero \u2013 yeah. You can't really look at Aero quarterly. But you got \u2013 for us, we look at it annually. And obviously, the first quarter was a huge transition, a big loss which I don't think the market understood. That's why we might have been off a couple of cents or $0.02 or $0.03 in consensus. That's very normal for a retailer to have their losses early on and then start to make it back up. So, what we're seeing in Aero is exactly what we thought we would see, but we don't give quarterly guidance.", "I will tell you this, though. They had a \u2013 I mean \u2013 knock on wood, I mean, we're seeing very good progress at Aero and we're still comfortable with how we modeled Aero in our numbers. Our increase in guidance has nothing to do with Aero. So, we're still got in the totality of the Aero results the way we saw it at the beginning of the year. But they had a good second quarter and back-to-school is percolating. Lot of work to do there, but this is a brand that had $900 million of sales and it's got a core constituency and we think it's going to be okay.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then, maybe just one more question for me. It looks like cash NOI was up. Straight-line rents were down. Could you maybe walk us through the moving parts and how those two buckets work with each other and how we should be thinking about that going forward?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The straight-line reduction was a function of the \u2013 if we have any straight-line receivables on our books and somebody cancels a lease through bankruptcy, we have to write it off that quarter. And that's why you saw a pretty significant decrease...", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So, not like \u2013 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, no, no. It's \u2013 basically, the vast majority of that is essentially the write-offs of the bankruptcies that we may have had on our balance sheet.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. So, not like free rent burn-off that was being put into the same-store NOI pool or anything like that, primarily bankruptcies?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, sir. All primarily the bankruptcies. We got to write off that receivable right when the lease is rejected.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Or they go into bankruptcy.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. And then, one other quick question. It looks like interest expense went up. Is that because the buybacks went on the line of credit, or am I speaking about that correctly?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well. Yeah, I mean, it's debt in our cash flow. So, we're not necessarily borrowing...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Just to do our buyback, we have enough cash flow to do it out of our cash flow. So, I just...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I just \u2013 nothing major there other than we did \u2013 I think we did have a write-off on our old revolver that may have gone through the second quarter because you got some of that on the balance sheet.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We have the redemption every 30 days.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, the redemption, which we had an extra 30 days. And then, we also have the consolidation of the certain MG assets as well. So, nothing unusual there other than a couple of consolidations and the extra time on our \u2013 extra 30 days on our redemption.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's it for me, guys. Thank you for the additional color.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure, no problem.", "Operating: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, folks. David, just given your comments on the unhealthy relationship between debt and retailing, as a derivative I guess on that business, what do you feel is the right level of debt for a retail real estate owner? And has that changed in the past year or two?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, for a real estate owner, look, I think \u2013 look, I like the spot we're in, especially if there is more volatility in the capital markets. I think we all have to be careful with too much leverage in any industry or in any business. I live through it. Rick live through it, which is good for our shareholders to know that we've got a few spurs on our boots, right? Spurs on our boots, right? That's not on our results, right? It's on our boots. But I don't want to give you specific numbers. I think every company needs to come to their own metric. We're kind of disciplined. And then, the A rating, we want to maintain that. But I think every businesses \u2013 everybody should come to their conclusion. I would hate to give you a number that's right for the industry.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And how do you think about the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon? I know it's not one of your tenants. I guess, I'm wondering, do you think Amazon or maybe another group entirely could target a mall anchor? There is no shortage of them, considering that frankly the enterprise value of some of these publicly-traded mall anchors are really a fraction of the consideration that's been paid for Whole Foods, particularly when you look at it on a per square foot basis?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I have a lot of interesting thoughts on it, but I will provide none of them on the record. But I do think it's \u2013 the good news for us, as an industry, it does reinforce that, in my opinion, the importance of connecting with the consumer through a physical business. But beyond that, I really \u2013 I mean, we really don't \u2013 I really don't want to comment on that. I mean, I have a lot of opinions. But I just kind of share them with my board and some of the guys here. But I don't really want to get into that. It's not \u2013 they're just my opinions, and who knows if they're right or wrong.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Maybe just one last question for Rick. I guess, sort of, a two-part or \u2013 as far as it relates to leasing, can you talk about any themes, particularly geographic themes, to new leasing activity or volume of leasing activity of late? And on the renewal side, I'm just curious if you see any change in the rent growth or concessions compared to the past few quarters.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "On the renewal side, the answer is no. Again, if you look at what we reported, I think it shows pretty steady, consistent progress where we were last year in connection with our renewals for 2018. So, there is nothing there. In terms of geographic, not really. We have obviously a very strong and focused effort to get local tenants involved in our properties, and I think we're doing a good job with that. But there's no regional, geographic trend that would drive the leasing activity.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, and I think entrepreneurialism is back. Lots of people want to start up a business. We're seeing explosion in the food area. We've obviously seen explosion in the fitness and wellness area, cosmetic area. So, all of that, we've seen it in the mixed-use area. So, I think that's all good. The stuff does take time. You do have downtime. But in that sense, we're excited about having the ability to broaden our mix, which I think is very important for us to do.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Hi. Just back to an earlier comment. Why do you think the environment is going to get better? What do you see in the broader market or maybe within your portfolio that gives you the confidence?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I said I'm not ready to declare that, okay? But I'm starting to think about it, and we'll see.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And then, what's your view on dispositions right now. Would you be interested in selling any of your Non-A Malls?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we always think about selling some assets here and there, and we'll continue that. But we're not \u2013 we've never believed to sell assets just to sell assets, we got to get the right price. We go through a very detailed analysis to do that. And if we feel like we're \u2013 we'll get a fair price, we'll sell some, what I'll call, non-core assets. But we're not under pressure to do it, and we'll continue to cull the portfolio though. Okay? Thank you.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Question, could you talk a little bit about your views on the retail outlook, kind of, U.S. versus Europe versus Asia on how that could influence some capital allocation decisions over the next few years?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, listen, I \u2013 the great thing about real estate is it's so unique that we've operated in three major areas and we could get caught up in the macro viewpoint of a country or a \u2013 where capital is flowing. But at the end of the day, it's all about location and supply and demand. So, let's take Japan as an example. Japan, from an overall macroeconomic environment, you would think to yourself, boy, the retail is going to be terrible, okay? But yet, we've got great properties, we got a great product, we have a great partner and we've been kicking tail for each and every year in Japan.", "So, we look at it. We really \u2013 and obviously, you want to be careful about where you allocate capital if you don't have \u2013 if you have a concern generally about the country and property rights and stuff like that. But we've avoided those kind of countries. And I would say, right now, we feel good about our Asian business. We opened up in Kuala Lumpur with Genting. It's off to a great start. We just opened in Provence, France. It's off to a great start. Another one in Seoul.", "So, I think we can still make money selectively. It's important to know macro trends. But at the end of the day, it's all about the local business because I kind of learned that just watching the Japan scenario play out for us. But at the end of the day, we feel really good about kind of how we've allocated where we are. We can be opportunistic outside of the U.S. But our core focus will continue and always will be the U.S.", "Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC", "Sure. Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, a question for you on your JV with Seritage. Curious if you're thinking about perhaps making more investments on that front, buying out your partner in some of the existing boxes and maybe incrementally investing in more. Saw one of your peers recently do so. I'm curious what your thinking is here.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think what \u2013 that deal was good for both companies, good for Seritage, good for General Growth. And there is possibility win-win intersects between us and Seritage and Sears for the foreseeable future, and we will try to create that environment and I'm sure they will as well. But there's no guarantee. Anything could happen, but we're always looking to create win-wins for our partners, Seritage being one of them and Sears indirectly in that they're in a lot of our real estate. So, a deal like that made sense for both of those parties. It certainly is possible as we think about things, but it's got to be a win for us as well and, obviously, for the counterparty.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got you. Okay. And then, I want to go back and get some incremental thoughts on leasing spreads. Last year, I think it was third quarter, you and GGP, I believe, first noted the impact of leasing spreads. I believe it drove your spreads down almost 400 bps sequentially. So, I'm just curious here, now, that you've had a couple quarters of 13% spreads following the 10% in 4Q last year, should we be thinking of spreads in this low-double digit range near term? And then, also, just want to confirm that the impact of these amendments are included in same-store NOI but not in spreads.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No. If it's \u2013 we define it in our \u2013 if there's a lease that's longer than a year, it's in the \u2013 all amendments are in there, okay? And that's defined in our 8-K exactly how we do it. We don't make \u2013 we don't give guidance on rent spreads. We give guidance on \u2013 we don't give guidance on occupancy necessarily. We kind of give you a flavor for it. We don't give guidance on tenant sales. We give guidance on FFO. We give guidance on our comp NOI.", "And I'm not going to make predictions of rent spreads. I will tell you that they were down from a couple years ago primarily because of the general retail environment and, obviously, some of the tenant restructurings we've been dealing with, and we'll see how it shakes out.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, I have a question for you. You guys clearly are executing better than some of your peers. Does that make you think about your ability to add value to other portfolios? And maybe can you give some comments broadly on how you're thinking about possible M&A, especially if there are changes to boards, et cetera? Does that make you change your big game hunting theory?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, as I said to you, I'm out of the big deal business. And I really haven't changed that point of view. If somebody wants to call and talk to me, I'm certainly going to take that call. But I think, Floris, it's \u2013 I wouldn't overreact to one person's quarter here or there that we're outperforming. I will say, over a long period of time, we've tended to have really good comp NOI growth within our \u2013 if you want to call us a mall company, we've been at the top of that, and we certainly have outperformed the strip center guys over the same period of time.", "Some of that is a function of what I said at the end of those marks, but it's really not fair for me to like comment on other people's numbers. And I wouldn't react to other folks with one quarter here or one quarter there. Real estate is a long-term business. You got to invest in the product. I think we all make too much out of one quarter here or one quarter there. All these guys are good operators or they wouldn't be here today. And I think you just have to give the benefit of the doubt to people in our industry. It's easy \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I don't want to go there, but the fact is it's \u2013 no one should overreact to one quarter or another. I think everybody's doing the best they can do.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Okay. One other \u2013 thanks for that, David. One other question. As we look at the mall sector, clearly, everybody's trading at big discounts. In your opinion, where do you think is the greater mispricing? Is it in the B malls or is it in the A malls?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, look, I think our industry certainly compared to other industry is being mispriced and I'll leave it at that. I think you can be a successful B mall operator.", "I don't think you're going to zero. I will tell you that without question. I think a lot of these what people want to call B malls, if they're in the right town and that town is stable and they're a good operator and they're focused and less worried about trying to please Wall Street but more interested in pleasing the community, they can do fine. Their growth may not be as robust as the ones with what I'll call \"A\" properties, but they can do fine.", "They may never be able to satisfy Wall Street and the institutional investor wanting kind of real estate that you could put on an annual cover, but they can do fine. But it's got to be focused on the community first, what they can do for the community and then the rest can follow. But look, having well-located real estate gives you a lot of opportunities to change it up over time and to make it better, which is what a lot of us have been doing for decades, not 5 years, 10 years, not 20 years, not 30 years, but 50 years, 60 years, Talban (01:06:28) 50, 60 years; Simon, 50 years, 60 years; General Growth, 50 years, 60 years; CBL, 50 \u2013 40 years, I don't know. I mean, that's a testament to those guys and a testament to their product, and we shouldn't lose sight of that.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Great. Maybe one last question on HBS. Any sort of comment based on the sort of the latest news coming from there or strategic plans with your stake in that company?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "How \u2013 guess how I will answer that.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "No comments?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The answer is, I have no comment on that. Our joint venture continues to do exactly what we thought it was. HBC has been a great partner. I've got all the confidence in the world in that team. Richard Baker is a very creative guy, but it's \u2013 we're not a shareholder of HBC. So, it's just not \u2013 it's not \u2013 there's nothing I can comment on that activity.", "Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.", "Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Thanks for taking the follow-up. David, I wanted to take your comment about the sector being mispriced from a public stock perspective. I'm curious in your conversations with institutional investors either your \u2013 some of your current joint venture partners or prospective partners, how they are thinking about the business both from your non-core potential asset sales or stakes in some of your high-quality assets and how those conversations are going and trying to navigate that mismatch.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we don't like selling stakes in malls. Obviously, you do it if you need the financial flexibility. But we've always looked at bringing in partners, if there's a new opportunity and we want to manage our balance sheet. That's the way we've looked at it so \u2013 but, Michael, institutional investors aren't always right. I mean, so, sometimes, they buy it.", "I'll never forget. I had one of the biggest and best sovereign wealth funds. I begged them to help me buy General Growth when they were in bankruptcy, and that was an 8.5 (01:09:20) cap rate, and this was before all the histrionics on the recap and all that stuff. But just \u2013 let's go buy it together, and the guy wanted a 9.5. (01:09:30) And I mean, so, they're not always right. I don't really have a comment on it. We're really not that active looking for institutional investors.", "Now, if we had a new deal to do something, I think we'd find the capital, but we haven't been really out looking for it. I think, on the B mall, the mall activity is starting to percolate. There's probably more people thinking about it a little bit more and somebody, I believe, in rolling up the \u2013 what is perceived as the downtrodden, whether that is the reason it's debatable. But what is perceived as a downtrodden, it's going to make money. It may not be appropriate for a public company \u2013 for public companies. But somebody is going to buy a lot of this stuff with cash flows and make a few bucks.", "Rick and I may \u2013 maybe we're going to start a new company so...", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "If we think about \u2013 if I make an analogy Q2 back in 2009, and I guess to go back to that time, but you did pretty big solid for the industry, right? You issued debt and equity and allowed the REIT market, capital markets to reopen. Isn't there some sort of analogy of being able to sell some interest in high-quality assets at remarkable cap rates to sort of prove evidence in some ways about where the stocks are trading. And I don't know if whether you agree with that or not.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think that's the silliest idea in the world. Honestly, why would I want to sell an A asset to make a print for you to be comfortable with and then you say, oh, it's great. But then, oh, but that's only the top of the portfolio. Or you have to sell B assets now, and C assets and E assets and D assets, it's a short lived \u2013 we don't think about like that. We think about operating our business, how to make it better for the consumer, how to market better, how to lease it better, how to redevelop better, not financial engineering that will be short-lived and have no impact.", "Why would I want to give up growth rate \u2013 a growth rate of an A asset? So, you will say, well, that's great. But what about the rest of your portfolio? It just makes no sense to me. We don't need to now. I understand if you need to because you need the financial flexibility. But as evidenced our ability to raise $1.350 billion in three hours, thankfully, we're not in that spot. That's just not what we do.", "But like I said, if there was a deal that we felt was good, I think we could raise institutional capital if we wanted to. Maybe we don't. We don't need to. I just \u2013 I am \u2013 I just don't understand that logic. It is short-lived. I mean, others have done that and they got a one-day pop. And now, they've lost the growth. Now, look, they did it because maybe there is too much exposure of one mall and I get \u2013 and maybe they needed the capital for other things. So, there are reasons to do it. But to do it just to print so it makes the NAV investors happy, I don't know. Forget it. It ain't happening.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "That's why I asked the question to get your perspective on it.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I hope I gave it to you.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Your answer was very clear. Last one...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "You may disagree with it. But at least, it's clear, right?", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Well, okay. Your point is, if you needed the capital, you would do it otherwise, as there's no reason to put up a print on the screen, which I understand.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "The last one. Just the overall environment with a lot of the headlines, the news media, even your retailer, public retailer conference calls. And I would say some operators and I know you said don't look at one quarter, but not all of the mall brethren operate at the same level you do or able to strike the same type of deals that you can and being able to stay ahead of the trends. That's why you are you and they are they. But how do you not let that whole perspective negatively impact the environment and become the self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think we all have to be careful about that, right? So, I think the retail community has been overly negative on the mall product. I don't know why they do it, but we're just going to get up off the mat, keep doing what we do. So, I'm not \u2013 this isn't sugar coating. We're in a tough environment, but we've seen it before, yeah. Could this be different this time around? Yeah. But I don't necessarily \u2013 I don't buy that equation, okay? That's not how we're operating our business.", "Do you need to be \u2013 maybe a touch more conservative? Do you have to hoard a touch more capital? Do you have to be a little more flexible with retailers? Of course. But I \u2013 but we don't see the end of our business. I think Rick told me he went to the ICSC meeting, and it was kind of all the negativity and I heard it from like four people. What did you say exactly, Rick?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I basically said we had a board meeting and it was a close vote, so we decided to stay in business.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "So, I do think the narrative is a little more negative. I think a lot of that is facilitated by investors making the other side of our bet. It's interesting. It's like I have a lot of points of view on certain transactions out there. We have never really seen that before. It's very interesting to see how that side of the world operates, but where we're \u2013 we got to deal with it. So, look we after this meeting Rick and I are going to be spending six hours approving capital projects to make our properties better, and that's how we're thinking about the business.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Well, I appreciate you sticking on to take the questions.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. No worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to David Simon for closing remarks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.

Sir, you may begin.", "Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning. The last couple of months obviously have been challenging as the country has endured the devastating impacts of natural disasters and tragedies, which have impacted millions of people across the country including many of our Simon employees and their families. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected. There has been significant disruption from Texas to Florida, Puerto Rico and California. And due to the dedication and heroic efforts of our field team members, thankfully, all of our personnel got through these events.", "Across all of our platforms, we closed 45 of our centers for combined 412 days due to natural disasters including the one that occurred in May at Colorado Mills due to a hailstorm. All of our centers in Texas and Florida had been back to normal. Our centers in Northern California now back to normal, operations as well after the horrific wildfires there. And we expect Colorado Mills, which has been closed since May to open in time for the holidays.", "Our two centers in Puerto Rico are currently not open and we are in the process of making repairs where possible. We expect full restoration of these centers to take some time given the damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure and availability of building materials. We are fully insured for this event including business interruption insurance. We currently expect the closure of Puerto Rico centers to impact our FFO by approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and this reduction is currently included in our guidance. I couldn't be more proud of the Simon team who have demonstrated courage, resilience, perseverance and how they professionally responded to these unprecedented events.", "Now, let's talk about the third quarter. We had another very productive quarter and are very pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.89 per share, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. For the nine months ended, our comparable FFO per share growth was 6% which, without question, will be at the high end of our peer group. We continue to report solid operating metrics and cash flow growth.", "Our malls and outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.3%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the second quarter. Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.42, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and outlets. Re-leasing spreads of $7.21 per square foot, an increase of 11.2%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $622 compared to $604 in the prior-year period, which is an increase of 3%.", "Total portfolio increased 4.8% year-to-date or $212 million and 3.9% for the third quarter. Comp NOI has increased 3.6% year-to-date and 2.5% for the third quarter. I remind everybody, once again, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI disclosure. Also as a point of reference, our third quarter growth is typically less than the growth rate we achieved for the first half of the year if you are interested in that and have a desire to look historically.", "Now on an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows: reported retailer sales on NOI-weighted basis would be $776 per foot compared to $622 per foot; average base rent would be $68.54 compared to $52.42; leasing spreads would increase 17% compared to 11.2%. And these weighted metrics, again, reinforce the quality of our assets, and they're not to be ignored.", "At the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion were ongoing at 31 properties across all three of our platforms. During the quarter, we opened a significant expansion in Allen Premium Outlets in North Texas. We have a significant opportunity to continue to improve our portfolio through the densification of our centers with the addition of mixed-use components, hotels, multifamily, office, and others, and included in our supplement this quarter, you'll begin to see that list of activity.", "We have a number of projects under way. We'll continue to add different uses to our centers where we see the opportunity to generate accretive returns. Construction continues on several major redevelopments and expansions, including The Shops at Riverside, Aventura Mall, Toronto Premium Outlets, just to name a few, and we expect these, again, to open over the next 12 months. We recently opened The Shops at Clearfork, great new center. This open-air center is an excellent example of the type of vibrant mixed-use, community-centric environment we create, along with our partners. We have carefully curated a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment, office. And The Shops at Clearfork will be the dynamic hub of a timeless asset in the terrific city of Fort Worth, Texas.", "Construction continues on two new outlet centers, both in really good markets, Edmonton, Canada and north side of Denver, Colorado, which will open in the spring and fall of 2018, respectively. Our share of redevelopment activities continues to approximate $1 billion.", "Simple update on capital markets. During the first nine months of this year, we closed on 12 mortgage loans totaling $2 billion: our share of that is $1.4 billion; weighted average interest of 3.12%; term of 6.8 years. Our current liquidity is $6.5 billion. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. We have the highest investment-grade credit rating in the industry, more than five times interest coverage, and I again reinforce our financial flexibility is a real advantage that cannot be but continues to be overlooked.", "Today, we announced the dividend of $1.85 per share for the quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 12.1%. We will pay $7.15 per share in 2017, which is an increase of 10%, and look out for 2018, which will be higher. We are updating our guidance range to $11.17 to $11.22 of FFO per share. That is the highest in the REIT industry. This is an increase of $0.03 on the low end of the range compared to our prior guidance, even with the $0.03 reduction for the quarter I mentioned previously due to the closure of our two Puerto Rican assets.", "So, finally, as you can see from our results this morning, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and metrics. We continue to invest in our product and generate the kinds of returns that will continue to grow our earnings, cash flow and dividends. We're now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good morning out there.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "This is not that far out there. We're in the Midwest. It's not like we're way out there, okay?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Well, that would be...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "There is activity for all of those investors, west of the Hudson. I just wanted to point people, I want you to point that out. Alex, what can I answer for you?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Well, thank you for that. So two questions. First, just in Puerto Rico, can you just tell us sort of a breakout number of tenants who are paying, or said differently, the number of tenants who aren't paying? And then on the business interruption insurance, maybe for there or elsewhere, what the impact is and if we should expect anything into next year or if the $0.03 is really just in the fourth quarter this year and next year we shouldn't expect any impact?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I'll give it to you, really very high level. So, we've taken a deductible. We had a deductible expense that went through the P&L in the third quarter for Florida and Puerto Rico. After that deductible, we're fully insured.", "In the fourth quarter, there is nobody paying rent at this point. We don't collect business insurance until all of that is resolved. And they won't begin to pay rent until we restore the building. And I wish I could give you a sense of that, but it's really going to depend on the next couple of months because there is a lot going on down there and power needs to be restored permanently. And as I said, we're doing our repairs and restoration work concurrently, but it's going to take some time to get it going.", "So, that $0.03 is what we expect. That would have been essentially our net operating income for those two properties in the fourth quarter. It could drag into 2018. However, if it does, we would expect some of that eventually to be recouped through the BI, but we can't book the BI until it's actually cash collected. And so, when we do our earnings and 2018 guidance, we'll have a better idea of exactly the impact.", "Again, I'm more focused on the tragedy at Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, if you extrapolated the $0.03, that's less than 1% of our business. So, it's obviously immaterial. But we're more interested in what's going on there. If you take out our redemption here, you know that we earn well over $11.50. So if we're at $0.11 or so, that's basically less than 1%. Even you, Alex, can do that math, right?", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Yes, although I do have a colleague for backup if need be. Then the second question is, in the other income breakout, the lease settlement income jumped and then marketable securities gains. Could you could just provide a bit more color? And then on that lease settlement, was any of that from Teavana, or is that still outstanding?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "None of that is from Teavana and there's been a little bit more lease settlement income this year. Again, that's not in our comp NOI. As you know, we did own Seritage stock. We did sell that. And I would only point out for those of you that \u2013 I would hope most people would study our P&L without making statements, is that we also had more than offsetting what I'd call unusual expense on the expense line, all of that you can see in our 8-K, in our P&L.", "So I think like this is all washes. If anything, it's a little bit more negative, but that's up for you guys to determine. And we outperformed even with the deductibles, even with the extraordinary expenses that we incurred that were higher than what I'd call the higher than normal lease settlement income, and obviously the Seritage marketable securities gain. It's a gain by the way, not a loss. Let's keep that in mind too.", "Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. Thanks, David.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David or Rick, can you just talk about occupancy in terms of the trajectory as we move into the fourth quarter and into next year? And right now in the third quarter, you're sitting about 100 bps over last year, which was a record high. You got to 96.8 bps by the fourth quarter, you're at 96.3 bps in the third quarter. How should we think about the trajectory into the fourth quarter relative to that spread, and how does that line up as we move into next year from an occupancy perspective?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We should have improvement in the fourth quarter. That's number one. We're not going to give you a number. Number two is we give you guidance in 2018 in February, but the reality is the only reason why it's down is we've had some extra bankruptcies this year. We had a bunch in 2015. We had less in 2016. We had a bunch in 2017. The portfolio is in excellent shape. So, we'll continue to improve upon that. And we've done more leasing this year. I don't have the exact number. Rick might have the total number. But we've leased a lot of space this year, what, over...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "7 million square feet.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, it's more than that, but the point is \u2013 and we're dealing \u2013 the issue with bankruptcies is you're at the whim of the court. So you have a lease, they can cancel it at a moment's notice, and it does take time to lease. But we've leased over 10 million square feet this year. That's a lot of leasing and we'll continue and improve. And like I said, I think we'll have an uptick in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Right. I was wondering whether that year-over-year spread is going to continue to widen. So you've gone from 40 basis points, 70 basis points to 100 basis points relative to last year given some of the bankruptcies. How we should think about how the fourth quarter is shaping up, whether that 100 basis points stays flat or whether it narrows as people start to take the space?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We had a lot of bankruptcies go through the third quarter. You can't lease space in a month or two. It's certainly harder to lease space to open up for the fourth quarter once you get that space back in the third quarter because you have build-out and so on. But like I said, we have an uptick, and it's essentially all on the margin the way I look at it.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And then second question in terms of capital, and you talked about how strong the balance sheet is and how much liquidity. I noticed that you didn't buy back any shares in the third quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit about why that was the case and how that differed relative to what you did in the first half?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The simple answer to that is we've got \u2013 we're very close to some significant redevelopments that we're excited about, and we are very conservative. So we're creating a pile of financial power that we want to take advantage of, and we've got a little bit more redevelopment that you'll see in the next, I don't know, month or two. That's really exciting for the portfolio, and we figured we might as well hoard some cash.", "And actually, we also love raising the dividend. I love raising the dividend 10% a year. I really like that. So between the redevelopment, raising the dividend, having a balance sheet that cannot be compromised, with significant firepower, I know it's all ignored right now, but I don't ignore it, and I'm going to rely on my judgment that that's stuff that I shouldn't ignore.", "So I know no one wants to pay attention to it. I know nobody cares. But raising that dividend 8%, 10%, 12% a year, having a hoard of cash to put back in the portfolio of accretive returns is really exciting, and having a balance sheet tried, tested, ready to go to work is really a competitive advantage that I really like, and that's what we're going to do. So this dividend is going up, the earnings are going up, the balance sheet is going to get stronger. That's the model we got. That's what we're doing.", "Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, all right. Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I noticed on the development activity report that the Edmonton project is listed under Mills. I wondered if this indicates a different leasing approach that maybe is broader in value scope than just outlets?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It will be. It's always been designed as Mills. Our partner there actually owns The Mills in Toronto and in Vancouver. And this has always been organized as a Mills. It's enclosed. It's what I'd say bigger in size. So it's always been kind of \u2013 we consider it more Mills like with the boxes and the outlet and the entertainment uses.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "So our partner is the owner of Vaughan Mills and the one that they've just opened in Vancouver as well.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, that's encouraging.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then it seems like you may be taking a change in direction on the new redevelopments, maybe more densification, or is that something that I just need to wait the next couple of months for?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think we've got a terrific portfolio set to do. So, the answer is yes, Craig. I think you'll see more and more stuff from us along those lines. Obviously, we're not going to do it just to do it. The idea is to increase the value of the portfolio. But Rick and I went over plans yesterday at King of Prussia. King of Prussia is basically a $2 billion asset. We had a Penney that just didn't fit there with Neiman and the Nordstrom and the Lord & Taylor and the Bloomingdale's at all.", "You know the center very well. It's very big. We didn't need another department store. They've closed their store there. We could have done traditional, but the fact of the matter is the pivot of what's the front and what's the back of that center has evolved over time. And we have the ability for a hotel, apartments, office, and complementary retail with outdoor work and play space. That's going to be unbelievable for that community and, listen, we've got to do it. We got to get it done. We've got to open it. But I think that a lot of folks are missing those kind of opportunities and are kind of \u2013 you cannot, one thing you cannot do is replicate the real estate that we have and that's unique unbelievable opportunity. It's going to be a significant investment.", "It will be our Hudson Yards version for suburban, but wealthy King of Prussia. It's a great market. It's a growing market. That's what having good real estate is all about and it's underappreciated, but I get it. We've got do it. We've got to prove it. But if you've seen some of the mixed-use stuff that we've done over the past few years, you've seen that our core competency is increasing in this area. So again, we will devote capital to those kind of projects that are very exciting and we'll take that $2 billion asset to, I don't know, $3 billion, $3 billion plus, why not, right?", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sounds good.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Hi.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Just a couple of quick things, David. One, I think you mentioned that you did have a deductable hit in the third quarter, but I don't think you quantified it. Could you give us that number?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "$2 million.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's $1 million per occurrence. The flood in \u2013 Harvey and all the flooding did not reach the deductible expense. We had other expenses, but not up to that number.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks. And then I also noticed on that other income page and expense page, professional service fees were up quite significantly, and I also noticed that the regional and home costs were down. I just don't know if you can provide any commentary around the large jump from professional fees in the quarter?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, it's mostly associated with legal expenses. As you know, we had this situation with Woodbury. You know our point of view in terms of how we felt about that, but they were significant, significant expenses. That, to me, is a one-time expense. And then obviously we're going to be \u2013 we're running our business as efficiently. We have the highest margins in the business. We've got the best overhead percent of revenue in the business. We take pride in that, that we have the highest margins. We take pride that we have the lowest overhead, again something that's underappreciated, and we'll continue to do that.", "We did not have an LTIP for the senior dudes because we knew this year would be a little bit tough. It's actually coming out better than we thought. We're hitting every number. We've got best growth in the industry. We've got the best balance sheet. Our operating metrics are \u2013 sales were up. All of that is pretty good. But you know what? We thought it might be a little tough. And so we tightened the screws, and that's what I like about my team. They're willing to tighten with me, and we tightened.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay. That's good. And then I guess just lastly on that 10 million feet that you talked about leasing, I don't know if you or Rick could maybe provide a little detail, just broadly by category. Presumably, a lot of that was other things besides apparel. But can you just kind of help us give a breakdown of maybe how much was traditional apparel, how much was home, food, and just some of the broad categories to show the diversity of leasing?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "This is Rick. In our new leases that we have been signing, the percentage devoted to apparel is down about 20%. The percentage devoted to food and entertainment is up about 20%, and the number is over 11 million square feet this year over our three portfolios, which is malls, mills, and premium outlets.", "Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI", "Okay, thanks. That's it for me.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. Hey, guys. I just want to say being from the Midwest, I agree, it's actually not that far out there.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Right.", "Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I had a question for Rick. I was just wondering if you can give us some high-level color here on the sales and traffic trends of the premium outlets versus the malls. And then maybe, just as a follow-up, can you comment on your watch list and any changes there? Maybe digging in a little bit, are you worried that we could get another bankruptcy or adverse retailer event here late in the year, whether it's a Charlotte Russe or anyone else of the troubled retailers out there?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We're not going to comment on individual retailers. That's not our place. Our premium outlet traffic is up. The mall traffic is stable. We're not seeing the kinds of trends that have been publicly reported by all these algorithms and black box things that have been out there and talked about in the trades. It's very stable and frankly, again under-reported, 2017, yes, there was a lot of bankruptcies. But frankly, we're also having many of our tenants get reorganized; emerge with very, very good balance sheets, and in the last several months, you've had Gymboree, Payless, rue21, all come out with restructurings with very stable balance sheets and growth strategies.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah. On the occupancy that Mike Bilerman asked which I probably should have mentioned, I mean part of the dip in occupancy that we have is also we've added new product to the portfolio. So, they obviously, both in redevelopments, expansion space as well as new developments, they are never up to or 95% and I don't know what that number is...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "About 30 bps impact.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. So it's about a 30 basis point impact and I probably should have answered that when Michael asked in any event. So part of that is just the portfolio is expanding and you tend not to be initially at 100% occupancy when you open. But yet, once the space comes in, the space comes in our number and it is what it is.", "Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, I appreciate that. And I guess, David, I was just wondering if you could just kind of talk about your appetite here for disposition, specifically kind of the lower end of the portfolio. You've talked about NOI-weighted results. So obviously further highlights how much of the revenue and value is really driven by the top.", "So as I think about the 13 \u2013 I think you have about 13 assets in the other bucket and maybe just more broadly some assets where, for whatever reason, the market or maybe demographics are moving against it. Does it make sense to sell those sooner versus later, or just how are you thinking about pruning the bottom from here?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, I think it's a question of your assets that don't fit with our portfolio, we generally have been a seller or spinner-offer of assets. The market is not great. On the other hand, I think we'll have at least a sale potentially by yearend or early next year. But it's a very simple \u2013 there's no asset here that we lose sleep over or that we have consternation over. And it's a function of \u2013 if we get the right price, we'll sell. If we don't and the present value of those cash flow is greater than the price, I mean \u2013 to me cash flow is still \u2013 there is nothing to be embarrassed about.", "I know this world doesn't want to focus on cash flow, but there's nothing to be embarrassed about cash flow. And I can take that cash flow and invest in something that's higher growth and that's okay. I mean, that's kind of what I think people like me should think about. But we'll continue to prune the portfolio. We're in pretty good shape, if the value is right, but we're not going to do anything that's a fire sale because we really have no need to \u2013 we can operate effectively.", "The thing about us is we can operate effectively from luxury centers to terrific suburban malls, west of the Hudson, to outlet centers, to the Mills product, to Europe, to Asia, to mixed-use properties. I mean, we have the ability \u2013 I mean, the fact \u2013 if you had only seen how this company dealt with these devastations, our multiple would go up, okay?", "You don't see it, but I see it. We had crews of people. We chartered plane. We had crews of people go down to Puerto Rico. We had people in the field that put their own personal situation on the back burner to deal with our physical assets. Crazy, crazy stuff. So, we can operate. I mean, people forget that we lost a mall in Nashville because of a flood that was shut down for, I can't remember, a year-and-a-half, two years? And we built it back better than ever. We'll build Puerto Rico back better than ever. Those assets are important to that community. We will deliver, and that's what people lose sight of. They want to focus on a metric here and there. I don't know. Sometimes it's interesting, but I don't know what you're asking. I forgot. But the point is, thanks for your question. If I didn't answer it, ask it again. Something about asset sales.", "The point is we operate in any kind of environment. We do extraordinary stuff. We give back to the community. Simon Youth Foundation is important, check into it, look at what we've done for the Komen Foundation with Breast Cancer Research, look at the fact that our operating income, somebody reported sales that had operating income of $347 million. We had $1 billion, $35 million of operating income, 3 times, what somebody else had, and focus on that. Focus on those kind of things I think would be helpful in your analysis. You should tell us what you want us to focus on. On the other hand, it's a two-way street, my friend. Thanks for your question.", "Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think he called uncle. Next.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk about on the sales side, you guys did have a nice 3% increase this year year-over-year which is the strongest since 2013. So I was just wondering if you could comment where in the portfolio that was, if it was more the international tourists, high volume centers coming back or if it was across the board?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Simply put it's basically across the board. And you've got to remember, September, we've dealt with a lot of crap. So I mean I was really pleased with that number. It's across the board. And I think that there's definitely been a pause with all these natural disasters, but I mean unfortunately they hit us hard from Texas to Florida.", "Don't underestimate the Las Vegas impact. Thankfully we had nobody involved. But it's a tragedy that changes the psyche of the consumer for a period of time. I think I heard from Southwest Airlines that their flights down to Vegas are down. It will come back, but we had to deal with that. And unbelievably, I mean we've never had malls where we had to shut because of fires. The untold natural disasters, what's happened in Northern California, it's been unbelievable. We had our partner in a mall there whose own home burned down. I mean just tragic, tragic stuff. And then obviously, the Puerto Rico situation is at another level.", "So, even with all that said, our sales came in pleasantly surprised. I think the consumer mood is better. Look, we can talk online or not online, the reality is, I saw something interesting, how physical books outperformed. Electronic books, who knows, but maybe that's a trend. I think you'll see that as well. People get bored despite all of the rhetoric out there, you would expect me to say that. But generally sales and traffic are not bad, pretty good absent obviously these things going on and the tragedies of this unfortunate circumstances that we've had to deal with.", "And again, I wrote a letter to the company. I can't tell \u2013 and I don't know how many people listen from the company on the call, but I can't tell you how people have stepped up in this company dealing with these crazy, crazy events. Proud of the organization.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks for that response. And then I was wondering on recent outlet development projects. Denver is under construction. It opens about a year from now. I'm wondering how the pre-leasing is going there and how that trajectory kind of a year from opening looks at this point versus I know Norfolk opened earlier this year and others of the past.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Great. I think that's going to be great. Denver is a great city. The growth there is phenomenal. It's a great site right on I-25. We are ahead of the outlets, took a bunch of retailers there last month. I think, we've got a great design. I think, it will be a great addition to the community there.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And I would say to you that there is still considerable demand in the outlet sector. Those tenants are growing and are actively looking for new opportunities. So, Norfolk now is performing very well and has got everyone open. And it's a lovely physical plant right on the water. We incorporated outdoor dining there. I mean, the \u2013 I would hope you go visit our product, Clarksburg, because the level of design and customer amenities is substantially elevated along with the tenant mix in these properties.", "Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Oh, that's great to hear. Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Hi. David, I think you said your NOI-weighted spreads were 17% in the quarter. When I look at my notes from last quarter, you talked about 14% spreads. Is that an apples-to-apples methodology so they actually increased in the third quarter?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yes, sir.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And I guess on the development pipeline, about $1 billion right now. Where do you see that number trending over the next two years or three years?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think it's got the potential to go up, frankly, because, as you know, we're going to have some opportunities like the King of Prussias of the world that are going to be really dramatic and change the face of some of these great pieces of real estate. So I think you'll see more from us in this area, even this year, that would tend to suggest that that number could be higher.", "Look, we are very focused on the redevelopment part of our business, investing in our product. We're actually in very good shape there. We've done a lot, as you know, since 2010. And we're still very optimistic on \u2013 we'll announce at least one more expansion of a material asset this year yet, Rick, probably, right...", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "There should be.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "...with really good tenant demand. We'll announce another major mixed-use development at some point along the lines of King of Prussia that I talked about. So I think we've got good stuff working.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. And I guess maybe for a second going back to the first question in the spreads again, going from 14% to 17%, does anything jump out over the last three months in terms of what would have caused that increase?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, we have such a large portfolio that they would have to jump really high to change a number.", "Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it, okay. That was it, thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Yeah, no worries. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. I think I had a little headset technical issue there before. But, David, you talked a lot about the dividend and the importance of the dividend, and obviously you increased it this quarter and alluded to increases in 2018.", "I know a lot of this has to do with taxable income and REIT rules and things like that. But I was just curious. As the markets continue to not really pay attention to the discount between the private market values versus your own stock, would you consider increasing the dividend more than you otherwise would in 2018 to continue to give back some of that return to shareholders?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think the simple answer to that is yes. If you look at where we are versus what we paid, obviously to keep increasing that level off a bigger base, that's a pretty big number. And I think the simple answer is yes. We have the ability to continue to grow our cash flow.", "And like I mentioned, I just encourage people to look at our operating income for the third quarter. It was $1 billion \u2013 operating income essentially being FFO, net income plus depreciation, more or less. It's $1.035 billion. Nobody gets excited about that number, but guess who does?", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Guess who does?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I do. And you put it in comparison to other companies and some of their multiples, we are I think truly undervalued. But I'm not going to \u2013 Mr. Market is Mr. Market. We can only \u2013 I think a good way to demonstrate that is by raising our dividend on a consistent basis. We'll continue to do that.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then just maybe going back to your comments about the psyche of the consumer, obviously there's been a lot of unusual things going on in the country here and with the natural disasters and Las Vegas, as you mentioned. Overall traffic sounds like trends are stable. But I'm just curious if the traffic trends in Florida, Houston, and Vegas as well, sounds like maybe not Vegas, but Florida and Houston, have they returned to normal?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's interesting. What happens \u2013 unfortunately, we've seen this before. What happens it does \u2013 and I will say this to you. Prior to this like string of natural disasters, the business was actually \u2013 sales and traffic were up. They were good. And what happens generally is you lose the week before because there's the preparation and then you lose two, three, four weeks after because obviously people are not yet back to normal. Houston, having just visited Houston, we didn't really have that much property damage, but there was unbelievable amount of damage to that city. Now, give it to Houstonians and Texans, they come back fast and hard. Florida probably is wild because it was East Coast, West Coast, East Coast, West Coast. That hurricane couldn't make up its mind where it was going to hit. But the reality, it does slow traffic and sales. Florida is back a little bit more normal. I think Houston took a little bit longer to get back to normal given the amount of devastation there. Vegas, we were having a great September in Las Vegas, great. I think that's going to take some time. What happened there is horrific. But we'll see. It's so hard to predict, but these things, they don't just snap back day one. It does take time for people to get in their normal pattern. And I don't blame them, frankly. They've got other things to worry about.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, I agree. Okay, thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. David or Rick, going back to your watch list and some questions about that, I was hoping that your early read on whether 2018 will be a better or worse year for store closures and bankruptcies based on what you've seen with tenants dropping off the watch list and reselling this year.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, I know we all want to talk about 2018. As you know, we don't talk about 2018 till our year is done. You're more than welcome if you would like next week, you can come to Indianapolis, spend. We go through space by space 200 properties, so it's mind-numbing. But we're doing our business plan for next year. If you want to burn a day or two or three or four or a weekend, come on in. We'll show you how we run the business. But we'll tell you about 2018 when we tell you about 2018.", "All I can tell you is that we've got a great real estate operating model that has historically worked over many years and many cycles. We've weathered lots of storms one way or another. We'd certainly love a better natural retail environment. It's not quite there, it was headed there. We'd like a more stable retailer environment. We're diversifying away from the have-nots to the haves. That takes time, but you can't duplicate our real estate. You can't duplicate our balance sheet. You can't duplicate the fact that this company can operate across this country as well as in many parts of the world. And we put it all together. We put it in a blender. We pull the right triggers, and lo and behold, we grow our earnings, and that's what we're all about.", "I don't expect 2018 to be any different than the history, but I've got the next two, three weeks of planning for the execution of 2018. But like I said, we planned for 2017. We're doing a good job in 2017. We're overcoming a lot. Whether it's retailer bankruptcies, natural disasters, changing market conditions, we did the same thing in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, even in 2009. It is what it is.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I appreciate that. And then just going back to that second question, going back to re-leasing spreads, which I know is one of your favorite topics, you talked about the NOI spreads getting better, value weighted spreads getting better this quarter, yet the ones on page 23 of the supplemental, that spread got a bit worse this quarter versus last year.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I think that's a simple \u2013 the simple thing is that we had more. We put everything in there, so we had more box deals, so that tends to damper down the spread for the entire portfolio as opposed to the ones that don't have as much box activity in the NOI weighted. It's as simple as that. It's not always like that, but...", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And you \u2013 but just \u2013 yeah. No. Yeah. Just to be clear here though. If we're thinking about the impact to your cash, same-store NOI, are the numbers, the spreads that are on page 23 more important or the ones that you're citing on the NOI weighted spreads?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Look, the reality is there's so much that goes into NOI spreads is just one element of it. So, I think, you put it all in the blender, and \u2013 look, we've been operating with our NOI with the strong dollar with our overage rent down significantly, yet we've produced pretty damn good NOI \u2013 comp NOI number growth.", "So there's so much that goes into it that it's hard. I would tend to look at \u2013 if I had to look at it, it's probably more important to look across the board, but they're both metrics for you to Q1. I don't \u2013 honestly, I've never run my business for metrics other than one, and guess what that is?", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "It's dividend growth.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, no, no, no. Cash flow growth, okay. Okay.", "Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That's the only metric I worried about, okay. So it is what it is. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. On Puerto Rico, sorry if I missed this, what's the basis point impact of Puerto Rico on SS NOI in the fourth quarter?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, it's $0.03 FFO all-in because we don't anticipate any BI and/or those centers right now to be opened by the end of the fourth quarter. But they might be, but we don't anticipate it.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So you wouldn't quantify it from a basis point impact on SS NOI?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, it's less than one \u2013 it's out of NOI. It's completely out. There is no NOI that we're going to be booking in the fourth quarter. Is that your question?", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Well, okay. I guess maybe from an NOI impact, what would it have been? Or how much is the take away?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Less than 1% essentially.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then in your lease negotiations with some of the retailers that have been challenged, if you look at you've handled them this year, I realized that's retailer by retailer and location by location. But are there any takeaways you can share from this process on how you might approach the leases that are coming up for renewal next year?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It really \u2013 I think, you answered it best. It really is space by space, retailer by retailer. I mean, I think, we really don't \u2013 we do across the board account, client-oriented leasing as you might imagine, but it is space-by-space, lease-by-lease.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And I would also tell you that, we're already working very significantly on next year's activity and we can evaluate now where we think market rents are going to be for the spaces coming up and we're doing everything that we can to have alternative users. So we'll have incremental bargaining power in that renewal process. If we don't get a rent we like, that tenant is going to be gone and we're going to bring in a new more productive tenant that's going to pay us more rent.", "Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, a couple. First, I guess David, the percentage of NOI from U.S. malls has continue to drift down over the last couple years, the spin of WPG a few years back certainly accelerated a piece of that. But now you're at below 50% for the first time in your corporate history, so I'm curious what you think the right balance of U.S. mall exposure is going forward in light of the new retail paradigm. And then also as part of that, curious if you're seeing any interesting acquisition opportunities out there. Anything that might be \u2013 that might fit your quality spectrum and are you sensing any change in the psyche of any of the owners of those quality assets?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, on the last question, not really. We're really not looking externally to \u2013 if we get approached, we'll certainly consider something but we're actually not looking that much externally.", "As you know, the big focus has been on the redevelopment, new development and that continues to take up most of our time.", "Look, I don't \u2013 we're not running away from \u2013 I just simply \u2013 the math is the math. The opportunities are the opportunities. The fact that we \u2013 we have always considered ourselves as a retail real estate company. I think, as things have changed, we now consider ourselves as a \u2013 we're going to have more mixed use opportunities. So that's going to change the mix a little bit on the margin, but we're not running away from the mall business, or running away from the U.S. business because literally, we look at opportunities, so granular. Like the previous question about how you look at leasing, it's space by space, mall by mall. I mean that's how we look at the opportunity set that we have here. And because of that, we may \u2013 the U.S. may go down \u2013 U.S. malls may go down, but it's really because we saw opportunities elsewhere not because we're running from the mall business.", "We went in the outlet business in 1998, and I made a \u2013 we built \u2013 it's a funny story if you got a minute. We built a mall for $4 million of equity in Orlando. It shows you how just stupid I am. But at the same time, we spent this money on the Internet and we lost \u2013 remember \u2013 by the way, we were ahead of our time. Some of this stuff today probably will be worth $100 billion, but okay.", "But we made some mistakes. I think, we had a $30 million write-off back in \u2013 around that period of time. And I \u2013 we built that outlet mall in Orlando. I had $4 million of equity.", "I look \u2013 I think of my \u2013 what's our return on equity. David Bloom at Chelsea at that time came to me and said he wanted to own 100% of Orlando, and I go, well, not really. But he said, no, I'll give you $40 million for it. And so that was a 10x in about a year, which even the smartest private equity or venture capital guys like 10x in a year. I said, okay. Little did I know, in 2004, I'd buy it back at a number even greater than that.", "But the point is we like to go where the opportunities are. We bought Klepierre in 2010 when the euro was going to be disbanded. We bought it at under NAV. So that \u2013 it's more \u2013 that's more our philosophy than, boy, I want to reduce the percentage of our mall business in the U.S. to get to this number, if that helps at all, and answers your question.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Certainly does. Certainly. I appreciate the perspective. And also I guess, speaking of opportunities, I'm curious on your thoughts on JCPenney this morning. Not asking for you to comment on them specifically as a retailer. I know you don't do that.", "But was more curious about how you might be thinking about potentially buying back some of those boxes, maybe re-tenanting opportunities. And are there any natural expirations or store closures on the horizon that you might be concerned about?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we really \u2013 I haven't really studied the Penney numbers, obviously. I know they weren't that good. We have confidence in JCPenney. I mean, obviously they had a \u2013 they're still recovering from the activity that occurred when they had a different shareholder base. And I have \u2013 I think that Marvin Ellison has done a very good job. We think they serve a real need to the consumer. I do think there's still unfortunately dealing with some of the traumatic events of their different shareholder base. That's taking time, but it's cash flow generating company. We'll study the number, see what they all mean, but I think they definitely have a loyal consumer base and have a business that generates operating cash flow and I don't expect anything too radical there.", "But I think over time, we are going to want to get some space back from the department stores and we may get some space back but it's all going to be on the margin. They don't pay any rent even at places where they pay rent. So, the opportunity to re-tenant those buildings on an accretive basis is pretty, pretty significant for us. And to the extent that they're not investing in their store and we are investing in the mall, there is a disconnect to the consumer that we hope to \u2013 potentially, we can modify that disconnect by having a better or different use. We're poised. We're focused on it. We spend a tremendous amount of time assessing what we want back, what we might give back and I think the opportunities are a lot more significant in what we want back than what we might get back.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "And just with respect to your question on their leases in 2015 and 2016, they had 14 options, all were exercised. In 2016 and 2017, they had seven; all were exercised. In 2018, they have 6, 4 have already been exercised and we expect the other 2 to be exercised. So we've not been experiencing any closures through lease actions with Penney.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And one last more, if I can squeeze one in, I'm not sure if I missed it or if you didn't specifically mentioned what drove the year-over-year decline in that home and regional office costs? Is it just that you're right-sizing the organization given the smaller asset base and does that flow through same-store NOI? Thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No. Primarily, the reduction in our incentive comp and LTIP primarily.", "Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. And then, is it \u2013 thank you.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I mean, we're really not reducing, I mean \u2013 we're really not reducing any kind of overhead on that kind of base. So we're just \u2013 you get us for a cheaper price. Some may think that's good; some may think that's bad. But it is what it is. As I've said...", "Richard S.

Your line is open.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys, and given that my family is from Kentucky, I can assure you in the end it's not that far out there.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "All right.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. I want to talk a little bit about your same-store NOI. I'll preface this. I know you focus on cash flow and you look \u2013 we do as well. But how much do you think that same-store NOI might be being helped or might be helped by the development pipeline? The development pipeline obviously looks like it's a really big growth engine for you now and you started putting dollars in there...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's not in the comp NOI number, so until it's open for a year.", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. And, David, what I was trying to think about was last year, you put up 2.2% in 3Q 2016 prior to...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Let me just reinforce this \u2013 and I've made this statement, Rich, historically, we do not look at our comp NOI on a quarterly basis. We do not look at that. Never have, never will. We look at it over a year. We told the market that we hope to do 3%. I think that's without lease settlement income, without new development, kind of a pure number, and we're on our way to do at least that. And for that, given all the complexity in the world today, that's pretty good. That's what I focus on.", "I do not focus on third quarter number. I don't focus on the second quarter number. We give you the facts. We tell you and we look at it on holistic year basis because when overage rent comes in and out, it's variable, it's when they hit it, they could hit it in the third quarter, they could hit it in the fourth quarter. Third quarter tends to be the lower end of our comp, if you're Interested in that, I don't really look at that. I don't know what else I can tell you other than how I think about it, and that's how I think about it, okay?", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. So let me ask the question maybe a little bit different way. 3% same-store NOI guide for the year. I think at midpoint, how much do you think your development pipeline is influencing that versus your core portfolio, or is that just not something that...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I answered that. That's not in the number. Okay?", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you. It's all in the 8-K. You can see the components of comp NOI, and you can see the other new development which is not in the comp NOI. We've made that clear for a long period of time. Okay?", "Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks, David.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I'm curious. You guys produce obviously a lot of cash. You've been talking about that today. But you didn't repurchase shares in this quarter. Can you speak more broadly about how you're thinking about capital allocation in the next 12 to 24 months, and do you think you'll be using a greater share of your capital for redevelopment and expansions and where do repurchases factor into that?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "You probably were bored, which I don't blame you, right? We answered that question earlier, which is basically we've been \u2013 because of some of these mixed-use opportunities like King of Prussia that I've mentioned before, we think our redevelopment pipeline is going to potentially increase. So we're being very judicious on that.", "In addition, the more I think about it, I just love raising this dividend 10% per year because the cost to carry on that is increasing. And I think that's more meaningful to long-term investors than episodic buybacks here and there. But it's in our arsenal. It's in our capital toolbox. We'll take it a step at a time. But we've got some really big mixed use opportunities and I just love having a powerful balance sheet. I just can't tell you how it excites me every morning.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess I should have asked it differently. I guess the question is it's not off the table then.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "It's never off the table, no. We have authorization and it's ready to go to work if in fact we're ready to go. And I would take that authorization seriously. Otherwise, we wouldn't have it.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And maybe this is a joint one for you and Rick. But I'm curious how are lease terms evolving in this environment and specifically around percentage of rents because frankly, I'm wondering if you think landlords get a fair shake on the accounting for retail sales because it strikes me that given the way consumers shop today, buying online, maybe returning in store, the reporting optics maybe favor the online channel of a retailer versus the bricks-and-mortar, and I'm just curious if you think leases need to adapt for that.", "Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Our leases are very well positioned to cover that point, and we are very focused on making sure that all the sales that are required to be reported under our leases are being reported.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Jeff, I will tell you this. And I think you point out a really important point is that we are absolutely unequivocally underreporting sales. We can only give you what we get from the retailers. But we've done enough work to know that there is an issue there and I think our sales that we report to you would be higher even \u2013 and we have very interesting leases that deal with the point that Rick is making. But I am absolutely convinced that our productivity is much higher than what's being reported, even though the lease requires them to do so. So I don't want to get into that, it's a complicated matter, but what you point out is very, very interesting.", "Now the market rewards \u2013 let's face it, the market rewards an online sale more importantly than it does a brick-and-mortar, so the market is trying to get retailers. The retailers would rather prefer an online sale to a bricks-and-mortar regardless of the possibility. But it's a very interesting point. And I will tell you today, in my humble opinion, there is absolutely an underreporting going on. But I don't want to say anything other than that. Okay?", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Understood. Do you think they have the systems? Most retailers have the systems to be able to handle whatever the new form of reporting would be? Like you said, they don't really have an incentive to adapt. But again, I'm just curious of these new leases you talk about, if you think they could be more broad-based in the future?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Generally, they know what they should be reporting, I would say so. And again, I want to leave it at that. Let's leave it at that. It's a good point. But I will tell, I do think it's safe to say that the numbers we have are underreported, absolutely underreported. It's a very astute point. And by the way, we're not giving that up on future leases. So because it's all melding, but you bring up a very interesting point, and I prefer not to talk about it after this.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. I have just one last question. I'm just curious. I'm sure in this environment you've been contacted by private capital sources maybe to look at JV-ing properties and whatnot. What sort of returns do you think they are looking for when they approach you guys? Are you able to speak to that?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "I'm not sure. To do something new or to buy? I'm not sure I...", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "To buy interest in your existing properties.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "We've had this discussion. I'm not really \u2013 I don't \u2013 that doesn't do much for us. So it's not something we really are pursuing.", "Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thanks. And sorry to you longer today, but just a couple follow-up questions. On the department stores, just given overhang on the stocks, on the mall stocks, are you seeing any initiatives that you're more positive on, or anything you could share from what you're hearing from your mall managers on some of the things we're reading about or seeing, because I would have thought, given your dominant properties, a lot of these initiatives would be occurring in your properties at those department stores.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "That's a big question. Look, I don't want to really get in too much about having a discussion with our clients. Look, I think ambiance, service, speed of execution is really important in today's consumer-oriented focus. I do think there are things that can be done at the store level that will improve that. I think as simple as a fast checkout at a store would improve sales and productivity dramatically.", "And there has been a huge focus on technology investment towards their online activities. I'd love for that to shift towards the store environment, because that's a real advantage. And I think if they did that in a more comprehensive way, whether through checkouts, service, styling. There are so many things you can do today, much like Apple does when you go to their store and town squares. If the focus were to shift a little bit there, I think they would see a pickup in their in-store sales environment. And it's all over the board, Jeff, frankly. I do think it could improve.", "And just like what we need to do, we need to improve our in-store experience on the stuff that we can -the in-mall experience on the stuff that we can control. So I think it needs to be a greater focus. It's around the edges. I'd like a little shift in that, but we'll see if that happens.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then another follow-up. Just listening to the comments on mixed-use earlier in the week, we received a lot of questions on the WeWork and L&T purchase, upper levels and...", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Right.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Rick and I were thinking okay, that's just a unique situation. Maybe there are a few other properties like that in the country. But I'm listening to your mixed-use comments. Do you think that a WeWork type of format, do you see that entering suburban malls or your malls, or that's not what you're talking about?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No, that's included in what we're talking about. Just so you know, we did a WeWork steal in Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. So no, I do think that environment will absolutely accelerate in the \u2013 again, I don't know that I would call these suburban. It's where the good demographic people live outside an urban area. There are still 330 million people, okay.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Urban and suburban.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Okay. I know New York City and San Francisco is urban environment, but there are lots of places outside of those where people live and work and play and be entertained. So the answer is yes, I expect us to do more and more with WeWork both directly like we did at Clearfork and through our relationship with Lord & Taylor. We know those guys. We like them. I've spent time with them. They're very creative. Both companies are very creative. L&T or HBC in that case as well as WeWork, good people too. I like them.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then my last question, I was just curious with the Amazon-Whole Foods merger. Are you more or less interested in adding grocers to your malls?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "No real chain. Chain, I think we've always liked it where it made sense for both parties, and the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods doesn't change our thinking. I don't know if it's changed their thinking, Whole Foods' thinking, but it certainly hasn't changed our thinking. We'd love to have them in the properties where it makes sense for them and for us.", "Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks so much.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just regarding The Edit @ Roosevelt Field, how are you connecting with and choosing these digitally borne concepts to participate in this effort? How are you leveraging your venture capital business in this? And is there a plan to roll this out further to more of your centers as you think about this as an incubator for new retailers?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "The answer is absolutely. Assuming this has legs, this will be rolled out throughout our network, and you have to look at our platform as a network and this will absolutely roll out. The great news is we've got a team dedicated to up-and-coming new retailers that may start digitally and then go online. Like MeUndies is a good example of that where we're opening a pop-up store in Stanford. So we have a team wholly dedicated to that. We also appear here which is a network where we're both an investor and a player. They actually started in London and have a number of \u2013 basically a platform that connects real estate owners with brands that want access to a portfolio in a very seamless way.", "They've also been instrumental in identifying up and coming retailers or concepts. And so, it's a big effort on us to do that. And not only that but also lease, not just through what we're doing at The Edit, but also through just normal deals like the UNTUCKits of the world. I mean there's a lot of that new business out there that is exciting for us because we are bringing in the up and coming retailers or food operators that know how to connect directly through the consumer, but also have a little different spin on how they connect with the consumer in the in-store environment. I think they're very smart, digitally savvy, speaks to Millennials, we love them as part of our platform and our properties.", "Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And then just given the natural seasonality of retailer income, how should we be thinking about the impact of Aeropostale, the Aeropostale investment in Q4? So what's in your guidance?", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, we don't break out that. It's in our guidance. We're pleased with the business. We bought it very \u2013 we're weighing the money. They're performing according to plan.

If we can just come back to the professional fees and other, it's like a $34 million, $35 million increase in the quarter. I thought the settlement on Woodbury was just under $1 million. So that would be a hell of a lot of legal hours even at $1,000 an hour. So can you just break out just the big chunks of that $35 million because it's not an inconsequential number and I think (1:23:16).", "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.", "Well, I think it's actually almost irrelevant because it's a one-time number and it is what it is, okay.

And unfortunately, this is a very expensive scenario that we have to deal with.", "The fee was nominal which reinforces what we \u2013 the fact that we, again, we made an announcement how we felt about it.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.

Mr. Ward, you may begin.", "Thomas Ward", "Thank you, Katrina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.", "For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.", "David Simon", "Okay, good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a very good year. Our FFO for 2017 was $11.21 per share which includes a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our senior notes. On a comparable basis full year FFO per share was $11.57 an increase of 6.4% year-over-year which without question will be at the high end of our peer group.", "To put our FFO per share in perspective, the $11.21 is more than $4 billion in total funds from operation which is the highest amount we've ever reported and the highest in the industry. Through active portfolio management, disciplined investments, relentless focus on leasing and property management operations, our annual FFO has increased almost $1 billion since we completed the spinoff of Washington Prime Group less than four years ago, yes $1 billion.", "We have achieved a compound annual FFO rate of 8% over the last three years and more than 12% over the last seven years. Our growth rate has outpaced the growth rate of all equity reached by more than 400 basis points over the last seven years and has been more than double the rate of earnings-per-share growth for the S&P 500 over the same time period.", "For the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $3.12 an increase of 7.2% year-over-year on a comparable basis and as a reminder our fourth quarter results were impacted by the closure of our two Puerto Rican centers due to continuing restoration efforts of those centers. We continue to report solid operating metrics and growth of cash flow.", "Our malls and premium outlets occupancy at the quarter ended at 95.6% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the third quarter. Our ending occupancy was impacted by the bankruptcies processed during the year as well as some of the new space we added to the portfolio from our new development and expansion openings.", "Leasing activity remained solid and improving. Average base rent was $53.11 up approximately 3% compared to last year and the mall and outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.42 an increase of 11.4%. Reported retail sales per square foot for our portfolio were $628 compared to $614, an increase of 2.3%. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.5% for the year or more than $265 million, and comp increased NOI increased 3.2% for the year 2.2% for the fourth quarter. On an the NOI weighted basis our operating metrics were as follows; retail sales - reported retail sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $779. Occupancy would be 96.3% and our average base minimum rent would be $68.97.", "We opened five new developments in '17 totaling 1.9 million square feet, which are promised to be really good additions to our portfolio. In the U.S. we opened Norfolk Premium Outlets; The Shops at Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. Internationally we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in South Korea; Genting Highlands Premium Outlets in Kuala Lumpur and Provence Designer Outlets in obviously Provence, France.", "Construction continues on two new outlets in Edmonton Canada and Denver, Colorado, used to be called the Intermountain region for the call and they'll open in the spring and fall of this year respectively. We've also started construction on two international outlet projects in Mexico and Malaga, Spain and both of these are expected to open in the fourth quarter this year.", "Transformational redevelopments and expansions at our marquee properties continue adding a total of 635,000 square feet including La Plaza Mall in place of a former Sears store. Other expansions include The Galleria in Houston the second phase of The Shops at Riverside Woodbury Commons, Allen Premium Outlets and Roermond Designer Outlet in the Netherlands. We will also complete major redevelopment expansion projects this year at some of our most productive properties including the Aventura Mall, the redevelopment at Town Center at Boca, and the Toronto Premium Outlets expansion.", "In addition we expect to begin construction this year on a number of transformational projects where we will replace department stores with significantly more productive uses at Phipps Plaza, King of Prussia and Southdale Center. As a reminder, we expect to fund these redevelopments and expansions and densification projects with our internally generated cash flow after our ever increasing dividend.", "Now, let me talk about the fourth quarter. We acquired and gained control of 12 Sears Stores in our portfolio. We acquired the 50% interest from Seritage in our JV of five Sears Stores and they are included Brea Mall, Burlington Mall, Midland Park Mall, Ocean County Mall, and Ross Park. As part of the transaction Sears announced these five stores will be closing in the next few months and we will begin redevelopment shortly thereafter.", "We have now acquired the right to terminate five leases, existing leases of Sears Stores at the following locations; Broadway Square, Cape Cod Mall, Northshore Mall, South Hills Village and Tacoma Mall and we also bought two Sears Stores at Stoneridge shopping Center and Wes Town Mall.", "Turning to the capital markets of course we were active continuing to lower our borrowing cost. We issued $2.7 billion of new senior notes with an average term of just under eight years 7.9 to be accurate at a weighted average coupon of 3.07% and retired $2.6 billion of senior notes saving 60 basis points. We amended and extended our $4 billion dollar revolving credit facility and lowering our pricing grid at the same time and towards in 2022. We completed 20 mortgages totaling 2.9 billion which our share is 1.8 at an average interest rate of 3.37% and the term is 6.7 years. Our liquidity ended the year at approximately $8 billion.", "We continue without question having the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry, in the entire world, we ended 2017 with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times. Our interest coverage ratio was 5 times and we continue to have an A and A2 rating which we actually think is under valuing our credit. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever providing us with superior operating financial flexibility to continue to create long term value for our shareholders. And I reiterate this is a distinct advantage that continues to be overlooked by the market.", "Dividend, we paid a record dividend in 2017 of $17 or $7.15 per share and achieved a compound annual dividend growth rate of more than 11.5% over three years and more than 15% over the last seven years and today we announced our first quarter dividend of $1.95 per share for this quarter and year-over-year increase of 11.4%.", "Now turning to guidance and we're ready for your questions, our guidance range is $11.90 to $12.02 per share. This represents 6% to 7% growth rate compared to our 11.21 we reported. Our range is based on the following assumptions; portfolio, NOI growth about 3%. No planned acquisition or disposition activity. Interest rate and foreign exchange rates based on current consensus and a continued share count - diluted share count of approximately 350 million shares.", "We are now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Hi, good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Good morning. Since 3Q earnings, we all know that M&A has been in the headlines for the industry and you didn\u2019t touch on it in the prepared remarks. So I was just wondering, well first, as far as we know you didn\u2019t put in a counter bid for Westfield and GGP, so I think your stock might be lower based on conversations we've had.", "But second, you said in the past that you're out of the big deal business and my question is more just around why, what's different now versus in the past when acquisitions like [indiscernible] DeBartolo and Prime made sense, is it that the math doesn\u2019t work out at current share price, could it work with more leverage, but you don\u2019t want to go there? Is it operation where you get less out of it than in the past? Just wondering what's different now versus in the past?", "David Simon", "Well, I means that's \u2013 I think I need a written, I need that listed in a written way that I answer all of them. Look, I think, here's what's ironic and funny about all this M&A activity. The market was dying to have a mark on a portfolio. Okay? Dying. Well, my God we don\u2019t know what the value of regional malls are. Unibail as you know has agreed to acquire Westfield and they did it at a very healthy evaluation and yet the market yawned on it.", "So I just find the whole thing ironic. We continue to be out of the big deal business. We're not involved in any of the activity there. And your best asking you know those participants how they feel about it. We've got a lot to do to continue to grow our company. Nobody has our growth, I mean high to sit back and think about we grew our FFO, we spun off by the way with WPG I think if I remember right about $200 million of FFO more or less.", "We made a billion two back and did not with a lot of M&A activity frankly. So we've got a lot to do. We don't need to do anything. I think all of this activity reinforces the strategy that we've had that I think scale in any and all industries is important. Our balance sheet is underappreciated. I think if you look at the Unibail Westfield transaction and compare their debt to EBITDA and compare to ours at 11.5 to 5.5 with the same ratings, you will see the amount of firepower that we have.", "But right now that firepower is on the sidelines and we're not involved in any of the activity. But anything that we do I'm pretty sure that will add value to including, you know including you know buying, remember when the market puked all over Rio [ph] Postell [ph] I am happy to tell you it had a record year OPCO [ph] did over $40 million of EBITDA. We bought it for 1 times cash flow and it's alive and kicking.", "So you know, whatever we do we're hoping to add value to and we wouldn\u2019t do a transaction including any redevelopment or development that wouldn\u2019t add value to, but the market's got it's mark and I think the market should be pleased that it's got its mark.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Thanks for that and I guess just on that topic of staying on the sidelines, I just want to hear your thoughts on does that mean though that Simon as the company is still in touch with discussions that are going on, deals that are occurring and it's a deliberate decision to stay in the headlines? I've heard some concern from others that by staying in the sidelines Simon might be missing out on some rare opportunities. So I just want to hear your take on how I'm assuming that's not actually the case?", "David Simon", "Well, again I say we're not active, but I can and that's activity, but I would venture to say we typically be, we're typically buyers when no one else is, and we're typically not buyers when everybody else is. And that's just the way it's been and that's why we have $12 projected this year of earnings which is way ahead of everybody. That's why we have the balance sheet that we had that's way ahead of everybody. And you know we're a little bit different than most. I hope you accept it and appreciate it.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Got it and then just one on a different topic if I could. You mentioned the firepower that you guys have in terms of your balance sheet. Just looking at your development pipeline, the portion that's in process now, it is down from last year and the year before. So I was just wondering what the outlook is to getting this up again? I know you mentioned a few upcoming transformational projects that would suggest that they weren\u2019t yet in process as of the end of the year or is that the amounts that have been completed just haven't been able to be replenished?", "David Simon", "Well, look we - for whatever reason we don't put a \u2013 you know we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, the word fabricate is a bad word, but we don\u2019t put our shadow pipeline in numbers. What Tom does is show you what deals we've approved and basically are under construction. So as an example, the Sears transaction that I spoke about, none of that redevelopment activity is in that number, nor is Phipps, or is King of Prussia you know and I'll go down the list.", "So what we do is we tell you the truth. When we approve it and we're about to spend money on it and it's been approved by our appropriations committee, it goes into the 8-K and we spit it out to the market. We don\u2019t think we need to do a shadow pipeline because you know I don't know it's a waste of energy to try and do it. We have plenty to do and we'll be as aggressive as ever, but on the other hand one of the hallmarks of our company is our return on investment and return on equity, because without that you can't grow your earnings.", "And we are about growing our cash flow. Cash flow growth leads to dividend growth which ultimately or discounted cash flow model leads to more value in the company. Operating metrics do not. Okay? Operating metrics do not. What leads to valuation growth in my opinion and certainly in the real community there may not, may be not as a technology area, but is cash flow growth, return on investment, and you know, so I - so the long answer to your question is, we have a lot to do and a lot of these projects are in the process of being finalized in terms of scope, scale, pricing. And once we formally approve it, it feeds into our 8-K and you'll see that number go up.", "Caitlin Burrows", "Got it, thanks for that and yes I work hard. If you want know that I noticed that the rate of return did increase to 9% so that's great to see. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Thank you, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Good morning, it's Jeff Spector here with Craig.", "David Simon", "Hi guys.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on the guidance. I believe David, you said that portfolio NOI growth over 3%. Can you provide a little bit more detail on that? Is that \u2013 that's not same-store correct that you're just talking about the prior\u2026?", "David Simon", "That is not same-store, same-store the way we define it will be slightly less than that. We're trying not that I want to like name companies, I've already named one. It's probably not a good idea to keep doing it. But we want \u2013 you know we see what others do like Federal where you focus on the NOI growth.", "We're trying to get you know as our company gets bigger, you know the impact of the expansion and a new project becomes less and it's easier for us to describe it just in terms of our total portfolio NOI so we're trying to get folks to start thinking about like that like they do with federal and again I'm not criticizing great company. I'm jealous, much higher multiple, and it seems to like the way they do it and so we're focused on that. But it will be slightly less than the 3% based on our numbers today.", "Jeffrey Spector", "And can you provide any of the details behind that in terms of let's say occupancy expectation or\u2026?", "David Simon", "We are doing it exactly the way we did the last year and one year after. We do not provide leasing spread forecast. We do not provide the occupancy forecast. We've never done that Jeff and I have no real desire to do it. You know, again we can - we can - we can just be obsessed with metrics, I'm obsessed, we're continuing to grow our company, make our company better. I'm not obsessed with metrics and I think unfortunately you know we can - we can get into that the rabbit hole. But the reality is I'd encourage you to look at $12 compared to the peer group, look at our multiple, look at our dividend yield and then come up with your investment recommendations.", "Jeffrey Spector", "Okay thanks. I think Craig has a followup.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Craig Richard", "I just want, great \u2013 I just wondered as the project is changing in some degrees that lets you go from 7% to 9% in the stabilized returns for the malls?", "David Simon", "There's always a mix change. We are excited. You know, and again Craig, we are - we are excited about, you know the redevelopment efforts that we've got on the drawing board, you know from Phipps to King of Prussia to the Sears transaction. So there's going to be, I can't tell you how excited we are to get, you know to get these spaces back, where the media likes to make it as the beginning of the end, we think it's the rebirth. Okay?", "And I can't tell you how excited we are to continue to do our - you know, our varied redevelopments. You know the biggest issue for us is just managing all the activity. It's not from an investment point of view. You know, again if you look at our business, people can grow their company if they increased their leverage. Right?", "Now technology companies, if you looked at their quarter-to-quarter increase in debt you'd be really surprised by how much you know maybe they are buying growth, we're actually trying to keep our balance sheet relatively flat because we know that there's a lot to do. So in that sense if you look at our net debt it's relatively flat year-over-year which is still kind of remarkable given that we've had all this activity.", "Richard Sokolov", "And Craig I would just say, you just followed our NOI has been increasing every quarter, projects roll off and new ones roll on. The beauty of our redevelopment positioning is that we are able to manufacture new redevelopment projects to continue to enable us to grow our cash flow.", "Craig Richard", "Great, and then just of the 12th that you have started did you gain control, how many will be under construction in '18?", "David Simon", "Well, that's hard to say. I mean we still have permitting to go through. So I \u2013 let's put it this way, all of these are well advanced in terms of plans and we're all through \u2013 we're going through the permitting process, but I would hope to begin a handful this year.", "Craig Richard", "Okay, great, thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Michael Mueller", "Yes, hi. Good morning. I have three questions here. I guess first, what was the NOI weighted weakened spread compared to the 11.4% you reported? Second, can you kind of talk about 2018 store closure expectations versus what we saw last year?", "And then third, it's little bit more of a technical question, curious why the Edmonton Outlets are considered a Mills project on the supplemental as opposed to an Outlet project?", "David Simon", "Well, I'll try to take them in the reverse order. So it's basically, if you know [indiscernible] they basically own the Mills up in Toronto, Vaughan Mills. They built one in Vancouver, South Vancouver. And if you look at Edmonton it's really enclosed. It's got a lot of the big boxes and it's really more of a mills type of physical product than it is in outlet center where the outlet centers tend to be open air and village settings.", "So it's got \u2013 I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, but 12 to 13 boxes at least, you know similar to what we would have here in our mills and what they would have there up in their Canadian mills. So it really is - it's really a Mills project.", "Second is, you look \u2013 if I remember the numbers 90 and 2015 we lost 900 some odd thousand, 2016 we lost 300,000, 250 to 300, 000, 2017 we lost a million too. Right? Good numbers see? Okay, so my memory is still with me. And we \u2013 look, it's hard to predict, but I would think that it's going to be significantly less than 2017 and that's the good news. And the opportunity is look we \u2013 you know, it is much as you and I want it more than you want it, okay? So let's just be clear. I want it more than you want it for that lease have to occur when you lose a million two.", "You know, it does take time and if you miss the season, you know it\u2019s a process. So and that's why to some extent our occupancy dropped in addition to some of our adding some new space that basically is over 2.5 million square feet in new space between the new centers and the expansions. So the reality is we got work to do to get our occupancy up. I expect that number to be down.", "And then on your final, the rent spread on the weighted is slightly less than that number, I don\u2019t have it at the top of my head which is I know surprises you, surprises me as well, but we can certainly work on that and get that to you.", "Michael Mueller", "Okay, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "How are you?", "David Simon", "Good.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "And I guess I'm fired up. So two questions from me.", "David Simon", "Do you want me to be depressed, what do you want me to be Alex, talk to me, tell me how you want me to be?", "Alexander Goldfarb", "You are always in a good upbeat mood, so I'll leave it there. And I assume you're going to Minneapolis in a few days.", "David Simon", "Actually I'm not. I'm going to be watching my, no I am not going to be going to the Super Bowl.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, two questions David, the first one is on the tax cuts, the retailers themselves you know corporately are among the biggest beneficiaries on tax rate and yes there were north of 30% effective. So obviously you know they stand to benefit big time. We've seen wage increase, bonuses, what are you seeing from the retailers themselves as far as reinvestment in their stores, in their brands, in their platforms, and how do you think it plays out at your centers?", "David Simon", "Well, I'll let Rick answer, I'll just be very, less wordy. You know, in my prepared remarks I said improving. So I think the fourth quarter sales were improving. Not every retailer, I mean some retailers yes, no, I mean but generally improving. The mood is improving. And obviously the tax \u2013 given where retail started with the board or adjustment tax to where it ended up, you know, I think is good for the general retailers and I think they've all concluded. Thankfully you know, some are in a better position to do it and then others that reinvesting in their store is not such a bad idea. Rick, you can add to that.", "Richard Sokolov", "And we would obviously like to see them invest more because the physical atmosphere that we can provide in our stores is going to be very important. All three of our platforms were up year-over-year in sales. Happily we also found some firming in the tourism markets where several of the markets that had been down are now showing some strength, so that's helping as well and we are encouraged about the trends there.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay and then the second question is, David, between the impact on Puerto Rico and I'm not sure what you guys are now recovering on business interruptions during\u2026?", "David Simon", "Well, Alex let me interrupt you there. We don\u2019t recover anything on that because I won't go through the arcane which I could, but I'll leave the accounting arcane treatment to the side. Reality is we cannot book business interruption insurance until we get so there is no - there is no income whatsoever when it comes to Puerto Rican assets okay? And we explained that to you last time.", "Even with that said when we started our guidance and put the redemption cost aside when we started our guidance I left some of these headlines about guidance short, guidance this, guidance that, yet no one, I'd never see the headline that says, highest growth in the industry. I\u2019m waiting for that, Alex you could probably start that trend. But even with losing Puerto Rico and the bankruptcies that in a lot of cases were unforeseen, we did beat our guidance that we laid out for you and this time last year okay? And not like our normal you know crush beat, but we beat it by $0.03, $0.04 something like that, and Tom I'm looking at Tom.", "So again, I just hope you appreciate that. I mean it's not - it just doesn't - we don't roll off the log here. We grind it out. We did beat our earnings when you take out the redemption charge despite Puerto Rico not being in the numbers and then obviously the decrease in the NOI loss from Puerto Rico which is not a crazy number, but it's few cents.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay, well just to finish the question David. Just curious how the rise in interest rates but the benefit on FX, how those two netted out as you guys laid out your 2018 is it than that wash or is that favorable or unfavorable one way or the other?", "David Simon", "Yes, it\u2019s basically a wash.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Okay.", "David Simon", "We're not that levered with that much floating rate debt for that to really hurt us that much and then obviously our international business is about 10%, so when you put it all together it's not going to - it's on the margin.", "Alexander Goldfarb", "Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of the Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Hi, yes. Good morning everyone. Just following up on Alex's question about FX, could you just talk about the impact of FX on same-store NOI in \u201917 where I believe there was a bit of a drag versus in \u201918 way to put it that consensus estimates and FX would actually be a positive to same-store NOI growth?", "David Simon", "It's basically flat and again there's a good thing about it, it may help tourism in the U.S. which we get a benefit of. So we'll see, but so it's not material in a sense and I \u2013 and again remember that international, you know that's why we try to guide you toward portfolio NOI, but international is not in our comp NOI, you know that, right?", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Yes.", "David Simon", "Okay.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful.", "David Simon", "Okay, so the only benefit that we will see from the domestic which is what we do for same-store NOI is what impact the weaker dollar will have on the tourism spend okay? Not the foreign exchange number. You're with me, right?", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Yes, correct.", "David Simon", "Okay, okay, just want to make sure.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay, that's helpful. That makes a lot of sense. Second question, you have a kind of an expansive list of densification projects here that\u2019s kind of good to see. Just curious with your partner in that densification project, are you participating in any of the upside associated with these upcoming hotels or office buildings or anything of that nature? I'm just trying to understand and I'm trying to understand the relationship to how it works.", "David Simon", "Well, yes of course we\u2019re partner - if we don't do it ourselves and we're partners of course we participate as a joint venture. A lot of these deals that we've done are 50-50 straight up deals. We get the value of the land which in some cases is higher than what our book basis is, it's never been lower and then we share in the upside absolutely. You know, and then I think with time there will be a trend for us to do more and more of these on our own. As an example at Fifth we plan on doing a hotel, the Nobu Hotel on our own.", "The office building that's programmed in that at this point is on our own. We may or may not bring a partner in, but although - if we do bring a partner we'll certainly have upside, if we don't just sell the opportunity at a premium and then let them develop it.", "Richard Sokolov", "And I would point out that this densification is not new for us. We've been doing this for a decade and we've been reaping the benefits as we decide when we want to asset managing, we've sold a number of these densification projects and make a lot of money doing it. So we've been doing this for a long time and we're just going to come up with incremental opportunities.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay, so I guess the expectation has I mean, in \u201918 we should see decent increase in the income from unconsolidated entities from all these JVs?", "David Simon", "Well, it's - a lot of these are under construction, so I don't think \u201918 is a big year for that, but they'll be you know there'll be some, I think you will continue to see more and more projects being added in our portfolio. We had a substantial increase quarter-over-quarter in the number that we included in the CAG.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Got you. Okay, just one more from me I appreciate the patience. There have been press releases about the Tijuana situation has been resolved between the two parties. Is there any color or commentary you can just kind of provide about lessons learned through that process?", "David Simon", "From us?", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Actually from both sides, because I\u2019m just kind of curious how was it settled, what's the ultimate decision? But does it give you confidence about system supporting your lease structures and I\u2019m just kind of curious?", "David Simon", "I don't think it's fair to ask us. The last thing we want to do is get into an argument with one of our clients. However, if we feel like it's not and this is a generic statement, if we feel like it's not being appropriately dealt with we have no choice but to do what we did. It's not what we want to do. We're not in that business, but if we feel like we have to protect our position we will and it - but it took a lot of took \u2013 you know generically when you have these situations it takes a lot of judgment what to do and not something I'm excited about doing, but if we have to we will.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks, good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Steve Sakwa", "I guess David, on the buyback, I noticed that the volume was much, much lower in Q4 than in Q3 and I\u2019m just wondering was there anything that maybe precluded you from doing buybacks and was there something about the share price or just your liquidity obviously is in very good shape, so I just thought maybe some comments on the buyback and how you're thinking about that in 2018?", "David Simon", "Well, we \u2013 well, I guess, I think as I look at \u201918 and I look at and I really study other credits that are like ours or that at least rated the same as ours, I shouldn\u2019t say like ours but rated the same as us, I see a lot more firepower than they do and that - it's important for us to maintain that rating. But I think we're underappreciated by how they evaluate things. So it is - a long story short, it gives me more \u2013 a stronger position to continue to be more aggressive than we were in the fourth quarter.", "The fourth quarter is just kind of an anomaly in that it wasn\u2019t anything legally precluding. There was a period of time when the stock really got hit. And we went in and then it jumped back up, so we and then before you know we're in the blackout period and then we can't do much more. So it's really more on that front, nothing other than that. But you know when I look at ratings of companies that are the same as ours, we have a lot more firepower and that gives me more confidence to be more, perhaps more aggressive here.", "Steve Sakwa", "And just to be clear, you're not assuming within the earnings for next year that there's any buyback activity, so there's no benefit from potentially using the firepower on the buyback.", "David Simon", "That is 100% accurate.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay and then just this is a little bit more of a medusa [ph] question, but when we look at kind of the income statement, home and regional costs as well as G&A were down substantially '17 over '16. And I'm just trying to figure out are the \u201917 numbers you think, sort of good starting points in run rates to think about \u201918 or was there something abnormal in \u201917 that brought us down versus \u201916.", "David Simon", "No, I think they're pretty consistent. That's a new run rate. What I \u2013 at the beginning, you know the executives here did not have - and again you can get me going philosophically, but we decided not to take any long term incentive for \u201917 and take and express to the market that we're going to do what it takes to continue to run our business as we've also retired a couple of people that we're that we haven't replaced at those kind of levels. But I think those are pretty close to the run rate sort of more or less. If it's up it's more inflationary up than anything else, but I would look for that to be more the new normal, maybe slightly up just from an inflationary point of view.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay and then maybe just a touch back on lease and I know you sort of circled this a couple of times and your commentary about good and improving and maybe just get Ricks commentary, but as you sort of sit here today and kind of survey the landscape in the leasing environment versus a year ago, it much feel better but how many, if you just help us kind of quantify or think about kind of the environment today and the discussions with tenants versus say six months or twelve months ago?", "Richard Sokolov", "It's Rick, Steve. It is clearly a firmer environment. The tenants are more constructive in their view of their store platforms. If you looked at all of the comments that the tenants had coming out of ICR, I think all of them basically were saying that we have made progress getting our portfolios right side. David has already commented. We view \u201918 as hopefully going to be a less debilitating year in terms of reworks and bankruptcies and we're doing a lot of refit.", "We have made substantial progress on the bankruptcy space. We got back. We're leasing it on rent. That for the most part are higher than the rents that the bankrupt tenants had and we are encouraged and frankly it doesn't hurt that we have a great portfolio of properties that tenants want to be in.", "David Simon", "And there seems to be just one other small point on that is there seems to be a lot of the, and without naming names, a lot of the folks that are, that were a little sketchy last year seemed to stabilize their business a little bit more. So again, that doesn't mean there's not a shoe to drop with you know one retailer versus the next. But it does seem \u2013 there does seem to be a sense that some of the folks that we're \u2013 could have gone left or right are kind of stabilizing their business.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, great thanks. That's all from me.", "David Simon", "Thank you, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hi it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Maybe Rick or David, just sticking on the leasing these, as you think about the pace of your openings, this year been a sub page 23 you are at 6.7 million square feet, you had been a little bit over 8 million the year before and consistently in that 7.5 million to 8 million type or range.", "You have almost 8 million square feet expiring in \u201918. Can you talk sort about that actual pace and if you feel like there's going to be an increase in the opening pace or what may have held back some of the openings in terms of back selling the higher amount of bankruptcies this year?", "David Simon", "Well, let me first address in terms of our renewals. We are right on pace on our \u201918 renewals today as where we were in \u201917 with our renewals. And we as David indicated we're still seeing a relatively strong volume coming in. We have a large portfolio and as we work through we have to a degree a lumpier process because we deal with our tenants on all their expirations. So it's a little lumpier, but we do not expect that we're going to have any significant diminution in activity this year as compared to last year as we saw our average rents were up and our spreads were around.", "Michael Bilerman", "Going back to the same-store NOI David, on page 19 you lay out pretty clearly that components of that growth and so are you going to not provide that information now that you're not providing the guidance from comparable and a total perspective?", "David Simon", "No, no, no, that number will be the same. I mean that page will be the same and I've provided, somebody asked me the question I provided the same guidance we provided last year, so we've given you the guidance. And that page will continue to be the same and we'll continue to report both same-store and portfolio NOI we just are trying to explain to you we think one's better than the other. But you'll get both numbers and you'll be able to decide what's relevant.", "Michael Bilerman", "Right, and I guess the question is just trying to define slightly and people, different people may have different views the spread this year between comparable and total was 130 basis points. I don't know, if 130 that\u2019s again more\u2026", "David Simon", "All right well, okay, I mean we don't have to get into semantics too much, but it's fine Mike well our \u2013 we expected to be above 2% in same-store but it, but again our business is, it's a little bit more difficult to and again we thought we'd be at 3% last year and we beat it. We like to beat our numbers as you know. We have again another unrivaled history on that, you know, an unrivaled earnings growth, unrivaled dividend growth, unrivaled balance sheet, also unrivaled beating earnings expectations.", "And obviously as you - and Tom and I spent a lot of time looking at comp NOI over a long, short periods of times, long period of time and it's safe to say we've outperformed that both from a complete real estate point of view as well as within the retail sector. So put all that aside, we would hope to continue to do that, but it's a little \u2013 you know our business is not as - it's a little bit more of an art and science just more levers, a little bit like the hotel business as opposed to say the office business or even the apartment business.", "So that's why we always try to guide you towards this kind of range as opposed to that kind of range because there is all lot more moving pieces then some of those others. But it's expected to be about 2% and our portfolio NOI is expected to be about 3% and that's exactly what we told you last year and we'll provide the same. I think you'll find page 19 helpful, is it Michael.", "Michael Bilerman", "It is.", "David Simon", "We will continue to provide page 19.", "Michael Bilerman", "And then just a strategic question, as you think about running a company a lot of times status quo has more risk in it and pursuing some sort of transaction de-risks the company in some ways and you think about your history in terms of going into the outlet business, buying mills, expanding internationally, spinning off WPG in each of those the resulting entity was stronger, relative to the status quo.", "And I'm just curious how you think about the status quo today in terms of your three divisions and your geographical exposure and you can translate a little bit of what Unibail is doing with Westfield right? They have a status quo of being a predominately European, French focused company may have had more risk and diversifying their entity into the U.S. small business to them was the attractiveness wealth of the status quo. So how do you think about the go forward as Simon sit here today in terms of having those three divisions in your geographical exposure?", "David Simon", "Well, I would say we are without question in my opinion perfectly positioned to continue the success that we've had over the last 20 plus years. So there is absolutely nothing that I think we are not appropriately position for future opportunities. We don't, I don't feel - the only thing I feel compelled to do is to make our existing real estate better. That I feel with a complete unmitigated, unrestrained passion.", "I also think we need to without question work our tails off to figure out how to connect with the consumer in lots of different ways. But I certainly don't feel that we need to be better positioned or that I'm losing out on the M&A activity. I just don't, I don't beat to that drum and I don't think we need to and in fact I think most people are catching up with what we've already done, so I don't get out that I don't worry about.", "I worry about absolutely making our existing real estate better and I worry about how we continue to want to connect with the consumer and we'll always find interesting things to do. I mean, the market Michael, you know we gloss over what we do, but we did open an outlet in Kuala Lumpur okay? We do have a great presence and I don't think anybody other than tab and I guess has a presence in China.", "We do have an international business. We do have diversity in product type. We do have a great balance sheet. Our people are good at what they do. I'm not that shabby. So I don't know, I think we're okay, but the passion here is how do we make our existing real estate better and if there's external deal to do that we think is opportunistic for our shareholders then we'll take advantage of it.", "But I don't, I really, really, don't feel compelled that we have to do that to continue our leadership position. That's right, I don\u2019t feel that all that. I will say this, I mean I think these folks are catching up with us. We'll see if they are successful. I've lived and breathed this. It isn't that easy, it not - it doesn't happen, well you're going from a piece of paper to cash flow is a different leap of faith and so we'll see.", "Michael Bilerman", "And how do you feel just about your appeal, you obviously have the stake in [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] a number of years ago. There's been some M&A activity in that marketplace. How do you sort of feel about owning a 20% stake in the public security, you're chairman of the supervisory board with a lot of control, but just, how do you sort of think about Europe in that context with activity going on there as well and what you could do?", "David Simon", "Well, listen I think we bought opportunistically as you know that it's interesting Europe. They're all excited about the growth there that's finally catching up with the U.S. I am very comfortable with our investment there. And what the job, they're doing we've done a lot with that company. We'll continue to make it better, but again I don't feel from that standpoint that they are missing out some of these M&A activities the shareholders of the acquirer you know are pretty much beyond if not puke and it's somewhere in between. Right?", "So we at Klepierre have a lot - I think a lot to continue to do to improve the company and they're doing a very good job of it and I feel very comfortable with that investment and I'm pleased to see that there's, that there's green shoots in France and their starting to growth and the entrepreneurial spirit is coming back to an area that truly needs and deserves it.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great, well I appreciate all the color and keep growing cash flow.", "David Simon", "Yes, that\u2019s what we do.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Hi, good morning.", "David Simon", "Good morning.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Thank you. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question about sales. Curious about actually the 2% sales growth to the fourth quarter, is there anything positive I think the fourth consecutive quarter of sales just were include growth. But most are a bit surprised that sales per square foot worked up a little bit higher. After all you had pretty easy comps given to on '16 week holiday season last year and the fourth quarter I think you did -1%.", "So adding that plus all the hype around how great to see holiday season was from the media. May be you can reconcile that and add a bit more color on which categories maybe weighed down your growth and maybe some of the out performers?", "David Simon", "Well, this is, I mean the number is, the number is that the retailers report to us. They're in the retail business there's always winners and losers every quarter. There's no extraordinary insights that I have that will help you, help me answer that question. And I don\u2019t know Rick if you, the numbers to number is all I could tell you, but Rick if you have some insights.", "Richard Sokolov", "The only thing I can tell you is that just in terms of categories the entertainment women's better and moderate and kids' shoes were better, regions of the mountain at Atlantic Pacific and Florida were stronger. I think again reflecting the point that David made earlier that tourism is back a little bit and I agree with David, our sales number is a derivative number from our retailers. We're certainly doing everything in our power to draw more people to our properties, but ultimately the retailers have to convert them once we get them there.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay, fair enough I appreciate that color Rick and perhaps do you guys also have a NOI weighted sales per square foot growth figure year-over-year? I'm trying to get a sense of\u2026?", "David Simon", "Whatever that number that we had last time, I don't know, and Tom can follow up.", "Thomas Ward", "Yes, it\u2019s in fact it's up a little higher than it was, it was up almost 2.4%.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay, thank you for that. And one more I guess on the transaction market, I\u2019m curious if you're maybe think few more assets in the marketplace, have you noticed that change in perhaps seller sentiment for the quality assets that you want, given the recent transaction marks provided. And I guess understanding not, that you're watching but not necessary intern participating in the M&A going on around you.", "Is it fair to assume that you are interested in high assets should they become available? I guess what I'm trying to figure out you have as you outlined 8 billion-ish of liquidity, 2 billion of cash what you're planning to do with it? Thanks.", "Richard Sokolov", "Well, I mean I kind of, we work kind of hard to build that up, so I mean it's - I view it as an opportunity not and I said look, I think at the end of the day. We're going to be focused on good real estate in terms of our external activity. We're going to be focused on good real estate that we could add value to priced right and if we can't find that, we won't buy it. And if you look at our track record, we've done that. So let me repeat, good real estate one, two is where we can add value and three is appropriately priced for us and somebody may have pricing view that's different than ours and we may be right or we may be wrong.", "The only thing I can point you to is our track record and I will assure you that every time that we did an M&A deal, we were wildly criticized from CPI to when the Barlow was so long ago and I mean people remember, right? I barely remember it. I mean\u2026", "David Simon", "And suddenly Rick showed up at the office one day and I go, how did you get here?", "Richard Sokolov", "But you know, CPI to buying Chelsea to buying Chelsea to buying the Mills, I mean that was not one deal that the market said, boy, you guys got a good chance. So now that the concern is we're not buying anything, it is what it is. We find those three metrics we'll do something. If we don't, we won't.", "Haendel St. Juste", "Okay, I appreciate the thoughts, but disconnecting the dots it sounds like there isn't anything more incremental in the marketplace that perhaps you're noticing a shift in sentiment or perhaps a change in the quantity of quality assets available?", "David Simon", "Well, look I think the good news for you are a market participant and the good news for you is that you've had a couple of companies that are obviously very thoughtful smart companies from Brookfield to Unibail that have given you a mark, Unibail has given you a great mark in terms of you want to value U.S. real estate. And I know the market really was dying for that and there it shows up. Yet, it's not enough. Okay? But I would say to you that's a pretty healthy mark, if you're looking at wanting to understand what existing pricing is today.", "Thomas Ward", "Okay, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good morning everyone. May be just a follow up question on this liquidity. You talked about firepower quite a bit and the strength of the balance sheet, but regardless of what the investment is whether share buybacks or M&A at some point in the future or developments, I guess how comfortable are you in taking up your leverage? It sounds like you think you're not getting the credit for your leverage, that some of your similarly rated peers are, so and then I guess would you be comfortable going to 6.5, 7?", "David Simon", "Well, I don't was to pick a number on, but I would encourage you to look at who is rated the same as us in the retail space and look at - it to me the most, nominal line guy, I'm so old that I ice go cold, private equity leverage buyouts okay, that's the pure definition of how old you are right, whether you say private equity or leveraged buyouts.", "I\u2019d encourage you, Vincent to look at this in retail real estate really look at debt-to-EBITDA ours versus the peers rated in our category and you can see there's a wide really shockingly big spread. So we're trying to assess that, what does that mean for us or why is it that way we don't have really good answers and so it's a work in progress, but we're paying attention to it. There shouldn't be that big a spread.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks and then I think we've touched on this in the past, but of the $1.2 million square feet that you referenced from 2017 bankruptcies, how much of that is expected to come back on line in 2018?", "David Simon", "We\u2019ve already brought back on line almost 50% of it and we're making really good progress on the balance and the tenants that are coming in are frankly great productive growing tenants that are going to be more productive in the tenants that closed and they're paying higher rents. So it is a very productive process, but it certainly does have an impact while we're going through.", "Vincent Chao", "Got it and just one last one just in terms of your contractual rent bumps, what is that currently on average for the portfolio?", "David Simon", "In terms of what we're doing in our leases?", "Vincent Chao", "Right.", "David Simon", "Typically they are 3%", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Rich Hill", "Hey good morning. I think this question is for David and Rick maybe together. From our perspective and I think probably yours as well, the retail narrative was really strong in 4Q with sales improving. So I was a little bit surprised to see overage rents, look to be down maybe around 13% year-over-year and I was wondering if there's anything that maybe drove that you had mentioned Puerto Rico being closed in the fourth quarter.", "David Simon", "So, yes the simple answer is yes. Puerto Rico we did have overage rent from Puerto Rico that we have to take out, but also remember that. And you see this in our average base rent going up, so it's our job to take that overage rent each and every year when leases rollover to put that in the minimum rent, right? So you know, as the lease rolls are over let's say they\u2019re paying $10 of base rent, $10 of overage rent it's our job to get that to 20 bucks at base rent, right so we can take out the volatility.", "So part of our job is to always even do that and in a robust sales environment historically you've had folks that even though we've eaten into their overage with increases in base rent, there's a whole slew of others but since sales have been kind of flattish over the last couple years you're seeing the impact more of us converting the overage into the base rent and you're seeing that in the average base rent increase.", "Rich Hill", "Got it. That type of the numbers that's all I have. Thank you very much.", "David Simon", "Yes, no worries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Nicholas Yulico", "Hi everyone. Couple questions on occupancy, in the third quarter you mentioned you had a 30 basis point negative drag on total occupancy from new centers, what was that impact in the fourth quarter?", "David Simon", "Similar.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, so I\u2019m just trying to understand why the year-over-year occupancy dropped more in the fourth quarter than third quarter?", "David Simon", "We processed a lot of bankruptcies in the fourth quarter. Again remember they tell you when they're going to close and just a function of the bankruptcy processing.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay and then just lastly on in terms of your occupancy I guess in the fourth quarter and over the past year, hoping to get a break down of long term versus short term tenants and how that trend has changed in the past year?", "David Simon", "It's the way, our definition is that it is hasn't changed, so the numbers are the numbers. Okay? We only include it if it\u2019s a year. And then if it's less and it is not in our numbers, so it's all in it's a year-over-year comparison is appropriate the number hasn't changed or the definition hasn\u2019t unchanged.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is now open.", "Floris van Dijkum", "David, a quick question for you on, sort of touching upon fall off on other questions you've had as well, but with the Westfield comp out there at a relatively low cap rate compared to where consensus is for eight more guys there seems to be 75 basis points certainly relative to where you're trading at today, why aren't you more aggressive or will you become does that make you become more aggressive about share buybacks heading into \u201918?", "David Simon", "Well, first of all you can't buy stock back in a blackout period unless you have a - what's the word I\u2019m looking for? 10B5 okay. So and you said guidelines on the 10B5, so unless those guidelines are met we can't buy it, but the reality is, I think I intimated that yes it's something we're thinking more and more about.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Okay, another question I had regarding your 12 Sears boxes that you now control. Presumably there not in your redevelopment pipeline as you mentioned earlier.", "David Simon", "Well, that presumably they\u2019re not, they're not, you can take out the word presumably.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Right, there not, no but I\u2019ll ask as but presumably the returns on those 12 boxes would be in excess of your overall portfolio and based on what certainly what [indiscernible] has been able to achieve on their space right now. Any ideas of or any advance thoughts on any of them that you can share in terms of maybe turning some of the space into enter small shop space or is it mostly going to be doing your anchors, how you\u2026?", "David Simon", "Yes, it's a legitimate question. It's all over the board. As these transactions are permitted and approved internally, then you'll see exactly and it will be some are just box for box. A lot of them are torn down and redo like what we did in Macau and Texas. And like what we're going to do with King of Prussia with Penny or like what we're going to do with the bulk [ph] department store at Phipps. So it's really all over the board and we'll obviously, for us as we get all of that done permitted, priced out, approved, that will flow into our 8K and you\u2019ll see exactly specifically what we're going to do there.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Okay, great thanks. Last question I guess is, maybe if you can make a comment broadly on TIs. I think one of the concerns that people have its TI packages certainly in some of the script companies but also in some of the other mall companies has been raising a little bit. Are you seeing any sort of trends there in terms of what you're having to offer your tenants?", "David Simon", "If you go back over our TIs over the last five or six years, they've been in a very tight range. So I think it's important we very rarely give any TIs on renewals it's only for new leasing activities when we have a slightly elevated TIs because we've been able to do more restaurants or design your tenants, but it's been in a very tight range and we're not seeing any material increase in what we need to give tenants in that area.", "Floris van Dijkum", "Great thanks. That\u2019s it from me.", "David Simon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Linda Tsai", "Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Floris\u2019s question on the future Sears redevelopments are you thinking about these spaces any differently as in would you be less interested in letting apparel tenants fill the boxes, just given how competitive the space remains even if some brands had a better holiday?", "Richard Sokolov", "We are focused on making our properties better. As David said we've got very defined plans for all 12 of these. We are far down the road in our approval and leasing process. We have apparel tenants, we have restaurants, we have mixed used elements. We've got boxes, health clubs, theaters all over the board, but in every instance there is one thing each of these projects has been common and that is when we're done our project is going to be substantially stronger, higher NOI, higher total sales and more attractive marketplace serving its trade area.", "Linda Tsai", "Thanks. This probably sounds minor, but the occupancy cost ratio increased to 13.2% where as it's been it was it's been in the 13% to 13.1% range for the past several quarters is there anything to highlight here?", "David Simon", "No.", "Linda Tsai", "Okay.", "David Simon", "No, it's immaterial really.", "Linda Tsai", "All right and then what was traffic like in the quarter at the Mills versus the Malls, versus the Premium Outlets.", "David Simon", "All generally positive enough and I think traffic and sales are painting a more robust picture than the narrative out there is suggesting.", "Linda Tsai", "Have you seen some of that traffic follow through in January?", "David Simon", "Yes, I think January has been a very well it's anecdotal, we don't have January sales, yet it's we get from the retailers 20 days after the month but anecdotally we hear January is very strong across the board. So again, I mean I wouldn't bank on that, but that's at least from a anecdotal point of view we're hearing that.", "Linda Tsai", "Thanks.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jeremy Metz", "Hey guys question for Rick, I just wonder if you could talk about the pace of activity or momentum kind of in the junior box space some of the fashion retirees that have been a huge focus here in recent years. It seems to be losing a little bit of steam, so just wondering what the pipeline looks like on that front relative to maybe a year ago?", "Richard Sokolov", "Yes, it's in fact very strong ironically if you look at 12, 31, 16 we indicated we were going to have 34 boxes that could open in \u201917 and beyond and in fact in \u201917 we opened 34 and we now have 40 additional ones on the schedule for 18 and beyond. So there is still a very robust market out there for our properties and as we have said in the past, you're seeing that in our portfolio.", "Tenants that are operating in the mall contacts and than have operated in the power center contact which we can provide better sales, better traffic, so robust pipeline that is continuing to grow.", "Jeremy Metz", "All right, I appreciate that and then just one quick point of clarity here in Puerto Rico and I know it\u2019s not hugely material impact nearly $12 of earnings this sounds like guidance includes no insurance recovery, but the continuation of that call it $0.03 quarter we had from loss income, so is that the right way to look at it, so $0.12 drag in 2018 more or less?", "David Simon", "Well, it\u2019s I don't want to really point to that because we've got actually collected, so we're still projecting kind of a tough environment in Puerto Rico, so not completely the end of the world there, but we've got the properties are slowly opening, so it's I would say the drag is in the $0.03, $0.04, range somewhere in that range, but there's still a drag but where in fact Puerto Rico outlets just open that's further along and then the mall is it's getting closer to getting up to where it was.", "I mean it's open as well, but there's still a number of tenants lagging, so we still have some drag there and then we can't really book that be until we get it so it's dilutive to where we would be if we didn't have the hurricane but that's kind of the number in that range that's hurting us absent that. ", "Jeremy Metz", "Okay, thanks guys.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Thanks. So you guys talked about better traffic sales and maybe overall better mood across the industry. When you think about your guidance for next year are . Are to better malls in your portfolio improving versus last year or is a bottom picking back up, I was wondering if you can provide a little more color on that?", "David Simon", "It is across the board, but obviously our stronger properties are getting incrementally stronger and growing a little better and that hasn't changed in 50 years.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Okay and what is the average vintage of leases that are coming due in 2018? And how you describe you know what happens after the value of vintage starts to wear off going forward, and what is that kind of your\u2026?", "David Simon", "I don't know the reference damage. I mean we provide you the expiring rents and I think that gives you a pretty good road map when you compare our average base rent of leases that are expiring with our opening rents that we use in our spreads, so it shows you we still have for the next seven or eight years considerable runway to be able to roll our rent based on what we're doing to that.", "Ki Bin Kim", "Yes, I mean there's a little bit of discrepancy and understanding that because I believe the expiring are exclusive of cam, so it's not exactly comparable, versus what you're signing, but if you compare the average base renI personally are signing but\u2026?", "David Simon", "No, but if you compare the average base rent expiring and our average base rent today that has all of the lower rents, we're still our average base rent today is still an excess of our expiring rents.", "Ki Bin Kim", "All right, thank you.", "David Simon", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.", "David Simon", "Okay, thank you ma'am. Oh thank you and again we apologize for the length of our calls, but we want to have everybody given the opportunity to ask whatever questions that they do. So I do apologize and also later than people want, but that's why we're here happy to answer questions, so thank you.
