A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some introductory information.", "This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.", "A description of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the Company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 18, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's Web site.", "I would like now to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 begins with stronger than expected revenue growth, reflecting improved customer retention and broad based growth across UnitedHealth Group. This in turn was driven by our consistent focus on customer value, fundamental execution and net promoter scores.", "We remain optimistic about 2017, and accordingly, we are modestly strengthening our revenue, earnings and cash flow outlooks. Considerable national attention over the past three months is focused on U. S. healthcare and tax policies, so we\u2019ll begin with some brief commentary there this morning.", "We have engaged with elected officials from both parties, and at the federal and state levels, to address improving quality, access, affordability, cost and satisfaction for all stakeholders. Affordability can be improved most in the immediate term through lower taxes, and we hope Congress acts soon to permanently repeal the health insurance tax, before it further worsens consumers' premiums, state budgets and senior benefits. We have no insight as to whether that will or will not occur, and accordingly, our plans continue to assume the tax will return in 2018, which will raise premiums and/or reduce benefits for commercial businesses, state and our nation's senior population.", "In the longer-term, policy changes that improve healthcare and the health system play to our strength. UnitedHealthcare delivers modern, innovative, high performing network based health benefits with market leading capabilities and consumer engagement, value based reimbursement, network architecture and clinical management. We tailor these capabilities to address the needs of programs of every type and the consumers they serve.", "Optum\u2019s customers seek better data and analytics to improve decision making in the doctor's office, in the ER and acute care settings, at points of consumer engagement and on payer and employer desktops. As an open market integrator, Optum uniquely serves across all payers and care providers. Optum's own comprehensive clinical care delivery services have a highly compelling quality and cost profile. And Optum offers pharmacy care that integrates with Medical Care to support a whole person's clinical experience.", "This UnitedHealth Group portfolio is flexible, adaptable, innovative and positioned to contribute constructably to virtually any change agenda. We will continue to serve and grow through the changes that follow evolving social policy. A core part of that adaptability is, we continue to broaden and strengthen our leadership team by developing executive talent.", "We routinely give proven leaders new challenges that deepen their experiences and skill-sets. UnitedHealth Group has a tradition of developing leaders in this way and doing so when our businesses are performing well, which is the best time for change.", "In this day, we will highlight for you some of our most recent actions. UnitedHealthcare's executive leadership team has performed exceptionally well over the past few years. We have made a few changes to evolve that team; Steve Nelson will step forward as UnitedHealthcare's overall CEO and Dan Schumacher will serve as President; Brian Thompson, Medicare and Retirement's CFO for the last several years becomes its CEO.", "This UnitedHealthcare leadership team, anchored by Jeff Alter, Austin Pittman, Dan and Steve for the last several years will continue to operate as one team. They are committed to accelerating UnitedHealthcare efforts to drive growth and deepen the quality and consistency of its performance and its relationships in serving all stakeholders.", "Optum's performance over the last five years under Larry Renfro leadership has been nothing short of exceptional. And we are laying the groundwork for even higher performance levels. Larry is evolving Optum's leadership team as well with Dirk McMahon, a 14-year UnitedHealth Group veteran serving as Optum's Operating President; John Prince is leading OptumRx; Eric Murphy, Optum's longstanding Chief Growth Officer, has assumed leadership of OptumInsight. And we\u2019re pleased to have Andrew Hayek, who have joined us by way of the SCA merger, assuming overall leadership for OptumHealth.", "Phil Miller has made the decision to spend less time on airplanes and more time with his family in Kansas City. And Mark Peer, who as CEO of OptumRx played a central role in leading the integration of OptumRx, has also decided to step back, take a well earned and deserved rest and pursue his own investment interests. We deeply appreciate their exceptional leadership in advancing Optum and the many contributions they have made.", "We'll now begin our first quarter performance review with UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Optum CEO, Larry Renfro. Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Thank you, Steve. As you said, it\u2019s the right time to evolve our leadership team. Veteran leaders with new focus, new energies and high expectations working with a mission, from a platform like none other in healthcare. Across UnitedHealth Group, our team continues to deepen the disciplines of responsive service, consistent quality, innovation and relationship trust, all in the context of our mission and our culture.", "We have meaningfully advanced the net promoter system, NPS, across UnitedHealth Group and fully aligned our compensation systems with annual and long-term NPS goals. This year's first surveys of consumer NPS at UnitedHealthcare showed scores rising 4 points in each of our commercial, Medicare and retirement and community and state businesses. And Optum's results show strong satisfaction as well.", "The greatest value with this disciplines lies in the insights, NPS provides, enabling our people to design focused action plans to improve the consumer, client and care provider experience. Our enterprise-wide goal is ambitious. We are targeting a world class NPS of 70 within seven years, or 70 in seven. For us, NPS is both an operating and a growth metric, because our operational responses to customer needs increase trust, loyalty retention and reputation and these ultimately translate to growth. And our businesses are experiencing consistently higher customer retention.", "We are becoming adept in relationship and pipeline development and management, with a laser focus on our five high growth market for the enterprise. Those markets are technology enabled information and services, clinical care delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits and global opportunities. Alone, each one of these areas represents a substantial opportunity to serve. And combined, they drive the next decade of growth for UnitedHealth Group.", "Turning to Optum's first quarter. We grew earnings from operations by $173 million year-over-year, a 16% earnings growth rate on revenue growth of $1.6 billion, virtually all organic. Operating margins expanded to 6% overall and earnings from operations grew year-over-year by double-digit percentages for each reporting segment. Strong first quarter operating metrics provide visibility into continued revenue growth in 2017. Compared to the first quarter of last year, OptumHealth grew to serve 6 million more people with average per capita revenues growing about 10%.", "OptumRx fulfilled 15 million more scripts, an above market 5% growth rate. And OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog grew 19% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with more than $1.5 billion added in the first quarter. First quarter activity included the completion of our merger with Surgical Care Affiliates, a strategic addition to our OptumCare platform.", "SCA and its strong leadership team, an outstanding workforce, move us one more step toward creating the next generation of healthcare delivery. Clinical care, i. e. community focused, high quality, consumer friendly and cost efficient. Today, we serve patients as an in-network care provider on behalf of more than 80 payers.", "We offer urgent care at nearly 250 neighborhood care centers, primary care through local medical practices in nearly 30 markets with 22,000 dedicated physicians; house calls 1.3 million home visits this year performed by 1,700 skilled certified nurse practitioners; complex care management services, both in home and in nursing facilities; and now, high quality consumer and clinically differentiated surgeries in 33 states and more than 200 convenient free-standing surgical centers with top flight medical partners in local health communities.", "When we align and integrate enriched patient level data and applied analytics with our own care delivery capabilities, we are better positioned to serve healthcare through more effective value based contracts on a multi-payer basis, and that holds true for those we partner with as well.", "This effort, when fully scaled, yields more consistent health outcomes, lower cost and greater convenience for patients and the health system as a whole. This will continue to evolve as we advance and connect these practices and patients and integrate their pharmacy and other ambulatory and acute services. We are just in the beginning phases of this multi-year effort.", "OptumRx was selected last month as a pharmacy care partnered by the Health Transformation Alliance, which represents Fortune 100 national employers. Proven OptimaRx capabilities in applying data and analytics to improve both pharmacy care and health care were important to earning new opportunity. We see the potential for multi-year growth through HTA, following a notable business award implemented in 2017 from several of the largest, most sophisticated customers in the market.", "Our health financial services capabilities continue to drive growth across channels, products and platforms as well. The nation's second largest retirement plan administrator, Empower Retirement, named OptumHealth its exclusive partner for health savings accounts. Empower Health\u2019s people understand the direct connection between health and wealth, and is offering customers Optum\u2019s HSA\u2019s and digital tools to help retirees and active workers plan and save their future healthcare expenses.", "These examples further illustrate how we serve effectively and strategically interconnected businesses with platform level capabilities. It has been over five years since we began one Optum, an effort that built a robust and growing first generation information and technology enabled health services platform. Many of you have tracked Optum success in bringing a differentiated approach to helping customers better solve their complex problems.", "This year, our revenues are on pace to triple from 2011, and we are continuing efforts to align and integrate our businesses to position leadership, to build deeper relationships, and to focus on mission, culture and growth.", "Today, we are driving a second generations one Optum effort, to position Optum to truly enable a better performing healthcare system from the local community to national and global levels. Our first quarter demonstrates we are on track to achieve the strong level of results in 2017 [audio gap] we have discussed with you, and we plan to enter 2018 with considerable momentum.", "Now let me turn it over to Dave.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare began the year with exceptional results. Outside the ACA individual market, the business grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year and 1.5 million more people in the first three months of 2017. This continues a multi-year run of seven-figure membership growth. Performance that remains distinctive in the market year-after-year, an expectation we remain committed to for years to come.", "Our commitment to improving consumer value in healthcare drives us to continually improve healthcare quality and lower healthcare cost. Medical cost remained well controlled, current year cost trends are running in line with our expectations.", "As you are all aware the health insurance tax was deferrred in 2017, reducing premiums for customers in 2017 and adding about 150 basis points year-over-year to our consolidated Medical Care ratio. Absent this impact, our first quarter Medical Care ratio improved, mostly due to our significantly reduced participation in ACA individual offerings. Our consistent focus and innovation around medical cost performance and consumer experience continue to drive customer loyalty, leading to higher retention and strengthen growth. Let's look at growth by business and product, starting with employer and individual.", "In commercial offerings, we grew to serve 480,000 more people in the first quarter, 225,000 through risk-based products and 255,000 through fee-based offerings. And as you are well aware, last year, we made the difficult decision to reposition our ACA individual offerings, given our views on the sustainability of that market segment. At the same time, we remained committed to working with states and federal policy-makers to find ways to offer these markets and the uninsured, more viable and sustainable health benefits.", "The year began strongly in the public and senior sector as well, with the number of people served increasing by more than 1 million in total, including more than 300,000 people in Medicaid and 675,000 people in Medicare Advantage, about half of which were in employer retiree programs. Consumers are responding to our strong and consistent quality, distinctive star ratings, clinical engagement, stable premiums and benefits and the service experience our employees deliver.", "Across the UnitedHealthcare, we are growing both through increased penetration and long-standing markets and through geographic expansion in Maricopa County, Arizona, in the Western slopes of Colorado and in Upstate New York, as examples.", "Our clinical engagement has been increasingly differentiated as we care for a greater mix of members with higher care needs. The Dual Eligible Special Needs, or D-SNP market is a good example. The dually eligible make up just 15% of the total Medicaid population, but they account for roughly 35% of the total Medicaid spending. This demand on healthcare resources reveals the need to deliver highly coordinated and integrated health and social solutions that improve consistency of access and care, decrease the use of unnecessary services and high cost settings, and ultimately reduce costs without diluting care.", "While these individuals\u2019 health needs are more complex, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. Only 2 million of the dually eligible are currently enrolled in Managed Care, while nearly 9 million remain largely unmanaged in state-based fee for services systems. So far in 2017, we have entered into five new state markets and we expect to serve nearly 100,000 more dually eligible people in total of this year.", "UnitedHealthcare's core capabilities, aligned with serving individuals with complex needs, and helping them maintain their quality of life, which benefits the individuals, their families and the state and federal program sponsors tests with financing their care. By the end of this year, we expect to serve more than one quarter of the 2 million dual special need planned beneficiaries enrolled in Managed Care nationwide. We see D-SNP as a new and early stage market with great potential to grow by serving those with challenging needs.", "Last, on the subject of growth. More broadly, and as a reminder, while we continue to see real opportunity for growth, we are disciplined and firm about participating only in those markets that remain sustainable and we\u2019ll make the tough decisions to exists unsustainable markets, as demonstrated by recent exchange actions and selective Medicaid exists in the past.", "Taken as a whole, the UnitedHealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by $4.2 billion or 12% year-over-year to $40.1 billion. That is despite foregoing $1.6 billion in quarterly revenues or 5 percentage points of the year-over-year growth from the ACA insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium. Earnings from operations exceeded $2.1 billion in the quarter, growing 15% fully in line with our top line growth in the quarter.", "Bringing the quarter together on a consolidated basis, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues of nearly $49 billion, grew 9.4%. Consolidated earnings from operations were $3.4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew 35% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS rose 31% to $2.37 per share.", "Overall, we now expect 2017 revenues of approximately $200 billion and adjusted net earnings per share to be in a range from $9.65 to $9.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 per share from the midpoint of our outlook in January, partly from an improved tax rate in the area of 32.05% for the full year. The tax rate improvement is driven by a number of factors, about half of which are more discrete in nature, such as share based compensation and half, which we would expect to be more sustainable into the future.", "We expect our full year fully diluted share count to be approximately 980 million shares and we have increased our expectations for cash flows from operation to approximately $12 billion this year. With these considerations, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be largely consistent with the first quarter earnings we reported this morning. Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, Dave. So we remain positive and constructive with respect to our organization\u2019s potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall; fulfilling our mission to help people live healthier lives and to make the heath system work better for everyone. In fully responding to the market needs we see every day, we\u2019ll realize the remarkable potential of this enterprise. And as we do that with consistent excellence and confidence, we will continue to experience diversified, balanced and consistent growth as we\u2019ve seen today.", "So thank you for your interest today and operator, let's turn to questions and again one question at a time. We\u2019ll try to get to all of them this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Peter Costa", "Thanks guys, lot of management changes there. Can you talk about if there is any reason why you're doing them now? And does it have anything to do with the selling season coming into 2018, going forward?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Peter, I don\u2019t really have anything to offer other than what we did. We develop and think about these changes in advance. We kind of evolve them in our organization. We do these things when things are really, I think in strong order. And I think our tradition has been to do these every two, between two years and three years. And we\u2019re excited about it, and I think it provides fresh new focus, a lot of energy. And we have a tremendous leadership team, great depth. So we have a lot of talent to choose from. And in many respects, we just, we move from one spot to another to broaden experience as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything more than we feel very comfortable taking these steps at this point in time.", "Peter Costa", "And then so you're anticipating the 2018 selling season to be similar to the past seasons, or how you\u2019re factoring out?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We think pretty positively about 2018, at some challenges with respect to the health insurance tax as it sits right now. But as a total enterprise and our opportunities, I think you can see momentum growing in our business here for the last couple of years. And we expect that to carry through into 2018. So we do expect strong '18.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Dave Wimbley with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Dave Wimbley", "My question is a follow up on the last, which is on health insurer fee. By what point would you need to know whether that moratorium will be extended or if it'll be permanently eliminated in order to price appropriately for 2018 or has that date already passed? And if the health insurer fee is reinstated for 2018, what impact would you expect that to have on growth and Medicare Advantage? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. So we'll parse those questions up. I think Dan will talk about...", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning Dave. Obviously, from our perspective, we have been long supporters of the permanent repeal of the health insurers\u2019 tax. At the end of the day, obviously, it just increases the cost of healthcare, makes it less affordable and compromises people's ability to gain coverage. So we are certainly advocating along those lines. As we think about the tax itself, obviously, we\u2019ve got to deal with it as it sits currently in loss, and so that's what we're doing. We're planning accordingly. We're incorporating it in pricing and also incorporating in our thinking as we plan our benefits in Medicare.", "In terms of timing, there's different timings based on the businesses. So obviously small business, starts to resolve itself clearly now and into May, for next year large group takes later in the commercial process. And then as you look at the Medicare business that first Monday and in June is when we're doing our filing. So as it sits right now, we will plan accordingly and incorporate it. And as you think about, if it were repealed, obviously, we talked about the benefit of the moratorium in 2017 and size that in the $0.25 EPS range. Obviously, when it went out versus when it would come back in, the size of that, if it were to stay, is about a 30% increase in the tax itself. And then obviously, we've done well to grow market share over that time. So you can expect that, if the tax comes back in, it would come back in at a greater impact than what we talked about for '17. I think that covers it.", "Dave Wimbley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Josh Raskin", "My question just on a retail presence and I'm just curious. Do you think UnitedHealth Group, overall, would benefit from a larger retail footprint beyond just urgent care centres? And where did that stack up on your list of priorities in terms of capital deployment and what you want to do?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Interesting question, I think we're actually gaining market presence through OptumCare and through -- and that growing portfolio. And I think you probably not talk much about this. But we've also tried to increase our community presence in our UnitedHealthcare benefits in terms of we do offer some store front, kiosks. So that is a coming trend, but I think we'll take that in a measured way. And I think the other thing Josh to think about is your digital presence, if you think about it, whether retail is or physical presence is as strategic today as digital presence might be.", "And we've obviously taken some really powerful steps in terms of developing digital capabilities through the rally platform and our other applications. So we kind of are moving out in both those directions and we'll take it in a measured way and make sure that we're staging into the marketplace in that presence thoughtfully. Beyond it, I don't think I can offer too much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Scott Sidell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Scott Sidell", "I had a question, just if you can talk about how your caulking out the final MA rates for 2018, and any swing factors that you saw, whether that was pretty straightforward. And then just also, separately just related to MA, maybe just give us an update on how the claims experience seems to be tracking so far in MA book, particularly in terms of the new members that you\u2019ve added so far this year? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, and I think the benefits obviously will be more measured because that is more strategic, et cetera. But, Brian, you want to respond?", "Brian Thompson", "Sure, thank you. Good morning, Scott. With respect to the rates, we do continue to be concerned about the underfunding of the MA program. I think this is now 13% in cuts, since 2010. The final rates, where I believe 45 basis points of improvement year-over-year to the industry still in positive territory, but less than what we did experienced a year ago. I do believe though our starts advance in 2018 will help us relative to the industry, and will help us as we continue to navigate through this funding environment to provide, what is our number one priority is around benefit stability or underlying members.", "As we think about the growth that we\u2019re experiencing, we\u2019re three months in. And what we\u2019re seeing is aligning to our expectations, both in terms of mix and cost profiles, and we are very pleased with our industry leading growth. As you know about half of that growth is coming from our group business with the balance inside our individual. And I can't emphasize enough the role retention has played. I believe this is the third consecutive year where we\u2019ll be breaking our own performance records on member attention. And that is the biggest driver of our individual growth this year over last.", "And as Dave mentioned at the outset, the themes are the same as a year ago; stability in our offerings, in our network; the advancements we\u2019ve shown in our quality, as evidenced with our stars; continued improvement in engagement and satisfaction with our house calls. And when you wrap it all up, we\u2019re certainly pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. And I think this growth is a positive validation of the priorities we\u2019ve been focused on.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "I just want to go, I guess to Larry's comments about the momentum, heading into 2018 in Optum. Because I guess, we look at this year Q1 Optum growth for all three businesses was less, and the annual number for 2016, I think, 2016 for all three businesses was less than what we saw in 2015. So when you talk about momentum into next year, obviously, the absolute growth rates are still pretty strong, but it's been decelerating over the last couple of years. When you talk about momentum in 2018, are we talking about consisting growth, reaccelerating growth? How do we think about that context and of those businesses, which business do you feel most confident about, seeing that momentum into 2018?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I\u2019ll let Larry take that. But I think the growth is actually across optimism has been pretty impressive. And each year, they drive bigger numbers, so they\u2019re growing off a bigger platform. And I think people lose sight of the share size and scale of Optum. But Larry you can handle it yourself.", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways. We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and we\u2019re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that we\u2019re going forward with right now. When we are looking at sales and we\u2019re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year.", "We talked about, I guess we didn\u2019t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion. And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion. So that\u2019s been tremendous growth in terms of how we look at it. Now, if we look at the first quarter of 2017, I don\u2019t want to go into the numbers. But I would tell you, it\u2019s a record quarter in terms of overall sales. Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what we\u2019re doing in OptumRx.", "We are absolutely having scale and efficiency that\u2019s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value. And as a result of that, some of those numbers might look a different. And I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about that in a second. But I think that, as we look into 2018, we think that we\u2019re very well positioned. We think that we are on target with all of our expectations. We have the five growth areas that we\u2019re focused on; the government services; what we\u2019re doing in OptumCare; what we\u2019re doing with Pharmacy Care services; technology services, as well as international. So we feel very, very downhill about 2018. So Tim may be comment a little bit on the OptumRx side.", "Tim Wicks", "Thanks, Larry. Kevin, Tim Wicks, CFO of Optum, just wanted to follow on with what Larry talked about in terms of the integration efforts at OptumRx. I think one of the things that\u2019s really important to understand is that as we continue to drive progress and our integration efforts are deepening, this is really translating into lower drug cost for consumers and customers. And it\u2019s really a key part of the helping us drive earnings growth performance year-over-year. And our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress around the levers that we\u2019re driving around the integration efforts that Larry referenced.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ", "A. J. Rice", "Maybe I'll just ask a broad question around the evolving landscape and wash on your thoughts on that. We\u2019re not really sure where the ACA revealing or replace is at this point. But some of the things have been discussed are such as easing up on the essential benefit package, given more flexibility with respect to the rating span, shifting more discretion overall for healthcare to the states. I wonder do you guys have a strong view on that. And also ask if we do pivot to tax policy, are there any -- obviously a lot of domestic earnings, almost all domestic earnings you have would assume you would be a beneficiary. But is there any nuances around that we should think about? And then finally on the regulatory, the CMS has asked the industry to offer up suggestions on the regulatory front. Is there anything that either you or the industry would highlight on that score?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, A.J. I would -- it's probably not often that we say this. But if you really actually have been following the media with respect to the activities, with respect to healthcare policy, I would say that the media has been very accurate with respect to the narrative that is going on there, and the elements, many of which you suggest. So I think if you were following the media, generally speaking, you'd be up to speed. And we couldn\u2019t probably offer anymore insights than that.", "In our prepared remarks, we obviously focused on the health insurance tax. Because that, as Dan said, is going into the marketplace now for 2018. And that has an impact on affordability and the uptake of the participation in those markets. So we are strong advocate of repealing that and to taking that action as quickly as possible. Beyond that, we have engaged. We think pretty constructively around the notion of, and I think you can see this in our published materials on our Web site, that we see actually a marketplace that could be pretty constructive. But based upon more orientation to state based markets, more flexibility in the marketplace, really seeing Medicaid as the programs that have grown in effectiveness and to become broadly recognized as actually very efficient healthcare coverage for the populations to which they apply.", "And the elements that you mentioned the flexibility with respect to underwriting activities and so forth, we think those all would be covered in what we would see as more flexible state based markets that are actually more under the control of those that are close to the market in the state. I think all those things are really in conversation, but I think it's really around what is politically possible, maybe in contrast to what might be the most effective policies that could be applied.", "I would say that the tone has been generally more positive and access has been more available. So there is little bit more of a constructive posture. And so we remain hopeful that as this policy evolves that it could be better for coverage for American people, and return to the innovation and flexibility of the marketplace. And we think healthcare will benefit from that. Corporate tax, I think broadly will benefit, broadly across America in terms of economics, in terms of Company's outlooks. And in our sector we'd be similar to that.", "We have high effective tax rate and we think that tax reform at the corporate level will be good for consumers. It will play back into their benefit. We think it'll be good for employment levels. And we would obviously benefit from that and it will be good in terms of just the overall level of resource that we dedicate to at the corporate tax line. So we would be an advocate of thoughtful tax reform, and I think the majority of American industry would.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Sarah James", "If I look at the Medicaid RFP platform for the next two or three years, it has a good amount of rebids as opposed to new contracts. And if I think further out, a lot of the new opportunity is in the higher acuity population. So how do you think about the influence of competitive rebids and a shift to higher acuity populations on the long term margin profile of your Medicaid book? And what do you see as the organic growth profile of Medicaid? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I actually think both will be \u2013 both of positive trends, Austin?", "Austin Pittman", "So first and foremost, the RFP pipeline remain strong, you hit it while there is both new populations coming into Medicaid; there're new geographies being expanded within existing states; and there're greenfield states that are looking to continue to move. I think it's just a measure of the continued value year-after-year that Medicaid has provided to consumers and to our state partners. So we don't see a slowdown in that movement. The movement in populations with more complex needs, and I think Dave actually touched on this in his opening comments, really plays to the core capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum both. When you combine the data analytics capability, the clinical insights, the local delivery mechanisms that we've now got in place, combining physical, behavioral and social needs, we really feel like we've established a real foothold in serving populations.", "We\u2019re very pleased with the response we've gotten from consumers in the D-SNP category that Dave spoke to. We've seen the consumer experience continue to improve. We've got NPS now over 74, so just really outstanding. We're not going to rest on that, we're going to continue to learn to serve these populations better and better. And you're right. We think that'll continue to be an area of significant growth that plays to our strengths.", "With regards to the earnings profile, like all of our government programs, we expect that to be in the 3% to 5% margin range. And certainly, we\u2019ll be on a higher revenue base. So when you look at the membership growth, you'll have to adjust for the type of members those are because those more complex needs members do drive higher revenue.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Justin Lake", "My question is broadly around the UHC business, just given the strength here, curious if you can give us some directional color at least in terms of how the segments within that business were performing in terms of margin and profitability. And then Dan, your comments on the health insurer fee are really helpful, a lot of questions here. So just hoping maybe you could take that one last step further and help us put a range around the EPS headwind it would present in 2018 if it's not repealed versus the $0.25 tailwind that it\u2019s adding this year? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, you want to pick up where you left off.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Justin. I appreciate the temp on the health insurers\u2019 fee. I think we'll leave specific sizing to that for our investor conference and also obviously a better understanding of what the actual law will be as we step into 2018. As it relates to your question around the UHC businesses, as Dave mentioned in the prepared remarks we were able to drive 12% revenue growth rate across the platform. And if you adjust for the impacts of health insurers\u2019 fee and the individual ACA, the reduction in our footprint there, we drove closer to about 17% growth rate in our UnitedHealthcare business. And as you underneath that, we had really nice growth in every one of our business platforms. And the driver of that revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing pull through to our earnings base is really the enrollment expansions.", "And as you look at each of our business platforms it\u2019s happening in the places that frankly we have an opportunity to deliver greater value and greater returns. So as you look at the commercial business, we\u2019re growing nicely inside that group commercial fully insured business in Medicare and in Medicare Advantage. And in Medicaid, orienting towards, as Austin just talked about, more complex and more vulnerable populations, all which have more revenue content and likewise have strong earnings potential for us as a business. So on balance very strong medical cost well controlled and very much in keeping with our expectations. So we\u2019re pleased with the first quarter favorable mix.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Ralph Jacoby", "Just want to go back to last question, specifically on the UnitedHealthcare margins, 5.3% this quarter. You ended last year around those levels. I guess what we\u2019re looking for is maybe a sense of where margins currently fit across the mark deal each end market at this point, where you still see room for expansion. Obviously, understanding that population should shifts are going to impact that. But just want to understand where there still is upside for margin expansion in each of the end market? Thanks.", "Dan Schumacher", "Ralph, this is Dan again. As far as the end markets and the margins, obviously, we\u2019ve guided to and talked about government based margins in the 3% to 5% range and across their Medicare and Medicaid portfolios that we\u2019re operating within those ranges. And we obviously endeavour to perform towards the high end of that range. And on the commercial business, we\u2019re in the mid to upper single digits, and performing well in that business. And as we think about margin expansion or [audio gap], I would say earnings growth more specifically, we\u2019re looking to orient drive our earnings growth more from volume, so continuing to serve more consumers across our broad and diversified platform. And where there is opportunity, we\u2019ll look to expand margins as well, but feeling good about our positioning in each of our businesses. And better and better Medical Care management, no doubt but commercial and Medicare being strongest and probably Medicaid follow that.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Chris Rigg", "I wanted to see if you can provide anymore color around the goals and net promoter score. First, can you just give us the basis, I know you said a four point improvement across the three segments, so where you are today? And then more importantly for investors, and we think 70 and seven years, what does that mean for capital deployment priorities? And is it sort of you are looking -- need to look externally to buy capabilities or is it more about just putting money back into what you already have? Thanks.", "Larry Renfro", "That\u2019s a great question, and half a day on. But Dave you want to take that this morning?", "Dave Wichmann", "Thanks Chris, great question, I appreciate it. As Larry stated, we\u2019ve meaningfully advanced our MPS disciplines in the business, I would say, over call it about two years now or so. And as he also indicated, we\u2019ve now fully aligned it to our compensation systems, which should give you some senses as to how we feel about the integrity of the data that we\u2019re receiving and also the ability of our organization to actually influence these results.", "Both businesses have shown very meaningful progress, and that\u2019s across the consumer client and care provider scores as well. So we do look at this in a multi-dimensional way. We generate a wide range of performance across our business. We, like anything we measure this over a multiple different sales in our business, and our performance does range out quite widely, which is one of the objectives that we have over this time period which is to get to more consistency, which will lead to a greater support of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum and other brands across our business overall. We gave you an expectation of 70 and seven years, and it\u2019s unlike to actually think and report out on a seven year basis.", "We\u2019re basically telling you the same things that we\u2019ve engaged our employees around, which is to have and seek to meaningfully improve our performance across multiple dimensions in our business. And that\u2019s exactly what they do they do this by analyzing why people promote our products, why there are detractors and our products. That deep analytic and then the action plans are developed around that are what really provide the substance to this program. And the achievement as measured is critical and important. And we just called out the achievements of UnitedHealthcare this morning, we could easily -- we\u2019ve done the same for Optum. But they have improved just so far in this first quarter alone by 4 points, which all the NPS statisticians out there would suggest that is a meaningful and statistical improvement year-over-year.", "So while this 70 is an aggregated number it does mark a plan of achievement over the course of the seven years towards a greater satisfaction and a greater a reference point of consumers, clients and care providers of our business. And I\u2019d suggest you that\u2019s on a baseline of about 40 or so today, which is a meaningful score, meaningful place. But honestly what we\u2019re trying to do is to reorient what our expectations are around satisfactory service and performance broadly as an organization.", "In terms of capital deployment, it\u2019s already found its way into the way in which we operate our call centres, how we process claims, how we handle adjustments and call backs from consumers and how we engage with the market base broadly. I wouldn\u2019t see this as something that\u2019s going to be capital intensive. It is something that just shapes the way in which we spend our CapEx annually. And likely will result in additional investment across the business.", "Again, our goal here is to create a higher NPS, which drives greater trust with the marketplace, trust to get loyalty, loyalty to get drove. And you're starting to see that shape up in the retention across our business. Retention is important, it gets us greater predictability in our business, overall, but it also provides a great launching pad for growth into the future.", "Chris Rigg", "That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.", "Larry Renfro", "I think it comes down to how we spend that capital, and doing it effectively. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a more capital issue it will give us insight to how we spend it more effectively. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Lance Wilkes", "Just wanted to ask a little bit about the TVM growth outlook and in particular for OptumRx, what is the composition of clients looking like, going forward. How much do you think you're going to be able to improve on penetration in your UHC self insurer block there. And what's the outlook for margin profile is that evolves, going forward?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Maybe Dirk, you want to start that out and then John Prince.", "Dirk McMahon", "I would say that we talked a little bit about the 2016 momentum that we had sold to some fairly sophisticated buyers throughout 2016. And in the script we also talked about the Healthcare Transformational Alliance. And again, we were chosen as a partner for that group. So from that perspective, I think our value proposition is resonating with the sophisticated buyer population. I would say in answer to your question about how we would further penetrate within UnitedHealthcare, I think it just goes back to our synchronization value story; our ability to take in the medical data, the pharmacy data; take that in with our next best action protocols and have our call service agents, get people disease management and clinical management program. So I think from the value proposition standpoint that will drive with UnitedHealthcare. More broadly about the market, I turn over to John to talk about what we\u2019re seeing in issuer selling season.", "John Prince", "Thanks Dirk. Good morning, Lance. This is John Price, CEO of OptumRx. In terms of 2018, we\u2019re still in the early in the season. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s chasing up to be a very robust season compared to last year. Our differentiated offering is really resonating in the market in terms of the things starting. Our pipeline is very similar to last year includes large government, labor, payer and employer bids. So it\u2019s a very robust market in terms of the diversity. There is also a lot of large strategic opportunities, which are in line with our expectations. The RFP volume is as well as the mix of clients is as expect in terms of expectations. So I think this is shaping up to be a very solid year.", "In terms of pricing competition, pricing remains robust in the market but disciplined. So we're also excited about that. And also very excited about how the market is responding to our solution similar to last year, our differentiated offerings in terms of things, focusing on managing drug cost as well as the total cost of healthcare is really resonating in the market. In terms of Lance your last session with the margin, our margin expectations haven't changed. We're still expecting 3% to 5% long term outlook for the market.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Michael Baker", "My question's for Dirk. Given the fact that you're headed back to Optum in a more elevated role. Could you give us a sense of your top three priorities?", "Dirk McMahon", "Well, I think to start off with my first one is to make UnitedHealthcare and Optum work better together, that will be number one. I think I have a good perspective of what works from a value creation standpoint and works from a customer standpoint across both business platforms. And I would start with that. I would add on to, from an NPS perspective, Dave mentioned that. NPS is very important. Pharmacy care services is a huge -- is the most heavily used benefit within the healthcare space. I think making sure that that operates well is important, we really gotten off to a good start there.", "And I would also say making sure that with respect to some of the integration that we have and it\u2019s still continuing, I would say that that's another area where it would be a high priority for me. And last thing I would say is from a technology standpoint, Optum technology making sure that we deliver on the technology is needed across the enterprise on behalf of our customers. One of the big things is simplification from a technology standpoint, from an NPS standpoint. And what I would say is that's a good place to focus as well.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Cheryl Connick with Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Cheryl Connick", "I had been wondering when the management shift or rotation would occur, it seems like it was a long time. So nice to see the Company is strong enough to be able to do that at this time, and do it so easily with some of the folks. The question that I have though is if we could, and I almost take assets Managed Care question, but I will. If we could dig down into the cost trend a little bit, you usually give us a breakdown in how much you see in utilization of in-patient versus out-patient, perhaps pharmacy trend. But if we can think about this from a value based perspective, what if anything, are you seeing in any differences over time in the composition of your cost trend. And if you can step back and analyze that a little bit. Now that you're in the care provider business, pretty strongly with OptumCare on the one side, and certainly your network construction on the other. What should we be thinking about those shifts? And how we might see the composition of the cost trend changing over time even if the level stays relatively constant?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'll start out with a few themes and then ask my colleagues on the UnitedHealthcare side to pick it up. But I guess Cheryl a good question and a thoughtful one. We have been seeing a pretty steady movement of services into, and I'll say, the out-patient setting, are out to the community. And we have been following them with the OptumCare platform and encouraging that. And thinking that that is a more ideal setting in which to engage and do those services. And we actually think the care technology is facilitating that. It is the procedures are getting simpler and more advanced, the rehabilitation processes, the care processes and so forth, all play to that. Also I think we've been pretty consistent about suggesting that we've seen more in terms of specialty pharma application, diagnostic testing; and those have been more of the trends in the acute care setting has been.", "And I would say that we're pretty hopeful and optimistic that better, let's say, a better formulation or application of resources in the community setting holds a lot of benefit, particularly whereas consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more information is available to them and they're being more engaged in picking the right settings for the services they need. Dan, you want to pick up on that.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Thanks, Steve. In addition to, I think what you did well to describe is some of that shift from the acute care setting to ambulatory settings, and that shift that comes from in-patient to out-patient. I think the other place Cheryl that I would point to is a greater investment around physician; so really them at the centre of the care continuum and making investments, and really connecting care in a whole-person way and investing in primary care, in particular. So as we think about the composition of where our spend is going, we do see shifts from in-patient to out-patient, a greater investment towards physician and then obviously some of the comments that Steve made with regard to pharmacy inside it.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And maybe Andrew, you have some perspectives, new voice and fresh perspective on that?", "Andrew Hayek", "I would echo what's been said. We do see across OptumCare, which of course include SCA and also our neighbourhood care centres. And medical groups, the Option D for more care to occur in the out-patient setting, improving the experience, quality and cost to healthcare, and improving the provider experience. So we're excited about what we see in the opportunity ahead.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And we\u2019re seeing the consumer more comfortable coming into these venues, and that\u2019s also really encouraging thing, so great question and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Ana Gupte", "I wanted to get some more color more broadly on your Optum margin outlook, and your targets and appointment time. You\u2019ve seen some margin expansion this quarter and Insight and in Rx, not in Health. Do you still have, as a priority, a stretch goal with margin expansion you used to have one before Catamaran? And where is the most leverage in the model, by segment, is it in OptumCare and OptumHealth, or Insight or elsewhere?", "Larry Renfro", "We do, and I think Larry alluded to that in terms of revisiting one Optum. And I am going to ask Tim to comment on this. But going back to I think what you were talking about the model we had what something called one point time it was 15 by 15 and it was 8 by 16. And what's Steve\u2019s alluding to we\u2019ve played that those two through. And now we\u2019re in the process of putting together a new five year business plan that we\u2019re calling the second generation. And so there will be an emphasis on a lot of different things. But margin will be part of that. So I'll ask Tim to comment on that.", "Tim Wicks", "A couple of things to consider, as Larry mentioned about the energy that we\u2019re putting around second generation of one Optum; there is a significant amount work around and ensuring that we\u2019re investing in the areas where we see growth opportunities to be able to drive sustainable growth in the future. And I think it's important to consider that we make investments in our businesses, really focused around our ability to grow and that confidence in the growth in those areas.", "I\u2019d say a great example of that is revenue at OptumHealth in the first quarter grew 18% year-over-year. And OptumHealth earnings grew 11%, while we made strategic investments across the platform, including Medicare deliveries significant growth in house call care capacity and implementing new behavioural clients. And as Larry alluded to as we think about the diverse portfolio across Optum, including margin expansion in Insight and Rx, we expanded overall Optum margin by 40 basis points while making the investments that I just described in OptumHealth; so that we think about it as a pretty seamless approach to driving investments in the businesses where we see growth and being able to drive overall earnings growth as well broadly across Optum. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Mike Newshel", "Can you give us an update on M&A and new contracts internationally, looks like you just got regulatory approval for another small provider acquisition in Brazil and there are potentially some more assets there for sale. Are you looking to do more deals, and what's your focus in terms of provider versus insurance assets? And second is there any update on international opportunities on the Optum side as well, and UK in particular? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. We\u2019ll start with Dave.", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. Thank you, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. As you have noted, we have been somewhat active in Brazil and we have been over the five year duration that we\u2019ve owned Amil, which we now refer to as UnitedHealth Group Brazil; constituting Amil the benefits business, Americas Servicos Medicos which is our healthcare delivery business and then Optum as an emerging services business there as well.", "We of course have and we\u2019re very curious about M&A broadly across our business. As you know, we don\u2019t comment specifically on individual targets, but we do see broadly across our business M&A as a way to continue to invest the very strong cash flows of this enterprise. And I would suggest you that our interest are primarily in the Optum services markets, as you see us, particularly investing in OptumCare. And then we do have interest in select very thoughtful capital deployment and international markets, as well as some plug-in work that we'll continue to do at UnitedHealthcare overall. So, that\u2019s what I would suggest you our priorities.", "Mike Newshel", "Okay, thank you.", "Larry Renfro", "This is Larry. I'll comment on Optum, and what we\u2019re doing in the UK. So it's something that would just relate to in the United States we always talked about 75 market strategy. If you are in the UK, we would talk about a 44 market strategy. And they have developed a mechanism that they call strategic transformation plan. And they have linked together their trust and their trust would equal their hospitals. And so they have multiple hospitals that are in these SPPs as they call them. So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs. And that\u2019s where you're going to manage with an ACO process, and we do have physician groups.", "And so we\u2019re tying in everything we do in the states into that win that we just received. Now, it\u2019s a first phase of it, we have about two more that are very, very close to have an a decision on. And doing that, we strengthen the leadership then we\u2019ve moved to a couple of people over so on and in order to manage this the way that we\u2019ll need to manage this, going forward. I would say that we\u2019re still in a situation, nationally. I look at the -- those 44 SPP is more local markets. But nationally, there are various things going on with data and information and digital that we are actually working with them very, very closely right now as well.", "I know in the May timeframe we\u2019ll have a showcase where we\u2019ll showcase all of our technologies, as well as we\u2019ll have the Secretary of Health visiting us here in the States as well as a subset of the NHS board visiting us here in the states in the May timeframe. So things seem to be breaking a lose right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Christine Arnold", "Let's ask about OptumCare and SCA. How much overlap was there between the locations where you've got primary care and your urgent care with SCA? And where are we in terms of innings in terms of building out OptumCare, do we feel that we need more specialists? How do we think about the progression of that business and how do we measure it overtime?", "Andrew Hayek", "This is Andrew. Appreciate the question. So in terms of overlap with the SCA and OptumCare markets, about 17 of the current OptumCare, primary care markets overlap with where SCA is. And SCA adds another about 17 markets that OptumCare positions are not in that are material MSAs. In terms of the mix of primary and specialist, we do see opportunities to leverage the presence we have with primary care. It\u2019s the relationships and brings more of the SCA model in to the benefit experience cost and the quality of care, which obviously helps the primary care groups and also helps our health payers and health system partners. So we do see opportunity to expand the model and be inclusive of more specialists, which we think inners to the benefit of the patients and the healthcare system.", "Christine Arnold", "And when will it take to build this out?", "Andrew Hayek", "Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s multiyear. Christine, you remember we\u2019ve talked about this in let\u2019s say 75 markets is a first priority. And while we have a presence in many of those markets that presents isn\u2019t complete where we really have the the entire model represented in that marketplace where that model has been fully integrated. So I would say we continue to be in the very early stages of what our ambitions might be around OptumCare.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Gary Taylor with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Gary Taylor", "Just had one, fairly precise question. I was wondering when we look at OptumInsight. What percentage of the total revenues or Medicare Advantage risk coding services, what percentage of its net external sales would be in a risk coding services? And has there been any impact on the trajectory of sales given some of the recent legal scrutiny?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'm not aware of any change in that, and it's not really that significant. Do we have an answer to that?", "Eric Murphy", "This is Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumIsight. We haven't seen any impact in terms of changes to both our existing business, as well as the strength of our pipeline. And I think we're in a very-very favourable position in that side of the market, just given the comprehensive nature of the capabilities that we bring to the marketplace with the integration of both risk and quality.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And it's not that big a line up of offering relative to the total of Optum. I don\u2019t know if we can size that, but it's just not that large, the product line.", "So, thank you. Thanks for your questions this morning. And we hope the discussion has given you a sense of the optimism we have for 2017-2018, and beyond. As I think you can see our businesses are growing and we're providing increasingly differentiated value to a more diverse set of markets than others, and we're building deeper relationships with customers, consumers. And I think most importantly improving the healthcare experience essentially for all stakeholders, and I think that's how we'll continue to grow over the next decade, So thank you and we'll see you next quarter.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 18, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning to review our first half 2013 and the longer-term future we continue to build at UnitedHealth Group.", "The performance of the quarter and the first half of this year reflect many of the themes we are focusing on with intensity across UnitedHealth Group: growing by serving more people with higher and more consistent quality with compassion and a better, more modern and personal consumer experience; making health care more affordable by enabling the health care consumer, the care provider and the system itself to become a more effective system of health and wellness; advancing the performance and value of this enterprise for shareholders through operating and capital disciplines in both growth and strategic diversification, as well as dividend and share recapture.", "We see several of these elements in our first half performance in a number of ways such as the consistent, broad-based growth across each of our market-facing business groups; medical cost trends that have remained in check and will help to keep health benefits affordable; the increasing pace in product innovation and adoption as nearly 6 million consumers now embrace our incentive product design and our rapidly growing portfolio of consumer tools; the rapid acceleration of deeper and more integrated performance-based payment relationships with care providers that will reach above 25 billion by this year end; and the increase in our dividend to more than $1 billion annually even as we sustain $3 billion in share buyback.", "We have a great deal more to do. We are far from performing to our potential. Although we are seeing steady advancements on many fronts, we are redoubling our commitment to consistent execution in the core fundamentals of our businesses. We are determined to accelerate the pace of innovation and the adoption of simpler and more modern approaches and technologies and ever better approaches consistently delivering higher-quality care and access and to make health care more understandable and affordable for both the individual consumer and for our society.", "Our performance in the first half of 2013 was characterized by this growing business momentum, continued service expansion and diversification across the enterprise.", "In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.40 per share, up 10% year-over-year with revenues over $30.4 billion, up 11.5% year-over-year. As expected, the consolidated operating margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 30 basis points as the consolidated medical care ratio increased to 20 basis points to 81.5%, reflecting our continued strong growth and diversification into government benefit programs. And accelerating growth from our services, international and fee-based businesses produced a 90 basis point rise in the consolidated operating cost ratio to 15.9%. The level of services growth has become so meaningful that it continues to outstrip steady efficiency gains from our multi-year initiatives enhancing quality, simplicity and system-wide productivity, as well as our concentrated focus on cost management across UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group.", "While this ratio has increased, it remains largely a reflection of the ongoing growth and diversification across UnitedHealth Group. Cash flows from operations were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.5 billion through 6 months. We decreased our debt-to-total capital ratio by 160 basis points during the quarter to 34.6% at June 30 and ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in available cash.", "Last month, our board increased our dividend by 32% to an annual rate of $1.12 per share and renewed our share repurchase program with a fresh authorization for the repurchase of 110 million shares. These decisions reflect confidence in the strength and consistency of our underlying earnings and cash generation capacities into the future.", "In the current quarter, UnitedHealth Group continued its pattern of steady, consistent growth and market share gains, and we see more growth to come in the next few years in areas such as commercial and consumer benefits through public and private exchanges, Medicare Advantage, state Medicaid expansions, Medicaid long-term care, dual-eligible MMEs, military and veteran benefits and services, the emerging Brazilian market and the continuing maturation of Optum's broad range of services for consumers, care providers, payers and other participants in the health system as a whole.", "Let's review second quarter business results, starting with UnitedHealthcare where the story remains one of remarkable growth and continued market share gains. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has been the fastest-growing health benefits company, increasing the number of people served by more than 9 million. This includes more than 2.9 million people in TRICARE and another 4.7 million people from Amil in Brazil, both new markets for us. Overall growth has been driven by offering distinct and innovative consumer benefits and services shaped to respond to local market needs and affordable price points for consumers.", "UnitedHealthcare has designed a comprehensive system of capability that aligns modern, incentive-based benefit designs with easy and convenient consumer empowerment tools that engage effective clinical care wellness programs, which in turn channel naturally into incentivized, performance-based care delivery access. This aligned system leverages better informed and incentive consumer and care provider behaviors to produce sustainable cost and performance advantages and deeper, more innovative relationships with consumers, care providers and plan sponsors across all market segments. Effective incentive alignment with consumer benefits through the care provider rewards is a critical component to sustainably improving broader accountability and effective payer to care provider integration.", "We are the market leaders in consumer value plans with nearly $6 million high deductible or consumer incentive plans in force. We are leaders in consumer transparency tools with innovative mobile applications that enable effective use of information specific to each consumer. We're further along in value-based care provider contracting than any other company and our pace is accelerating with more than $50 billion in accountable care performance contracts expected by 2017, if not sooner. These programs offer varying levels of integration with care providers, depending on their ability to affect health outcomes and assume financial risk. Year-by-year, these programs are helping transform how health care is delivered, paid for and rewarded.", "This quarter, UnitedHealthcare's organic growth was led by the initiation of services for TRICARE in the West region for 2.9 million members in the military and their families. This is the first time this contract has moved to a new service provider in more than 15 years and we encountered challenges as we engaged in this complex and massive transition. We have learned from these initial challenges and regret any disruption this may have caused to men and women we are privileged to serve, and we're deeply grateful for the collaborative working relationship with the Department of Defense, the TRICARE Management Activity, the TRICARE Regional Office West and the surgeon generals of the respective services, the military treatment facilities and their fine leaders.", "Having quickly advanced from these initial challenges, we remain committed to consistent excellent service and the value of innovation in going forward for these programs.", "UnitedHealthcare's Employer & Individual business added a net 235,000 people year-to-date and is performing strongly across-the-board. Growth continues to be strong across the government benefit markets as well. Through the first half of the year, UnitedHealthcare remains the largest, and once again, fastest-growing Medicare Advantage participant. And Part D and Medicare Supplement both continued to perform strongly. Medicare Advantage products have grown to serve 355,000 more people through the first 6 months, and our full array of Medicare product offerings has grown to serve over 1 million more seniors this year.", "Medicaid growth stands at 110,000 people through the first 6 months despite a divestiture impacting 60,000 people earlier this year. Care for chronic and complex populations remains a distinctive capability for this business and a major forward growth driver with recent awards to serve long-term care and dual-eligible beneficiaries in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Washington State.", "For the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare generated operating earnings of $1.9 billion with solid contributions from all businesses. The commercial medical care ratio improved 10 basis points year-over-year. We are performing slightly better on outpatient costs despite the continued migration of clinical services from inpatient settings. We continue to experience lower hospital inpatient usage as we expected, and inpatient costs are in line with our projections.", "Overall, 2013 full year commercial cost trends are tracking in line with our initial projections of 5% to 6% with unit prices remaining a core driver of increases.", "UnitedHealthcare's results include Amil, which is now 90% owned. With Amil, our international business has grown to serve 260,000 more consumers in the first half of the year, remain solidly ahead of its growth and financial plans for the year and is well-positioned to continued growth and market share gains, driven by its distinctive market offerings and clinical engagement model.", "We continue to be gratified by the growing response to Optum's market-leading offerings and capabilities. Each of Optum's businesses posted double-digit top line gains. And overall, Optum revenue rose 21% over last year. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 6.1% despite the increasing mix of pharmacy services revenues. As of today, we are more than halfway through our pharmacy migration. And since January 1, OptumRx serves a total of about 8 million new consumers, including these migrations and new business.", "For the first 6 months of the year, total Optum operating earnings rose 80% to just over $1 billion. Optum's strong first half 2013 performance is proving that the broader health system and its constituencies create a natural end market for services, a market we have sized at more than $500 billion annually.", "Historically, this market has been fragmented and served primarily by smaller single-point solutions. We see the opportunity to bring together the services and capabilities we offer and provide broader, more integrated solutions to larger, more diverse clients while continuing to deliver even more effective stand-alone products and services to our traditional customer base.", "We are focusing our investments on roughly 10 product families and freeing up resources through this more disciplined focus and the related productivity gain to fund further development and innovation on behalf of the clients and consumers we serve. These actions are driving stronger and more consistent margin performance across all Optum's businesses.", "The collective performance of our diverse UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses ultimately comes through in UnitedHealth Group's strong overall results. As we indicated earlier in our commentary, UnitedHealth Group consolidated revenues grew 11.5% and net earnings grew 10% to $1.40 per share in the second quarter.", "We expect full year 2013 net earnings in the tighter range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share. Our second half earnings performance will benefit from the timing of Part D earnings and contributions and Optum's continued performance gains. Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this year. We already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders, and our recent dividend increase now puts us in an annual dividend payment pace of more than $1 billion.", "Looking forward, our outlook remains consistent, strongly positive in the long term with familiar near-term challenges coming in 2014 and 2015 as we indicated last quarter.", "We expect pressure on the pace of revenue growth next year, given both rate and membership pressures in Medicare Advantage. We see further business and product integration advances, further medical affordability gains and intense focus on driving lower operating costs to improve and sustain our competitive positions serving key health benefit markets and continuing strong cash flows.", "The next phases of the Affordable Care Act should bring growth and expansion in the Medicaid business, as well as to Optum and some meaningful financial challenges as well. For instance, on the Medicare side, the challenge is intensified meaningfully and include nondeductible taxes combined with the continued significant underfunding of Medicare Advantage. We remain committed to Medicare Advantage as the most valuable and fastest-growing Medicare benefit offering available to American seniors.", "By 2016, Medicare Advantage will, in effect, be reimbursed at parity with original Fee-for-Service Medicare. And at the same time, it will continue to deliver better benefits at lower costs because of effective medical cost management and far better consumer-focused services and technologies, none of which are present in the current Medicare Fee-for-Service system.", "2016 should represent a final baseline pivot for Medicare growth for years to come, and America's demographic trends are compelling. Well more than 3 million people will enter Medicare each year, and UnitedHealth Group is uniquely positioned to emerge as the market leader. These long-term growth trends informed our approach to our 2014 Medicare bids, which will remain under review by CMS through the summer. Our decisions for 2014 focus on balancing program sustainability, margin protection and cash flow generation of our MA business measured on a long-term multi-year basis. We are aggressively and consistently addressing the operating and marketing costs of our Medicare programs without compromising the exceptional support and services we offer to the seniors we are serving through these important benefits.", "The depth of the underfunding of these benefits to seniors is causing us to exit certain market areas, reduce the number of plan offerings and reduce benefits in the majority of the local markets we serve commensurate with our review of the competitive position and long-term sustainability of our services for each individual market.", "We are shaping our networks to ensure we are delivering health care with local care provider partners who deliver high-quality care and provide a sustainably low medical cost structure and to increasingly share in the results of collaborative efforts to bring greater quality and consistency of care to seniors, including the most elderly and those with chronic conditions.", "These steps can be expected to moderate member growth in 2014 in contrast to our strong growth experience over the last few years. We will engage our members further by increasing our use of in-home health reviews and in-home services. Even with these actions, we expect pressure on 2014 Medicare Advantage margins. The severe underfunding of the MA program for 2014, combined with the ACA tax impact and continued sequestration effects are too significant a burden to ask seniors to bear alone and still expect this important franchise to remain attractive to them.", "Beyond Medicare Advantage and some remaining unknowns focused around ACA implementation in the individual and small group markets, we expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's performance for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our commercial benefits, international, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform well. Optum will continue to grow strongly and contribute comparatively more of our overall performance as virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue on that path.", "We will continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital, continuing to balance investments across our businesses and returning more capital to shareholders in both dividends and share repurchase.", "From 1999 through the end of 2013, we have returned more than $40 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase even as we have grown and enriched the capabilities, the market positions, the value and the forward potential of this enterprise.", "We remain optimistic about our capacity to serve society and to create value for the people and customers we serve as well as for the health system at large. And we look forward to an expanding discussion of our strategy, growth and performance at our investor conference, which this year will be on December 3 in New York.", "As usual, this morning, we have a full complement of leaders here and would ask the operator to open the call to our questions. Only one per speaker, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to just ask a little bit more about Medicare Advantage. You made a comment, if I heard it correctly, about final baseline EBIT in 2016 as a base for growth once we're fully at parity. Did I hear that correctly? And do you -- are you implying that EBIT is -- in Medicare Advantage is down from -- on a downward slope in '14 and '15 and then normalizing in '16 and growing from there?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, well, I'm glad you asked the question because I don't think that if it went out that way, that's not what our intent was. Basically, continued funding pressures, some of them mechanical, the impact of the ACA and so forth will continue basically to get the funding mechanisms for Medicare Advantage to be at parity with Fee-for-Service. Once that funding is leveled at that basis, the programs are thought to then be neutral to each other from that perspective. And therefore, one could expect, given the strong performance of the Medicare Advantage program, that the growth could even accelerate from that point because you've got this significant demographic trend. You have a very attractive program, and the Medicare Advantage program will still have meaningful advantages in terms of benefits, medical management capacities, consumer engagement and relationship capacities that the Fee-for-Service system simply doesn't have right now. So that's why I think our outlook on Medicare Advantage in the long term is so positive because, in essence, we have to navigate through these next couple of years where some of the mechanical funding actions will take place. But even in those periods and those have been, in my view, in effect, Medicare Advantage has continued as a broad national program to prosper and grow. So I don't know how it will play out in 2014 and '15 as these elements play in on the funding -- to get funding in essence to neutrality. But from 2016 forward, that neutrality should then baseline this program and it will be Medicare Advantage with its, I think, compelling advantages compared to the Fee-for-Service system. And we think the prospects for growth after that are quite compelling. That's really what we tried to get across.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that makes sense. You also characterized, in terms of next year, that the impact would be to moderate member growth for 2014. Do you imply by that, that you do expect growth but it's just at a slower rate?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, we really didn't comment on that direction. What we were intending to say is actions that we are taking to make sure that program is competitive and viable in as many markets as we can possibly continue to advance in. So along those lines, we outlined a series of steps that we're taking that maybe Jack Larsen wants to count on that. But again, we are focused on operating that program to its maximum potential in serving as many American seniors as we can through that program and making sure that it continues to perform in terms of growth, margin protection, cash flow attributes, et cetera, and to maximize the performance of the program, recognizing the funding pressure that's on and recognizing that there might be limitations to how much seniors can actually bear the underfunding actions that are being taken with respect to the program. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Thanks, Steve. I would just add maybe a bit of an exclamation point on some of the changes that we're contemplating for our business next year and I think Steve went through them well. We're looking at benefits. We're going to be adjusting our -- planning some market withdrawals, I think, at a more modest end, perhaps 5% or so, with most of those members having an opportunity to enroll in another UnitedHealthcare plan. We'll be narrowing our networks consistent with achieving better cost, better outcomes and better management of our stores [ph]. And Matt, we haven't really seen how our competitors are taking to all these, too. So I would say, at this distance, I think the only thing we can really say is that our performance at the membership growth line is likely to be more moderate compared to the last couple 2 or 3 years where we have grown very well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First, just wanted to check and see if there's any updated view you can share with us on 2014 EPS growth overall.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, Justin, we thought that question might come up. We don't really comment on next year's guidance in the current midyear quarter. I would say that with that said, earnings growth is clearly our focus for 2014 and we are intense about that. But we have to recognize that there is a great deal in front of us to achieve that. As we just mentioned, certainly strengthening Medicare Advantage given the significant 2014 funding shortfall and the steps we need to take to make sure that program continues to be vital is on the front of the list of that. There's also ongoing work in the commercial markets, with pressures on our own individual business, the continued market migration to lower price point insurance products and fee-based conversions. And those are all occurring kind of in the backdrop of a normal competitive dynamics intention. We remain respectful of medical cost trends despite the success in keeping trends in check, and particularly, given the measured economic recovery. We need to make continued investments in Optum in the emerging categories of private exchanges, Medicare risk and revenue cycle, house calls, ever larger and longer-term care provider relationships, Optum cloud products, and in general, we are committed to continuing to fund ongoing innovation and adoption. And then last, we want to think about headwinds. Investment income, we'll see probably short-term pressure as current portfolios actually turn over and transition from kind of capital gain realization mode into higher-yielding portfolios for the longer term. So with that series of headwinds in front of us, experience has taught us to be somewhat cautious and to be sure we consider and respond to these headwinds before we offer a sense of 2014. So we are not prepared to do that, but I would say we are intensely focused on solid earnings growth for 2014. But we have to work our way through that as we stand really in the mid-year of '13.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then my actual question was more of just a follow-up on Medicare Advantage. Just to make sure I'm clear on what you've laid out here is you felt like 2014 and '15 are looking like a -- obviously, you're going to be under pressure. But by the end of 2015 going into '16, do you expect that '16 growth to reaccelerate and you feel like you'll still, after all this pressure, given what you're doing from a cost perspective and managing, you're going to have -- and you feel like the benefits that you still have left out there for seniors after these costs will still be enticing and you expect growth to be in line with what you've seen over the last couple of years and potentially even accelerate? Was that a right -- was that the correct takeaway?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think you generally have it correct. I think you may have a more precise notion of it than we would having to operate the program. So I can't tell you that on January 1, 2016, that there will be some kind of a light will go on, et cetera. But you have exactly the direction of our thinking on this program correctly. That as we navigate through the next couple of years and the pressures that, I think, are well acknowledged on the program, we intend to operate it in a -- in such a way that we are maintaining the vitality of that program, protecting its margins, maintaining the vitality of its benefits and its distinctions to consumers, to seniors that need these programs and that we think that, as you reach that point of neutrality, which is about 2016, that the growth dynamics of that should accelerate, yes.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And so do you see the program will be bigger than it is today or not -- or smaller than it is given the -- given what's facing you when you get to 2016? And that's it for me.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That's the third installment of your single question. Obviously, Justin, from that discussion, we expect in the long term that the needs of the American seniors and what the values we can bring to the Medicare program suggest that is a very strong long-term growth platform.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on Medicare Advantage again and make sure. I understand what you're talking about in terms of reimbursement and the pressures in '14 and '15. But when we think about the business near term, particularly fourth quarter this year and how you market to seniors, will you take your foot off the accelerator somewhat in terms of marketing, or do you think you have to accelerate the spending this year to maintain what you have and potentially grow? And just if you could give us any context on how the suspending might change year-to-year, that would be helpful.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I might offer -- take it at my level that how we're going to approach and deploy resources to the market from a marketing point of view at this point in time is really a little, I would say, a level of competitive intimacy that I'd rather not share. I would say that our commentary was more along the lines of the fact that we are going to be shaping networks to be more focused, to really focus on the high-performance assets as it relates to seniors, that the benefit reductions that are fairly broad based, those are the elements that I think will play into more conservative growth prospects for '14. I think that getting into what our marketing plan is, might be a little bit more than we would like to get into this morning.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe I'll switch gears a little bit. There's been some developments, obviously, around the ACA since we last had you guys on the conference call, the employer mandate delays, some documentation delays and then we've also gotten some information on the exchanges in some states. I know you said you'd be opportunistic, particularly around the exchanges. Can you comment about, A, does any of those developments that have occurred in the last few months change your perspective on those opportunities that are available to you maybe looking out next year and beyond for the ACA?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think I'll have Gail and Jeff Alter kind of comment on that. I would just say, again, like to calibrate the perspective we're bringing to it. Long term, we're positive with respect to those channels as they form and as they became areas where we think we can participate and add value. The near-term dynamics are more challenging for us and maybe that's specific to our particular profile of business. So near term, we have tended to be more cautious with respect to those, and I think generally, the elements that have been occurring reinforce those tendencies.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. I think Steve hit on the core principles. We've been, I think, modest in our participation in the exchanges. But I think the biggest story, quite frankly, is there is significant change going on across the overall commercial markets. So as we think about our business, we're focused both inside and outside of the exchange around affordable benefit offerings for our consumers. So what we're talking about in terms of our network and our intentional integration of product, clinical and network strategies is really core to both what we're doing inside and out of the exchange. We're participating in about a dozen exchanges as you can see from what's been publicly disclosed. And quite frankly, at this stage of the game, we've kept a very disciplined process around that. We think that there is a huge opportunity over the long term, and we're going to participate to learn in those exchanges. In terms of what's happened on the overall reform implementation, at this stage, we're preparing our business. And as I said, much of what we're doing, we're doing for both inside and outside of the exchange because we think affordability and consumer engagement are probably the most critical pieces.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just wanted to understand a little better this year's guidance. You guys reported a quarter, which beat at least consensus numbers by $0.15. But it looks like you're only raising guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. So wanted to understand a little bit how you thought about guidance. Is there anything that you thought of, in the back half of the year, that might be a headwind that maybe you weren't anticipating before, that maybe the market wasn't anticipating?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't think so, and I might have Dave comment on that. But in essence, we tend to operate within a range and feel comfortable in that range. I think excessive precision here is -- time has taught us to be careful about that and to, in essence, be prudent with respect to the guidance that's offered. I would say that the performance of the business has been strong through the first half and while there is -- the orientation of the business was more challenging to the second half, we are pretty much on course and had -- saw no reason to do anything other than tighten again the range of guidance.", "David S. Wichmann", "Right. So Kevin, it's David. If you kind of parse through this, the range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share suggests that the second half of the year will not only be stronger than the first half of this year, but also stronger than the comparative half year in 2012. And as we kind of commented on in the first quarter, that's largely due to the change in the seasonal pattern of Part D revenue and profit recognition. While -- Steve had it right, there's very modest pressure, additional pressure, on the back half of the year, I think we've already pointed some of these out. But just to keep in mind, obviously, the last half of the year has 2 quarters of the sequestration impact versus the first half of the year, we're only having one, as an example. And then, of course, as you also see, we have an uptick in a run rate of our growth patterns in the business as well. So that requires some investment, not only in terms of selling, but also in terms of implementation. And then Steve did mention the near-term impact on the higher interest rates than the impact that they have had on our ability to recognize the extensive capital gains that we have in the past. And then the last thing I'd just point out is our tax rate will return to 36.75% level for Qs 3 and 4, which will comparatively impact earnings in the last half of the year.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. But I guess, except for maybe higher interest rates, none of those sound necessarily new, like new headwinds per se?", "David S. Wichmann", "No, I was just trying to give you some...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "No, I just think we're just trying to establish a prudent, balanced, I think, consistent with what our posture has been for the last several years. And the businesses continue to perform well and Optum, in particular, is having a very, very strong year. But we didn't really see a need to change the guidance other than to tighten the range given the fact we only have a half year left.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just taking a look at the SG&A changes. It came a little bit higher than what we were looking at. I think you were up 20 basis points. The ratio was up 20 bps in the first quarter and now up 90 in the second quarter and I see the TRICARE piece of it. But I'm just curious what's driving that? Was there sort of -- was there any discretionary spending, any acceleration of planned spending that you thought would be coming? And maybe within that, if you could just give us a baseline to start with the TRICARE revenue contribution, that'd be helpful.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Dave, you want to respond to that?", "David S. Wichmann", "Sure. So the operating cost ratio is up 90 basis points year-over-year. It was very much in line with our expectations for this quarter. We mentioned in the script that there are several things contributing to that ratio, predominantly related to business mix changes. As you know, we had one large funding conversion from risk to fee in the first quarter. That obviously will continue to impact us throughout the year. We've also added Amil, which has a higher SG&A ratio. And obviously, we didn't have Amil in the second quarter last year. TRICARE, of course, fee-based contract as well as continuing costs of implementation through the second quarter, again not in place last year. And of course, Optum is growing very quickly, and of course, most of that business is service-oriented and fee-based as well. The only thing I'd point out beyond that, which is all in the script, really, is there's continued cost of implementation for CPCA [ph], ICD-10, the TRICARE implementation and the PBM migration. Those are all items that are inside our numbers for the second quarter and those, for the most part, associated with improved growth prospects for the business going forward. So we're pleased to make those investments. The last thing I'll just say is that, as indicated in the script, is that, obviously, all these things have offset what this management team has done over the past several years. But in particular, in the last year around cost containment efforts and done a very nice job advancing the productivity of the business and really muting the impact of this mix shift on this operating cost ratio.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. I was looking, Dave, more just 1Q increase versus 2Q increase. It looks like there was just sort of a pickup in the second quarter. I understand a lot of the implementation costs and the funding conversion, Amil and the implementation. I know a lot of that was impacting first quarter as well. So was just curious what caused the 70 basis point increase and sort of the year-over-year in 2Q and trying to figure out if TRICARE was big enough to do that, and my guess is that fee-based business probably wasn't big enough to cause that change.", "David S. Wichmann", "Well, I don't think, if there's anything from our perspective that's out of line in there. I think it is the continued progression in mix. I think Optum continues to be a larger overall factor. And I'm not sure everybody can actually calculate the impact of that, but I think that is probably the largest contributing factor that the business -- that's all operating expenses and growing at a very solid rate. So I think it is, as we have analyzed, it is overwhelmingly mixed even the items in terms of regulatory and so forth, so basically in these numbers year-over-year and in them sequentially. So there is nothing in that, that we see out of line or outside our expectations or plans for the year other than probably an even higher level of performance on the part of our services business, which includes not just Optum, but also the fee -- the significant growth and continued fee-based businesses across UnitedHealthcare. That's where all their commercial growth has been.", "John S. Penshorn", "Josh, it's John Penshorn. Last November, we said 15.9% plus or minus 30 basis points. That range we affirm and that accommodates the accelerated growth in fee-based services Steve referred to.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you go over for us how OptumRx growth is helping the firm exactly? And we can see it on OptumRx, but some of the improvement bleeds over into the commercial side of the business. What portion is on the commercial side of the business and what portion is on in OptumRx itself? And then can you talk about the growth path of Optum Rx in 2014 and 2015?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I'll have Dirk respond to that. I mean, it is perfectly in line with the OptumRx's agenda on synchronization and the impact it has extending to the total medicals costs. So Dirk, you want to...", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes, I think, well, let's start up by talking about the business. I think if you look, our RFP volume is up a bit year-over-year. And if you look at what we see, we don't see a lot of the business changing hands across the PBM space. But what we do see we're actually getting a little more than our fair share and our retention has been pretty good. So if you look at what we try to do, we try to, again, manage total health outcomes as well as our -- as well as improving the cost of care. And we do that, as it was with our synchronization approach, we bring all the data together and optimize the overall spend. So we think that, in addition to our specialty offering in the marketplace, is resonating very well.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So that bleeds to performance for UnitedHealthcare and its businesses, and obviously, for our government programs. So it does, we think, make us distinctive with respect to medical cost trends, with respect to that section of medical cost drugs as well as a growing and vital and more diversified PBM business that we think the potential, once this migration is fully digested and we can focus our full attentions to the external marketplace, I think the growth prospects of that can be quite impressive.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you quantify for us in any way how much of the improving MLR on the commercial side comes from bringing the Optum business in house?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't -- I think that we would be -- it would be too much of back-of-the-envelope kind of response. So we'll take that off-line and we'll kind of bring that kind of thing perhaps back in the next, in our next quarter. We'll comment specifically on the impact of that. I just don't want to shoot from the hip on something like that. So I think it's a very good question and I think we'll take it that way, if that's okay with you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "There is obviously a robust conversation going on with parties in D.C. around the sufficiency of 2014 Medicare rate and how that may influence 2015 budgets and rates. Can you give us a read on what you see as the current perception in D.C. of the adequacy of 2014 rate that, initially, it seems to like debut 2014 as more positive than you view it. So I wanted to see if the perception in D.C. has changed throughout your discussions with them. And if you could give us a read on the level of their receptivity compared to previous years to the information you're presenting on where rates should be going forward.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That is a -- that would be a challenging kind of conversation to have in a forum like this. I would say this in a very constructive way, that access to the administration, CMS administration, HHS and so forth has been -- has always been open and fair and constructive dialogue and conversation. They obviously pursue a variety of protocols in establishing the rate process. It is a complicated process. It's multi-faceted. So it's not really possible to have a single conversation about elements such as that. I think our positions with respect to the funding patterns on Medicare Advantage are well articulated and supported. And there is an open dialogue about that and that dialogue is occurring, in essence, all year long. So I do think it's an environment where the parties are working together. I think there is a recognition of the role that Medicare Advantage plays in the marketplace. And I would describe the conversations as very professional and productive. And I think we would have to leave it at that. It is not what I would characterize as some kind of contentious environment at all. These are extraordinarily professional people in the administration that are trying to administer these programs in accordance with the protocols that have been established into the best of their capacities. And we are having an ongoing business dialogue with them on this subject. So I think that's all we can really comment. And that happens in states as well, in Medicaid. It's just the nature of the market.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First, just wanted to make sure I heard correct that you're planning on exiting 5% of MA markets next year. And if possible, if that's correct, can you give us a sense of what percentage of MA enrollment that represents today? And then second, separately, just wondering, has the delay in employer mandate changed or would you expect it to change discussion at all with employers? I guess, it'd be helpful just to get a sense of how your discussions are going with employers. Is there more pushback? Is there confusion? Is there concern, et cetera? I'm just trying to get a broad sense of the appetite to make changes due to ACA near term.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Let's take Medicare first.", "Jack Larsen", "Hey, Ralph. Jack Larsen. So the 5% does relate to our membership. And I really wouldn't call them market excess -- market exits as much as planned withdrawals. So about 150,000 or so of our members will be impacted by member withdrawals. But in turn, about 80-plus percent of those members will have access to another UnitedHealthcare MA product.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Ralph, this is Gail Boudreaux. There are a number of questions, I think, embedded around the employer mandate. So let me address that one first and if I get to your issues... In terms of, first, the delay of the employer mandate, we don't really think that, that's going to have a significant impact. Employers who currently offer insurance are going to continue to do that and that's been the course of our discussions. In terms of how our discussions are going with employers, there is a lot of change coming to that marketplace and the intense focus is around affordability, as I said earlier, not just on the exchanges, but across all of our customers. They're looking at value-based plan designs, getting consumers much more engaged, how they integrate clinical programs. So I'd say the real focus is around affordability of coverage and improving consumer engagement and making sure they have real value for the dollars they spend.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "The MA discussion is remarkably more bullish than I thought it would be and maybe that's why your stock is trading up so nicely because it would suggest that 2014 may not be as challenged a year as one might have thought. So I guess, the first question is, is that -- the first part of the question -- is that the correct interpretation that now that you've gone through all this, you've reaffirmed your commitment to the program long term, post-2016, which I think was the point of that discussion, that you're able to find ways to mitigate the impact on both the beneficiary and the company of what is a dramatic underfunding of MA? And then the second question I have relates to capital deployment. Given that discussion about MA, can you either -- give us a sense of where you see the most attractive segments of your market or new opportunities, be they international or existing opportunities like Optum, like commercial, et cetera, where you think are the highest, best use of the capital that you're not already returning to shareholders.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. First of all, very good observation, which I'd like to make sure we bring in-line. I think our view in terms of Medicare Advantage is really not different than we had indicated last quarter. We believe that program is severely underfunded for 2014. The comments that we're making, if you parse them are, that we are exiting certain markets, we're exiting certain plans, we're narrowing our networks across virtually all the markets, we are taking benefits down across all the markets. So those are not good things for American seniors who engage on these benefits. And those elements will clearly put pressure on both top line for 2014 on Medicare Advantage, an important program for us, and on the margins of that program. So to level set on that basis, that's I think what we said clearly. And we will work through those things. And we are absolutely intense on this program because we think it has a meaningful long-term value to American seniors and to basically the viability of the Medicare program, in total, going forward because it brings in market dynamics around the managing medical costs, around engaging consumers, around holding care providers accountable, elements such as that. That's a long -- that's placed to our competencies. It should be a strong, long-term market, so long as the program is funded appropriately. If it is not funded appropriately, then that -- those market dynamics will change. So I don't think anything has changed about that. We have just worked one more quarter through the tactics of how we will have to navigate through 2014. So to level set that, we are -- we see pressure in '14 and '15 on Medicare Advantage as a product. We're working through those. The program, in our view, has not been funded strongly in the past and '14 was very significant. It's a 750 basis point delta and what we see the cost of that program to be. In terms of allocating capital, we have a diversified model. And that strategy and diversification is a conscious one with the notion of allocating capital opportunistically across the spectrum of that diversified model. We see compelling opportunities and have in the Optum business. There are opportunities that will emerge, we think, in the benefits businesses. And we think that they will emerge over time as more pressure is brought into the overall health benefits marketplace. And we look for opportunities where we can deploy our 3 competencies around local care, market engagement, around information and around enabling technology in international settings. We found Brazil to be a compelling opportunity for that, particularly on our Optum services side. There's probably more market opportunities for us on the international side and we'll continue to look for benefits. But that is going to be probably more opportunistic because we don't see as many of those other than in Optum. I think Optum has a significant opportunity on the international side. We parse our investments based upon cost of capital return thresholds, along those lines, and recognize our responsibilities in terms of returning capital pursuant to dividends and share repurchase. So that's kind of the perspective and that really hasn't changed at all.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Right. So if I could just follow up then. If I'm going to interpret your 2014 comments, I think what I would say is beyond the challenges provided by MA, you see your capital deployment and all the other expertise that you bring to the table as providing the kind of balance perhaps to 2014, offsetting some of the negatives in MA would be the continued pace that you see in the rest of the businesses? And that the challenge in predicting 2014 for us is to balance the negative of the MA against the positives of the other business. The street is interpreting, I think, your comments as meaning flat 2014. And I'm trying to, from my perspective, I think you said balance one against the other, but you didn't commit to flat. Is that correct?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, we have committed to no position on 2014. I think beyond that, that what you're laying out is broadly the way I would -- broadly correct. And that is, we are positive about the other aspects of our business and our capabilities and we're applying them intensively to the pressure that is being put on the Medicare Advantage program that are still working through that. So we haven't declared on 2014. We are focused on growing earnings in 2014 and growing this business, that is our focus and our intensity every year. We have a lot to offer in terms of our diversified business model. And when we feel we have worked through this to the point where we can responsibly offer some direction to the marketplace, we will do that. But I think generally, you have the framework of it correct.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.", "Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "So a lot of questions on 2014. I'm just trying to get a little more clarity on commercial and Medicare in 2013 as that's the baseline for all the headwinds that you will experience in '14. So on the Medicare side, in the first quarter, you had quite a bit of deterioration in your x commercial medical loss ratio. You brought up sequestration, enhanced Part D and some seasonal patterns of first quarter pressure and so on. It seems to have eased up in 2Q. I'm just trying to understand if it's because of Part D or you've actually done something to improve your base Medicare Advantage business and the potential margin deterioration that you've been experiencing, I think, in 1Q? Or is it prior period reserves or Amil or something else?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think we'll have Dan comment on it. Clearly, Part D is a factor in it. But I think it's not the only one. So Dan?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. This is Dan. You have -- you had a lot in there. To Steve's point, absolutely, the biggest difference as you look sequentially, first quarter, second, both on a consolidated basis and in government programs and Medicare, obviously, is the Part D timing. In the first quarter, as you look year-over-year, it actually increased the loss ratio. And as you look at the second quarter, it actually decreased the loss ratio on a year-over-year basis. So that's the biggest swing item. But I'd also tell you inside of Medicare that we also have more favorable development than the first quarter and on a year-over-year basis and that's a little more concentrated in our Medicare business. And from the first to the second quarter in Medicare, we're seeing a little bit better performance on our new growth in Medicare. So those are some of the things that are influencing it with Part D being the most pronounced.", "Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "So your view of your own base Medicare business and if you can split out Medicare Advantage and Part D, do you expect deterioration from 2012 or not for the full year '13?", "Daniel Schumacher", "On the full year, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to go up. Obviously, we have the significant reimbursement challenges as well as sequestration. And then working against that is our focus on clinical management and so forth. So -- but yes, in aggregate, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to increase on the full year. As you look at Part D, our performance is strong there. On the full year, our earnings will be up and they're up in large part due to the significant volume growth that we had in Part D. And obviously, the quarter-to-quarter progression is different. But in aggregate on the year, Part D earnings are going to be up.", "Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "That's helpful. Then just the follow-up on the commercial side. You had a little bit of margin expansion in 1Q. You had cited the loss of a big, fully insured very high MLR count at the time. You're seeing a little bit of margin expansion in the second quarter. Your days and claims table have gone up by 1 day. All of you are on the hook for this tax for next year or so. Should we expect that either your reserves will strengthen or that your commercial underwriting spread gets better through 3 and 4Q as you build up for that tax burden?", "Daniel Schumacher", "On the commercial side, yes, we had a decline in our loss ratio again this quarter on a year-over-year basis. We are down 10 basis points. A big portion of that is, obviously, the large case funding conversion that we had at the beginning of the year. And that's being offset by the competitive market environment. We guided at Investor Day to a more than 1 percentage point increase in our full year commercial loss ratio. We've adjusted for that large funding conversion. And we still expect at the mid-point, about a 60 basis point increase in our commercial loss ratio on the full year. So full year commercial loss ratio guidance still in that 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think the question is really a baseline one. The commercial baseline for the current year is very solid, very strong. And it will then run into the challenges that you point out, that everybody will run into in the marketplace in '14 and '15.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you roughly quantify the margin compression that you're expecting to see in Medicare Advantage next year? So roughly, are we talking 50 to 100 basis points or something bigger than that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, well, first of all, we don't really get into margin at that level in the first place. And I think if I could do that at this point in time, we would have more to say about 2014. So that's what we're working through right now. And we have to work through them on a real basis through the specific markets. So I really can't offer guidance with -- at that level of precision, the mid-year of the current year.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, maybe ask it in a different way. If the headwind that you're talking about is 750 basis points, you talked about sort of the seniors' ability to handle adjustments to that, what would you view as being a reasonable amount that a senior could handle in terms of benefit design changes in a given year?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I have no basis to really speculate around that. Let me go back to a couple of things. If you think about it, that spread that you're focusing on, we're attacking by, in part, taking benefits down in a way that maintains the value and viability of the program. And it is -- it runs a spectrum across markets. So it's not like a universal thing. This is done at a relatively precise level market-by-market. Network shaping is also that. We have historically sponsored a very broad, very open access kind of market for our Medicare Advantage. We will be forced to narrow that. We are focused potentially on operating costs across-the-board. So those are the elements that we're really playing. And then, obviously, we are, as I said, we're operating in a way to maintain the long-term viability of the program. But my second point in there was protecting margins. The sustainability of the program has to be that it is one that returns capital. So we are protecting the margins of that program. And that is a market-by-market proposition relative to our set of assets in the marketplace, as well as the way the program is being administered by its sponsor in those markets. It's a complicated proposition, but I can assure you we are focused on closing as much of that gap as possible. And seniors are clearly going to participate in it, pursue the benefit reductions, narrower access. So none of these things, the underfunding of the program is not a good thing for American seniors who benefit from these programs. But we are trying to navigate that in the best way possible to preserve these programs [indiscernible] long term because we think it has compelling long-term growth aspects and value to the administration in terms of what it can do for Medicare.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowan.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Optum seems to be running generally ahead of expectations. Is there any change to the long term Optum objectives that you outlined at Investor Day? And you talked about international being a substantial opportunity. Where else do you see good opportunities in Optum?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Larry, you want to comment?", "Larry C. Renfro", "Christine, this is Larry Renfro. And I think you know that we put together a, what I'll call, a multi-year business plan back about 18 months ago. We call that One Optum. And when we did that, we wanted to make Optum a more potent solutions organization and we wanted to really position ourselves for the future. And at the same time, we made some financial commitments to you guys on the ROIC being 15% by 2015, a 6% operating margin by 2015 as well as doubling our operating profits so -- of 2011. So those goals that we set at that point in time we're kind of marching down the road. We are hitting those pretty well and meeting expectations and sometimes actually doing better. The initiatives around them are pretty much around simplification, reengineering, business integration. Really, the whole business alignment and we talked a little bit about the PBM. And in 2013, we have now started to pivot toward growth. And part of the growth initiative, and I forget the part of your question, is that we're trying to really have deeper, what I'd call, larger as well as significant relationships with our customers. And that's actually working fairly well for us right now as well. The other part of growth, as we've been talking about this today, comes from what I'll call new opportunities that surround us around this talk about Medicare rates and the pressure that's going on in the industry. So what all that does for us is cause us to really look for the future and we have to put certain development dollars, as well as innovation dollars in to make all this work. I would say that international would fall into that same category in terms of innovation and development. As we work toward doing a lot of these programs that we are doing today in the United States, we'll be putting them into Brazil. So we're confident that we have planned investments. We're balancing those investments with the growth, as well as cost management. But at this point in time, we would pretty much stand by the overall multi-year plan in terms of our guidance to meet or exceed the high end of the range.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So thank you, all. Once again, thank you for your interest in UnitedHealth Group today. We have had a very solid quarter and a strong year-to-date, both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and both continue to grow. Our performance trends are positive. I think it reflects in part the value of our diversified business approach and we remain intensely focused on the remainder of 2013 and on 2014 in the long-term success of the enterprise.

This morning we will review our performance for the second quarter and first half of 2007, and update our outlook for the balance of the year. ", "Today, we again have a number of our executives available for your questions on the call, after which John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, Mike Mikan and others will be available to respond any additional questions. ", "Consolidated earnings were quite strong again this quarter. They reflected as I expect the full year and 2008 will do as well, the overall strength and adaptability embedded in our diversified business model. That business model is a strategic point of differentiation and has two dimensions. ", "First, we focus dedicated businesses toward well-defined and high potential healthcare markets. And second, we leveraged three exclusive core competencies, healthcare facilitation, access and quality, the use of complex technology and the application of clinical healthcare information. ", "Throughout periods of flux, this two-dimensional portfolio has consistently enabled us to adapt and succeed to economic downturns or changing market conditions, to perform well competitively and financially, and to remain focused on enhancing quality, affordability, simplicity, and access in American healthcare. ", "Our diversified businesses help to provide the consistency and stability that enable us to deliver the strong results you saw in the second quarter. ", "Net earnings per share increased 24% year-over-year to $0.87 per share, exceeding our previous estimate by approximately $0.06. Revenues increased 6% year-over-year, to just under $19 billion. Operating earnings increased 21% year-over-year, to more than $2 billion, and our operating margin expanded 140 basis points year-over-year, to 10.7%. ", "The consolidated medical care ratio of 80.5%, improved 110 basis points year-over-year, below the low end of our expectation for the quarter. On a full year basis, we now expect the consolidated care ratio to be in a range of 81% plus or minus 50 basis points, an improvement from our previous guidance. ", "Aggregate prior year reserve development in the second quarter was a net positive $100 million compared to $150 million, for the second quarter of 2006. Medical days payable excluding AARP, were 52 days, squarely within our expected range. ", "The second quarter operating cost ratio was 13.8%, which compares favorably with the 13.9% operating cost ratio in the second quarter of 2006. We continue to make steady advances in this area. We targeted full year operating costs falling in the range of 13.5% of revenues, plus or minus 30 basis points, excluding the 409A charge, and based on our updated revenue forecast for the year. ", "Cash flows from operations as reported for the quarter were $1.7 billion. Normalizing CMS payments to the respective periods, we achieved an equally strong $1.65 billion in cash flows. This is nearly 140% of second quarter net income. ", "Our financial position remains exceptional, with the debt-to-total capital utilization ratio of approximately 28.5%, and available cash of $2.9 billion. In May, we closed on the $2.6 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and in June, we issued a $1.5 billion three-tranche bond offering, that was very well received by the marketplace. And both Moody's and S&P removed their negative outlooks this quarter. ", "Return on equity in the quarter was roughly 23%. As you know, we resumed our share repurchase activity in mid March and have spent approximately $2.4 billion through June 30. We expect to spend over $2 billion more in the second half of the year. ", "Further, we recognized some revenues earlier than planned due to the resolution of certain matters related to Medicare population eligibility and risk status. All of these relate principally to the current year operations and contributed approximately $0.02 per share, to the second quarter. These items were previously in our outlook for the second half of 2007. ", "As we said in the last quarter's call, we recognize the need to focus sharply on the fundamentals in order to continue improving performance, and we made considerable progress in the second quarter and first half. ", "Some examples: we continue to expand our proprietary care network, already the largest and broadest single network in the country. In the first six months of this year alone, we added 120 new hospitals, and 14,500, net new physicians, and other healthcare practitioners. We did so with a significantly reduced level of disruption compared to the prior year, which should translate into more favorable membership growth potential going forward. ", "We completed several high profile contract renewals including Adventist in Chicago and Kansas City, WakeMed in North Carolina, Banner in Phoenix and BOMA in Detroit. And on July 1, we initiated the marketing of our joint venture product with the West Penn Allegheny Health System, to improve affordability and quality in that region. We also have a standard contract template now in place with 85% of our doctors and 65% of our hospitals, and even more consistency and certainty in these important relationships. ", "Service performance on the legacy UnitedHealth operating platform is at an all time high. Our dollar accuracy rate on medial claims is running consistently above 99%, and we are developing and testing features for a next generation service model built for the consumer era. ", "We are excited about its prospects, even in its very early days. We continue to move forward the full integration of our acquisitions, including significant increases and resources dedicated to serving and strengthening PacifiCare's legacy operation. We have completed the in-sourcing of all our key data centers, servers and related technology infrastructure. We now have under our direct control the ability to optimize technology performance, quality and cost across our entire enterprise. ", "Let us now discuss in more detail our market groups starting with public and social markets. This area continues to be a significant growth and earnings driver for our company. We recognized that some 100 million Americans are expected to participate in some government program by the year 2016 and we're exceptionally positioned to service a strong share of them. ", "Ovations reported revenues of $6.9 billion in the second quarter, an increase of about $0.5 billion or 8% year-over-year, and down $300 million sequentially, solely due to the timing impact of Part D accounting, given the design of this program. ", "Total Ovations Medicare and actively marketed supplemental membership, grew by 40,000 members, including 10,000 in Medicare Advantage. Ovations' diversified product portfolio, including Medicare supplement, Part D, Medicare Advantage and Evercare Special Needs Plan, uniquely positions us to respond to market specific dynamics. ", "This portfolio supports by increasingly sophisticated and market leading approaches, the member engagement, targeted prevention and coordinated care. And we are getting greater traction in our clinical care and network initiatives, to improve quality of care and medical cost trends. ", "Many of these initiatives originated in Evercare and are leveraged across our entire Medicare population. The initiatives include: effective high-risk patient management efforts, such as local on-the-ground clinical resources, favored discharge planning programs, following acute hospitalization events, and targeted disease management programs. ", "In the quarter, we improved our cost structure by continuing to leverage the UnitedHealth networks for Medicare beneficiaries, and by reaching more members with our care management model. We also experienced the first year of applying our overall pricing and underwriting approaches to Medicare members acquired with PacifiCare. ", "We have been moving ahead with AARP to implement our new agreement, and continued to be enthusiastic about the growth prospects and potentials. We will be able to offer retiring seniors a unique suite of product choices that can meet their individual needs through a synchronized education, distribution and branding strategy, which will be in the market for 2008. ", "We are making significant progress in upgrading the training and certification of brokers in the Private-Fee-For-Service Medicare advantage program, as part of the voluntary agreement the industry reached with CMS in June. We intend to demonstrate compliance with the new CMS requirements in a matter of weeks and be back into the market. ", "We are also quite pleased with AmeriChoice this quarter. It was the overall membership growth leader for our company. AmeriChoice expanded by 205,000 members, including a successful launch of the TennCare program in Tennessee. At the same time, AmeriChoice improved both its operating and financial performances sequentially. Our combined 2007 revenue for public and social markets should approach $32 billion this year, $27.6 billion for Ovations and $4.4 billion for AmeriChoice. ", "We will now turn to our individual and employer markets. Second quarter net membership across this group declined by 55,000 people. The funded products were fairly stable, increasing 20,000 members overall. We were quite pleased to see our legacy UnitedHealthcare fully-insured business grow by 25,000 lives this quarter, but our PacifiCare AMS lines were down 60,000 net, as we continued the repositioning of these businesses. ", "Through the first half of 2007, we had an 81.5% medical care ratio in UnitedHealthcare. We expect the full year MCR to be in the 81.5% to 82% range. The most significant portion of this year-over-year increase relates to the impact of prior year reserves development. ", "Through the first six months of the year, UnitedHealthcare observed a meaningful swing in commercial reserves development, from a favorable prior year development in 2006 to unfavorable in 2007. We project that this will account for about 100 basis points to the full year competitive increase in the 2007 care ratio. We also have a strong orientation of larger case sizes, which naturally carries a lower medical margin in small groups. ", "Finally, net premium yields are turning up tighter than we expected, albeit within our overall underwriting tolerances. We estimate our annual net premium yield will settle out in a range of 50 to 70 basis points, less than originally projected for 2007, which reflects a larger than expected, waiting a new business with associated pursuit discount, high down trends that are greater and more competitive than we saw last year, and actions taken to increase medical care ratios in states where we project to drop below stayed minimum. ", "None of the items contributing to the increase in the full year medical care ratio are indicative of any actual overall increase in consumption in the broad health system. We have been and we will continue to price to maintain our margin in the managed risk based membership growth, in a mix as necessary to accomplish this. ", "Given the patterns we have seen and the actions we have taken, we now expect the total membership levels to essentially remain stable for the second half of 2007, for the risk and fee-based products across UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise. Estimated 2007 revenues for UnitedHealthcare are now expected to be $36 billion, as a result of the volume short fall already discussed. ", "We are improving our competitive position for our commercial businesses in two ways. First, we remain engaged in increasingly effective programs to contain medical costs, focused principally on efforts to direct people to the highest quality sources of care. Second, we are driving even greater innovation in our products, which we believe will stimulate profitable growth and attract quality membership with favorable retention prospects. ", "For example, we grew our consumer direct health plan membership by 355,000 in the first half of the year. We recently launched vital measures, a program enabling individuals and families to earn credits toward lowering deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses by meeting key health goals, which are simpler and easier to understand for the consumers. ", "Employers can realize both cost savings and greater productivity; and vital measures bring those capabilities to smaller businesses that were previously available only to larger, self-funded employers.

Aimed at the lower price point, but full benefit offering marketplace, Edge is designed to save employers up to 30% over traditional plans. We believe this product will enhance our small business offerings and compare favorably with the narrow network, respected access products that others offer in the market today. ", "For the Health Care Services segment in total, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice, second quarter operating margins increased 160 basis points to 9.2% compared to 7.6%, for the comparable prior period last year. For the full year, we estimate operating margins for the Health Care Services segment will reach 8.9% compared to 8% for all of 2006. ", "Uniprise revenue increased year-over-year by 4% to $1.4 billion for the second quarter, with an operating margin of 14.3% compared to 16.4% for the comparable prior year period. That sequential quarter decrease in revenues of $31 million, stems from the normal reconciliation for large customers that purchases benefits under our retrospectively-rated, coverage arrangements. This is offset completely by a corresponding reduction in medical costs. ", "Uniprise's current operating earnings and margins reflect increased investment in three areas, increased technology development resulting in a higher amount of non-capitalized costs to support initiatives, such as real-time adjudication, the new product features, we just previously discussed. Exante Financial Services's functionality and healthcare affordability initiatives are advancing at an accelerating phase. We are advancing the consumer service experience and other product enhancements, including the spectrum of wellness offerings introduced this year, and service advancement including the strengthening of our Pacificare platform. ", "For the full year, we now see Uniprise revenues of approximately $5.8 billion, while it is still too early to comment on growth projections for 2008. Uniprise has had several impressive new client wins, and is doing well thus far in retaining the client base. ", "In the business-to-business market, Ingenix, Exante, and Specialized Care Services again all reported strong growth and profitability. Specialized Care Services added 1.8 million unique members year-to-date, and revenues increased 17% to more than $1.1 billion. This was substantially all organic growth. ", "Net operating margin for the quarter of 18.3% was consistent with expectations compared to 19.1% in the comparable prior year quarter, as it added a significant new public sector business, which carries a lower margin. In the coming months, we will have the full launch of the re-branding of all our individual Specialized Care Services businesses, as Optum Health. This effort is designed to fully integrate and simplify the SCS experience for consumers, and to convey the increasing sophistication, breadth and value for the clinical services it offers.

Ingenix generated a 15.4% operating margin compared to 13.9% in the comparable prior year period, and rode the revenue and margin gains to a year-over-year operating earnings increase of 47%. ", "We continue to expect full year margins for Ingenix to reach or exceed 20%. Driving this growth is increased recognition by the health care industry that information and technology are essential to improving care outcome, and that Ingenix is uniquely positioned to build that critical need. ", "Exante saw a 60% growth in assets under management year-over-year, to more than $400 million, and nearly a 100% growth in electronic payments to providers, reaching $4.5 billion in the second quarter. Exante continues to gain momentum as a distinctive business for UnitedHealth Group. ", "Let me also update you on the continuing evolution of the company and culture that is coming of age.

", "For 2007, we see consolidated revenues in the $76 billion range, which reflects a further softening of membership versus -- in the second half of the year, versus our previous outlook. The decrease in our revenue outlook will be offset by a better than expected consolidated benefit care ratio, which will be 81% plus or minus 50 basis points, for the full year. We are broadening our earnings per share outlook and raising it by $0.02 on the high end of the range of $3.43 to $3.48.

We had a very strong first half of 2007, despite a number of challenges, from $0.09 over the original 2007 guidance. ", "Second quarter operating earnings exceeded $2 billion, with strong cash flows. Our instincts were right to prefer the Medicare network based offering and to be more thoughtful on Medicare privacy for the service product version, even if it costs us some 2007 revenues. We are excited about our expanded and renewed, long-term relationship with AARP. Really the most respected enterprise representing American seniors, and which will come to market powerfully for 2008. We believe the approaches that we are taking in the commercial risk market by premium designation, vital measures, and edge will put us ahead of the curve and the meaningful changes that are taking hold there.

We are able to announce today that we have been awarded the Empire State Pharmacy business for 2008, which will translate into well over $1 billion of 2008 revenues, and this is pending new contract completion, and final approval.

We are getting real traction in contract standards, clinical integration, premier designation, and pay-for-performance.

When you consider what we were dealing with at this point last year, at the same time, we were managing the first year PacifiCare integration and Part D demands. It is clear that we've put an enormous amount of difficult work behind us, achieving some important accomplishments and that our current efforts will show results in 2008 and beyond.

", "Melissa Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning. Can you walk through on what approvals and regulatory processes remain prior to being able to close this year's acquisition? And then I have a follow-up on, just a question on what was your basic share count for the quarter? Thanks. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think Tom Strickland is probably best position to respond to that. ", "Tom Strickland", "Right now we are waiting the final approval from the Department of Justice, that process is underway and we expect it to be resolved early in the fall. In addition, there are additional hearings in the State of Nevada next week and we are hopeful that the final approvals with the Nevada Insurance Commissioner will take place, again sometime within the next 30 to 60 days. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks, Tom. What were your second questions in share counts? ", "Melissa Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Yeah. What was the basic share count in the quarter? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mike? ", "Mike Mikan", "1.3, 17.6 shares. ", "Melissa Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think that was precise enough, Mike. Next question? ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Christine Arnold with Morgan Stanley. ", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. You said that the Uniprise business had several wings and you feel like you are retaining business. Could you give us a sense for how much has been completed on that, what your incoming versus outgoing RFPs look like, and some sense of net wins versus a year ago? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, we obviously can't respond to specific company names and things like that. In terms of providing, I think a good but broader response tranche bond. ", "Mike Mikan", "Yeah. Hi, Christina. I think we can characterize this year's inbound RFP activity as comparable in pattern to prior years; it is developing about 10 to 15% less than the pipeline for last year, which again was 10 to 15% below the pipeline of the prior year. ", "As we continue to see a decline in the inbound RFP pipeline, we fully believe we see all that comes to open market bid in a large client sector of that which is coming to bid a less and less is actually changing vendors a defining portion is actually moving from one company to another within that context we continue to perform exceptionally well. Our closed ratios have improved and our retention has increased over the prior year. And that gives us some positive outlook towards the 2008, effective date selling season. ", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "So, when you said your retentions are parallel to where your RFPs were versus a year ago. And how many of those have been closed? ", "Mike Mikan", "You are asking what percentage of our existing book of business went out to bid this year versus a year ago. ", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. And how much of that has made a decision and you retained it? ", "Mike Mikan", "Right, the amount of our book of business that went out of bid this year was slightly higher than past year's, driven primarily by a typical three year renewal pattern that culminated this year. Virtually all of that large case business, the large pieces of that, has been resolved and retained. So the bulk of the risks, that we had inherent in that modest increase has been retained going into the '08 of season. So, we are through the consecutive. ", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Mike Mikan", "Next question? ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Nersessian with Credit Suisse. ", "Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks. Good Morning. I just wanted to clarify the health performance in the Ovation segment. I think, you mention the risks payable that you quantified as having $0.02 impact on earnings in the quarter. But so, if I back that out, there was still a dramatic improvement in the Medicare MLR. I'm just trying to figure out how much of that is sustainable and what are the factors that are specifically attributable? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "We try to address a little bit in the script about the terms of the traction that we're getting with respect to a number of the programs that we think Ovations brings to that space, uniquely a lot of them taken from the approaches to the market that Evercare has been very successful with, as well as the use of our network access on these programs. Simon, do you want to add to that or Lois? ", "Lois Quam", "I'd just point to all factors among the range of things that are having an impact there. The first is, as you've just said Steve, is that we're now able to leverage and broaden the United Network across the country and deploy the best of PacifiCare, and the best of United in terms of our network management, first time into the full year. I reckon that we've obviously maintained a continued disciplined approach to our marketing distribution and operating costs. ", "Third, we took deliberately balance design to balance the benefit design, this being the second year which we've been able to apply our pricing and underwriting methodologies across the Medicare lives acquired through PacifiCare. And fourthly, and very importantly, we've seen enhanced care utilization and that has had a number of components, including being able to leverage elements of the Evercare model across our entire book. So, those factored amongst others means that we are seeing steadily improving performance. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "And we've always, as I think we've said to you in the past, kind of taken a long-term view of these programs, and not just a year-by-year view, and as a result we manage them in a way that we think that the profitability of these are sustainable, given what we bring to those programs. ", "Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse", "I guess my question was more, if I look at you're components of your guidance, the commercial medical loss ratio, the guidance is between 81 and 82, and the overall medical loss ratio is 81, and which would imply that the Medicare medical loss ratio would be 80%. I'm trying to figure out if that is a sustainable level for that ratio; if there is something else going on there that we shouldn't sort of project going forward? ", "Mike Mikan", "There are two important differences obviously between the medical cost experience in our Ovations portfolio and commercial portfolio, although we don't talk. The first is that we can link a significant portion of that Ovations medical cost to our overall Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, either directly by capitation or indirectly by Medicare network contract. ", "And the second is that obviously the mix of services being used by senior members differs in important ways from the mix of services being used in the commercial population. So for example, we see a more pronounced impact on our Medicare Advantage costs as a result of recent litigation and cost increases from implantable cardiac defibrillators, sensing certain counselor therapist, and treatment of [macular] degenerations, all of which would have a higher utilization rate in the seniors' population. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I would just broadly say that we have made the points throughout the year that in our diversified model, we are getting strong performance out of observation and it is offsetting to some extent the commercial business this year. Next question? ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. ", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. First question is, if you could just talk about your pricing strategy in a little bit more detail and specifically, if in the back half of the year, you are looking for higher net yields and pricing than the first half, and also expectations around 2008, if you expect higher rate increases than you are seeing in 2007. Then, if I could just ask a follow up on your leverage expectations, and are you still comfortable at 25 to 30%, would you consider moving that up higher may be into 30 to 40% range? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I will hand this question over, but instead of baseline, we take pricing actions every quarter. We are looking at pricing at all times. We are pricing to preserve our margins and to respond to the forward outlook on medical costs. So, we take these actions at all times. We have the actions at all times. We have been moving them up and we do expect to improve. And Dave, can you offer some of the background? ", "David Wichmann", "Sure. Thanks guys. Just to reiterate a couple of comments that, Steph we've made first our pricing strategy is been very, very consistent and our underwriting disciplines around that pricing strategy have been very disciplined, which focus on pricing to our forward view of medical cost trends. With your second question really related to are we looking for higher premium yields in the second half of the year and I'd suggest to you that, in the normal course of business, as we evaluate our pricing really on a quarterly basis. ", "We determine when and when not to adjust it, and in this case we have decided to adjust it up, really for two things. One, obviously, we have a modest short fall in yields relative to 2007; and the second is really just looking to 2008, which we expected to be largely the same relatively flat cost trend, year-over-year. There are a couple of items that have come forward; really in the tech agenda and also with breast cancer screening. We do expect that you will have higher day content and some other items. I'd suggest that there is going to be a modest uptick in trends in 2008, and because of all those factors, we have raised our pricing expectations for 2007. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "And your second question, Scott. ", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "And I was just more around your debt to capital comfort level at this point. I know you talked that 25% to 30% historically. Is that still your comfort level or would you consider moving that up? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think we discussed that a little bit in our last call and we have ambition to move it up, but Mike you want to respond? ", "Mike Mikan", "Yes, Scott. We believe with our diversified business model, our strong cash flows at this company can sustain a higher debt-to-total cap ratio. We're working with the rating agencies as well as our Board. Right now, we're comfortable in our range and the guidance that we've given with the 30% debt-to-total cap, and we would seek to potentially, in the future, raise that maybe to a 35% range or so. But at this point, we're comfortable with 30% debt-to-total cap. ", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Mike Mikan", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. ", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "Yes. Hi, thank you. Good morning. Let me just start by saying that, Steph, I think you're becoming CEO, is a very good thing for UnitedHealth Group. But I wanted to ask a question, if your thinking has changed about the industry at all with regard to cyclicality. But it seems to me that one of the problems you're dealing with right now, you're dealing with the tough end of cards, if you will, for the next two, three years. Would you agree with that assessment in terms of the buildup of competitive pressures, that you're seeing being markedly different from what we had a few years ago? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Actually Matt, I've always believed that there have been a lot of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. And I think we've seen those competitive dynamics become more intense over the last couple of years. But I'd say we're in the middle of those kinds of dynamics. So, you and I've never actually had a conversation about personal views of the space. ", "But I don't think they've changed from the perspective that I think, the space particularly in the commercial marketplace, has strong competitive dynamics. They are highly regional, and they are across multiple market segments. So, it is very difficult to generalize because of the meaningful segmentation. But if you're asking is there an increased intensity in competitive dynamics, I think that there has been increased intensity. But I'd say it's probably been over the last two years, and I think it continues, and I think it will continue for the next couple years, particularly given a relatively moderate medical cost structure in the marketplace. ", "We perform when there are medical cost challenges, because we really have the capabilities to deal with those challenges, since we think uniquely better than others. So, in a period of strong medical cost advancement, we've the capabilities, and the leverage and scale to be, we think, increasingly more effective, and that would be my response. ", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah, that makes sense. If I just one quick follow up which is if I pause together your guidance on the commercial involvement outlook correctly. It looks like you're looking for total commercial involvement risk plus fee days to be down slightly for the full year. And I'm just wondering, what you can point to that you think will be significantly better in 2008, as compared to this year, if it's internal or external? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'll let some others. But I'd tell you that I'm actually pretty encouraged with respect to the approaches, I think that have been taken to the commercial books of business. I think there has been a lot of fresh thinking about of the spectrum of products that are being brought there that I think there is a lot of fresh thinking with respect to specific market segmentation and I think we have a lot of opportunities to come a lot more affected in front end of our business, which is an area where I think it can be strengthen. ", "So, I think it can be more much more effective in the front end sales, marketing, local relationships, the new products that are coming to the market place that introduced we have a three major new products advancing and others are coming forward and the orientation to making sure that book of business stays vibrant and fresh is, I think very, very positive, Ken, you want to response to that. ", "Ken Burdick", "Sure. Thanks Steve. Matt, I appreciate the question. Just to reinforce couple of other points that Steve made. We've had an improvement in small business meaning that the losses have been reduced from what we had seen over the past quarters, however, we haven't seen the complete reversal. We are excited about the new product line UnitedHealthcare edge and the modernization of our portfolio. ", "We also, as we've mentioned in last quarter's call, the vast majority of the AMS and PacifiCare losses are now behind us that has cycle through. Second point would be that, our individual business has temporarily stalled that had been a source of for propound growth in the past and will be in the future. We are awaiting a couple of key markets for approvals namely, Rhode Island and California and we will be launching an eight new markets in addition to those to the later half of this year, which gives us a good right path heading into 2008. ", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "And Matt, if I can comeback and link those two if your question about view of the marketplace in total. I think that we are actually quite ahead, as you think about positioning of this book to move forward we are ahead in consumer products, we are ahead for agenda about affordability and price points on products. ", "And I think we are ahead in terms of the nature of the products that we're bringing forward and the elements that we haven't talked about, which is how are clinical engagement of facilitation is integrated with our networks and how the premium networks and so forth are tied into those products. I think that we will see over the next couple years that the actions that have been taken over the last couple years are really going to be quite productive. ", " Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Lehman Brothers ", "Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up its sounds like Steve, you said in your prepared comments that the pressure on the medical loss ratios disagree on the commercial side still relates a lot to the favorable development and those comments are very consistent with what you said last quarter, but it did sound as though included in the press release you talked about competitive pressure on renewals etcetera. ", "But I just want to reconcile that with your previous comments that said it didn't sound like you are seeing a real change in the marketplace right now. And I just want to make sure that what you are seeing in the second quarter is no different in what you saw in the first quarter or are there actually incremental change of things? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think I'm going to repeat what I said may be, you tell me whether it's responsive or not. We see the competitive marketplace, competition to be intense, but we have seen it that way. We had as we start the year we project what our net premium yield would be, and they have come in 50 to 70 basis points less than we have projected. We've as this said, we take a very routine pricing actions on that each quarter or more often if we have to. And we've taken those actions, and so we're continuing from that perspective. I don't really think that to change in our approaches. ", "Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, that's what I want. And then could you just clarify what's your comment was when you said your instincts were right about the Medicare Advantage network product? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "That we, as we really positioned as we entered 2007, and that position it takes place in 2006. As you think about the positioning of the benefit designs of the relative offerings across the Medicare space, we said that we preferred the network based versions of those offerings. But those offerings have we think greater value. They offer more potential to the recipient, and that they are more sustainable overtime because of that. ", "And as a result we orient more to those than to the Private-Fee-for-Service, and that just been our philosophy. And we think that was a good positioning because we think that the network based products have a longer-term value. Simon, do you want to offer anymore, no? ", "Simon Stevens", "Nothing more than that. ", "Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. So, it sounds like more comfort with your ability to manage the cost, and maybe a slight excitement of the potential future for Private-Fee-for-Service is that what you talk about meaning sustainability ", "Simon Stevens", "I think, that's going too far. We believe that Private-Fee-for-Services continue to be part of our portfolio for 2008. We expect it continue to grow in this product. But that said Steve as just pointed out we're not overweight or dependent on the Private-Fee-for-Services. And taking our multiyear, and multi product approaches we do, we see that our broader organizational asset including the strength of UnitedHealth network can obviously be deployed with particular advantage in our network based Medicare Advantage offerings. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay. If you just come back to the notion of networks, and the integration of care facilitation. What you can do for people with that we come back added in this, is it a cultural change in terms of what's the best for the senior for the consumer, the Medicare network based offerings have greater value, and greater long-term potential to serve the consumer, and that's why we value them. ", "Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital. ", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital", "Good morning, everyone. Okay I've one very minor question and then a real question if I may is, answer my real question first and I think get to the minor I will get that. We're focusing on the commercial business Steve, if I want to interpret your comments in your term correctly, I think I've heard you say that you're refocusing, you're reorganizing and you're repositioning that commercial business in the sense that it sounds like you've reviewed the product portfolio and recognized that significant important new products need to be brought to market as you say modernize the portfolio. I hear you also saying more about the leadership in the consumer directed side, but I guess what I'm getting at here is really two issues. ", "One, how big was the problem in commercial? How far behind the curve of keeping that product offering flexible up-to-date, customers service being what it needs to be, any or all of those important metrics. How far behind the curve might you be, because I'm getting the impression that you've lost the momentum and I'm getting that impression because your membership growth isn't all that robust. ", "So, I'm trying to reconcile that with your comments that you think that you're ahead of the curve and I'm am trying to also get a sense of whether there is sort of this renewed effort to position the commercial business, so that may be we won't have to see another year of if not membership deterioration than flat membership, but declining mix of members in terms of margins and profit dollars? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, there is a lot in that question, but in the broadest sense. First of all, I actually don't think we were behind in anyway and I don't want to create an impression like that at all. We have I think struggled with respect to being able to get a bead on commercial risk membership over the last couple of years. And I think across the industry based upon what I have observed and we do look, that has been more of an industry-wide situation and not at all unique to our enterprise. ", "What I might say it has been unique to our enterprise over the last couple of years is that, we had been more active in acquisition and when you are and you begin to reposition those books of business and I'll deal with them separately. You will have more loss and that loss will run through your net membership reporting and we do the best we can, I'm trying to separate that related to new acquisitions, because there is a refreshment of that book. ", "Most of the time those in our view need pricing potential and we know that going in. But I think to the core of your question is there, we behind in terms of product offerings or things of that nature. I don't think we are, actually we think that we are, unfortunately we will with the marketplace. ", "I think the marketplace needs to move ahead and I think we're pushing inside this organization to say, let's do what we think is right and let's put kinds of products in the marketplace, that we think the marketplace is looking for. I think Vital Measures is a good example of that. I think the edge product is a good example of that. I think the [blade] product is a good example of that. I think tighter integration of our ancillary services and engagement with our consumer services is a good example of that. ", "And I think we are pulling those things together and we are getting active in the commercial marketplace along bringing change and refreshment to that and that's why I think we are ahead. The service theme, I think we have, I believe that, a lot of that was related to PacifiCare, where I think we were more aggressive and perhaps too aggressive as we approach PacifiCare's platform, which was not as strong as our legacy. ", "We overlaid the UnitedHealth Group model on it and we've had to retrench to bring more resources back and I think that has been done. Our legacy platform, actual service this year over last has been markedly stronger and it is only going to get stronger. It is in a lot of new hands and we are taking service extremely seriously on the consumer and the provider side of it, so that needed to be addressed anyway. Am I answering your question, Sheryl? ", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital", "Yes, you're. And I guess my, this little quick question is typically when we hear about Medicare and Ovations and Evercare, we hear from Lois, is Lois okay? ", "Mike Mikan", "Lois, would you like to talk to Sheryl ", "Lois Quam", "Sheryl, good morning. Thank you for inquiring about my health. Yes. ", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital", "Okay, just wanted to make sure, you are still there. ", "Lois Quam", "Yes. I'm very pleased to have such a strong team of people to work with. And as I think, I asked Simon Stevens, who he had worked with on the international business to join the organization earlier this year and as you can see he is making strong contribution. ", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital", "Okay, excellent. Thanks very much. ", "Mike Mikan", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Peter Costa with FTN Midwest Securities ", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Hi, you guys beat the numbers you sort of raise guidance, you bragged about the diversified model that you have, you're not getting value for it considering you guys have a similar evaluation to other health insurers, and your stock down today obviously because of the performance on the UnitedHealthcare business. Do you think about tying to capture some value for that diversity that you've in someway, have you thought about doing something to capture that value? ", "Simon Stevens", "Well that's a subject. We obviously are very oriented to making sure that industries are appropriately rewarded for their interest in our enterprise. We look at various approaches to achieving that and it difficult to get into a specific conversation along those lines. I think some of the questions about capital leverage start to get at some of it. And I could only respond to tell you that we're, I think a very active organization. ", "We think, I think you can tell from our merger and acquisition activity, and I think you can tell perhaps from the way we approach capital, which I think might be a little different than others that we're active in thinking along those line. And beyond that I don't think, I can respond to specifics other than to suggest that we think that we could do better and we're focused on that. Well, that's not much of an answer, but I can't really, I don't think get into a lot of specifics on a question like that. ", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Quickly, just some clarification on the UnitedHealthcare medical loss ratio, you mentioned 100 basis points of the increase is really explained by the unfavorable development that you saw late at the end of '06. And then in the scripts, you talk about $10 million of favorable first quarter '07 development. So, I guess is it fair to assume that this late '06 unfavorable experience has completely gone? And then secondly, what's the probability of seasonal reoccurrence of this type of experience in your model? ", "Simon Stevens", "Mike, do you want to address that ", "Mike Mikan", "Tom if I get your question right or correct that the swinging prior year development that we forecast for the year is about 100 basis points, and that translate to about $300 million. We did not have prior year unfavorable reserve grew up from the prior year in the second quarter of this year. We did however have prior year favorable development last year in the second quarter similar to what we had in the first quarter. And so, the total impact for the year is about a 100 basis points year-over-year on the BCR and the net delta are the things that folks Steve and Dave Wichmann have talked about previously. ", "Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So again may be could you talk about the second half expectations for this year and I know you've talked somewhat higher level on changes in pricing and expectations on enrollment and things like that. Again, do you think we see anything late this year? ", "David Wichmann", "Tom. It's Dave Wichmann this time. So you asked two questions that I just want to make sure we close out. One is whether the \u201806 development is done or gone and we are not seeing that continue to advance. So, we believe in fact that it is. Second, with respect to whether this is going to repeat, we have taken into account in developing our estimates of 81.5% to 82% benefit care ratio or medical loss ratio if you will, the natural ware off of the deductible like we experienced last year. ", "So as you might recall during the fourth quarter of the year, we experienced a ware off of the deductible on our higher deductible or high deductible healthcare products and we have taken that into consideration. We feel quite confident in the 81.5 to 82% medical loss ratio. ", "Mike Mikan", "And I would just follow on Tom that. We believe that we've adjusted our reserve methodology accordingly, so we do not anticipate that the same occurrence will occur in this second half as it did this year from last year in which we reported in the first quarter that we missed, we don't think that will happen again. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "We will take one more question and then, through the balance of the day; John, Brett, Mike others will be available. So we would like to make sure that we respond and if you call us we will timely address the questions. But we can only do one now, so next. ", "Operator", "This morning's final question will come from the line of Charles Boorady with Citi. ", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you give us the seasonality of the med loss ratio generally for Part D this year for the four quarters? And if the guidance for a weaker 4Q this year reflects any change in the seasonality where we historically expect that to be and especially strong quarter for Part D? And so what you are baking into your assumptions for the 4Q? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "That question could take 15 minutes to answer I think. So, may be you should, we will give you a response now, but if it's not enough, we will handle it offline. Is that okay? ", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "Yeah. Really just the four quarters med loss ratios on a directional change from quarter to quarter and if the 4Q is not significantly improved for Part D is there some other reason why your fourth quarter guidance is lower than what we would have expected based on the first three quarters? ", "John Penshorn", "Hey Charles, this is John Penshorn. You know, we don't disclose medical care ratio for Part D on a standalone basis. I think we've stated clearly that the seniors businesses hurl across the portfolio of Ovations are all having very strong years. And the fourth quarter outlook that we have here we think is appropriate in total, which includes the comments that we just made about fully accommodating in our models the expectations around medical costs in some of the high deductible products in the later half of the year ", "Mike Mikan", "And we will see how that plays out ", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "Steve would you make any '08 or beyond comments that company historically talked about 15% plus annual long-term EPS growth, do you think that's achievable over the next one to three years? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Actually, I would tell you as we look at the business, I think well we've been mostly about challenges and I like what's going on. I like the orientation that this leadership group is taking. I like the way that we are approaching the UnitedHealthcare business in terms of how we're looking at the commercial space. Obviously you have to like the positioning that has been taken by Ovations. I think the state business opportunities are really quite remarkable. ", "I don't know exactly when those fall in place, and the other is that the movement in terms of the enterprise services businesses that Richard Anderson oversee they are making meaningful contributions, and they're growing at striking rate. ", "So, I actually, I'm pretty gazed up about the business and the business issues, and I will go back to the theme that said, if you could have a sense what we are dealing with the middle of last year and the progress and where we're set to be back at this moment with the opportunities, we think are in front of us and some very difficult work that has gotten behind us. ", "We're back into the business, and I think you're going to see that in 2008. I think you're going see it profoundly in 2009 and beyond. So, I'm not all backing off on that. ", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "Thanks. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks. ", "Mike Mikan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Fourth quarter results are currentlyprojected to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.92 per share.", "Seasonal increases in medical costs in the commercial riskbusiness and in Medicare Advantage marketing expenses are projected to be partiallyoffset in the fourth quarter by seasonally strong Medicare Part D and IngenixHealth Technology results.", "This would bring full year 2007 earnings to an adjusted$3.49 to $3.50 per share. This performance would be 18% above our 2006performance and substantially above the $3.40 per share target we establishedat the start of 2007.", "Our expectation for 2008 is a return to balanced growth,stronger operational execution to predictable earnings performance.Specifically, we anticipate earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.00 per share.This assumes the expected closing of the Sierra acquisition before the end of2007, and approximately $7 billion in further share repurchase between now andthe end of 2008.", "This preview of 2008 assumes revenues of approximately $83billion, including Sierra and an operating margin in the 10% to 11% range.", "Compared to 2007, operating earnings would be up around 7%to 9%, which as you know excludes incremental financing charges, and full-yearweighted average shares would decrease by as much as 7%. Earnings per sharewould be up roughly 15% when compared to $3.49 to $3.50 projected for 2007.", "Cash flows from operations would approach $7 billion in2008.

The pressures we see in thecommercial benefits marketplace, continuation of current levels of medicalinflation, as well as the opportunities we are pursuing as we continue todiversify our businesses.", "Obviously, the actual growth rate will vary year-to-year,but our sense is that this range is right for now.", "Focusing now on the third quarter. It featured strength inearnings, margins and cash flows, and a sequential improvement in thecommercial risk medical care ratio. We also saw a growth and advancingperformance in a range of business units, including Evercare, Ingenix andAmeriChoice.", "Our diversified market facing business model continued toserve us well as the year progresses.", "Operating earnings increased 16% year-over-year to more than$2.1 billion. And our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 11.5% ", "The third quarter consolidated operating cost ratio was 14%.This ratio increased 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the growingimpact of business mix, as businesses, such as Ingenix, meaningfully increasedtheir contribution to our total operating cost trends, and investments we havemade to improve performance in service and to senior business marketing, whichwe will describe shortly.", "And I would point out that operating costs increased only$11 million sequentially, so the increase is minimal from an aggregate dollar impact.", "Normalized cash flow from operations for the quarter were$2.1 billion, a strong ratio of 1.6 times net earnings and we are on track forfull year cash flows of approximately $6.2 billion.", "We repurchased $2 billion in stock in the third quarter, bringingthe year-to-date total to nearly $4.5 billion.

We made important operating gainsin each of these areas in the quarter.", "In the first instance, we continue to expand our proprietarycare network, already the largest and broadest single network in the country.", "In the third quarter, we added 20 new hospitals and 19,500net new physicians and health care practitioners. This includes retaining oradding some of the highest profile hospital systems in their markets. Recentexamples include multi-year arrangements with BJC in St. Louis, Swedish Hospital in Seattleand St. Louis in Cincinnati.", "Access to partners like these strengthens our offerings tocustomers in each of those local markets.

Over the past eightmonths, we positioned the commercial service and operation functions, as wellas our technology organization under the [Dirt Mickman] and David Wichmann,which pulls together key assets serving all of our commercial markets under twoof our best operators.", "We are also better aligning our services and responseoperations to more directly linked to the service to serve local marketsettings. We use our technology and service applications to provide moreimmediate response at local market levels, empowering our people to respondmore quickly to market specific needs.", "Finally, we are realigning incentive compensation for ourexecutives, to our front-line employees to more directly tie to our performanceon fundamental consumer and care provider services and satisfaction.", "We will be more accountable to consumers and care providers,listening more closely than ever and providing the exceptional service to theseconsumers and care professionals expect and deserve from us.", "Let me now turn to the businesses, beginning with the HealthCare Services segment.

In fact, it was the strongest AmeriChoice earnings quarter,with the lowest medical care ratio in a number of quarters.", "We expect this performance level to continue into 2008,supported by stable medical care ratios and quite steady growth. We entered the2008 Medicare selling season much better position for meaningful growth in lastyear.", "There are four reasons for this optimism, more competitiveproducts and expanding geographic footprints, great branding and improvedexecution.", "Specifically, we go to market for 2008 with generallystabled or enhanced benefits, including strongly competitive private-fee-for-serviceplans.", "We have expanded our Medicare Advantage footprints for 2008.For example, we see expansion markets for network-based Medicare Advantageofferings include Boston, WashingtonD.C., Chicago, Atlanta and Kansas  City.", "Evercare chronic illness Special Needs Plans will expandfrom seven states in 2000 to 34 in 2008. These are all states where we alreadyoffer Medicare Advantage, so we efficiently leverage existing local operationsand where our networks are broad and strong.", "From a branding perspective, we now offer the only MedicareAdvantage product that carries the AARP name. We are obviously very excitedabout both the immediate and long-term potential for this exclusive alliancewith AARP to 2014. And we are promoting this with an intensive multi-mediacampaign.", "Finally, execution around marketing, sales and enrollmenthas been meaningfully strengthened, with key investments in leadershiptechnology and infrastructure, and by the much more complete integration of Ovationsin SecureHorizons.", "For example, we have a stronger and better organized networkof contracted and certified brokers. They are more aligned, better trained andbetter paid and they clearly understand the need to deliver accountable resultsto preserve their ability to sell AARP-branded products. We also have muchgreater direct access to an oversight of their day-to-day efforts.", "We have launched our own internal agency with brokers fullydedicated to distributing our products, including individual insurance andchronic Special Needs Plan and traditional Medicare Advantage offerings.", "All products communications, marketing and enrollmentmaterials have been fully adapted for local market uses. They were into thelocal markets well before the enrollment season, which was not the case lastyear and which undoubtedly affected our results.", "We have tightened and automated the enrollment submissionprocess to drive simplicity, increase speed and eliminate potential [sourcesthere]. And we have established a command center to monitor, analyze and adjusttactical approaches daily as required.", "We are off to a strong start and we want to drive thiscampaign for the next two and half months.", "On the public market side, we are well positioned forpotential SCHIP expansion and are working to grow pipeline, a state programexpansions and procurement opportunities including Tennessee,Iowa, Missouriand others.", "Turning to our individual and employer markets, thirdquarter membership in this group declined by 115,000 people. Fee-based growthat UnitedHealthcare of 80,000 consumers was more than offset byemployment-related attrition at Uniprise and a decline in UnitedHealth riskmembership, including the 70,000 decrease from PacifiCare.", "We expect that year end 2007 membership would be slightlydown from the total for this group at September 30. Much of our commercialmembership decline stems from a conscious decision to put profitability aheadof top line growth. Achieving both was difficult in 2006 and 2007, but in 2008,we are committed to doing so.", "In 2008, we expect our commercial risk membership to declinein January then strengthen modestly quarter-by-quarter in the second half of2008. We are refocusing on the local market dynamics and the needs of thesecommercial benefit markets, which continue to become more consumer oriented.", "We have introduced a number of new innovative products tosee these changes, directly engaging consumers and making effective healthchoices and decisions.", "Specific new offerings address both consumerism andaffordability, including the Golden Rule and Definity consumer-directed productlines. United with Me, which focuses on employee activation and wellness forthe very large employers.", "The new Vital Measures product line to engage, encourage andreward healthy behavior. And the recently launched Edge product line, whichinforms and motivates people to use the best doctors and hospitals.", "This innovative package brings the market abroad, nationalpremium designated network at significantly reduce price points by usingbenefit designs to encourage consumer choice that drives cost-effective qualityand care.", "Edge will be active in 20 markets by January, with theremainder to follow over the course of 2008.", "At Uniprise, we had customers who sponsor more than 2.5million members out of market for January 2008.", "In all then we should net out to an estimated Januarydecrease of between 80,000 and 100,000 people.", "UnitedHealthcare fee-based enrollment is also expected todecline slightly in January and then grow throughout the year more thanoffsetting any in-year attrition at Uniprise.", "Participation in risk-based offerings for UnitedHealthcareis expected to be down in January, although it is too early to quantify at whatlevel. We are committed to sequential improvement in risk-based result for therest of the year.", "We see that improvement coming from four key areas: newproducts, which I just described; an expanding network; improved service; andbetter local market dynamics. We expect 2008 growth in diverse market segmentssuch as student, individual, and ethnic groups and through geographic marketexpansion such as Sierra and more effective local market engagement across theBoard.", "We expect our traditional markets to strengthenprogressively quarter-by-quarter in the second half of 2008, as new productsgain traction with brokers and employers. These products will reach marketsegments that are more price sensitive than those of our traditional productlines.", "The third quarter medical care ratio for UnitedHealthcare of81.6% improved 40 basis points sequentially. UnitedHealthcare also saw afavorable increase in per member per month premium yield this quarter.", "We continue to estimate the full year 2008 UnitedHealthcaremedical care ratio in the range of 81.5% to 82%, implying a fourth quarterratio of around 83%. This is an appropriate expectation given the higherutilization of services expected in the fourth quarter.", "For full year 2008, UnitedHealthcare is pricing to achieve astable medical care ratio, subject to normal seasonal variation.", "Our medical cost trend continues to run in the area of 7.5%for 2007, with no notable deviations in individual cost categories.", "We are projecting only a slight uptick in cost trends in2008, principally due to changes in public policy and evidence-based careguidelines and we have incorporated that into our pricing.", "There is much more to be done in this group. We are deeplycommitted to improving our performance and commercial benefit growth in overallservice levels, productivity and innovation efforts. We expect our efforts inthis domain to be evident in 2008.", "Let me now turn to the enterprise services market. Again, Ingenix,Exante and newly re-branded OptumHealth all reported solid growth andprofitability this quarter.

Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Lee Coopermanwith Omega Advisors.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Thank you very much. I appreciate it. If you go back to theold DuPont formula ROE times retention equals to sustainable growth. We clearlyare retaining much more earnings than we need to finance that business.", "And historically and so far intelligently you\u2019ve taken thoseexcess retained earnings and put it into stock repurchase. And you are really doingso in extreme, it\u2019s very few companies of your size and your history that payno dividends.", "So I guess the question I am really asking is how confidentare you that you are doing the right thing for shareholders that are notselling back their company and effectively enlarging our ownership as youbuyback stock.", "And I guess this raises question as simple as that, becauseit is pretty extreme for a company of your size in profitability, not repaying ameaningful dividend?", "Now I want to make it clear, I am not criticizing thebuyback by the way, I am just trying to examine that we sort this thing throughand at the end of the day, we are not going to be like CountryWide to spend $1 billionbuying back stock at twice the current price and now they are under capitalize.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well I appreciate the question and our perspective has beenthat in terms of capital use our first priority is to invest it, kind of in aconsistent, a thoughtful way in a multi-year basis in the business itself, toreally focus on areas of business expansion through acquisitions that bringsome strategic value or bring us the capability that we get faster or moreeffectively through a purchase.", "And then when we look at the remainder of the use of thatcapital and particularly relatively to our -- where we see the potential of ourbusiness and our valuation, we see the greater appreciation clearly dedicatedto the continued repurchase of shares and I agree completely that the cashgeneration capacities of these businesses is quite remarkable.", "And continue to see that as the most appropriate course andthat has been our orientation and less on the orientation towards dividends. Ithink that's probably the most efficient approach to managing the capital.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "And I assume if you thought your stock was adequatelypriced, you would move away from stock repurchase?", "Stephen Hemsley", "If we felt that we got to a position where that disconnectwith the market as a potential that we see in the business and we saw then inthe long-term, we would have to consider that, yes.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Okay.

So, your new long-term EPS growth target of 13% to16%, can you talk about how you think longer term that breaks down betweenannual revenue growth, operating earnings growth and from capital deployment?", "And then, maybe if could talk about the decision to changefrom the 15%, how much of that relates to the law of large numbers that you areseeing with the growth as compared to a difference in how you see theopportunities in the industry?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, I will let Mike and John talk about the elements ofit. I would like to keep that at a reasonably higher level in this discussion,because we intend to get into this in a significantly greater depth at theinvestor conference.", "So we think that's the best venue for that. I would saythough that we think that there is very strong potential and opportunity interms of our business model and the businesses that we are in and in thebusinesses that we see in a path, as we continue to pursue diversification.", "But it is impacted, I think in a significant way, by thefact that we're -- our operating earnings are approaching $9 billion. And ifyou take the long-term growth path on that given conditions we see in themarket place and the more moderate levels of medical cost inflation, which wethink will persist, that we thought the guidance was appropriate in that range.And if you want to get into just couple other broader strokes of that model.Mike, do you want to respond?", "Mike Mikan", "Scott, it's Mike. We will go through more in detail, thelong-term outlook and how we build it up. But just to give you some high levelmetrics, we expect long-term revenue to grow somewhere in the high single-digitrange.", "Operating earnings, we target on average 8% to 12% say andthen the capital accretion or the use of capital whether through share repurchasesor the like for acquisitions we think we can get around 5% accretion on ayearly basis.

Can you talk about what's causing a decline of theFee based membership? Will just Aetna and [Signa] coming back, is it serviceissues or is it geography type of PacifiCare and Oxford, what sort of reallyissues there, can you get us through that a little bit?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah I'll give you  myreaction in all, I\u2019ll add -- as such some others can predict and so forth theresponse but I would say that we need to strengthen our execution along alandscape of issues in terms of minimizing disruption in the market place. Iwould say a closer connection to local markets in local market dynamics as Isaid in our prepared comments.", "And just basically more effective execution, energies andcustomer intimacy. So, I think it is a back to basics. And execution onfundamental, and a greater focus towards customers I think our elements thatwill bring that kind of market response back in the line. Ken?", "Ken Burdick", "Peter thanks for the question. Couple of things just tobuild on to Steve, first, we continue to reposition our PacifiCare business,and that did contribute significantly to the loss of this quarter.", "We are very confident that, that work will stabilize afterJanuary of \u201908. And we got some exciting things that we have introduced in themarket place. In the prepared remarks, you heard Steve talk about the edgeproduct. We just rolled that out in September, we\u2019ve already several dozens salesas you heard in the script 15 markets by the end of this year and then 21 byJanuary.", "In the fee business, we are really looking to build on themomentum that we have gained in the consumer activation products. And we talkedabout United with me, vital measures, you probably read about some of that inWall Street Journal.", "And then, the comment that Steve made with regardingnetwork, I think needs to be underscored. Year-to-date, we have added a 190facilities and we have renewed contracts with 1,500 hospitals, most of themwith multi-year deals. So we feel very, very bullish about the stability andthe efficacy of our networks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And if you really focus, our trend performance with respectto these large cases, this year has really been quite exceptional. So I dothink it is a function of execution on basics in terms of service, accountmanagement, flexibility and customer orientation.", "And basically, some of the basics that Uniprise had usedvery effectively in their earlier years and we are basically returning to thatorientation. And I think that the market will respond as it has in the past.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "And then on the Medicare side, is thisPrivate-Fee-For-Service now a focus area going forward or was some of thegrowth that we saw this quarter from the Group retirees side, can you talk alittle bit about sort of where you expect membership growth in Medicare?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Ken, you want to respond to that?", "Ken Burdick", "Well, Peter, your right that obviously, we did seeincreasing momentum in membership growth in this quarter with 95,000 newMedicare lives compared with 40,000 in Q2. Most of that growth on the MedicareAdvantage Fund came from our network-based offerings.", "Going into 2008, as Steve said earlier, we have obviouslystrengthened our competitive position on Private Fee-For-Service and so areparticipating in 49 states. The Private Fee-For-Service has expandedgeographical coverage.", "We are of course also though heavily committed to ournetwork-based offerings and new AARP-branded Medicare Advantage product and thesignificant expansion of our Special Need Plans from 7 to 34 markets.", "So this is a broad-based approach to expanding our Medicarefootprint, recognizing that we participate in all of the Medicare productcategories and have a balanced revenue generation from those differentcategories of Medicare.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Justin Lakewith UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions, just first afollowing up on the Medicare Advantage. Last year you gave us a membershipnumber and I think it was up 150 to 175. Did I miss it this year or are youwilling to talk about what you think about for Medicare Advantage next year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "You didn't miss it at all. We just have concluded that weprefer to go through the details of 2008 itself, as well as the discussion ofthe longer-term growth in the investor conference. So across the Board, wehaven't provided specific membership guidance for 2008. We think that will bebetter done in our discussions at the investor conference.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Okay. And in regards to the Medicare AARP contract, is thereanything you can tell us as far as the changes in economics there. I believethere was a - you are going to be paying royalties on all of your HMO membersfrom beginning of the year. Is that correct?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. I think that we basically have economics attached toall of those lives, all for the full year. Do you want to comment on that Bill?", "Bill Munsell", "The obvious impact is that we are going to go to the marketwith the only Medicare Advantage product, with the AARP name. And we think thatthat will be important as a trusted brand, not just for next year but over themedium-term as well, given that this is a contracted that gives us someexclusive relationship with the AARP on Medicare through 2014.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Sure. I guess I was just curious if there was -- if you are payingout a fee for 2008 on all the existing members? Is there some break-even numberas far as the membership you need to gain through AARP in order to offset thosehigher costs, or did you may be do it to offset those costs through changes inthe benefit designs?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I don't want to get into detail of the economical side of whatwe believe over the life of this contract, this is going to make an importantcontribution to our ability to grow in the Medicare space and we believe thatthe trust embodied in the AARP and SecureHorizons names will serve bothorganizations well over that timeframe.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Okay, great. And just one quick question on the commercialrisk side, the PacifiCare, can you break out the quarter-by-quarter, you've beentrying how to break out the PacifiCare, which wasn't at a commercial risks.", "And I think last quarter you said, UNH on a standalone basishad actually grown. Can you give us those numbers for the first quarter and whatyou expect for this quarter and what you are kind of embedding in the 2008 whenyou say it is going to be down?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I felt we said that in total in this quarter, PacifiCarerepresented 70,000 of decrease of about a 140,000 in the risk-based book ofbusiness. So 70,000 for this quarter.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "And for the first of the year, can you tell me how manyPacifiCare members you expect to loose?", "Stephen Hemsley", "What, January of 2008?", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Yes.", "Stephen Hemsley", "There will be some fairly large cases that were insured andfrom our point of view not at all attractive from an economic perspective, butI don\u2019t know if we are -- that we can actually predict what the number will begoing into January and which is why we stayed away from that subject.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "And you did say that that would be pretty much the end ofthe re-pricing of PacifiCare?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave Wichmann, you want to respond to that?", "David Wichmann", "Sure. Just a couple of things that 70,000 is the rightnumber and that makes the year-to-date PacifiCare repositioning to 270,000lives, which I think is important metric.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Sure", "David Wichmann", "Leaving the underlying growth of our legacy business. So Iwant to make sure that we point that out. With respect to the large -- fewlarge case losses cases that we would have to write or rewrite at a loss, so wechose to not be as anxious for those as some others.", "So there will be some of that in there. But it is entirelytoo early, particularly given the components of that block of business fullypredict what PacifiCare losses would be for January 1 or throughout 2008.", "We caution on the repositioning of PacifiCare, this is ablock of business that at best was very modestly profitable and we have had todo a fair amount of repositioning with that business and that will continueinto 2008. And we have fully taken that into consideration in developing ourestimates.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Great. Thanks for answering those questions.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Josh Raskinwith", "Lehman Brothers", "Josh Raskin - LehmanBrothers", "Hi, thanks good morning. Two questions just on CR, I thinkwhen you guys announced it, you have said that it was $0.04 I just want tocheck if that\u2019s still the right number for 2008?", "And then just more broadly speaking on Medicare, could youjust help us understand sort of the strategy, I think some people are a littlesurprised by the bidding and I am not sure, how that came out versus yourexpectation from an industry perspective.", "But, as you think about the next three to five years, andthat new earnings growth rate, what sort of contribution and where do you thinkthe Medicare growth is going to be?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I am going to handle the CR discussion.", "Mike Makin", "Hey Josh, Mike. We are not changing our curtness or ourassumptions with respect to the accretion for CR at this time.", "Josh Raskin - LehmanBrothers", "Okay", "Unidentified CompanyRepresentative", "With respect to the parties, I mean you want to respondthat?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah. So your questions on the bidding was specificallyaround the dual eligible bidding limit, Josh?", "Josh Raskin - LehmanBrothers", "Yeah, I just think it, how you guys thought about Part Dcoming into 2008 and what was the impetus for the strategy that you guysbrought in terms of raising the bids? It didn't look like this year theprofitability was an issue in terms of the Part D and I know it's not brokenout specifically, but it is sort of curious what the thoughts were?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, let me take that in two parts. You think about ouropen market Part D positioning and then dual eligible Part D positioning. Asfar as our open market positioning is concerned, I think [DMS] just reportedthat the average Part D plan premium for 2008 will be $25 [PBM].", "We have a range of plans in Part D market including ourvalue plan that has an average premium of just $22.17. If you think about theaverage premiums on our popular saver plan, they have only increased by 6.4%over two years during 2006 and 2008.So we think, we have bought some good valueofferings out are there in the market.", "As far as the dual eligible piece is concerned, I think ourPart D group would rightly say that we have a very clear line of sight to theactual cost experience of these low income members, recognizing too that, thattends to be back left upside of mail or former incentives for this group. Andin the light of that is our usual practice, we took a disciplined approachpricing to our costs.", "So the processes what to be is in the results, what theyare, as far as the few eligibility is concerned. Although as we previouslyreported the outcome is naturally negligible to us from an earningsperspective.", "But more generally around the dual eligible bidding process,I would say that, I think the number of commentators pointed to some of thepublic policy challenges, obviously this methodology if it goes forward.", "But it does appear to be generating more restricted form ofrisk for low income than the better off Part D members, and it appears thatsome of the low income members are about to be switched to alternative plans toinstruct formally exclusively together some of the top branded medicines totheir physicians who aren't prescribing it. I don't know if that comes out withthe Part D point. If you want to also pursue the sort of general Medicare.", "Josh Raskin - LehmanBrothers", "Yeah. That was perfect for Part D, I thought I understoodthe strategy there. No, I think but your point Simon maybe more broadly, becausejust overall on Medicare where you see that in terms of growth over three tofive years?", "Simon Stevens", "Yes, well, the sorts of things that we do particularly incoordinated Medicare Advantage, we think there is going to be strong continuingdemand for. If you think Josh, for example, Monday, this week, there was awidely publicized report from the National Cancer Institute, pointing thatthere have been encouraging declines in cancer mortality at 2.1% a year for thelast number of years and that's being driven by prevention and early detection.", "If you then look at the Medicare population, what you see isthe type of programs that we offer through Medicare Advantage are exactly thosethat are required to contribute to that kind of improvement.", "Medicare Advantage in the [longer view] right for exampleare around 60% compared with 46% in Fee-For-Service, colorectal screening rateis 70% in Medicare Advantage, that was 58% in traditional Medicare.", "So the kind of clinical value added that we are bringing touncoordinated fragmented Fee-For-Service Medicare, I think is going to bevalued, regardless of the particular financing mechanism on top of thoseprograms.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And what we need to do is become more creative in terms ofdemonstration projects and initiatives to bring more ideas forward, becausethey are looking for those kinds of solutions that we have, the competency andresources to deliver on them. And that's why we are quite positive with respectto where these kinds of market can go long-term.", "Simon Stevens", "Yeah. I'd just say for example Evercare, which is now a $2.5billon company, there is absolutely no reason why Evercare can't double in sizein the next two to three years serving exactly this kind of market.", "Stephen Hemsley", "We are going to go for about 10 more minutes. So, we oughtto pick the pace on this. So, the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John Rex withBear Stearns.", "John Rex - BearStearns", "Thanks. I just wanted to focus back on the Ovations segmenta moment. I appreciate the difficult to get talking with precision aboutenrollment for '08, given that open enrollment hasn't kicked off yet.", "But with your benefits all filed for your new MA plans for'08, wonder if you can give us kind of a relative magnitude of what youanticipate for margins, or if you want to say MCR's business. They clearly,they would appear to drop out very, very favorable so far this year.", "And again, I know you don't give precision in terms of MCRson that segment, if you can give us some kind of order of magnitudedirectionally and how much you built in for cost ratio deterioration in thatbook based upon how your benefits were filed?", "Unidentified CompanyRepresentative", "Yeah, well, let me say this John. We feel about our 2008earnings prospects for several reasons, right trend and one time 2007 SG&Acosts that we are experiencing. Let me just give you a little more detail onthose. 2008 Medicare Advantage rates as we previously said reasonable which hasallowed us to have stable and strong benefits design going into 2008.", "We are anticipating stable to modestly improving medicaltrends for 2008, which in part is thanks to our seniors who direct clinicalmodel. As you know we don\u2019t act so fast regarding that was a critical corecompetent in the Medicare space.", "Wealso expect meaningful gains next year in male penetration, in genericutilization across our Medicare businesses undertaking this process off withour new Part D benefit design that effectively provides members with genericdrugs for free. It\u2019s supplied by mail and that way we are sharing these supplychain efficiencies with our members.", "And of course we will continue to be properly compensatedfor the underlying health risk for the population we serve. That\u2019s not aone-off event, that\u2019s an ongoing process. So breakthrough reasonable medicaltrend, stable to modestly improving and then as we\u2019ve already discussed inCharles question a number of one time SG&A costs that we were absorbing in2007 that we don\u2019t expect to repeat at the same level in 2008.", "John Rex - BearStearns", "So just and I just want to clarify. So would that say thatyou anticipate your medical cost ratios and M&A to be stable in \u201908 withthe\u201907 levels we\u2019re seeing?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, as you know we don\u2019t give guidance specifically on our[PCOs] and our Medicare portfolio, but I have just directed to you I think someof the factors that will drive that performance across the peak next year.", "John Rex - BearStearns", "Sure. And I guess I would step away from your commentssaying that, that kind of seem like general stability in MCRs. I Just want tomake sure I\u2019m not over interpreting your comments.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah ", "John Rex - BearStearns", "Okay. And just you made one comment on -- Steve it wasinteresting to me in your cost trend outlook. I just want to clarify on theslight up tick in trend, you are taking about policy and evidence based careguidelines. Is there any additional detail on what\u2019s driving that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Breast cancer, testing protocols, there are couple ofothers, Ken you want to comment?", "Ken Burdick", "In addition to the revision in breast cancer screeningguidelines, which means that there will be a larger number of patientsconsidered high risk and therefore, receiving MRIs.", "We've got several significant policy changes coming from theCMS, the Medicare eligibility as it relates to End Stage Renal Disease, increasingfrom 30 months to 42 months, will contribute to that up tick, as well as the MS-DRG.", "And then finally one more point that I would add is thatremoval of the generic alternative to OxyContin has been factored into our costtrend projection. And all of these things have been factored into our pricing.", "John Rex - BearStearns", "Thank you ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of MatthewBorschwith with Goldman Sachs", "Matthew Borsch -Goldman Sachs", "Hi good morning and just wanted to say first it sounds likeyou guys are doing all the right stuff. Let me ask with regard to thecommercial fee-based enrollment outlook and I understand the market pressureson the commercial risk side of the business.", "But, it\u2019s obviously huge change for you guys to be talkingabout that being down in the first quarter of next year, beginning of 2006, Ithink in the first quarter you added close to a million fee-based lives.", "Is that, looking back on it try to understand what happenedand how are you fixing it. Is that, would you, would it be fair to say thatcoming into to 2006 you had too many balls in the year in terms of large scalemerger integrations combined with the Medicare growth and did that distractedyou from some of the execution?", "Stephen Hemsley", "My believe that most of your writings have been very much onpoint on this and I would say correct, and that is we had, as we go into 2006,we had certain challenges with respect to our stock option programs and soforth, Part D was coming online, PacifiCare was coming online.", "We were driving a great deal of change within ourorganization and I think that much of that has been addressed, and as you know,you don't really see the full impact of that until it really resonates in themarket for sometime.", "And I think that you are going to see, I think there is someearly evidence of that and you are going to see continued evidence of a muchstronger, operational executional focus and base.", "I'd add to that though, a reorientation back to customerfocus and basics that I think that we can perform much more effectively on interms of how we approach the marketplace, deal with consultants in themarketplace, deal with consultant audits, deal with customers, our level offlexibility, a whole variety of areas that I think that Uniprise was wellregarded for a few years back and we are putting in place in a absolutelyvigorous way going forward.", "Matthew Borsch -Goldman Sachs", "Okay.

Good morning. Just a quick clarification and afollow-up. Did you say you are expecting a flat commercial MLR or did you saythe business that you are renewing your pricing at a flat MLR, in other worddoes that contemplate the higher cost PacifiCare business thing your re-pricingterm?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mike.", "Mike Mikan", "Would you clarify the question, what period of time are youtalking about?", "Greg Nersessian -Credit Suisse", "In 2008, I think you said you are pricing for a flatcommercial MLR.", "Mike Mikan", "Yeah, we are pricing for a stable MLR on an internal basis.", "Greg Nersessian -Credit Suisse", "Okay. So that includes the contemplated re-pricing of thePacifiCare business and the other business that you are losing?", "John Penshorn", "This is John, Greg. You've got about 10 million members intotal there. So, that may be two fine of a question. I am not sure that youwould get detectable differences either way.", "Stephen Hemsley", "But I think the answer to that is yes. And it has been as wehave worked through the PacifiCare book and that I don't know if we have realprecision over what, how many cycles it takes to really, what I will sayreposition the book business like that, may be Dave Wichmann has a view of it.But that has been running through our numbers.", "Greg Nersessian -Credit Suisse", "Okay. That's okay. Maybe I will just take it off-line. Iguess my other question was just on the earnings, the quarterly earningsprogression next year. Would you say, that this year's earnings progression isa reasonable proxy for next year and I guess, on underlying the question is thejust the change in Part D risk quarter and is that going to impact theseasonality in your earnings progression for next year in terms of thequarters?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We are not giving greater guidance with respect to 2008 andI don't want to signal quarter-to-quarter progressions and so forth.", "With respect to basic template of the business to be largelythe same, in terms of the broad make up of it next year. So, I don't want toconfirm that pattern, but I also don't want to give guidance on aquarter-to-quarter basis next year, until we have the investor conference inDecember", "Greg Nersessian -Credit Suisse", "Okay, fair enough.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of ChristineArnold with Morgan Stanley", "Christine Arnold -Morgan Stanley", "Hi, there, just one last question from me here. On theSG&A ratio, kind of, as we look into 2008, do you see opportunities forimproving kind of your operating cost ratio and continuing to see improvementthere or do you feel like 2008 is an investment year with new products,recognizing that you do have some '07 cost that will occur?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mike, maybe you want to answer that financially, and thenI'd have Dave Wichmann kind of come back, because I do think there are a lot ofopportunities in front of us.", "Mike Mikan", "A comparable mix of businesses we anticipate improving ouroperating cost ratio by 20% to 40% -- 20 to 40 basis points in any given year.And, so we believe if that to be true in next year, so we should see areduction of somewhere in that range on a year-over-year basis assuming thecomparable mix of businesses.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And Dave -- Dave has taken over kind of the broadoperations, you on an enterprise-wide basis want to comment on some of theelements of that?", "David Wichmann", "Sure, Christine. So leading that is really, productivityexpectations are improvement in productivity, which we see and that had beenable to demonstrate a year-after-year. I really look at kind of, though thereis a five primary areas of opportunity, obviously they'll be continuingconsolidation broadening in this marketplace over the long haul. So I wouldexpect that consolidation integration to drive greater scale efficiency.", "We are very methodically and thoughtfully advancing ourintegrations. Right now we are very much into technology and operationalprocess conformance stage, and there we see great opportunity to leverage ourcommon platforms and processes in narrowing reduced cost, but also serve ourconsumers on a much more reliable and efficient basis. Not really look to thatfueling productivity in three to five years out or so.", "One of things we haven't talked a lot about in the lastcouple of calls is our continued promotion of self service. And what we like tolook at it is that we offer a very flexible line-up of service option, selfservice being one of them.", "In 2007, just by way of example we have to increased ourtransaction volumes on our portals quite considerably, consumer portal up 13%and I expect that to expand next year, now that we've achieved the number onerating on that portal again.", "Our provider up a remarkable 26%, our broker up 12% andemployer while flat is in the re-tooling phase right now. So I'd expect that tocontribute greatly in the future.", "In addition, I'll just touch on our EDI and auto-adjudicationrates, which are -- we believe to be fairly industry leading and are continuouslyperforming in the 80 plus percent range. So we're confident that that we'llcontinue to make advances in that area and improve our productivity as aresult.", "I'd also just touch on process improvement, which not only,as Steve touched on it briefly in the script, but I want to bring it out alittle bit more, because I think it's a strong advance in health care.", "When you get outside of your four walls and start reachinginto the supply chain more broadly. And we've done that with what we referredto as our HP3 program, which is essentially re-utilizing, re-manufacturing andSix Sigma techniques working with a large hospital systems through mediate kindof common issues that exist between payers and providers in this marketplace.And we expect to have 476 hospitals under this program by the end of the year.", "And I think that you'll see that, that will not only improvehospital-based operations and performance, particularly around billing and cashapplication things of that nature, but it'll also improve ours as well and leadto the types of enduring relationships that Steve spoke up earlier.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks, Dave. We're going to have to conclude now. So, Iknow there are other questions in queue and we will start to take them off-linevery actively. But we're going to have to close this. I will thank you. We willbe back quarter-by-quarter, stronger levels of operations, with solid growth,earnings. Thank you very much.

In 2007, our primary goals were continued predictablegrowth in earnings, the strengthening of our operating fundamentals, andfurther leveraging the value of our diversified market-facing businessapproaches, including our capacity to generate and apply capital to build shareholder value. As we look at UnitedHealth Group's 2007 performance, we canreport that we have begun to make strong advances in all of these areas, andthat we have a significantly more powerful sense of momentum than we had atthis time last year.", "Fourth quarter earnings of $0.92per share bought full year 2007 earnings to an adjusted $3.50 per share. Thatrepresents an increase of 18% over full year 2006 results. Earnings growth wasdriven by a more than $1 billion increase in adjusted operating earnings, andcomplemented by a reduction of more than 40 million weighted average sharesoutstanding for the year. We saw improved profitability in public and seniorprogram, while Enterprise Services businesses continued to deliver exceptionalgrowth in financial performance. These strong performances were offset by yearlong softness in our commercial risk benefits business, which today representsroughly 40% of our operating earnings. However, our medical care ratio improvedby 60 basis point year-over-year, and our operating profit margin expanded from9.8% to 10.6% as adjusted.", "The value of our diversifiedbusiness approach was evident again in 2007, as we pursued expansion invirtually every segment of the Healthcare landscape. Our earnings streamcontinues to diversify by business, product, service line, client type andgeography. Our operating performance continues to strengthen across the fullexpanse of our businesses, with a smooth transition into January forcommercial, senior and public sector clients. ", "We continue to see clearimprovements in our market relationships and in service, as measured both byour metrics and more importantly by direct market feedback. We are installing agreater emphasis enterprise wide and building relationship equity with all ofour stakeholders, and those efforts are beginning to get traction. ", "Our [own] capital generationremains at distinctive characteristic of our organization. We reported cashflows from operations approaching $6 billion in 2007 or 126% of net income. Weachieve these results amidst reductions in risk-based memberships at UnitedHealthcare,Ovations Medicare Advantage, which underscores both our remarkable cashproduction capacity our businesses have and the critical focus we maintain oncapital generation.", "I would note that there were sometiming differences that impact fourth quarter cash flows, including certainstate Medicaid receivables, some accelerated income tax items, and the timingof certain federal program payment. We now expect cash flows to be roughly $7billion in 2008. ", "We increased our debt-to-totalcapital ratio in 2007 from 26% to 35%, and expanded our share repurchasecommitment while maintaining strong credit ratings. We repurchased 125 millionshares in 2007 for $6.6 billion, including 40 million shares for $2.2 billionin the fourth quarter. This fourth quarter activity gives us a strong start onour stated target $7 billion in share repurchase by year-end 2008. ", "In addition, we had $2.4 billionin cash on hand, as well as further debt capacity as of December 31. Ourcapital will support our previously announced all cash mergers, sharerepurchase goals and general corporate uses.", "While 2007 was seen as a quiteyear for us on the merger and acquisition front, we made a number of significantmoves to strengthen our enterprise. The most visible announced acquisitionswere Sierra, Fiserv and in early 2008 Unison. We also executed a number oflower profile, but strategically important acquisitions, including the LewinGroup in public policy consulting, Administration Resources Corporation, themarket leader in VEBA administration and Healthia, Lighthouse MD and Red Oak inclinical data and physician revenue cycle management.", "Since we are discussing capital,I will anticipate a question about our investment portfolio. We have a totalportfolio of cash and investments of about $22.3 billion. Our exposure at thebeginning of the fourth quarter to sub prime loans was the de minimis, and whatlittle exposure we did have was further reduced in the quarter.", "Our municipal bond portfolio isabout $5.5 billion in size and represents about one fourth of our total cashand investments. Those bonds were selected by highly regarded outsideinvestment managers, specifically based on the strong underlying credit qualityof the issuers, and independent of any credit insurance. Our investmentphilosophy remains one of conservatism, rather than one of overreaching for yieldand that approach has produced dependable result in times of bond marketturbulence in the past.", "As we discussed at our recentInvestor Day, we have completed the transition to our new business segmentfinancial reporting this quarter. We have posted historical quarterly detailfor 2006 and 2007 for both income statements and the membership payables on ourwebsite. And Mike Mikan can answer any questions you may have related to thesechanges through the course of the day.", "We will now turn to a briefdiscussion of our key fourth quarter January trends in the areas costs, growthand client delivery. The short version is that all three of these are trackingwith our most recent outlook. Full year adjusted earnings from operations of$8.025 billion were near the upper end of our range we provided at InvestorDay.", "Year-over-year earnings growth inenterprise service businesses continued to be powerful in the quarter.Healthcare services earnings showed an expected sequential decline, whichreflected the decrease in earnings in the commercial benefits businesses due tonormal seasonal usage patterns, as well as the increased investment inmarketing to seniors.", "In general, our businessesserving senior and public sector markets had another very solid quarter andshowed strong year-over-year earnings improvement.", "Fourth quarter medical cost trendswere in line with expectations, with the full year medical care ratio of 80.6%in line with the low end of our Investor Day outlook.", "Ovations and AmeriChoice againhad strong gross profit results, continuing their recent trends. The commercialrisk medical care ratio for UnitedHealthcare was 83.7% in the quarter, briningthe full year ratio at 82.1%. That fourth quarter care ratio includes certainnegative non-recurring items, the largest of which is an accrual that reducedpremium revenues in the quarter due to one state recently issued regulatorydetermination on prior year underwriting performance.", "After consideration of these ourfourth quarter medical care ratio was above what we expected for the quarter.This includes the prudent and appropriate accrual for estimated medical costsin high deductible health policies, which incurs seasonally higher claims costin the fourth quarter each year.", "All in, our 2007 full yearcommercial medical cost trend came in comfortably within the 7% to 7.5% rangewe discussed at Investor Day. We are pleased with that excellent and consistentmedical cost trend performance.", "Fourth quarter operating costsremained well controlled, coming in at 14.4% in the quarter and bringing fullyear to 13.8% as adjusted. This sequential quarterly increase in operatingcosts of about $80 million included expenses for fully staffing the annualJanuary surge and benefit changes in enrollment service needs for membershipbusinesses and marketing costs for our senior business, including significantadvertising and market launch expenditures for the only Medicare Advantageproduct branded with the AARP name.", "Turning to January 2008 growth,we are still truing up retention figures, so these remark are very much basedon preliminary estimates. Our enterprise services businesses are on track forsolid 2008 revenue growth. Ingenix closed the year with a revenue backlogexceeding $1.7 billion, an increase of 46% over the last year.", "OptumHealth's integratedcapabilities at new branding are resonating well with customers in both theemployer and payor markets. Exante, which is being re-branded as OptumFinancial Services has been building its electronic payment network at a rapidpace and moved to total of $19 billion in funds electronically in 2007, anincrease of 80%.", "Prescription Solutions is infinal negotiations for the location of its third mail service facility, andwill start fitting out this base in early 2008. As we move aggressively doadvance our growth agenda.", "I would point out that thiscollection of enterprise services businesses made more operating profit in 2007than the entirety of UnitedHealth Group did in 2000. They are each wellsituated for growth in 2008 and for longer-term performance.", "AmeriChoice grew by 245,000people in 2007, a 17% advance including 10,000 people in the fourth quarter. Weare pleased with the momentum AmeriChoice has generated this past year, whichincludes the new Medicaid program in Tennessee,SCHIP in Texas and the January 1 launch of aninnovative consumer-driven model serving the uninsured population in Indiana.", "We anticipate continue growthduring 2008 from this business. Additionally the state of Tennessee recently issued its RFP for theeast and west regions, and we are well positioned to pursue both. Missouri and Connecticutare also markets we are evaluating for 2008 expansion.", "Our pending acquisition of Unison will further strengthenAmeriChoice in these states and expand our services in this high growth marketsegment, sort of, to a total of more than 2 million people. We expect thistransaction will close before the end of the second quarter.", "In Medicare Advantage, ouradvance planning, broker training, national and local market advertising andelectronic enrollment processes drove a productive start to the selling season.This is a much improved position from last year. The broker channel hasreengaged and the build out of our internal distribution channels will continuethroughout the year and into 2009.", "Ovations is off to a strong startwith preliminary January figures, putting us on pace for growth of 145,000 to175,000 people, with Medicare Advantage offerings in 2008 as we set out atInvestor Day. Compared with last year, new sales are meaningfully up andcustomer retention has improved sharply. Our strong growth sales are estimatedto net out at around 60,000 to 85,000 new members by the end of theopen-enrollment period, which runs through March 31.", "We continue to expect thatone-half of our annual growth in this line will come after April 1 from [8thJune] activity and in particular strong monthly growth trends in our expandedchronic care special needs plan.", "Those are all organic numbers andexclude any impact from the pending Sierra acquisition. While we are limited inwhat we can say here, we are in very advanced and productive discussions withthe Department of Justice and planned to close this year transaction in thenear future.", "As per Part D, as previouslydiscussed, January saw the reassignment by the government of the number of ourPart D low income members. We anticipate a reduction of about 650,000 peoplethat will be at least partially offset by open-market growth, the pendingacquisition of Sierra's Part D business and the Part D component of the newMedicare Advantage enrollment activity I mentioned a moment ago.", "In the Part D open-market, oursales trends are quite satisfactory, recognizing that of course we need to waitto shoot up this enrollment data from CMS before we have any final numbers.", "As we discussed at our CommercialDay, or our Investor Day, our commercial market businesses, UnitedHealthcareand Uniprise remain soft. The first quarter 2008 decline in people servethrough fee-based arrangements is trending closer to 150,000 than to 200,000people as we are performing better than expected in open-enrollment resultswith large employers. We believe this is an early reflection in our servicegains, which I will discuss in a minute.", "First quarter losses inrisk-based commercial products appear closer to 400,000 people than 350,000.The components of the 400,000 include more than 200,000 from the PacifiCare,75,000 on funding conversions that remained with our company and the balancerepresenting organic decline.", "We are still truing up all ofthese numbers, but it appears that first quarter will still have the expecteddecline of about 2% in total. Our results in 2008 business will be strengthenedby the acquisition of Fiserv, adding close to 2 million consumers serve throughfee-based arrangement and Sierra contributing additional risk-based consumersin commercial market businesses. This would result in a net gain of 7% in thefirst quarter for the UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise commercial benefit markets.", "Let me now address our pricingdiscipline and improving service performance, which are critical given theireffort, the effects on organic growth layer in 2008 and into 2009. We continueto match UnitedHealthcare pricing to medical cost trends and expect to maintaina stable full year medical care ratio at around 82% plus or minus 50 basispoints.", "With natural quarterlyutilization fluctuations, our fourth quarter 2007 revenues show a sequentialimprovement in the rate of increase in realized per member per month yield, andwe expect this trend will continue steadily in 2008. We remained comfortablewith and committed to our discipline in long-term philosophy of pricing to ourmedical cost trends.", "As you are aware, we started itearly last year on a conservative effort to rebuild and enhance our service,which had impacted UnitedHealthcare's growth, with both fee-based andrisk-based customers. At Investor Day, Dave Wichmann discussed in detail thesignificant commitment to this area and the tangible results we have alreadyachieved.", "In summary, we focused leadershipand resources on the issue and our service levels have recovered strongly. Wehave more to do with Legacy PacifiCare, but we are otherwise back to marketperformance levels and will further improve our service metrics throughout therest of this year. We are pleased to report to you continuing advances in theseareas.", "Let's start with some basics.Intense focus has brought down our adjusted inventories by 80% over the pastsix months, and turnaround time on issues improved by more than 40% from thethird quarter to the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect to perform to less than48 hour inventory on issue resolution going forward and we anticipate that thisincreased fee, the resolution will be felt positively by clients and physiciansalike.", "Our quality also continues toimprove. With first call accuracy in the fourth quarter up 20% year-over-yearfor consumers and 60% year-over-year for physicians. Our emerging serviceapproach integrates pharmaceutical, medical and administrative data enablingempowered experts to provide once and done resolution service across these keyfunctional area. The feedback on this approach has been powerfully positive andwe are expanding aspects of it broadly to the marketplace.", "Our dollar accuracy on claimspayment has advanced 80 basis points in the past year to over 99% in the fourthquarter. We are seeing improved audit scores from consultants that willcontinue to improve in 2008, as fresher results begin to recover by theirreviews.", "With regard to access, an independentthird-party survey found more U.S.physician offices except UnitedHealthcare than any other insurance claim. Weadded more than 40,000 physicians and other care providers to our network in2007, and continue to advance consumer access with key hospitals, most recentlyAdvocate in Chicago.", "I would point out that less than50 basis points of our hospital spend was in out of network status at any time,even for one day in 2007, taken for a highly stable network.", "Our Premium designation programis critical to consumers who want to make in-form decisions about the qualityand cost of their care into our new generation of consumer products such asEdge. In 2008, the Premium designation network encompassed 21 distinct medicalspecialties and is available to consumers in 38 states, plus the District of Columbia.This is an important component of our integrated strategy to support consumersin receiving the right care at a right time and place. Sophisticated employersunderstand the value of an Advocate for this kind of transparency for theiremployees and their families.", "In our customer satisfaction onpost call surveys continues to be in the 98% of our range in the fourth quarterand nearly 98% in December using the strengthened service approach as describedearlier. Consumer surveyed immediately after their interaction with our agentsare indicating strong improvements in overall satisfaction. Also important tonote, that 2007 was another fertile year for innovation across UnitedHealth Group.We introduced exciting new products such as Edge and Vital Measures. Weexpanded the integration of comprehensive Care Advocacy protocols. Launched thenext generation of consumer products, advanced and began to scale theintegration of financial services, expanded our real time adjudicationcapability, introduced the personal pharmacy history, brought premiumdesignation program to scale and became the first company to adopt NCCNstandards for determining chemotherapy drug coverage as part of our commitmentsto [best science]. And as I mentioned; launched an innovative service modelthat is delivering compelling results for our customers. ", "We are gratified to have beennamed most innovative company in our industry in the most recent fortunesurvey. These service and innovation examples all directly relate to thebroader aspiration of performing as an integrated UnitedHealth Group Systems.We look forward both to external market validation of these gains and continuedadvancement and innovation in 2008.", "I will close with a brief summaryand some forward-looking comments. This year and quarter, we have done what wetold you we would do. We refocused to improve fundamental execution and we willmaintain that focus. We continue to expand and enrich our network across all productsand did so with significantly lower levels of disruption. We have substantiallyaddressed PacifiCare integration and broader service issues, and fullyrecognize that we must continue to strengthen that market quarter-by-quarterthroughout 2008.", "We executed on our marketing andsales approach in the Medicare Advantage and Part D sales season. Westrengthened our discipline in pricing to cost across the commercial benefitmarket even at the cost of membership growth and demonstrated it with improvingyield in the quarter.", "At 2007 adjusted earning pershare increased by 18%. This is directly the result of diversified, adaptable,and market-focused businesses. We are positioned to deliver continuous strongresults in 2008, and key elements for 2008 include an accelerating MedicareAdvantage business supported by an exclusive alliance with AARP for 2014,expanded product offerings and expanded geographic footprints and great brandname recognition. Second; market place recognition of our stronger service performanceacross the board.", "New product launches and anintense focus on profitable growth in our commercial market, a continuedcommitment to pricing discipline, timely closure of the Sierra and Unisonmergers and as always our ongoing commitment to effective capital management.We continue to project revenues to be around $83 billion. The impact of thetiming of the Sierra acquisition kind of a potential resolution with theJustice Department will be more than offset by closure of Fiserv. Unison representspotential upside of revenue. We expect earnings of $3.95 to $4 per share in2008 supported by cash flow of $7 billion, and we are targeting first quarterearnings in a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share or 11% to 14% over the prioryear as adjusted.", "As we pointed out in InvestorDay, we are focused on the greater, long-term opportunity to become a trulyunique enterprise. The opportunity to build out UnitedHealth Group as an openand engaged health system, one that could adapt to ever changing market conditionsand shifting demand in the dynamic healthcare landscape.", "I want to thank our employees fortheir focus and support from our customers and our businesses during 2007. Westand together dedicated de-leveraging our ideas, unique capabilities in scale,our solid execution and our strong financial standing for the benefit of theentire healthcare community, our customers, our employees and our investors.", "We appreciate your interest todayand we can now move to questions, I'm joined in this room by many of our seniorbusiness colleagues. And John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, and Mike Mikan andothers will continue to be available after this call to respond to anyadditional questions you may have. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your first question will comefrom the line of Josh Raskin with Lehman Brothers.", "Josh Raskin ", "Hi, thanks good morning. Questionon the improvement in the service metrics, I think you guys have a lot ofstatistics to sort of back it up, in terms of the internal measurement, but I'mcurious how do you measure the external constituents? I mean are there brokersurveys that you do or how do you get sort of comfort that the market'srecognizing that or it's just simply looking at your membership growth?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well Josh, I would react on twolevels. Obviously given our focus on this we have been in a very consistentcontact with brokers, with consultants, with employers and soliciting verydirect feedback in terms for our performance in these areas. And I cannotoverstate the degree of connection we have been pursuing and will continue topursue with that. And that is one channel of direct feedback.", "I would point to another, andthat is our post call, post contact surveys with consumers directly and withphysicians with respect to their satisfaction and our follow-up in terms of anyareas where they express concerns. And we monitor those surveys, which arereally available and done on every call, at every contact, so that we can reallytrack trends in this area. And those have been trending so strongly, favorablethrough the course of the year that is I think another very credible andfact-based respond with respect to our service levels. But I would also -- wehave [Dirk McMann] here and Dave Wichmann and I think perhaps they can respondmore effectively.", "Dirk McMann", "So, what I would also say isthat, Josh, after the call is over, we'd both take a survey and if there is anegative result on that survey, what happens is that the negative result isdefined as two standard deviations from the mean in terms of performance, andthat email immediately goes to one of our supervisors and the supervisorfollows up within 24 hours with that particular customer to make sure the issueis exactly resolved. As a result of it we have also been very, very powerful ona very first call, first contact basis. And that\u2019s where we look the trend thatwe are seeing, and that just being followed up.", "David Wichmann", "From a call perspective in termsof how we have improved, we have moved from about a 4% plus error rate at thebeginning of last year to a 2% error rate at the end of this year.", "Josh Raskin ", "I think what I am trying tobridge is, is these improvements in these metrics which is obvious, I mean thelevel of service is obviously dramatically better. I guess I am trying tobridge that with the expectations around membership. I think, you've alluded tothe commercial businesses, first quarter loss is trending a little bit betterthan expected. Is it fair to say that's where the outlook for the full year. Ithink you had said last time that you would had growth in the sequentialquarters two, three and fourth, is there -- maybe an update as to what youexpect full year membership to look like?", "David Wichmann", "Yeah, I'll let Ken Burdick andMike Matteo respond to that, but our view in terms of membership guidance isreally unchanged. We do expect to see positive growth, particularly in the riskproducts in the third and fourth quarters. And I would say to your openingcomment that the momentum is, dynamics are clearly distinctively different thanthey were at that time last year. Ken?", "Ken Burdick", "Good morning, Josh. Let me justrespond on the outlook for the remainder of the year. You are correct. We continueto have an expectation that is absolutely in line with the guidance from theInvestor Day. There has been some variation in January results by funding type,but the outlook for the remainder of the year is for growth both in the fullyinsured space as well as the fee-based business and is really attributable toseveral things.", "Number one, the improvements thatthe marketplace is seeing in both service and in the network stability. Numbertwo, the impact of the new generation of the broader range price point productsthat we discussed at some length at Investor Day. And then third, we're reallystarting to get traction from the focus on expanding and revitalizing ourbroker and consultant's distribution channel.", "And maybe I'll let Mike Matteospeak to some of the success we've had with some of the open enrollments.", "Mike Matteo", "Thanks Ken. In terms of our largecase market with Uniprise, we saw a better first quarter than anticipated and alot of that is attributable to working in concert with our large employers andthen partnership really helping them to showcase what we can do from a serviceperspective but a medical cost trend perspective and our ability to attract andretain individual members when they have a choice between us and the competingplan, and so open enrollment results were actually better than expected thisyear for January in the first quarter.", "Josh Raskin ", "Okay, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'll throw one point ofclarification in and that is, as we've said, we are down 50,000 more than weanticipated as we look at January. We don't see recovering that 50,000 but theexpectation that we have in terms of growth for the balance of the year andthat mix continues to be in line with our Investor guidance. Bill, nextquestion please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come fromthe line of Bill Georges with J.P. Morgan.", "Bill Georges ", "Thanks, good morning. I'mwondering, if you could just help out with a little more detail around yourcommercial medical loss ratio and I guess, you mentioned during the preparedremarks, some sort of state funding requirement, I wasn't exactly clear on whatthat was but could you, if possible, strike out the moving parts around thehigher commercial MLR?", "Ken Burdick ", "I would ask Mike here to respond?", "Mike Matteo", "Bill, I don't want to get intothe specifics on the regulatory item, because it's an ongoing negotiation. ButI'll try to breakout and give you a little more detail on the context into whatSteve said earlier. We did book the fourth quarter to an 83.7% medical careratio. That was impacted by the special cause items that Steve had mentioned.The regulatory item was something we were made aware of in the late secondquarter, early third quarter. At that time we booked to our best estimate basedon our interpretation of the statute and legal advice. We worked with thisindividual state throughout the remainder of the year. Based on new informationwe have reconciled this best estimate with the state, and that impacted ourfourth quarter tier ratio. If you excluded those items, we would be in linewith the expectation that we gave at the end of the third quarter.", "Bill Georges ", "Okay. And if you could also justprovide detail on the moving parts in your cost trend forecast for '08?", "Mike Matteo", "On that I wouldn't stick withwhat we had at the Investor Day conference that I laid out for you and I thinkalso Ken Burdick did as well.", "Bill Georges ", "Okay. So no change in view of thecomponent and cost trends?", "Mike Matteo", "No we would still be overall at 7.5%plus or minus 50 basis points for 2008.", "Bill Georges ", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question will come fromthe line of Charles Boorady with Citi.", "Charles Boorady ", "Hi thanks good morning. Justcurious in light of the changing economic environment what assumptions you aremaking about the impact of the economy in '08 versus '07 in terms of the topline from the potential for lay-offs and pressure on state budgets in yourstate programs? And then on the medical expense line, one could argue for lowertrends if you assume that we consumers are going to consume less healthcare butthere is also some evidence that people accelerate consumption ahead of beinglaid off in healthcare, I'm not sure how you see those two offsetting eachother?", "Stephen Hemsley", "While there are severaldimensions to that one question, we build assumptions for attrition into ouroutlook and I'll have Dave Wichmann respond to that, I'll also suggest that thecost pressures that are imposed on states often present opportunities, probablymore often than not present opportunities for us in growth, so we often viewthose pressures at the positive in terms of the growth outlook. And then I'llhave Mike kind of respond to the economic impact that might manifest itself ontrends, so Dave.", "David Wichmann", "Good morning, Charles. As you'dhave expect we too are concerned about employment levels and the fact that theymay drop off, we believe that we accounted for nominal costs attrition in ourforecasts, however depending upon the severity of the economic conditions thatof course could be more severe as well. To-date we have seen some modest, verymodest declines in the financial services industry, related to the sub-prime inparticular, beyond that we have really focused on advancing service and seeingif there is opportunities for us, so we can grow our enrollment within ourexisting clients. And I think as Mike Matteo pointed earlier in this response,we\u2019ve been very successful with that large case marketplace, and believe thatsuccess is reflective about that improved service performance.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Rick, you want to talk aboutstate progress", "Rick Jelinek", "On the state side, we have goodvisibility, and too -- roughly half of our markets are ready in terms of therate settings for 2008 and we feel good about that in this year. In addition,as Steve mentioned any budget shortfalls or budget pressures at the state levelprovide opportunity for the business to grow in general, as more people areadded on to the Medicaid rolls and the SCHIP rolls for the program. So, we feelvery good about the prospects this year looking forward.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Charles, let me speak aboututilization more in the broad context and then I will try to narrow in on theimpact of the economy. And broadly speaking, we think our products align wellto the individual's consumption behavior, that is, getting the individual moreinvolved in the health care decision making process and that in fact has had abenefit on bringing utilization to a more appropriate level. We are also veryintent on managing our costs. As you know, we've talked about significanthealthcare affordability initiatives, driving bed-days, in-patient stays downand we have seen that again this year with another 1% or so decline in bed-dayutilization.", "With respect to the economy, asyou know, healthcare consumption generally lags the economy, so at a point intime, when you are going into a recession, you generally are experiencinghigher utilization that is already baked into our run rate, but we willcontinue to manage costs and utilization by aligning our products and all thethings that we do around educating the consumer and managing utilization,broadly speaking to make sure that our cost trends are in line, if not industryleading and we feel very confident of that.", "Charles Boorady ", "", "Have the employers been proactivein asking you to do more to control medical expenses, I saw your initiative ononcology and also mimicking Medicare on not paying for certain areas in thehospital? But are there other such initiatives that could bring down the trend?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mike, do you want to speak,broadly speaking, from our customers' perspective?", "Mike Mikan", "Yeah. I would say, overall, fromthe large case perspective, customers are always interested in theaffordability agenda. But this actually presents an opportunity where somecustomers who may have been, I would say, more paternalistic or willing to lookat more aggressive tactics that help them manage costs, in terms of how theyinteract with the system, particularly around consumer driven health plans andreally evaluating those and how that can part of their portfolio, to drive moreaggressive cost trends. So, this economic exposure does at times create someopportunity for us to leverage what we have in our best-in-class network or premiumnetworks and activation strategies with consumer driven health plans. So, thatkind of opens up the conversation a little bit more.", "Josh Raskin ", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question will come fromthe line of Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake ", "Thanks, good morning. Couple of questions,just first in regards to your -- obviously with the fourth quarter issues youhad last year, I was just wondering if there is anything that you could tell usas far as what you've done to improve your visibility on cost trends orutilization, as you went into year-end and maybe compare that to last year. Andsame thing on the pricing side, you said, as you went through the first quarterof '08, it was apparent that your yield didn\u2019t reach the levels that you werehoping for. Is there anything you could tell us as far as giving us an updatein regards to what you see your pricing yields doing? And what you've donedifferently to see those trends?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah. Ken do you want to respondto yield aspect of it?", "Ken Burdick", "All right. Thanks Justin. Afterseeing the fourth quarter results in '06, we began making adjustments in '07 toour pricing. Some of that fell towards the end of '07, much of that is going befelt in '08 and we are very confident that our pricing and our yield istracking with our net-of-cost projections.", "Justin Lake ", "Okay. Anything on the utilizationside that you could tell us as far as what you saw at the -- maybe you had folksin the hospitals at the end of the year? Do you see anything differently thanlast year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mike.", "Mike Mikan", "Yeah. This is an area that we'vespend -- as you can imagine Justin a fair amount of time on this year. Tryingto get better information, real-time notification information from ourhospitals, also understanding what is occurring in the outpatient setting, andthen as important to that is just looking at the pharmacy data as we closed outthe year between the holidays and we saw a significant drop-off in the pharmacyconsumption which really last year occurred from two fold, one was thesignificant ramp up that we saw within, call it the high deductible benefit,just the switchover from traditional products into that. And then also,consumers that wanted to give their prescriptions filled and a outpatientprocedure done near the end of the year, we just didn't anticipate that as youknow last year we talked about that or at least the degree and this year wefeel we are lot closer to understanding that and we feel we've reservedappropriately as you can see as indicated in our expected loss ratio for thefourth quarter.", "Justin Lake ", "Great. And just one quickfollow-up on the economic questions that Josh had, I saw that your accountsreceivables was up about $200 million and your DSOs were up a day, I am justwondering if that's timing related or maybe there are some issues and I am justcurious around the individual segment with the economy being what it is, I amwondering if you are seeing people maybe paying their bills a little bit lateror not paying them at all as far as they are individual, maybe they are verysmall, and the small group on the premiums.", "Mike Mikan", "", "No, they were timing relatedissues and in particular Steve mentioned the state Medicaid payments, we hadtwo states that we did not collect at the end of the year and we've collectedin January already, so they are just timing differences.", "Justin Lake ", "So, nothing on the individualside to worry about?", "Mike Mikan", "No nothing.", "Stephen Hemsley", "No actually they are receivableson the commercial businesses that had performed exceptionally well, most of thereceivable growth as in the other businesses.", "Justin Lake ", "Perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come fromthe line of Christine Arnold with Morgan Stanley.", "Christine Arnold ", "Good morning. I have a questionon your commercial MLR, the premium yield improved in the fourth quarter as youmentioned, you increased price such that you said much of the benefit will be feltkind of in the first quarter and into 2008. Given that the MLR was higher thanyour expectations in this business in '07, and you've taken pricing action,what's the potential that the MLR could improve in 2008? I know you are guidingfor kind of stabilish plus or minus 50. But it seems to me it should improvegiven the pricing action, could you talk about that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, we offered guidance thatrepresented a corridor and obviously we are striving for stability there. Ithink there is potential for upside performance. But I think it would be very,very premature to provide any indications of it at this point in time. And so weare, our guidance stays where it is, but we would be looking to outperform itjust as a natural instinct.", "Christine Arnold ", "Okay. And then the follow-up.We've heard from the marketplace that you've changed some of the ASO termsentering 2008, in some cases in order to retain accounts, where there were someservice issues. Can you talk about the change in ASO terms and how at risk youare for medical trends?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, I think my Mike Mikan isperhaps the best to respond to that and then maybe Dave Wichmann could put somecolor on it.", "Mike Mikan", "Yeah, thanks. When we look at thelarge case marketplace and the performance guarantees, we had to increaseseveral amounts at risk from a service perspective, but we're that confidentthat that it will be a non issue for us going into the year. We do not have avery different profile in terms of a ASO fee at risk from an affordabilityperspective or a cost perspective in terms of that, while we've done it onselected accounts. It is not something we think will substantially change ourrisk profile in 2008 or 2009.", "Christine Arnold ", "Is that because you don't thinkmedical trends will hit that next quarter or because you didn't put much risk?", "Mike Mikan", "It's a little bit of combinationof both while we've had to put some amounts at risk. We only will put at riskwhat we think we can hit and achieve. The other part of this is that in a largecase market, we are able to achieve very good trends for our large customerseven below some of those trends on our fully insured books of business.", "Christine Arnold ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Christine, the only thing I wouldadd to that is that we throughout the year and just trying to get back to Josh'squestion, we throughout the year had seen a steady decline in the amount ofpayouts and performance guarantees our business particularly related toservice. So it's just another external validation point.", "Christine Arnold ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come fromthe line of Greg Nersessian with Credit Suisse.", "Greg Nersessian ", "", "Hey, good morning. Thank you. Myquestion is just on the quarterly progression of earnings next year and justspecifically in light of three factors, I just wanted to hopefully get a betterunderstanding for the first is just a loss of the dual-eligible PDP lives. Howthat might influence the earning seasonality innovations?", "The second was just on the NAmarketing cost related to the AARP relationship in '08. Was there any one-timeamount of spending this year, or would you expect the same amount of spending next-gen?", "And the final piece is just onthe high-deductible plans in the commercial book. Has that kind of stabilized,or would you expect to commercial MLR progression to get even more pronounce?Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think I have Mike respond interms of those elements and then from our business point of view, we might addsome color.", "Greg Nersessian ", "Okay.", "Mike Mikan", "Okay. With respect to the loss,there is two things going on with the Part D. One, as you know, the change inthe risk corridor, which will affect the quarters, especially the first threequarters negatively and then positively in the fourth quarter. That will besomewhat offset by favorable impact of not having the level of Part Ddual-eligibles in the first quarter, so that should be favorable in the firstquarter offsetting some of that negativity. And then I apologize, what were thelast two?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Actually high-deductible plansand I think that basically we have a very clear beat on that as the patentsestablish that would be roughly the same as, we expect it would be roughly thesame as this year. And then with respect to marketing cost, there is no [oncard]. I think Simon might respond to that.", "Simon Stevens", "Sure. Yes, Greg. So as far as theAARP brand launch is concerned, we have had a number of one-time launch costs,which we incurred in the second half of last year, which we wouldn't into thisrepeating at that same level next year.", "Greg Nersessian ", "Could you quantify the magnitudeof that or a range?", "Mike Mikan", "Well, we will obviously makeadjustments as to precisely what the shape of that marketing spend would benext year, when we see the full year impact of it this year. But we have talkedabout the 30 basis points of costs associated with that in the last part of2007.", "Greg Nersessian ", "Okay. But just in, so justgenerally speaking, overall, the quarterly earnings progression for next yearwill be most impacted by the two Part D components Mike that you mentioned onthe dual-eligibles and the risk corridors?", "Mike Mikan", "Yes.", "Greg Nersessian ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come fromthe line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch ", "Yes, hi, good morning. Just aquick one on pricing. Could you characterize what you are seeing in the marketversus maybe a year or two years ago, and particularly in terms of theintensity of price competition on the commercial risk side of the business?", "And is there any variation betweenpublic companies and not for profits where maybe ones more aggressive, onesless aggressive than what you saw a year or two ago? And just, if I could justadd to that one other piece which is, can you give us any sense of where youthink the commercial risk MCR will land in the first quarter just because thereis obviously a lot of focus on that metric.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So Ken, may be you should respondin terms of what you think the pricing environment is, and then Mike can talkto the first quarter care ratios.", "Ken Burdick", "Thank you, Mathew. Let me speakfirst for the, and [also] profits. We are seeing the consistent pricingbehavior that we've really observed for the last 18 months to 24 months. Nochange. It continues to be competitive.", "With respect to the individualmarket, that's where we think we have seen an increase in the number ofcompetitors, which is driving a higher level of price competition. And then inthe upper range, it's really consistent with the patterns that have emergedover the last couple of years. We don't see any fundamental change in thedynamics around either fee or risk-based pricing. It continues to be acompetitive, but the rational market.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And relatively stable consistentwith last 24 months.", "Matthew Borsch ", "Great.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And ratio?", "Mike Mikan", "Hey Matt, when you adjust out --as you know, last year we reported Q1 loss ratio in the UnitedHealthcarebusiness of 81.2%.

Just had aquestion, just around if you could give us a little more details on the MAopen-enrollment fees and then just relative to the net sales you are seeing,maybe how that's tracking in network-based products with the ARP relationshipcompared to private fee, and then also if you are seeing any higherdis-enrollments in terms of retention in MA, a couple of competitors have citedseeing some of that recently.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Simon, I think this is yours.", "Simon Stevens", "So, SecureHorizons folks are fairlyseeing a sales turnaround from their position than last year, gross sales areup and determinations are down. As Steve said based on current enrollmenttrends, SecureHorizons believes that they should be on track for 60,000 ormore, [next to] Medicare Advantage numbers sold by March 31 and effective byApril 1, inline with our full year projection that we set out at Investor Dayof a 125,000 to 175,000. As for product mix, we are seeing gross salesconsistent with the strategy that we set out for you at Investor Day withdeliberately strong acquisition in our network based products, AARP branded HMOproducts and [SNP] products together with private free-for-service sales, butfocused particularly on our network-based offering.", "Scott Fidel ", "And then in terms ofdis-enrollments or retention levels, I think you said that there was trackingin line with expectations for '08 so far?", "Simon Stevens", "Yeah, I mean, our terminationrates are significantly down on what they were last year. Well of course we havelarger installed-base of Medicare Advantage members than anyone else in theindustry, nearly 1.4 million members.

We are going to activelyparticipate in the 2008 opportunities group business, recognizing of course forthe large group as these are most likely to take effect for 1/1/'09.

So I don't want to waste my question by pressuring you on thatpoint. But I guess where I do want to pressure you a little bit for moreclarity or color if I could is, you mentioned the commercial membership wasgoing to be down about 50,000 more than anticipated, and if I heard you, or atthe lower end of the range. And if I heard you correctly Steve, you said thatyou probably don't make that up. A; is that correct? and B, did I hear youcorrectly, and D; can you break that down into; are these old products, arethese markets in which you've not yet got any traction on your service andinnovative product initiative or is that a lack of traction in the new, moreinnovative products or where you've put the effort into reconfiguring thebroker channel?", "Stephen Hemsley", "First of all, Sheryl youabsolutely heard correctly we are 50,000 and more and we are talking risk base.", "Sheryl Skolnick ", "Right. That's what I mean, thecommercial risk base.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Right.", "Sheryl Skolnick ", "And if you are in a group size,can you give me more detail on where the weakness appears to be?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Ken you want to respond to that?", "Ken Burdick", "", "Sheryl, you are correct, that inthe older product line as I mentioned in the Investor Day conference, our Edgeproduct for example is rolling out throughout the country, but we only had itin 21 markets as of January. I'll just speak to the-- that the momentum that weare gaining, I'll sight one example of the Chicago market, because I know if Italk about things like network stability, and improved service, and broker engagementit may not resonate. I'll just quickly describe that using Chicago in example all of these things havecome together, so that with the signing of Advocate we experienced growth inour small book for the first time in several years. We sold seven new customerswith brokerage that we had not been writing business with. And we had 2500additional members in one open-in-moment opportunity and our large caseproposal activity is up 25%.

Are we going into yet another cycle of disappointmentbecause we're surprised by a lack of traction in the old product base forUnitedHealthcare.", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, Sheryl I would not think thatthat theme resonates, if you really take a look at the concentration, it ismore California, I won't put it all in terms of PacifiCare, and I won't put itall in terms of repositioning of that book, but I would say, if there is aconcentration, it is more in the Californiadirection. And, I actually think that our outlook with respect to going forwardis as I said more positive than we have been probably in a couple years.

Why shouldn\u2019t I be?", "Mike Mikan", "I actually think the quality ofearnings is quite strong, I think we were very appropriate with respect to howwe established care ratio for the fourth quarter. I think the earnings actuallywere at the upper end of our range.

I think if you take alook at cash flow capacity that was approaching $6 billion and the cash isreally more a function of timing, so we've basically strengthened the 2008.

We've got a broad diverse business across the insured differentblock and development is, most of you all are aware that we did have negativeprior period development or prior year development for the UnitedHealthcarebusiness. We have a diverse block of business across Medicaid programs, the OptumHealth program, stop-loss and other. So, Idon't want to just focus in on MA, which is what seems to be where we arenaturally going. You do need to look at it across a block of business thatrepresents and I know that's insurance cost, but that is, in fact, this part ofthe business is roughly call it $55 billion plus in medical cost and over $8billion of medical payable.

The first is obviously the 2008 rates were reasonable. Thesecond was that our 2008 benefits were designed prudently. Th1ird was medicalcost trends are expected to be broadly stable. In addition our clinical modelis gaining traction. The efficiency of the drug components of our servicescontinues to improve and opt through a greater mail and generic usage. Thereare some annualized effects from the change in member mix that we sold during 2007,and of course the risk adjusted compensation that we now received to meet thehealth needs of our members this continuing the results flow [not a] one-timepayment.

So youwere close to what I would have estimated the adjusted loss ratio to be.", "We are impacted by those specialcosts items that we mentioned earlier. As you know even though we are seeingpricing increase, the impact on that has not -- on the loss ratio is not farenough along to see that result in the fourth quarter. We do expect our pricingactions to be seen in 2008, but that did impact as well.", "And then also the net item thatyou are probably trying to quantify is the fourth quarter does have heavier daycontent. You price for that across the year, but the fourth quarter 2008 is ahigher utilization days than the previous year. And then the ramp-up of thehigh-deductible plans as evidenced by the increase in CDHP plans in the LegacyUnitedHealthcare product going from 11% to 15% in the fourth quarter. So thatdoes impact the individual quarter not necessarily the full year as you know.You price for that for the full year, but if you've got months that haveFebruary utilization, that doesn't in fact impact your loss ratio.

", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and CEO of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning. Our release today focuses on the first quarter results, but at the top of our call, I want to address the revision to our 2008 outlook. We have lowered our earning outlook for the rest of the year, reflecting what we feel will be near term pressures on revenue growth and related earnings and margin. We have been careful and measured in doing so. These projected reductions are caused by a number of concurrent events: top-line revenue short falls reflecting competitive pressures, impacting both enrollment volumes and net premium yield, a uniquely important shift in a difficult economic environment toward lower benefits and lower price points, as well as the continuing shift to self-insurance. ", "In the Medicare market we are seeing lower than expected engagement by seniors in traditional HMO style product offerings and interest rates have dropped dramatically, which will affect our projected investment income for the balance of the year. And so the 10% full year downward revision reflects declining risk-based member and revenue growth over the balance of 2008. Senior business mix and commercial premium pricing pressure, an unusually severe flu season, and reduced investment income, and we are addressing operating cost levels that need to be realigned to our revised growth outlook. At this stage we do not see changes in forecasted medical cost trends at the national level. We are clearly being impacted by the declining national economic outlook, including employment levels, the interest rate environment and inflation trends, which are combing to create pressures not seen for many years. ", "Our specific sector conditions are in flux as well, some positive and some not. New generations of products and services are moving forward, such as in the consumer domain, where we have dramatic national leadership.  Emerging markets are beginning to open up, such as in state programs and in culture ethic offerings. We are also regaining traction in the large employer market; at the same time other products are beginning to mature, such as Medicare Part D. In addition we see increasing levels of employed consumers\u2019 simply declining coverage of any type, particularly in smaller businesses. And the pricing economics across all markets continues to be intense, even given the relatively stable medical cost environment. Today, though it is not clear how quickly the positive trends will produce results against this challenging backdrop, our coach two and outlook for 2008 has been revised in light of the challenges we face, principally around growth in risk based offerings. To make it easier for you to see our current assessment, we have provided a summary of our revised 2008 expectations in the press release.", "The first quarter earnings would have been in line with our original expectation, after a few factors: we saw perhaps the most severe and geographically broad flu season in five years.  It cost us $80 million or approximately $0.04 per share above normal flu costs and we did not have the earning strength across our businesses to off set that cost surge.  Our revenue plans are not being realized in risk-based products and accordingly operating costs were high and need to be realigned. We are addressing this promptly while thoughtfully keeping service levels and growth initiatives fully supported. Investment income was off in the quarter, but off set by realized investment gains. ", "Our first quarter operating cash flows of $280 million were negatively impacted, compared with the first quarter of 2007, by the timing of approximately $275 million in various government program reimbursements and payments, which will reverse over the course of the year, and more than $250 million in reduced medical payables related to accelerated payments and decreased in risk-based commercial and Part D membership, as well as the timing of payments to our pharmacy benefits fulfillment partner of roughly $150 million. We still anticipate generating nearly $6 billion in cash for the year. ", "For the full year we have revised our 2008 revenue outlook from a range of 82.5 to 83 billion, from a range of 81 to 82 billion. Although we previously updated this range in January, for ease of comparison we will refer back to the more comprehensive data elements from our investor day. Our outlook includes additional revenue from acquisitions of 1.7 to 1.8 billion, from Fiserv and roughly half a year from Unison; it is offset by a reduction of approximately $450 million for the delayed closing of Sierra and the related divestiture of the Nevada Medicare Advantage lives. This results in an organic decline in projected revenue of roughly 3%, excluding the impact from these acquisition related transactions. ", "The major pieces of our revised revenue and operating earnings are as follows:  Commercial risk membership for 2008, which we have projected to decline by up to 300,000 people, is now expected to decline in the area of 700,000; as a results of this reduction, our revised full year commercial risk premiums will be 1 billion to 1.1 billion less than previously forecasted. Premium revenue will also be negatively by slightly lower than planned premium yields, partially offset by benefit reduction, for an additional reduction of approximately $200 million. These arise from local market pricing pressures and continued growth in lower price point consumer directed products, which is actually an excellent trend for us going forward. We retain customers that we otherwise might lose, while recognizing there is some margin trade off. The public and senior premiums are now projected to be lower than originally planned by approximately $1 billion; this is caused primarily by lower than expected growth in Medicare Advantage products, a 100,000 to 125,000 people, down from the 125,000 to 175,000 as well as the timing of much of that growth being realized from April 1 to December Premiums are further impacted by projected lower risk scores and product mix changes compared to plan, with the majority of the growth coming from our distinctive, special needs plans product offerings.", "Medicaid premiums and AmeriChoice continue to be aligned with expectations. These reductions in our risk-based volumes affect our OptumHealth businesses and coupled with lower than expected external new business; we are now reducing our revenue outlook by around $100 million for these businesses, including a modest Fiserv impact. Prescription Solutions and Ingenix are also affected by the revenue softness, which has already been more than offset. ", "The corresponding reduction in operating earnings related to these revenue changes, including the changes in business and product mix is about $250 million in the public and senior markets, principally in Medicare Advantage products, $300 million in the commercial risk business and $75 million in OptumHealth.  We are also experiencing higher Medicare pharmacy utilization trends planned in the first quarter of the year, particularly in the low-income subsidy segment. On an annual basis, this increase in unplanned drug utilization translates to a range of 150 to $175 million of additional costs. We have included that in our revision and are incorporating it into our 2009 Medicare bid.", "We announced that $100 million less in investment income net of estimated realized capital gains, which will also reduce revenues and operating earnings in these businesses, this assumes an estimated $150 of realized capital gain in 2008. ", "Finally, our outlook reflects the incremental cost of around $80 million from the unplanned high incidence of flue in the first quarter. Taken together we expect operating earnings to be between 7.5 to $7.7 billion or roughly $900 million less than previously planned for the full year. ", "", "Before getting into detail on the first quarter, let me make clear how unacceptable these results and revised outlook are to all of us. They do not reflect the capacities of our businesses and we are moving aggressively to address the performance related issues. ", "Let me now walk you through first quarter results beginning with revenues, than medical costs, operating costs and capital. ", "Our first quarter revenue of $20.3 billion increased 7% year-over-year: a number of elements impacted revenue growth. First, participation in our fee based benefits services was stronger than expected, reflecting the strong improvement in our service and value to the large employer market sector, even during the down turn in the economy.  Mail order script volumes for our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management businesses are ahead of plan to the first three months, and several other businesses were fully on track for growth for the quarter, including AmeriChoice for Medicaid, OptumHealth financial services and Ingenix for technology services, AARP Medicare supplement, Medicare Part D and others. Conversely, revenue was affected by net growth below plan in Medicare Advantage and a greater than expected decline in commercial risk business, as well as premium yield pressures and lower benefit uptake from retained commercial risk business. ", "Regarding investment income: with the bond markets focused on quality our portfolios gross unrealized capital gain position advanced from $162 million at December 31, to $240 million at March 31. We have monetized some of our treasury investments and will reinvest in other high quality securities. This sale produced $53 million in capital gains this quarter. Keeping with our long-term strategy we will likely continue to reallocate at a moderate pace in coming quarters, depending on market conditions, ensuring a continued, high quality, diversified investment portfolio. ", "Continuing the revenue discussion let me turn to our operating businesses, starting with our public and senior markets group business. Ovation growth was improved meaningfully compared with last year. We see 2008 as an important transition year as we continue to build new, dedicated, captive distribution capabilities to support even stronger growth and greater retention in 2009. Active Medicare supplement is off to a strong first quarter, with growth of 40,000 new people putting us well on track for our forecasted growth of around 125 for the full year, plus an additional 10,000 acquired from Sierra. Our Ovations Medicare Advantage businesses had net organic growth of 50,000 seniors as of April 1: this was underpinned by more than 200,000 gross new sales, an increase of over 50% on our performance for the same period last year. These were largely individual members, not group sales and almost all sales were network based rather than privacy for service products.  With the opportunity to continue to sell A gyms, employers and in particular our dual and chronic special needs plan, which have seen outstanding growth, we expect net Medicare Advantage growth for the year at around 100,000 to around 125,000, excluding Sierra and related divestitures, and 135,000 to 150,000 all in. In addition, Ovations had singular success in winning new fee based state sponsored Medicaid benefit programs in which Evercare added 70,000 members during the first quarter of 2008, as well as being awarded a three-year contract for the state of Hawaii\u2019s Quest Expanded Access program.  ", "For Medicare Advantage in 2009 I would highlight three elements: first, our results confirm the strategy of building out our captive distribution channels this year. We expect to go into 2009 with greater control over how and where our products are sold and with greater member retention capabilities. Second: on our Medicare Advantage HMO products we made the decision for 2008 to hold margins broadly stable, rather than reduce them for membership gain. We will reevaluate the optimal positioning for this product county by county, as we consider benefits in light of CMS proposed 2009 rate. Third: our 2008 Medicare Advantage growth essentially all comes from retail sales to individual seniors, which can be meaningfully, strengthened in 2009 by aggressively focusing on the groups Medicare Advantage market, which we believe is beginning to open up. ", "Finally the Part D program lost fewer members than anticipated as we retained dual eligible\u2019s who were slated to go to other plans under the governments auto assign process. With the addition of Sierra, Part D members and the growth of Medicare Advantage, total Part D participation stood at an industry best of 5.5 million people as of March 31.  Overall for Ovations, we now forecast 2008 revenues at about $28 billion, including the affect of our Nevada Medicare divestiture.", "AmeriChoice is growing steadily and we expect that we\u2019ll add more than 500,000 people this year, without including any pending RRPs of which there are several in the market. This includes organic growth of roughly 85,000 to 100,00 people, from 60,000 from Sierra, another 370,000 3participants when the Unison acquisition closes and 30,000 more in Washington D.C. that Unison was just awarded. We expect AmeriChoice revenues approaching $6 billion for 2008, including a roughly \u00bd-year contribution from Unison. Fundamentally our public and senior markets group is a $34 billion business that is performing at a very steady level of growth. ", "Continuing with our health care services businesses, in the commercial markets group we reported a net organic decrease of 560,000 people as we had projected on our fourth quarter call. The mix has changed meaningfully. We had an organic loss of 530,000 risk-based members, about 130,000 more than we had estimated in January. About 60% of the loss were either due to employers converting to fee-based arrangements or related specifically to specific care business. The economic down turn has put additional pressure on the all ready price sensitive small group market. We continue to protect our margins against that backdrop by raising our base rate and limiting our new business discounts. We are committed to sustaining a quality business without taking shortsighted pricing positions. ", "Positive commercial developments this quarter include the closure of the Sierra transaction, the addition of 1.3 million fee-based participants through Fiserv Health and substantially stronger participation than expected in fee-based services on an organic basis. We are down 30,000 people through the first three months, as compared to an originally expected loss of 200,000 fee-based participants. We saw stronger than expected growth and retention of consumers at open enrollment for large employer-customers, even during poor economic conditions. This is a favorable, leading, indicate or the strengthening service execution and performance that we have been driving for the past nine months as well as a broad, stable, network access and clinical quality approaches that are part of our value proposition. We saw continued outstanding performance from our consumer directed offering where we remain the national leader. For the first time, we have more participants in the funded savings accounts than we do in the notional health reimbursement account. As consumer directed HSA offerings begin to scale in the individual, it\u2019s called small group market place. ", "A total of 2.7 million people with CEH offerings hold the number one market position in that category and we grew at 25% year-over-year. Uniprise reports 42% of its employers are using a TDA program and more than 50% of its membership is in some type of CEH plan. A recent study of our national employers indicated our CEH programs provide 10 to 12% absolute cost savings sustained over a four-year period, driven in part by their employee\u2019s use of preventive care and evidenced based care for chronic conditions. We now forecast a total net increase on commercial market of 4% or 900,000 people this year. This 900,000 gain is comprised of the addition of 1.3 million people at Fiserv and more than 300,000 at Sierra, the organic loss of 700,000 risk-based participants at UnitedHealthcare and flat fee based membership this year. This brings the commercial markets total estimated revenues to nearly 42 billion for 2008. ", "Moving forward we will continue revitalizing broker relationships, improving flexibility around local market needs and dynamics, and strengthening service performance. We will continue advancing in culture offering for targeted groups and consumer segments and driving new products that better meet affordability needs, all while pricing to forward costs and balancing the medical care ratio. These actions are also supported by on going efforts in the medical cost affordability and critical quality domains. We believe these are the right actions for sustained, long-term value creations.", "Moving onto enterprise services revenue. Prescription Solutions is performing well, with mail order scripts ahead of plan for the first three months and generic utilization continuing to increase strongly. Prescription Solutions has already sold pharmacy benefits management services to plan sponsors representing nearly \u00bd million unaffiliated lives this year and is working an active pipeline with potential clients, representing several million people.  ", "OptumHealth shows some signs of top line pressure due to the short falls in commercial and senior growth else where in our enterprise. OptumHealth is making targeted investments in its business to capitalize on existing and emerging market opportunities. Areas of focus include public sector product development, specialty benefits product bundling and external sales force expansion and our consumer engagement initiatives and care solutions. In the public sector, our new product capabilities have already created nearly 1 billion in emerging revenue pipeline and contributed to new sales in 2008. ", "Ingenix continues to consistently grow at a high rate, with record new order volume in pharma services, continuing strong sales in health information systems and analytics and a backlog of nearly $1.7 billion. We expect Ingenix revenues to reach nearly 1.7 billion, Prescription Solutions revenues well more than 12 billion and OptumHealth to be in the area of 5.3 billion. This represents all in revenues of some $19 billion for enterprise services. ", "With that I\u2019ll move forward to an analysis of medical costs from across the company.", "Our commercial markets group Medical care ratio came in at 82.5%, while UnitedHealthcare\u2019s traditional Medical care ratio, now including Sierra, was 81.5% in the quarter. This was worth an incremental 40 basis points alone, putting us to close to the upper end of our first quarter guidance range of 80.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Realized premium yields have increased in the quarter, reflecting the strongest realized premium yield increases in several years, even in an intensely competitive environment. With the average coming in just short of our plan perhaps our 30 to 40 basis points, which is now incorporated into our full year outlook.", "Medical costs continue to be in the 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range that we earlier anticipated:  the total cost picture continuing to be driven more by unit costs than utilization, primarily in the hospital inpatient category. ", "In the senior businesses, the Ovations special needs plans have, by their nature, a higher acuity population and higher care ratios, particularly in the first year when seniors who have not had coordinated care initially join the plan. We have seen strong sales of these snip plans this year, so this membership mix is increasing the Ovations medical care ratio. ", "In our traditional HMO based Medicare Advantage business, the medical care ratio is performing on par with the first quarter of 2007. ", "Overall, we are focused on several key strategies: UnitedHealthcare will continue to be disciplined and consistent in its pricing and drive more affordable designs and stimulate growth. Evercare\u2019s special needs plans are still a growth driver and a long-term opportunity for our enterprise to demonstrate the unique value in our coordinated care skills. We are now looking for a 2008 consolidated medical care ration in a range of 81%, 81.3 % plus or minus 50 basis points, including a UnitedHealthcare ratio that is likely to be in a range of around 82.3% plus or minus 50 basis points. The 80 basis points change in the consolidate guidance includes about 40 basis points from Ovations, 20 basis points related to commercial, 10 basis points because of flu and the remaining 10 points from other factors. ", "Moving on to operating costs, our ration of 14.35 of revenues in the quarter is high, particularly because of revenue volume short falls. There was also a 20 basis point impact from Fiserv Health and another more than 10 basis points due to stronger than expected fee-based service mix across our enterprise. We have taken targeted and thoughtful steps to realign operating costs to revise revenue levels while avoiding indiscriminate and potentially harmful just investments. We are very committed to fully supporting service, growth, and innovation across the full spectrum of our business. That said, we are focused on reducing our operating costs run rate by 3 to 5% as well as reducing capital spending.", "Looking at capital, our long-standing approach is delivering benefits. We strengthened our commercial and senior benefits with accretive acquisitions that will provide prudent risk adjusted return. We also signed a merger agreement that will put us in a leadership position in Medicaid and safe services, bringing us to a total of two million participants and a presence across 21 states.  These moves strengthen, expand, and further diversify the United Health Group services business.  We\u2019ve repurchased $1.5 billion in stock this quarter, bringing our debt to total capital ratio to approximately 40%, which is about the range of the capital structure we discussed last fall. With the decreased share price and the active repurchase program, our first quarter weighted average share count decreased 121 billion shares, to 1.28 billion shares from 1.4 billion shares 1 year ago. We are in position to repurchase a total of $ 4 billion in stock this year in addition to having completed the mergers I have described. This repurchase level represents close to 9% of the market cap of the company at recent prices. ", "There are some additional non-financial matters to discuss today as well. We have renewed our relationship with Medco to 2012. UnitedHealthcare, together with Medco, has shown exceptional drug performance for customers for nearly a decade on both an absolute cost and trend basis. With the growth we have seen during that time frame, this was a logical time to reassess our approach to providing drug benefit management. For their parte, Medco was open to changes in approach, which improve our alignment and increase value for our customers. Under the new agreement we will continue to manage our formulary and benefit design, while Medco will continue to handle fulfillment. We will in source customer service and customer benefit set up, create a more integrated, seamless, experience in these customer facing functions. We have an extremely capable and scalable Prescription Solutions business. A business that today serves more than 10 million people and has a 15-year track record of performance, a business we are building for growth. We will continue to use Prescription Solutions for all our rapidly expanding business in the public and senior sector, government business and in selected commercial markets, including pharmacy carve-outs. In addition, Prescription Solutions will retain and continue to grow its Legacy Pacific Care business and consolidate UnitedHealth\u2019s specialty pharma business, we have integrated in event, and the PDM purchase is part of the Fiserv acquisition inside Prescription Solutions. This renewal puts us in a strong and diversified position and we continue to invest in Prescription Solution and position it for future growth. We intend to leverage out enterprise wide scale and expertise on behalf of all our customers. We have been pleased with our two-platform approach and will continue to evaluate our strategies as the marketplace evolves.", "We also continue our efforts to bring the very best panelists into our enterprise. Earlier today we were pleased to make announcements that represent very positive news for us. Gail Boudreaux will join us as a UnitedHealth Group executive vice president and president of the Commercial Markets Group. We know Gail well from her work in Illinois and Texas, where she was executive vice president of the Health Care Services Corporation. Gail will bring a new dimension to UnitedHealth Group and focus on the clear growth challenges within the UnitedHealthcare businesses. The addition of an executive of Gail\u2019s caliber will further expand our capacities in a critical area of our business.", "Our other announcement was that Dave Wichmann has become the of the UnitedHealth Group operations. This means that he will focus his considerable talents and the breadth of his understanding of our business to manage an enterprise wide basis, several areas that are among our highest priorities: these include areas such as optimizing our business performance, strengthening and better aligning our organization, over seeing our operations and related cost levels, technology, integration, capital management and quality agenda and managing corporate development, research, and international operations and all integration efforts. We are fortunate to have someone with Dave\u2019s abilities take on this senior leadership role.  Michael O\u2019Boyle, former chief operating officer of the Cleveland clinic has joined us as our new president of National Network Services, where we believe he will be instrumental in enhancing our relationships with network physicians and hospitals. Tina Brown-Stevenson, formerly of Aetna Integrated Informatics will run all clinical and customer analytics and related services for Ingenix. Each of these people and others like them, reflect the caliber of individuals we continue to seek to attract to leadership roles at UnitedHealth Group.", "I\u2019m also pleased to announce that another new board member will stand for election at our 2008 annual meeting in June. Glenn Renwick, Chief Executive Officer of Progressive Insurance brings both expertise in consumer products and distribution and prospective on insurance and will be a great addition. He joins Michele Hooper and Bob Darretta as new independent directors and we expect additional new board members later in 2008.", "Finally, I want to congratulate Dr. Reed Tuckson, our Executive Vice President, and Chief of Medical Affairs for being recognized by Ebony magazine and Modern Healthcare this month for his profound leadership and impeccable contributions to society.", "Let me wrap up with some thoughts and a summary of our outlook.  The pressure points we discussed this morning are clearly broader in UnitedHealth Group and related parts and national economics industry trends. In that category I will put interest rates and investment incomes, unusually high influenza costs, continued competitive activity around membership growth, customer demands for leaner benefits that increase buy downs and slow revenue growth, and the risk of declines in business from customers in challenged industries. ", "Other items are more specific to UnitedHealth Group including, most significantly, the area of commercial and Medicare risk membership growth. We expect revenues in the 81 to $82 billion range. We are currently forecasting full-year results at $3.55 to $3.60 per share. This includes a second quarter outlook of $0.81 to $0.83 per share, with progressively stronger results in the back half of the year. We believe this view is right, in light of recent trends, is consistent with what we see in the business today and we\u2019re confident we can perform to this level. ", "Overall, I\u2019m strongly confident in our businesses. Our operations and functions are well managed, we have attractive new products and represent a first rate value with strong customer acceptance, we are well positioned to advance to our current stressful market environment, we have a highly diversified business that serves strategically large and growing markets and that have compelling long-term needs. Our products and services across these markets allow purchasers to choose from an array of prices and features. We need to do a better job in maintaining our members in the commercial risk products; that has been the case for too long. It is strongly encouraging that we have increased our commercial pricing yields in 2008 and uniquely important that our medical outlook remains constant. ", "Taken together the UnitedHealth Group businesses represent a unique health care services franchise that is a strong earnings and cash flow machine. We do not accept our current disappointing positions relative to where we have been in the past and the permanent condition and are taking immediate action to change the direction of these trends.  We appreciate your interest today and we can now move to questions. I am joined in this room by many of my business colleagues. After the call, John Penshorn, Brett Manderfield Mike Mikan and others will continue to be available to respond to any additional questions you might have. ", "-----------------------------", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) We also remind you that for purposes of getting to as many participants as possible, we ask those with questions to limit to one question per person. We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question will come from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake-UBS\t", "", "Thanks good morning. A question first on the MCR for the business: when you look at the commercial risk MCR for \u201908, it\u2019s going to be 100 basis points higher than the total, which is with the remainder being mainly government business. I\u2019m just wondering how long you think this could persist, I mean the government businesses running MCR that\u2019s meaningful below commercial, and if it does normalize higher, what impact should we think about that having on your long-term growth?", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Justin, can you just reframe that? I want to make sure I\u2019m understanding your question and I\u2019m not sure I caught it. ", "", "Justin Lake-UBS", "", "Sure. When I look at the commercial risk MCR of 82-3, that\u2019s 100 basis points above the UnitedHealth Group overall: the UnitedHealth Group, the remainder outside of commercial is normally government businesses, which typically, historically run higher MCRs; so if the government\u2019s running materially lower than commercial, how long is that sustainable? You talked a little bit about Medicare Advantage and thinking about the trade off of growth versus margin; I\u2019m just trying to think about how in 2009 and beyond, how we should think about that pressure from the government businesses possibly normalizing higher.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, Mike do you want to respond to that?", "Mike Mikan", "Well Justin, there\u2019s a lot of ins and outs and we\u2019ve discussed this before that it\u2019s not just the government business that is the delta between the commercial medical care ratio and UnitedHealth Group. There is Optimum Health and there\u2019s also the pharmacy business that reduces the cost ratio because we purchase, Prescription Solutions purchases drugs for the Ovation\u2019s business as well; so it\u2019s not just the government business and particularly it\u2019s not just Ovations, but it also include the AmeriChoice business and the myriad of different products within ovations. So, if you\u2019re asking with respect to one product line, we don\u2019t get into that level of detail, but the public and senior market group medical care ratio is higher than the commercial medical care ratio in total.", "Justin Lake-UBS", "", "Okay and just a quick question on medical costs.

We guided for 2008 at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. I broke out those details for you; I think Ken Burdick did as well at investor day. We would change those some, we are seeing some difference in mix and I\u2019ll go through those, but, with respect to unit costs and utilization and aggregate, those remain the same. Roughly 5% for unit costs, roughly 2.5%, or so for utilization and mix and those components are positioned, we had been at, at the investor conference at I think 5% at the investor day. We are now estimating between 4-and 5% per position. On inpatient as a result of significant unit cost pressure, on the west coast as well as the east coast, we are now projecting inpatient trends at 11.5 to 12%, that\u2019s up from 9.5 to 10.5%. Outpatient, which was at 78% is now at 6 to 7%, I think there\u2019s some mix changing there and then pharmacy, which we had estimated at investor day at 78%  we now forecast it at 6 to 7%. If you do the weighting of each one of those on the medical cost trend it remains consistent with our aggregate forecast that we had with 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.

We\u2019ve had this conversation in the past and I really think, Steve, you should add to your list of things you\u2019ve got to do better is capital management. From 2004 to 2007 we have spent $15 billion buying back stock and if the opening this morning is any indication of on going value, the program, there has been really an enormous mistake and it\u2019s particularly aggravating because it took place at a time when there was substantial insider selling, back to the corporation in effect.  We\u2019ve had this conversation before, but I\u2019d like to know how well thought out is this buy-back philosophy to where you\u2019re excluding a meaningful cash dividend completely? In other wards, when I look at the statistics, 80% of the S&P 500 pay dividend, 100% of Dow Jones Company\u2019s pay a dividend. Where do you think your stock would be selling at if you took say half of your 355 to 360 in earnings and paid out a cash dividend, of the remaining half, half went to grow the business and half went basically to offset option dilution and if the shareholders made their decision. Now I myself have historically been a fan of stock repurchase, but only when one condition exists: that we\u2019re buying back something that\u2019s meaningful under valued when we\u2019re leveraging return to remaining shareholders, and clearly we don\u2019t seem to have a good handle of what our business is worth or missed mister market is making an enormous mistake. What can we say here about this?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well first of all, I appreciate your perspective and I believe I understand your perspective. Our approaches to capital have been consistent in terms of reinvesting in a way that we think is measured in our existing business. Dedicating capital where we see opportunities to strategically expand our business and we have seen and felt that share buy back provides the greatest shareholder value and we look at our business and assess what we consider to be the intrinsic value. I think we are influenced by the fact that we have not executed well and have not executed well over the last, I would say two years, and as result it has clearly been reflected in the share price. We continue to believe that the potential of this enterprise, executing near or to its potential, is extremely compelling and we are committed to that level of execution, and as a result share buy back appears to be the most compelling use of that capital. I take your point with respect to a dividend analysis and I can assure you that we look at that and evaluate that on a regular basis and evaluate it at the board level.", "Lee Cooperman-Omega Advisors", "", "My only suggestion, since you\u2019re taking an extreme position. I mean today you said you were going to do about a $4 billion buy back of I guess 10% or there about of the market cap. Why don\u2019t you share the valuations thinking that the board and financial management of the company has gone through in reaching this decision and send all of us a little letter in discussing this decision, because you know we spent 3.4 billion in \u201904. 2.6 billion in \u201905, 2.3 billion in \u201906, 6.6 billion in \u201907, these are substantial numbers. This is the biggest investment decision the company has ever made and it\u2019s been so far flawed. Now, I myself, I get intrigued when you really get under valued. My guess is you\u2019re probably significantly under valued, but I\u2019d like to kind of understand the thought process that management is going through to reach this determination. Because, the, you know, I suspect if we announced this morning that we were to pay $1.80 dividend, which is half the earnings and the other half would be to grow the business or off set option dilution, your stock wouldn\u2019t be trading where we\u2019re starting at today.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I appreciate that solution.

I\u2019m really struggling with your assertion that you\u2019re not seeing a change in forecasted medical trend. Because, if I look at your commercial loss ratio, you\u2019re saying that you got better yields than a year ago and yet a year ago the commercial loss rates show benefited from 120 basis points positive development; so even excluding flu, your MORs up over 100 basis points; so that implies that costs have accelerated more than 100 basis points. Can you help me with that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think that one of the major themes there is that we have gotten better yield realization this year as compared to last few, the issue is, are those yields sufficiently covering the level of projected medical costs and Mike can, I think, provide some color.", "Christina Arnold-Morgan Stanley", "", "But how can the acceleration and premium yields not cover trend if trend isn\u2019t rising or accelerating?", "", "Mike Mikan", "", "Christina, let me clarify that as best I can. What we\u2019ve said is, and I\u2019ll go back to my earlier comment with Justin, last year we ended the year at 7 to 7.5% at the lower end of that range. This year we have been forecasting and remain to forecast at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. If you try to tie in yield, last year, as we disclosed to you, is we missed trend by about 60 basis points. If you assume that we\u2019re getting 50 basis points better on yields, but we\u2019re still short by 30 to 40 basis points from yield to trend, that would imply that your medical costs have increased by 20 to 30 basis points, well within the range that we had given previously. So last year we ended at the lower end of the range and this year we\u2019re well within the 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. There is flu that works into that as well, but 30 to 40 basis points is relative to what we expected trend to be, so flu is in there at 10 basis points and then there are some ins and outs, but nothing major beyond that.

I really don\u2019t understand what it means that your premium yield is \u2500I do understand in terms of the numbers that your premium yield was better than it was last year. It\u2019s still not good enough to cover trend. I\u2019m going back right to Christine\u2019s question on this and I guess where I\u2019m very confused is, is it that you expected, you priced for a cost trend say at the 7.5%, what you\u2019re getting on premium yield is 7.3%? Is that the right way to look at this in terms of just putting it in simple English and simple numbers?

Those are areas around a culture that focuses on organic growth and the innovation and the kind of service environment that is required to sustain it, an organization that has the kind of relationship orientation to work effectively with all the participants in the healthcare market place, so that it\u2019s presence in that marketplace is welcomed and encouraged and I think we have made significant advances in that area. We continue to struggle with our capacities around growth. Growth in principally risk-based products, products that have extreme price sensitivity where we endeavor maintain an economic discipline about how we price that product and how we over see that product in terms of its attributes, so that we have some visibility with respect to the economics of that. That has been a challenge for us, it\u2019s been a challenge across the marketplace and that growth issue and the inability to predict that growth, I think has been at the core of our issues and is clearly the core contributor to our guidance with respect to that.

Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Tom Marsico with Marsico Capital.", "Tom Marsico with Marsico Capital", "", "Hi, thank you for taking my question. In listening to the conversation today and the questions that have been brought up with some of the analysts and also with Mr. Cooperman, I think it\u2019s very insightful to look at what\u2019s happening to some of your businesses including the Pharmacy Solutions business. Today you announced that you signed the contract with Medco. Medco today is up 8%, it\u2019s adding $2 billion worth of value to its market cap and it sells at 22 x earnings. I\u2019d like to understand what you think the strategic relationship would be worth if UnitedHealthcare were to sell prescription solutions to Medco. Also, in light of that, looking at the Ingenix business, which I think is a terrific software business and also Optum Health, which has very specialized services, it seems like the value in those three businesses, which represents about roughly $20 billion worth of revenues is a dramatically higher multiple business, especially looking at the Medco business, than the way that the HMOs are trading. So, I think that, in my view as being a long-term shareholder for our clients, in looking at the valuation on United Healthcare, it seems to me that the parts are worth dramatically more than where the stock is trading now. Other HMO companies don\u2019t have the product diversity that United Healthcare has and it seems to me that, when looking at the sum of the parts solution to what United Healthcare might be worth, is dramatically greater than where it\u2019s trading at today; so your share repurchase program you\u2019re almost looking at a 15% free cash flow yield and we\u2019re going through a normal cycle, I think. I like the pricing discipline that you have in the PM business and I like the fact that you\u2019re holding to making certain that you\u2019re not pricing the product too low, because the cost trends have not changed, so I like the pricing discipline. And looking at what private equity\u2019s paid for businesses in the medical arena, such as the private equity acquisition as HCA, it seems like the valuation, when the credit markets start to normalize, would find United Healthcare dramatically under valued. So, Steven, in light of signing the Medco contract and some of the other comments I\u2019ve made as far as Ingenix is concerned, how do you look at these special businesses that are within United Healthcare, given the valuation on your company, and is it something that we should be talking to the board about as far as realizing the opportunity? I mean, I just , you know, the markets down 57 basis points today, Medco is up 8% adding $2 billion worth of value and we\u2019re looking at the stock at United Healthcare down another 10% and I\u2019m saying to myself, the cash flow valuation is very supportive and I\u2019m just interested how you look at this?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, we have had parts of this conversation before and I\u2019m very familiar, I think, with the spectrum of value dynamics across our diversified portfolio and I can assure you that we look at that and assess that in terms of what I will call the long-term interest of shareholders and we do that, not just by ourselves, but we use external experts in terms of making those assessments and you are very correct in terms of seeing the distinctions in value across that spectrum. Taken together, if you think about the total health care marketplace, it meets its potential and the systemic fashion in which we think it is appropriate to address it. That diversification that has been cultivated in this company for more than ten years has been distinctive and it\u2019s helped us grow in a variety of different domains. Much of the growth in these special businesses that you\u2019re referring to has been stimulated and leveraged off the assets and capabilities of businesses that perhaps are not as vibrant at this moment. And I would also say that the view may be clouded by the lack of consistent execution to getting this portfolio of businesses to all perform to their potential. My sense is that the evolution of this enterprise, to that more complete business model has distinctive capacities in the marketplace and has distinctive value potential. That said, Tom we look at these pieces and will look at these pieces and assess whether we can accomplish those same elements, those same goals, without necessarily controlling those, and we look at that on a regular basis and assess whether the position and so forth would be appropriate to unlock value. In fact, we thought that unlocking value was appropriate at that time for long-term shareholders. I use the PBM as an example. Rx Solutions, we think, is a very high potential business its\u2019 potential is far from fully realized. We are making investments in it and making sure that it flows and can be positioned to something that could be quite distinctive in the marketplace and I might look at the extension with Medco as a bridge to that ultimate kind of potential. So I think, for example, you could look at that as a piece in the strategy that might play exactly into what you\u2019re suggesting. We\u2019re looking at these across the spectrum, whether it\u2019s Ingenix or Rx Solutions, Optum Health, AmeriChoice, across the board. I would offer one other element and that has been consistent for many years, is that a core element that has allowed us to cultivate these businesses the way they have, has been the competency around care access and clinically integrated care management, information, which is key to the, I think, success of all of the businesses and the leverage and use of technology and those are present in all those businesses, an important leverage point that one has to consider if these were ever to be separated.

", "", "Scott Fidel-Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "And Ken, just remind us, what is remaining at this point in terms of commercial membership from Pacific Care, what\u2019s left in that block at this point?\t", "", "Ken Burdick", "", "11.6 million members.", "", "Scott Fidel-Deutsche Bank Securities\t", "", "Okay and then I just had a quick follow up in terms of on the Part D business and some of the comments you made around the cloche in the LAS business. Can you help us think about what you think pre-tax margin in Part D will look like this year? I know historically you\u2019ve talked about targeting a 3 to 5% pre-tax margin of that business?", "Simon", "", "Yes, Scott, this is Simon. Part D continues to be a successful and profitable business for us and the new benefit designs that we introduced for 2008 are generally performing well. We certainly have been successful in stimulating increases in generic male penetration as we planned. As Steve said, we are, however, how seeing higher than planned pharmacy trends, particularly for our low income Part D members and this is to some extent a spill over effect from last years low income benchmark bidding process. As to margins, obviously, as we\u2019ve said for many years, we typically look to a minimum hurdle rate of 3 to 5% with an established government program, recognizing that returns can often be better for individual participants in programs who are high performing. ", "Scott Fidel-Deutsche Bank Securities\t", "", "Simon, is it fair to think a little bit lower than that long-term hurdle rate, but still profitable for Part D?", "Simon", "", "It\u2019s certainly still profitable, the Part D and that\u2019s the basis in which we participate in all government programs.", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "I think we\u2019re going to half to wrap it up. I apologize we can\u2019t get to all questions and we will have management available broadly for questions through the course of the day. I would like to, though, comment on something that occurred here this morning at 9:00. The state of Tennessee awarded AmeriChoice both the east and west agents for the state Medicaid business. That business will largely start in the beginning of 2009; it should represent about $1 billion of revenue growth for AmeriChoice. I think that\u2019s an example of the RMPs that we said were in the marketplace that we think are fruitful, so AmeriChoice was successful in securing the state of Tennessee business, should represent about $1 billion of revenues for 2009. Our orientation for its growth like this needs to come back into our commercial risk businesses, we\u2019re focused on that, we\u2019re focused on our operating costs; we\u2019re focused on making sure that this enterprise performs to its potential and we are urgent about it. The steps that we\u2019re taking, I think reflect that. We\u2019ll be happy to have an opportunity to talk to you about your questions through the course of the day.

We previewed second quarter earnings three weeks ago and the themes this morning are unchanged.  We are taking aggressive actions to improve our company\u2019s growth and earnings performance across all businesses.  Those actions are intended, in the short and the long-term, to improve our customer focus and financial performance as well as respond to broader industry and economic pressures present in the overall economy and in our sector specifically.  We expect these actions to strengthen our enterprise and its performance in 2009 and position us for greater advances in 2010 and beyond.  ", "Second quarter results are basically in line with the estimates we provided you on July 2.  Earnings per share of $0.67 excludes special items totaling $0.40 per share.  To briefly touch on these items, first we agreed to propose settlement of legal claims for historical stock option matters and related costs.   Second, we recognize severance charges related to actions to reduce operating costs and finally, we divested a portion of our Medicare Advantage business in Nevada, which brought proceeds that we are required to record as an offset to operating costs in the quarter.  Including these special items, we reported earnings of $0.27 per share in the second quarter.  I will use only adjusted numbers for the balance of my remarks this morning.", "For first quarter, our first half-financial results reflect a number of business developments.  Our overall commercial medical costs trends continue to perform within expectations, while the commercial risk based benefit businesses are short of expected premium yield and enrollment.  In the senior\u2019s business there are gross margin pressures on special needs plans and in Medicare Part D.  Medicare Advantage growth is meaningfully improved from last year, but short of plan on membership and on revenue. ", "Medicaid and our Enterprise Services businesses are performing very well with the exception of the behavioral cost pressures at OptumHealth and some Pharma research project cancellations at Ingenix.   We had an unusually intensive [inaudible] spike in the first quarter and have a lower interest rate environment for the year.  We expect the second half of 2008 will proceed like this.  ", "Earnings in line with our revised annual expectations:  Beginning with the third quarter in the low to mid $0.70 per share range with improved operating margins.  Further profitability gains in the fourth quarter, driven by the seasonal performance of the Medicare Part D program and by strong high margin sales at Ingenix.  Full year consolidated and commercial Medicare ratios to remain in line.  Continued reductions in run rate operating costs quarter-by-quarter and improved alignment and translation of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s strategy to local market resources and operation across all UnitedHealth Group health benefit businesses.  A common regional structure with strong regional leaders across all of our health benefit businesses to drive more in market coordination and leverage performance across the spectrum of common local market needs and opportunities; pricing and commercial risk underwriting disciplines across the board to deliver premium yields at or above our projected medical cost trend; more effective local engagement in marketing and distribution for commercial health plan businesses.  First phase consolidation and focus of clinical care services across all of our health benefit businesses.  A similar consolidation of technology operations across our entire health benefits enterprise that goes hand in hand with a tighter and simplified technology and capital spending agenda; an enterprise wide commitment to substantially completing all remaining integration efforts by the end of 2010.  An invigorated Medicare Advantage marketing approach for the 2009 open enrollment period, more grass roots in nature with more dedicated to controlled sales and enrollment resources.  Successful preparation and start up for our recent Medicaid market wins; continued growth in generic and mail order drug utilization with a Prescriptions Solutions PBM business; operating cash flows in the range of $4 billion in the second half prior to the consideration of the timing of legal settlement payments.  ", "Advancing these items of the next six months and into 2009 will produce a stronger business, one that is beginning to again perform in the face of challenging market conditions.  ", "We will now turn to a discussion of second quarter financial results.", "Second quarter revenues of $20.3 billion increased 7% all in year-over-year including 3% organic growth.  Revenues in the quarter included $50 million in realized capital gains on fixed income investments as expected.  The consolidated medical care ratio was 83.4% and the UnitedHealthcare medical ratio, excluding national accounts, was 82.9%.  If you include national accounts, the UnitedHealthcare ratio was 83.8%.  There was no net change in our estimates of prior period medical costs in the second quarter, where as last years second quarter results had a $110 million benefit from prior period development.  This represented a 60 basis point variation in the consolidated medical care ratio year-over-year.", "Our operating cost ratio at 14.6% is excessive and reflects an infrastructure size for growth that did not develop in 2008.  We have taken aggressive action to adjust this and expect to remove $500 million in run rate operating costs by the second quarter of 2009 and continued beyond that.", "Second quarter cash flows from operations were $600 million.  This included the unscheduled return of $170 million in deposits to a continuing customer to accommodate its request.  Second quarter 2008 cash flows were also negatively impacted when compared with the second quarter of 2007 by the timing of more than $700 million in income tax payments, which historically would have been made later in the year.  ", "We continue to forecast full year adjusted operating cash flows in the area of $5 billion; this is in the area of 1.3x net income with strong second half cash flow results as government payments are received and working capital is reduced.  We have already collected nearly $500 million in government receivables this month and received notice of another $250 million for August 1, which will bring down our government receivables balance by \u00be of a billion dollars in the third quarter.  We have direct line of site to cash flows from operations in the area of $1.8 to $21 billion in the third quarter and a comparable amount in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to growth trends, on the services side our enterprise services businesses continue to be on track for strong 2008 revenue growth.  Ingenix is positioned for full year revenue growth exceeding 25% and closed the quarter with backlog of $1.8 billion.  Despite some abrupt and unexpected contract cancellations, Ingenix CRO sales activity remained solid and it closed ratio for the first half of 2008 is strong at more than 35% on a dollar basis.  ", "Emerging Ingenix both areas include consulting services under a long-term contract serving payers, providers and the government sector.  We are also starting to see more international sales such as the large North Hampton share primary care trust contract which was secured this month.  ", "OptumHealth has seen continued strong growth in public sector services which partially compensates for the membership shortfalls in its ancillary business within UnitedHealthcare and other commercial benefit carriers.  We are targeting full year revenue growth in the mid to upper single digit percentages. OptumHealth financial services also continues its strong growth momentum with now more than $600 million in assets under management, a 50% year-over-year increase.  ", "As expected Prescription Solutions revenues decreased due to the previously announced reduction in auto assigned Part D business as well as increasing generic drug utilization, which is good for consumers while it strengthens our margin.  ", "The Enterprise Services businesses continue to perform well in the aggregate on growth and earnings metrics.  They are each well situated for growth for long-term performance.  ", "Let me turn to the benefits businesses.  Starting with UnitedHealthcare commercial markets our business remained soft in the second quarter with stable fee based enrollment and a decrease of 95,000 people in risk based products.  The commercial market continues to be characterized by low employment levels, intense economic pressure, and strong competition.  ", "On a full year outlook for an 800,000 or more person decrease in risk based business includes an estimated loss of 350,000 people from PacifiCare and 100,000 in conversions to our fee based offerings.  Participation in fee-based arrangements continues to run more strongly than originally expected with current expectations for stable enrollment this year.", "Including the Fiserv Health and Sierra acquisitions we anticipate 2008 gains of about 900,000 consumers for our commercial business in total, which would be a 3% year-over-year increase. We continue to see our national commercial health plan medical cost trend at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, essentially toward the upper end of this range, with the upward pressure coming from inpatient unit costs in California and the northeast.  Our gross margin pressures relate principally to pricing where we have not seen the yield advances previously expected and forecast.", "Relative to pricing we have not seen changes in the market place for risk based offerings for 2009.  While one can create a case for firming and pricing in the market we are not relying on any improvement in competitive conditions at this time.  I will reiterate that our discipline and long standing underwriting philosophy and approach is to fully price our expected cost trends.  There is no change to that approach and there never has been, but we must become more effective in achieving the premium yields we target and meet.", "To that end we will compete differently going forward.  We are going to be more engaged at the local market level and do a better job in support of local market tactics and execution.  Key differences in regional market structures, cost positions, and competitors mean different markets require different approaches.  The goal is to bring customers the largest and most diverse set of resources in the most local way.  This approach combined with sharper more disciplined underwriting and continuing gains in service and innovations will once more advance our value to customers.", "On the national customer side we bring a comprehensive, integrated set of service offerings combined with excellent medical cost trends driven by distinctive, clinical information and intelligence, effectively aligned medical care management, leading quality designation programs and the broadest network on a single system.  As the 2009 selling season is about half done we don\u2019t yet have a final bead on January 1 results.  At this point we have lost a couple of high profile accounts where we believe the business went to the market at lower price points than we were willing to accept.  Accordingly, we expect some membership decline for January 2009 in this market segment. ", "", "In the Medicaid market place AmeriChoice added 375,000 people this quarter including 55,000 through organic growth putting them slightly ahead of the growth plan at this stage of the year.  We closed the Unison acquisition on May 30, sooner than expected.  Unison\u2019s strength [ph] is our public-sector business in Tennessee and Pennsylvania and adds market presence in northeast Ohio, Delaware, South Carolina, and Washington D.C.", "Two years ago AmeriChoice was struggling.   We reorganized it under new leadership to take better advantage of the UnitedHealth Groups resources and to get closer to its markets.  Today margins have stabilized and we have the number one market share in the state Medicaid market segment.  In just the past 90 days we have seen new market wins or contract extensions in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Washington D.C., and a double win in Tennessee.   I credit Rick Gelnic and Tony Walters and their team for work well done.  Well there is always more to do, in some ways this work represents a template for the directions we are moving in commercial and senior markets. ", "In the senior markets growth results are mixed.  Medicare supplement is on track to add $125,000 seniors.  Evercare is continuing to win new contracts and expand its state based programs in markets such as Texas, Hawaii, and New Mexico.  Hospice while small is growing nicely.", "Most of our growth in Medicare Advantage this year has come from special needs plans rather than SecureHorizons traditional HMO products and accordingly revenues will grow only modestly, roughly 7% organically.  SecureHorizons has the potential to perform better and that is being addressed with new leadership, stronger control of distribution resources, more grass roots focused approaches to sales, marketing and enrollment and adjustments to benefits design at the county level for 2009.", "We have previously discussed the probability issues with special needs plans this year, including for the 80,000 seniors enrolled in our chronic care plan.  We established a $49 million premium deficiency reserve this quarter for those special needs plans, which contributed 30 basis points to our second quarter consolidated medical care ratio.  This reserve is intended to address the loss exposure on these plans of the balance of 2008.  ", "We are confident that our 2009 benefit bids with CMS have fully addressed benefit underwriting issues and we will have more specific comments on product positioning later this year, after their approval in October.  ", "I will move from growth to touch further on operations.   As I noted, we are taking aggressive action to address operating costs.  The goals are to achieve the full benefits of the scale of our enterprise, to better support our local businesses in their regions and to tighten the control processes that led to excessive operating costs relative to our achieved levels of business.  Let me tell you how each of these goals are within reach.", "We are aligning clinical and network organizations and technology operations across our health benefits business unit in an effort to improve their focus, simplify their agenda, and eliminate redundancy.   We will get better basic outcomes at lower costs.  We are accelerating multi-year integrations in businesses like OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare where there is ample opportunity for performance improvements for customers, as well as cost efficiency\u2019s as we consolidate redundant operations and processes.  ", "Our clinical operations will be more local market centered and continue to operate within the boundaries of national clinical policies.  Our relationships with medical societies and professional association and their inputs regarding issues of science and administrative simplicity will continue to be core.  We will continue to have a prominent position and brand supporting clinical excellence which has long been one of the strengths of this organization.  ", "Collectively these activities improve visibility, accountability and speed while freeing up dollars to support investments in local market resources that improve market relationships and responsiveness.  To that end we are also changing our strategy for advertising, promotion and distribution; in the Medicare market in particular to become more grass roots in local markets and much lower in cost. ", "Our final topic this morning is capital.  During an unusual market condition our team has managed our investment portfolio well.  We have avoided material impacts from sup prime investments, auction rate securities and other troubled asset classes and we have prudently generated $103 million in capital gains in the first two quarters.  ", "As of June 30 we have a gross unrealized capital gains position of $100 million and a net unrealized loss position of $52 million.  Our strategy of investing in a diversified mix of high quality securities and generating appropriate risk adjusted returns has been appropriate for this market environment.  ", "We will lower our capital expenditures in 2009 and the supporting expenses will therefore also be lower.  Again, we are focusing our investment agenda on those items which have the greatest favorable impact for customers and our future growth and cutting or deferring items which are lower priorities with lower returns.  ", "For more than ten years we have maintained a strong share buy back agenda.  We have viewed this as the most effective way to use excess capital given our view of the potential for our businesses.  Until the last two to three years that approach has been exceptional.  It was clearly not effective over the last two years or more; however today, even looking at our businesses conservatively, with long-term growth rates, margins, and cash flow levels less than expected for our sector, our shares appear under valued and compelling.  Accordingly, for the near-term we believe continued share repurchase to be more accretive than it has ever been, exceptionally so.  ", "As our businesses perform at more predictable levels and as our equity returns to a more typical valuation, we will continue to assess rebalancing our capital allocations and evaluate dividend levels in light of our size and the strong cash flows we\u2019re capable of consistently producing.  ", "While market conditions are perhaps less predictable than they have been in a decade, we believe the actions we are taking across our businesses will produce a measured performance recovery in 2009 and set the pace for an accelerating performance level going into 2010 and beyond.  We recognize execution is key.  Only through better execution will the financial markets restore fully the valuation we believe the enterprise is worth as a diversified organization.  ", "In the interim as we grow some businesses and turn around others, the sensible path is to pursue the returns we believe we are capable of generating through share repurchase given our level of projected operating cash flows and the low relative stock valuation that I mentioned earlier.", "I will close with a brief summary and some forward-looking comments.  Our focus at this point is on 2009.  I have described the steps we are taking to improve performance.  We are refocusing regionally and locally, strengthening underwriting discipline, reducing operating costs and capital spending levels, correcting senior product benefit membership mix and distribution, opening new Medicaid markets and continuing to execute in our Enterprise services businesses. ", "As we move toward 2009 the results of these steps will be accelerated, but the economic approves.   For 2008 we continue to project revenues to be in the range of $81 billion with earnings of $2.95 to $3.05 per share supported by operating cash flows approaching $5 billion as adjusted.  ", "We appreciate your interest today and we can now move to questions.  I am joined in this room by many of our senior business colleagues, John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, Mike Mikan and others will continue to be available after this call to respond to questions you may have through the course of the day.  ", "\u2026\u2026\u2026..", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS    ", "", "I have a couple of questions, one specifically on the commercial MOR in the quarter it was a little bit better than I had expected and I\u2019m just curious the 83, 3 number that you have out there for the full year, I know it\u2019s plus or minus 50 basis points, but as I look, to get to that number the back half of the year would need to see a significant deterioration in MOR of about, I \u2018m measuring about 250 basis points.  As I look back to last year the MOR was closer to 100 basis points up seasonally.  I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything that you can tell us as far as what you think might change there year-over-year. Where do you think you might be towards the lower end of that plus or minus?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Well Mike can kind of respond to this and then I might comment after his comment.", "Mike Mikan", "", "Justin, we are going to stick with the guidance that we gave three weeks ago of 83.3 plus or minus 50 basis points, but what we\u2019re seeing on a year-over-year basis, or what we expect to see is a heavier utilization in July than we saw last year given that July 4 fell on a Friday this year.  Last year it fell on a Wednesday as I recall and that was a long weekend, so we expect higher outpatient procedures this year for that time period compared to last year.  So it really is driven by that for the third quarter.  ", "Typically I think we\u2019ve said in the past that we expect third quarter to be flat to slightly down from the second quarter.  This year we\u2019ll see it slightly up from the second quarter and then the fourth quarter we continue to expect and I think prudently so, the deductible wear off that will impact the fourth quarter, so I think our estimates are in line with our expectations.  ", "So yes, year-over-year it will be higher this second half than last year.  ", "", "Justin Lake - UBS  ", "", "Okay, and \u2014   ", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Justin we are going to try to keep these to single questions.  We have been allowing too many questions per and have gotten some feedback, so we could keep these to one each.  So, I might move to the next question please.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Charles Boorady with Citigroup.", "Charles Boorady \u2013 Citigroup", "", "What is the biggest challenge to cutting $500 million from your admin cost structure while at the same time trying to improve customer service and does that $500 million include the CapEx reductions that you refer to or would that be in addition to the $500 million?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well it includes the capital expenditures.  There are internal costs that go along with them so it includes that portion of the internal costs, but we really have quite a start on this and I\u2019ll let Dave Whitman kind of respond to give you some of the facts.  ", "David Wichmann", "", "One of the metrics we\u2019re trying to achieve is the reduction of somewhere around 4,000 FTEs in our business and we\u2019ve accomplished about 2,000 of that through June 30 and we have had another 1,200 reductions since that time frame up until today.  So we have about a remainder of 800 to come out, but that will come out net of seasonal adjustments that we need to make for our staffing, which tends to rise seasonally towards the last half of the year, to prepare for the fourth quarter utilization period. ", "So that\u2019s obviously we are managing it very effectively the getting these headcount reductions in place.  The reason why this isn\u2019t nearly as complicated as you might otherwise think is that we did grow quite substantially on a same store basis our FTE counts leading up to about this time last year, so we\u2019re actually still in excess of last years counts as of June 30.  So against that we have also not grown to our expectations so, what we\u2019re really doing is right sizing our labor to respond to the growth budget and materialize and those changes are under our operations area sales local service etc\u2026", "We are also centering our IT agenda on a more narrow set of very important and strategic initiatives and as a result of that we\u2019ll have some labor reductions there as well.  That $500 million does include some portion of non-capitalize able expenses that generally trail our capital expenditures so those will be eliminated as well.  ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Both technology, administration, some areas of what I might call internal operations, I think the orientation towards, as we say, rebalancing towards regions are favoring regions and addressing redundancies on the national side of our metric, those are areas that we have found to be most effective.  We have not really had to look at the service disciplines, etc\u2026 all of those which have improved significantly over the course of the last year, so I appreciate the question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs ", "I was just wondering if you could comment on you capital levels at your subsidiaries, where they are now.  If you could give us an RBC ratio perhaps and what your target is.", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "I think Mike Mikan can best address that.  ", "Mike Mikan", "", "Our RBC levels are over 300%.  I think we\u2019ve said before that we are very well capitalized across all our legal entities. We continue to work with states on getting appropriate from those levels, but we feel we continue to be very well capitalized and consistent with prior years.  ", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs ", "And your outlook just on that, if I could just ask a follow up.  So, what are you assuming, if you can share with us, in terms of dividends from your subsidiaries for the back half of the year?", "Mike Mikan", "We have anticipated that we would have somewhere between $3 and $3 \u00bd billion worth of dividends in 2008 and we expect to have about $2 billion for the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Josh Raskin with Lehman Brothers.", "Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers", "", "I have a question on 2009.  You know Steve I think you did a good job of highlighting some of the pluses and minuses, but could you just sort of outline what are the biggest pluses and minuses, maybe just in the top and could you sort of expand what exactly did the measured performance recovery in 2009 mean?   Does that mean earnings you\u2019re expecting higher earnings in 2009 than 2008?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Well obviously I am not attempting to provide specific guidance on 2009.  I would say, I\u2019ll go back to the comment I made as I closed the formal commentary.  I think that the orientation to the local markets for the commercial businesses, I\u2019ll use that first, is quite potent.   We have a great deal to offer and I think we can be more effective on a market by market basis, making sure we align the right products to the marketplace, optimize our cost structures in those markets and engage, I think, more effectively and I think we have the right leadership in place with respect to that.  So, I think you will see a much more competitive dynamic from United in that basis.", "The same might be said of the SecureHorizons business on a market-by-market basis, particularly in the front end of the business in terms of the sales distribution, enrollment disciplines etc\u2026expect a much stronger business along those lines.  ", "Pricing disciplines, we are committed to commercial pricing disciplines in our risk-based business and we have made the appropriate corrections with respect to our Medicare benefits for 2009.

Is there still an opportunity there?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "We thought that question might come up.  Simon I think is prepared for that.  ", "Simon Stevens", "", "Well Greg, as you know we have had a strategy of deliberately positioning ourselves in favor of network based Medicare Advantage rather than private fee-for-service over the years, because we think we can unleash more value from Medicare that way and because of what we perceive to be a slow blue [ph] risk, if not a risk that is now crystallized in the new law.  ", "So the direct impact on us is minimal, because only around 7% of our Medicare Advantage membership is in private fee-for-service and all those 100,000 or so members 3/4 live in areas either unaffected by the law or where we already have network based alternatives.  The direct specs are minimal but we do think that indirectly the more essentially great the growth opportunities for us, because obviously the end of deeming will mean that perhaps 80% of the private fee-for-service market will now over the next two years have to migrate to a network -based product and that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve been critically positioning ourselves for.  ", "Potentially 1.7 million private fee-for-service members are going to be triggered into shopping and as the largest operator of network based Medicare Advantage with, what 100 still involved perception panel [ph] behind us, we hope to be able to capitalize on that opportunity.  ", "As to the group market the congressional policy changes obviously mean that by 2011 group Medicare Advantage members will have to again move to network based products and that again we see as presenting a meaningful opportunity for us.  In the meantime we are seeing a pleasing upswing in and interest in our group Medicare Advantage for 109 [ph].", "   ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Cheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. ", "Cheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital Group", "", "I would like to delve into your local market strategy a little more to understand this because my questions are related to that.  One isn\u2019t local markets a strategy less efficient, less standardized way of doing business versus a national standardized PPO approach?  How long does it take to roll that out given how broad a distribution of across the country UnitedHealth currently still enjoys and how long will it take to get traction do you estimate and how much will it cost?", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "I might start with a couple of themes and then ask Gail to pick it up, but as I think you know we have operated in what I\u2019ll call a matrix for several years, so we basically maintain a regional structure down to the local markets level and we maintain national, what I\u2019ll call product line and functional structures and we have, in essence, some redundancies in of those and we have been saying for the last year, I think, that there needs to be a rebalancing back towards local market dynamics.  This really is a meaningful step and commitment in that direction; so we have really operated on those two dimensions for some time.  ", "We believe in kind of an 80-20 rule and have for some time, but while there are common elements across markets and you can fully scale and get the leverage of the enterprise and consistency that you reference, but there are meaningful elements that are local in nature, how the products are positioned, the cross structures, the relationships etc\u2026that we have not been taking advantage of those to the extent we could and it has made a difference in terms of our competitiveness on a market by market basis.  This effort is really headed in that direction.  From a cost point of view I actually expect that we will be more effective from a cost structure point of view, because we will adjust our cost structure between the national and local levels.  ", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "Just sort of building on Steve\u2019s comments, first let me start with we still plan to use our leverage on a national scale but deploy that more effectively.  I do think it is about changing and rebalancing from a national and product view that we currently have to a regional and local view.  We had some examples of that already, so isn\u2019t a brand new model to us, we\u2019ve actually been very successful in managing our network contracting under this model for some time.  We have a very strong national oversight in that for example, we have regional leads and local market individuals already deployed and you can see those results in our excellent unit cost results that we\u2019ve driven over a number of years.", "What we are really doing is we are taking that model that was used in network very successfully and aligning our clinical products and our analytical resources.  The other thing that you need to remember, and I think Steve touched on this as well, is we already have our financials organized by region and product so we can take a view of that as well.", "As I sort of sum that up, our focus is on strong regional and market leadership and disciplined local market execution and remember this has to be supported by a simplified operating model and we\u2019ve already taken those steps to go forward to support those tactics, so we\u2019ve reduced our regional structure from six to four; we have new regional leaders in place who know how to execute on this business design; and also have a very strong and deep financial and operational health plan experience.  They know how to do this.  They have been through this before.  As we think about summarizing that, it is going to drive much more specificity on how we take our national resources and deploy them locally.  As we think about that, that is how, I guess, I would summarize.  We are pretty well prepared to execute on it now and that\u2019s where we\u2019re moving forward.

", "So it seems on the surface to be significantly under valued and I am wondering to what extent this under valuation is the result of the extreme approach that you, Aetna or WellPoint take in terms of capital management, meaning virtually no dividends at all.  ", "On the other hand I say if it\u2019s worth 37.5 it\u2019s really exciting, about the prospect of buying it back so far below fair value.  But then I look and I see in the first half of the year we\u2019ve spent $2 billion buying 48 million shares back with an average price of $41.67 and we talk about spending $3 billion for the year which means we\u2019ll spend a billion at a hell of a lot lower price than we\u2019re willing to spend at higher prices. ", "I guess the question is are we really facing coven issues or balance sheet constraints as to why we\u2019re not buying back at least as much in the second half as you bought in the first half.  Then second assuming your policy regarding capital deployment remains the same, that we use our cash flow to buy back equity because we think it\u2019s under valued and I\u2019m not discouraging you by the way from doing that.  ", "Could we assume that next year that the $3 billion that we\u2019re spending this year could be replicated, as a rough idea, assuming no dramatic change in the price of stock, that $3 billion ongoing repurchase program in \u201909 would be a distinct possibility assuming no dramatic change in business or stock price?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Yes.

On the early July call you got the question a number of times and it didn\u2019t, at least the perception was, there wasn\u2019t a real straight answer there, there was a lot of focus on case by case underwriting, focused more on local markets, where as today it just seems like you\u2019re making a much more definitive statement that you are going to price at our above trends in 2009.  Maybe you could just give some color around was that the intention around the pricing strategy for next year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", " I would tell you that the message got through.  There was never an intention in our previous call to signal anything other than a real commitment to disciplined pricing to our cost trends and while I recognize we got into a discussion about how does that play on a case by case basis, the core theme is we are going to price to our price, we are going to price to our cost trends and maintain that discipline and strengthen that discipline down at the local market level which is what Gail has alluded to and we are just confirming that message today.", "There is no change here other than we could have done a better job of discussing it in our last call.

That is slightly up from what we\u2019re seeing this year.  We think it\u2019s prudent to take that view given we have seen some inpatient unit cost trends, as we\u2019ve mentioned over the last several calls, in the northeast as well as the west coast.   We\u2019re really not seeing any dramatic changes other than that.  We have seen some slight up ticks in orthopedic devices and things like that, but nothing dramatic, so we think it\u2019s prudent at this time to forecast 8% plus or minus 50 basis points and that\u2019s where we\u2019re expecting right now.

The first one we underestimated the impact of the mental health parity legislation that was enacted in New York and as a result under priced that business. We will fix that and factor it into 2009 pricing decisions.  The second one is across the boat we\u2019re seeing some overall increase in utilization as a result of more of our consumers accessing their behavioral health benefits, so we\u2019re seeing a slight increase in penetration.

I think we can be more effective in medical cost management and I think we can be more effective in operating cost management; so I think that those things can improve our performance.

First we didn\u2019t see the acceleration that we expected in first quarter.  Second we had a mix shift because of the 800,000 fully insured lives that we\u2019re going to see a decline in and that\u2019s a big driver of what happens and finally this mix of new business is greater than in prior years and again the case-by-case negotiations.

Is that your fair characterization of your assessment?", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "We don\u2019t have a systematic control issue, we have good strong national control, so it really is a mix of business, again, that we can focus back on what happened as we look at the yields.

In terms of the performance of that business it has had some nice steady growth, but its real performance has been driven by the concentration and improvement and penetration of mail order itself and in generic.  I think that has been the story.  We are also in sourcing all our specialty pharma through RX Solutions and while that is evolving that is very good for both our benefit businesses and for RX Solutions itself.  Bill you might have any other comments?", "William Munsell ", "", "No I think you said it well.  2008 has been a year where Prescription Solutions has been focusing on improving generic penetration and the results have been nice in that area and also improving mail service penetration and those results have been productive and as Steve said then, we\u2019re pleased with the progress so far from the standpoint that it not only lowers costs but improves our margin in that business.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James", "How about if you look externally, are you seeing anybody particularly aggressive on price and changing the dynamics in that business or is it pretty much steady stayed compared to last year?", "William Munsell ", "My experience would e that it is a competitive market.  It always has been a competitive market, but I haven\u2019t seen any significant change in dynamics.  Does that answer your question?", "Michael Baker - Raymond James", "Thanks.

The industry has remained relatively disciplined on pricing the last few years.   That combined with a slowing economy, I\u2019m just wondering first of all if you agree with this hypothesis that we\u2019re at a point now where it\u2019s just getting more and more difficult for employers to afford some of the managed care risk products.  Would you agree with that hypothesis and if so what does United do about that?", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "In terms of pressure on benefit affordability, I think that has been in the environment for some time and it\u2019s always a relative thing, but we continue to see employers supporting benefits, carrying benefits and being very much committed to them and actually integrating them more and more with their total employee relationship and approach to their workforce.", "What we\u2019ve seen employers do is then pursue the products that have lower content, have a consumer engagement element, and begin to engage the consumer, as we\u2019ve said for years, into participating in this health relationship with them.  We are actually seeing more commitment than ever on the employer\u2019s side to engaging on that kind of level, which actually gets them more involved in the benefits and they\u2019re seeing positive things. ", "Our trends for many or our large clients have been quite exceptional this year, as they have engaged in these kinds of programs. ", "Gail, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d like to add color to that.  ", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "I think affordability is absolutely an issue that employers are very focused on.  We have a broad portfolio leading consumers and platforms and we\u2019re seeing and continuing to end spring new products to market.  Those are tailored based on the specific market needs, but in a small group we see a continuing purchasing of linear benefit products and continuing buying of those, so I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that trend.  The upper end, consumer engagement continues to be an important position and that\u2019s an area where innovation I think, serves us extremely well.   So we are very focused on good product design and then secondarily, actually it\u2019s very important is helping to manage the medical costs and renew focus on that; so both of those tie very much into the affordability discussion.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So while your premise that there is tension and what I might characterize as health care crisis, that\u2019s almost a prevailing environment and more and more I think are relevant to, as an industry, to the marketplace to be able to provide these benefits and manage costs effectively and help employers and their employees.

Maybe you can answer that question by explaining a little more specifically what the 300,000 lives that are the specific lives that are not the conversions but the other 350,000 lives. What were those lives? Were they small group, mid group, were they geographically specific, were they product specific?", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "Let me clarify this is, again, a balanced strategy. We have strong national underwriting controls and we manage this again, pricing is managed on a market product segment specific basis, so it\u2019s the combination of the national controls with local insights, because pricing again is both mathematical as well as assessment of the market conditions.  So again, we\u2019re pricing to beat our cost trends.  ", "Getting back to sort of that distribution question you asked.  As we look at the overall numbers it breaks down between as you said 350,000 from PacifiCare, 100,000 from conversions, roughly 100,000 in just attrition in the books and then it\u2019s a balance between our small book of business and our middle market.  We do see a concentration, again, in certain states and California being one of those.  ", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "I might also broadly suggest to you that we talk about pricing, but it\u2019s really a broad underwriting dynamic and it\u2019s really putting the right product and basically crafting a solution for a customer that will perform for the customer and drive the margins that we\u2019re looking for from an underwriting point of view and that takes a degree of intimacy that has to be achieved at the local market level.", "Before we go I might just touch again on a couple of the themes for the quarter.  That basically our results were in line with what we had reported three weeks ago. There are strong elements of our business that are growing quite well, including AmeriChoice, Ingenix, our enterprise services businesses and in the businesses that are more challenged, we are taking actions to improve our growth and financial performance and to strengthen our operations across the board.

", "We would characterize this quarter as solid, with strong execution; a sharp focus on cost control and continued quality and service advances; active engagements on healthcare modernization; continued innovation in the marketplace and ongoing diversification of our business, highlighted by the proposed acquisition of Health Net\u2019s Northeast licenses and a significant contract award from the Department of Defense. ", "Today we\u2019ll discuss our results and outlook, some of our innovation activities, and some thoughts on the key elements needed to modernize and not just reform healthcare in the US. Starting with revenues, we now expect revenues for 2009 to approach $87 billion, up from our expected range back at the start of the year of $85 billion to $86 billion. ", "Strengthening revenues from public and senior customers in both our benefits and services businesses is expected to offset intensified recessionary pressures across the commercial benefits sector. This market balance reflects one of the values of our diversified business model. ", "On the Health Benefits side, our second quarter revenues increased $1.3 billion or 7% year-over-year. We have added 785,000 people in public and senior programs to-date in 2009. This is entirely organic growth. We are better organized and focused around our end markets and have elevated our performance in sales, marketing and distribution. Our Medicare Advantage growth of 245,000 people year-to-date is the best we have posted in several years and it has advanced with a risk profile similar to our existing business. ", "Looking to the future, our Public and Senior Markets Group will be further strengthened under the Tricare Southern Region contract awarded to us last week, covering services to 3 million people. This is one of the largest scale assignments we have undertaken. Tricare will further diversify our mix of business, adding military healthcare to our health benefits businesses, and allowing us to leverage our distinctive capabilities for our Armed Forces and their families. ", "In our Commercial Benefits businesses, through the first six months, group retention has improved year-over-year. However, overall attrition driven by the economy is significant, accounting for nearly half of our decrease in consumers served. Focusing on the second quarter alone, half of the membership change in full-risk business resulted from employment attrition, and attrition also constituted more than 100% of the net change in our fee-based business. ", "We expect some moderation in attrition for the back half of the year, given the normal quarterly patterns and given that the rate of increase in national unemployment is expected to moderate. Depending on attrition levels, we project a full year decline in the area of 1.5 million people in total. ", "We are holding to our pricing and underwriting disciplines on risk business. Customers and prospects are showing mounting interest in our ability to fundamentally control medical cost growth while driving quality. ", "Consultants and employers are responding positively to our eSync capability introduced in 2009. eSync uses advanced real time analysis of clinical data, multichannel outreach and consumer coaching to engage consumers in their own healthcare, to support prevention and wellness programs, and to significantly impact, help decision making. ", "Revenue generation on the services side of our business is strong despite the weak economy, increasing $458 million or 9% year-over-year in the quarter. OptumHealth continues to offset commercial membership losses with public sector revenue growth and innovative product offerings such as their integrated payroll and medical care. ", "Ingenix continued to produce solid growth in the public and payer sectors, in areas such as consulting services and software sales and installation, and Prescription Solutions had another strong quarter led by growth in senior business and in specialty pharmaceutical revenue. ", "Moving to medical costs, the consolidated medical care ratio for the second quarter of 83.6% and the commercial medical care ratio of 84.2% were well within our range of expectations. The slight year-over-year increase was largely a result of the H1N1 virus, as well as overall public sector mix at the consolidated level. ", "Our MCR outlook for the year remains unchanged. These results reflect consistent and progressive execution around pricing and medical cost management. One example of this work is the value AmeriChoice delivers in Michigan, compared with both the state\u2019s fee-for-service program as well as average competitor performance. ", "AmeriChoice\u2019s personal care model emphasizes primary care and prevention. Our members have 42% more physician office visits and 36% fewer outpatient hospital visits than those under the fee-for-service model. We believe this ensures more appropriate use of healthcare dollars and produces meaningful savings to the Michigan Medicaid programs. ", "Another example; we are directing increasing volumes of business to those care providers who distinguish their performance and receive premium designation recognition. Premium designation identifies those doctors who meet quality and cost efficiency standards, now nearly 100,000 physicians in 138 markets that cover nearly 20 million members. These clinicians represent about one-sixth of our UnitedHealthcare network and drives strong quality and better affordability, with consistent cost savings of up to 20%. ", "Our operating cost performance was also strong through the first half. Today we are supporting an $87 billion business, with nearly the same monthly run rate in operating costs that supported an $81 billion business at the start of 2008. We are pushing optimal resource utilization to fully realize scale benefits across all operating cost areas. Capital expenditures also drive operating costs and our CapEx run rate for the first six months of 2009 was down to three-quarters that of the first six months of 2008. ", "Our quality and service performance have significantly improved year-over-year. As is often the case, those go hand-in-hand with increasingly favorable operating cost performance. One example would be physician call service satisfaction, which improved 14 percentage points to 89% over the past six quarters. Overall, we are producing the strongest service statistics across our businesses that we have ever recorded.", "So perhaps a few comments as to what first-half 2009 performance means for our outlook. We expect this year\u2019s revenue growth in public and senior business to continue to more than offset the potential for further pressure in the employer market. In the second half of 2009, quarterly revenues for AmeriChoice, Ingenix, Ovations and Prescription Solutions should be up double digit percentages year-over-year. ", "Quarterly revenues for OptumHealth are expected to advance slightly by a high single digit percentage and for UnitedHealthcare to be flat to down slightly year-over-year, depending on attrition and revenues from investment income. We expect 2009 operating earnings to be in a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, and net earnings to be in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion; supported by strong cash flows from operations of approximately $5 billion. ", "Our capital priorities remain consistent. First, we spun the internal development of our businesses. Next we used strategic acquisitions to deepen our businesses, expand or diversify our platform or acquire new capability. Then we returned excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase at prices below our estimate of our intrinsic value.", "In the current environment, we see increased opportunities for targeted acquisitions. In June we acquired AIM, which positioned Ingenix as the market leader in payment accuracy solutions for payers and hospitals. ", "Last evening we announced pending cash purchase of Health Net\u2019s Northeastern licenses in its Medicare business and Medicaid business and rights to renew its commercial membership in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. We believe the geographic and product fit are excellent, the terms are fair, and we expect our resources and cost structure to drive meaningful value for customers in this business.", "We expect to have a conservative year-end debt to total capital ratio in the range of 33% to 35%, and to repurchase about $2.5 billion worth of shares this calendar year. This all suggests as we said earlier, earnings at the upper end of our prior outlook, in a range of $3.00 to $3.15 a share.", "One of the reasons we are able to maintain these positive results is our commitment to driving innovations that consistently deliver medical cost savings for customers while helping improve health outcome. For example, a core group of progressives national self-funded customers that represent more than 7 million consumers. That group has seen a four year medical cost trend at 5% per year, with the last two calendar years running under 4% as our cost control program have matured into this group. ", "Our medical cost per member per month to deliver networked based Medicare Advantage benefits is at or below the federal government\u2019s cost for the same benefits in the majority of our county markets. These cost savings contribute to funding valuable benefits that senior consumers receive from our private programs that are not available in the government\u2019s historic Medicare Indemnity plan.", "Individual states continue to turn to the private sector to manage their public program obligation, including our recent success in securing 65,000 CHIP participants in Mississippi. States pursue this course because they value our ability to innovate and manage overall medical and administrative costs, rather than relying solely on provider price control.", "We are also growing our total care management and consulting businesses. Our enterprise services customers, including foreign governments are seeking specific expertise on how to capture and use clinical data and lower cost trend and improve results around clinical quality. ", "When we apply our experience, innovation, and economies of scale to specific healthcare challenges, we have real world evidence that we control costs on a sustained level, with higher quality and greater choice and access. For example, we are partnering with the March of Dimes to reduce scheduled premature Caesarian section births. The New England Journal of Medicine highlighted early C-sections as a driver of significant neonatal intensive care services, stressful for families and expensive to the health system. ", "The majority of people with diabetes do not comply with the guidelines for prevention and treatment. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to serious complications such as heart attacks, kidney damage and strokes. ", "Our enhanced benefit diabetes health plan, targets those suffering from diabetes or pre-diabetes, guides them to physicians with documented success in treatment and provides continuing education on the management of their disease and the importance of routine care. Using one large employer as an example, diabetics who complied with their care costs less than 40% less than noncompliant diabetics.", "Our drug interaction alert program flags incoming prescriptions and alerts physicians to potential adverse drug events. This process improves patient safety and quality of life, while saving on estimated $13,000 for every adverse event avoided and just last week, we introduced Connected Care, the first national Teleheath network in conjunction with Cisco. ", "This initiative combines advanced technology to link people in underserved areas with our network of primary physicians and specialists in our clinical support. I am sure you are picking up on the heavy use of examples of innovation and cost management in this morning\u2019s prepared comments, it is not an accident. ", "Practical real world innovation and cost containment experience have been at the core of our participation in Washington for several months now. Much of the current policy debate is focused on what form of tax, surtax or embedded healthcare tariffs will pay for expanded healthcare coverage. We are hoping more energy will be spent on proven private sector innovation that could slow the rate of cost growth and improve quality, which we believe are the only means to really expand coverage to more Americans in a way that its obtainable. ", "We\u2019ve been getting to an outcome that truly modernizes our health system requires legislation that focuses on costs and consistent care quality by modernizing the healthcare system, not just expanding coverage or raising taxes; legislation that respects the complex in critical inter-linkages among all the components of the care system, that sets clear public policy performance goals, standards and milestones and then holds the private sector accountable, to deliver against them over a reasonable timeframe and has meaningful, broad bipartisan public and political support. ", "In this context, the past quarter we advanced two sets of research to enrich the discussion. We identified a sample list of 15 categories of costs where UnitedHealth Group and others in the private sector have existing real world programs in place that could strengthen the performance of traditional Medicare, and could reduce pressure on the trust fund. ", "We estimate savings for Medicare from using innovative programs to be more than $1.5 trillion over a ten-year period. Importantly, none of our suggestions reduce fee schedules for physicians or hospitals, all of our recommendations involve more effective use of medical resources and the health system in total. ", "Second, we look more broadly at the health system to identify opportunities to improve and simplify the administrative processes that support care delivery. Again, we used existing technology and innovation that has already been advanced in the private sector. We estimate these administrative savings could exceed $300 billion over 10 years, with concerted public policy and private sector action across the entire health sector to adopt more common basic data and transactional standards. ", "All parties would benefit; government, care providers, payers and individuals. We bring these proposals forward and will continue to bring others forward with a simple agenda. We believe our country should build an employer based coverage, instead of public health dollars only where coverage needs are most challenged. ", "We believe progressive, affordable coverage should be available to all Americans and that they should have access to quality care and we want to encourage and reward efficient high quality care and advance the use of modern healthcare technology, information and evidence based standards. ", "We are looking forward. We are seeing the possibilities for both, social success and business growth that will come from a progressively more modernized health system. We also see future new markets with new demands, including international markets, that share with the US the common need for improving the healthcare system and reducing costs that we can help address in market in a specific ways. ", "Before opening up for questions, let\u2019s reemphasize a couple of observations. Our operational performance has improved markedly year-over-year, we are actively engaged in Washington DC and inside our company seeking to contribute to the health reform movement and to advocate and drive innovation and modernization internally by our actions. ", "Our enterprise touches a community of 70 million individual Americans. We focus on directing core capabilities, not just products to better serve that community year-by-year and we invest in innovations to better support the people we serve. UnitedHealth Group is strong financially and has maintained an appropriately conservative balance sheet.", "These attributes, collectively position our enterprise to evolve and even lead change in healthcare, in its delivery, change that is inevitable with or without federal healthcare reform. We see change as our ultimate opportunity. Change provides us the opportunity to create an even more significant and diverse enterprise serving the needs of Americans across this immense and growing social marketplace and that is what we intend to continue doing. We thank you. ", "At this time, we would like to open it up for your questions and discussion.", "Questions-and-Answers Session ", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital.", "", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital ", "My first question is just on the Medicare strategy for 2010. You guys didn\u2019t mention it on the call, but there\u2019s been a lot of discussion. So maybe we could just sort of set the record straight as to what was going on there. ", "Then, if I can ask a follow-up, just I didn\u2019t hear any comments at all about COBRA and I was wondering if you had any thoughts there.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. First, I know there will be interest around Medicare through the course of the day, but you need to appreciate the fact that we are really right in the midst of a process of finalizing bids with CMS. It is a part of our routine process and we are going to be very limited in terms of what we can say, if anything with respect to where the bids stands right now, because they are truly deliberating on finalizing bids and we need to respect that process. ", "So I\u2019m not sure there is a lot more we can shed light on in terms of where our 2010 bids will stand. I could ask Larry Renfro to comment further on that if he would.", "Larry Renfro", "Josh, its Larry Renfro. What I might start out with is to talk a little bit about the CMS bid process, we kind of look at it in three steps. The first step starts at the beginning of the year, really gets going about the March, April timeframe and we receive the CMS reg letter and then we start, what I would call our interpretation and preparation of the bid, getting ready for the June, 1 submission.", "We kind of call this obviously the bid preparation and submission step. Then it moves into the second step on June 1, and that step goes from a timeframe of June to August, September and one key component I\u2019d like to bring out talking about CMS, is that CMS is a customer and we have to treat CMS as a customer. ", "I use an example, if you were thinking of a corporate customer that you were dealing with and you were working on a proposal with a corporate customer, then as you were working through that you wouldn\u2019t be disclosing that information to anyone. So we treat CMS in that same capacity and when we start working with them, we start by trying to go through the clarity of our bid. ", "We\u2019d talk and go back and forth, and we try to really hit poles, what I would call the final bid approval. Again, that\u2019s the step that we are in today, and so that\u2019s why it\u2019s premature and would only be academic for us to talk about exactly where the details on our bids are at. Obviously the third step is when the bid is approved and it is made public and that\u2019s normally in the late September, early October timeframe.", "", "We are caught in a position where we are so into the stages of final deliberation and approval. We are going to be quite limited in terms of what we can say about those bids, and I think we can hopefully be in a position where we can get into it either later as the year progresses and the bids become final, and public.", "", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital ", "Maybe I didn\u2019t ask it well, but I guess just curious from your point, just strategically as you think about 2010, or not necessarily specifically 2010, but your bids, were they submitted sort of letter of the law or I think the big question is what happens if there\u2019s doc fixed and there\u2019s no change to your reimbursement? I guess that\u2019s the main question.", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "The best way I could answer it, under the circumstances, with CMS reviewing these right now is that I think our initial bids were made in a CMS compliant fashion. There has been, as Larry described, kind of a natural engagement in that as they deliberate, and I really can\u2019t comment in terms of how the final benefits and bids will come out. ", "I would say globally that, just given the approach that CMS has taken, that there will be pressure in the private sector Medicare. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret to anyone, that we are responding in terms of how we will be positioning our business in 2010, really focusing on how we are going to manage medical costs, operating costs, how we are going to go to market and so forth. ", "I\u2019m not sure that there is really that much difference in terms of how the approaches that have been taken to Medicare, at least for our book this year for us, other than the fact that we see an administration that is putting pressure on the program itself.", "Larry Renfro", "Gail is on the line. Gail, do you want to comment on COBRA?", "Gail Boudreaux", "A little bit of perspective on what\u2019s happening with COBRA. Essentially it\u2019s played out pretty much as we expected. As we look at our fully insured membership over the first few quarters, it\u2019s grown, which we would have expected as part of the stimulus and just the increasing unemployment.", "At the start of the year, we were at approximately 1.5% of our risk based enrollment that was in COBRA; that represents about 2%. As we look at COBRA, again, we believe that it is covered in the guidance we gave in terms of our loss ratio, and again, that is played out pretty much as expected. The take-up rates are essentially the same as we had projected, which is roughly in that 20% range.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Any change in the MLRs on that book, has it gotten any better?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Again as I said, COBRA members historically do consume more, but we have it projected in our loss ratio at the 84% plus or minus 50%, which is what we had assumed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "", "Yes. Maybe I could pick up on that theme a bit here, and just could you tell us what you are seeing generally in terms of commercial medical cost trends as compared to the last quarter, and maybe elaborate a little bit on the H1N1 impact. In specifically what areas of utilization that's impacting and the extent to which so far as you can tell, you see that continuing into the third quarter?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think let\u2019s deal with it first on a consolidated basis. Mike, do you want to respond?", "Mike Mikan", "With respect to commercial trends, we are not seeing anything different than what we\u2019ve said or expected in the past. We see continued pressure on unit costs, we are seeing continued moderation of utilization which has been consistent for periods now, and we don\u2019t see any dramatic change in any one of the cost categories.", "With respect to H1N1, we did see an up-tick in services related to H1N1. It costs us roughly $50 million in the quarter. I would say it\u2019s a little different from the typical flu season. We didn\u2019t see the same drug utilization or the same inpatient admissions related to the H1N1 virus. ", "So we suspect that it was related to a fair amount of advice and services in the physician office or through the ER, with the idea that they had H1N1 and it didn\u2019t ultimately result in that, but we did see a significant amount of additional physician services related to H1N1 in the quarter.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "So office visits and diagnostic testing and that sort of thing. Maybe if you could, just in terms of the outlook for the back part of the year, are you continuing to look at the same expected slope in the MCR, related to in-part a higher uptake of high deductible products?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I would start off globally Matt. I\u2019m sure this question will come up and I\u2019ll try to head it off with the pass. Our medical loss ratio was well within the guidance that we gave at the investor conference. If you recall, we expected a consolidated medical care ratio to increase about 50 basis points or so to 82.7% plus or minus 50 basis points for the consolidated group.", "That was related to mix, as we discussed last quarter and previously that we were going to have a greater weight of government business versus the commercial business, which has played out that way, in addition to the fact that we had, within the government business, we had a greater mix of private fee-for-service, which is a higher loss ratio and the fact that we had improved our benefits to be more competitive broadly in the MA space.", "So, that played itself out and we are seeing that in the second quarter. You didn\u2019t see as much of that in the first quarter and it was favorable. We did have a significant amount of favorable development in the first quarter, so that was with respect to the first quarter. With respect to the remainder of the year, on a consolidated basis, if you take out reported development, you should see a pretty similar rate of change pattern for the remainder of the year as you saw in 2008.", "With respect to commercial, we do expect that you will see higher loss ratios in the second half of the year and that will be related to the seasonal pattern that you noted for deductible wear-off. ", "We also expect continued COBRA up tick for the remainder of the year and Dan Schumacher said that in the first order and we also have vis-\u00e0-vis last year, there is a higher day content or work day content in the second half of the year, this year versus the first half of the year. So you will see a natural seasonal progression for the remainder of the year for the UnitedHealthcare loss ratio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Carroll - Stifel.", "Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel", "Just a couple of quick administrative questions. You mentioned $1.5 million enrollee loss for the year. Is that in total, or was that just the commercial business and then secondly, just going forward, should we assume that your annual tax rate now will be 35%?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think the first one answer is commercial. The second, Mike?", "Mike Mikan", "35% to 35.5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks, I just first a question on the Medicaid business and if you could hone in on how margins performed relative to plan in the second quarter. Then just two topical questions in Medicaid, one being if you saw any swine flu impacts there and then also just talk about sort of mix changes and if there is any cost impact from an increasing mix of commercial members coming in due to rising unemployment.", "Rick Jelinek", "We have experienced some moderately higher outpatient and physician costs this past quarter, partially due to H1N1 that both Mike and Steve referred to and partially due to what we refer to the new member durational effect, where new members coming into Medicaid tend to use higher services it\u2019s dominantly outpatient and physician. ", "In the first for to six months of their enrollment in our plan and this usually wanes off thereafter and so, from that standpoint, these new members costs were contemplated and are in our full year outlook. I think I covered that; anything Scott asked you\u2019d add in there?", "Stephen Hemsley", "He was asking if margins could be\u2026", "Rick Jelinek", "Yes, from a margin perspective, we are very comfortable that we are performing in along the range. Obviously, our revenue outlook as we mentioned previously, has been at the lower end of the range, but we counteracted that with some unit cost pass-throughs that have come from the state.", "We have also done a good job with our medical cost management and lastly, as it relates to our operating costs, we have generated efficiencies there. So from a performance standpoint, we are very comfortable with where we stand today and we\u2019ll continue to see growth through the end of this year and probably into next year as a result of the unemployment and economic conditions.", "", "John Penshorn", "Rick, this is John Penshorn. I\u2019ve got a clarifying question for you. You mentioned revenue was at the low end of the range. Are you referring to the company\u2019s total revenue, or are you talking about the rates of reimbursement?", "Rick Jelinek", "Thank you, John. As it relates to base revenue increases from the state for this year, we have locked down to date about 95% of our member months, so we are very comfortable with the rate outlook, at least from the base rate coming from the states for this calendar year. So, all in all, we\u2019re performing in and around the range of expectation that we have set for this year and membership is slightly higher due to the economic condition.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "If I could just ask a follow up, just maybe an early read on the 2010 national account season. I know it\u2019s still early here, but maybe if you can just touch specifically on number of accounts out to bid, average case sizes, and maybe just the level of fee competition that you\u2019re seeing out there or for \u201810 relative to 2009.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Gail, do you want to respond to that? Gail Boudreaux? She is not with us this morning. She is on a hookup so she is probably having technical difficulties.", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail. Let me start with reiterating your point, it is still pretty early in the national account selling season, but I\u2019ll give you a few points of context for what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. One, in total, the proposal volume that we\u2019re seeing is pretty equivalent to a year ago.", "It\u2019s not slightly higher on the lower end of the market and by the lower end, we would think of that as employers with 10,000 to 20,000 employees. The reason I point that out, that is a bit different from the 2008 cycle where we saw a lot of the very large jumbo accounts out for market. This year, that\u2019s relative to last year, it\u2019s a bit lighter.", "The other point of context, I think in terms of the market is that, with smaller employers out to the marketplace, what we\u2019re seeing is a bit of a later cycle in decision-making going past what would be the normal timeframe, which would be about around now where the employers are making decisions. In terms of what they\u2019re looking for, what\u2019s important to them right now is management on the total healthcare spend and total healthcare costs.", "As Steve pointed out, I think in his earlier comments that\u2019s been positive for us, because clinical capabilities like eSync and our ability to help manage consumer behavior in our consumer directed products I think are resonating very well with the consulting market. Overall, it continues to be a competitive marketplace on the C side. I think that gives you a bit of a perspective what\u2019s happening on national accounts. So, we think over the next few months it will play out, given the size of the proposals in the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Rex - JP Morgan.", "John Rex - JP Morgan", "So kind of maybe perhaps a bigger-picture question here. I realize today is only July 21, but there\u2019s some fairly obvious headwinds to operating earnings growth for everyone as you look out to next year and 2010, I think about lower commercial member months; I think about Medicare rates. Do you guys done some offsets Tricare, things like that.", "I was wondering if you could just kind of, from a big-picture perspective, understanding you are not guiding to 2010, kind of prioritizes some of those, because it would seem like a challenging year for operating earnings growth, given some of those components.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I think maybe I can respond maybe broadly on this. I think you have to recognize that it is July 21, so it\u2019s a little early, but certainly 2010 looks like a challenging year for us and I actually think it will be for everyone and for every industry in this country.", "We will assume unemployment growth will likely advance at a slower pace, but we also don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve necessarily quite hit bottom. I think, perhaps most significant to 2010, we will not assume any real meaningful employment gain in 2010. We will also keep to our pricing discipline, so that will continue to be kind of a commercial membership pressure.", "However, also as Gail just pointed out, we are really seeing some positive response to UnitedHealthcare in total on our offerings in 2009. We expect that response to only get stronger, not only in terms of effectiveness in terms of how well we\u2019re managing medical cost at a fundamental level, but also as we have very balanced back to local markets, there has been a very positive response to that.", "We expect Medicare margins will be under pressure given the general climate of the 2010 premium rates, but we also expect to perform strongly in sales, in medical and operating cost management. I think as Rick pointed out, AmeriChoice should continue to steadily grow and strengthen and they really have been performing quite well over the last year or more, and we expect that to continue.", "I think the military healthcare should also contribute, although modestly in 2010 and I think our services business, it should be another very solid growth year like 2009 is playing out. Then lastly, I would say that we\u2019re not assuming that investment yields will recover significantly in 2010, and that has been a factor for our 2009 comparative.", "So, we have been operating through 2009 with a view, given the weighting of our overall benefit businesses that we will have a lot of work and as you say John, \u201cheadwind\u201d to make 2010 come out well, but we are really focused on that and I think we probably tell from the commentary, we have pretty good inventory and assessment of where our businesses are, and we are very focused as a team on 2010, but it is a challenging environment. I think those comments will kind of give you a sense of each across the businesses.", "John Rex - JP Morgan", "It maybe too early to call, but at this point would you say, if you\u2019re looking out, you\u2019d be pleased to be able to get the kind of a flat operating earnings for 2010, given if particularly the commercial member months issue? Would that be considered, do you think kind of a good achievement or are you willing to characterize that yet?", "Stephen Hemsley", "John, I applaud your efforts for trying, but I think it\u2019s really too early to offer that kind of view. I would say there is very positive momentum inside the enterprise we are operating, I think at a very strong level, but it is the very challenging marketplace in total. There\u2019s a lot going on in healthcare and I think it\u2019s just premature for us to really comment further.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Lake - UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "A couple of questions, first on days claims payable, which were up a little bit more than two days sequentially. That looks like a pretty strong number compares to last year where you were actually purposefully increasing reserves, because of some issues there on the commercial business look like a whole lot of others. ", "So, I\u2019m just wondering if you can parse out that increase, between what might be typical white noise versus what you might have embedded into reserves in terms of conservatism this quarter around things like corporate take up and the H1N1 pressure?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We\u2019ll just take this one straight off. I think Mike is the best to answer this.", "Mike Mikan", "We do, as we disclose overtime, our days payable does go up. It starts low at the beginning of the year and rise throughout the year as the Part D seasonality plays itself out during the quarters, as I think you know, Justin. We did have an increase sequentially, I would say flat year-over-year though and the sequential increase, the bulk of it is related to seasonality in Part D, it\u2019s about 1.4 days.", "You probably won\u2019t like this answer, but it\u2019s up roughly three days, but it rounds, when you get to the actual days, it rounds to about up 2.1 days. Some of that is related to COBRA, H1N1, but I would say the majority of the change is related to what we typically experience during the year. Justin, as always we book to our best estimates. I wouldn\u2019t call them conservatism per say, what our best estimates on reserves are.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Then just a quick question on SG&A looks like, it was down about $100 million sequentially after adjusting for New York. When I had the first two quarters up, you are close to that 14% number versus guidance, which I think is 14.6%. So clearly, it looks like you\u2019re doing a little bit better there. I\u2019m wondering if you can just kind of parse out the drivers here. Is this good number to kind of use going forward? Basically, do you expect to be toward below that guidance point on SG&A?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think, I will have Mike respond to guidance and then if we want to add color in terms of what we\u2019re doing in there, we\u2019ll have Dave Wichmann respond.", "Mike Mikan", "As you know Justin, 2008 we came into the year approximately what we called $500 million overstaffed vis-\u00e0-vis versus the volume actuals that we had versus the expectations. So, we setout to reduce our operating cost run rate by about call it $40 million a month to say. We were running, at that point in time back in the first quarter of 2008 at about $1 billion a month. ", "In May, we were actually slightly under $1 billion a month. So, we took a lot of action. We reduced headcount by about 5000 FTEs as we disclosed. The sequential change from Q1 to Q2 is really related to, as you know we ramp up costs and resources coming into the year and then it takes about until about April 1 or so to ramp those costs back down to the normalized levels for the year. ", "So the sequential change is really related to seasonal workforce FTEs coming out. We will see the strongest quarter in the second quarter and then as, we\u2019ll start to ramp back up in the third and the fourth quarter, related to fulfillment and seasonal resources needed to staff up for the next year.", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave, do you want to comment on the kinds of things we are looking at?", "", "Dave Wichmann", "As you know, for about the last 30 months or so, we have been very much focused on continuing to advance quality in our core operating performance and the good news behind that is that lower cost has become a very nice byproduct of that higher quality, as well as several initiatives around automation. Rather than talk about the past, what I\u2019d maybe just give you some comfort that not only we have built some momentum but we will carry this going forward as well.", "We have, like I said, we\u2019ve seen nice advancement in quality and we\u2019ve really been focused on defect elimination. That activity has improved our service quality to the levels that Steve talked about in his opening remarks. The best that we\u2019ve seen in this company, at least in the decade that I have been here, we are continuing to advance the EDI, but not the same kind of EDI that we focused on in the past.", "Our focus now is more on remittance and posting and I know that doesn\u2019t sound really elaborate, but it is a very high cost driver in our business and you can actually see that in option number four and working paper number two as the high cost driver for the industry and that\u2019s why we\u2019re intensely focused on that as well. We are also nearing a point where our decommissioning activity on our old systems is beginning to take root. ", "We have managed to get off of a number of our acquired systems platforms and we are just doing claim run out on a number of those, but over the course of the next year or so, we will continue to advance our integration agenda and continue to move off those systems and as you might suspect those, when we move off those, we get a pretty substantive benefit associated with lower maintenance costs, but also, we get the benefit of the substantial scale that exist on our destination platforms.", "", "Stephen Hemsley", "I just a couple of other things if I may you\u2019ve seen us really focus our capital investments and I give a lot of credit to our finance team around this, but we have gotten very disciplined around the way in which we deploy capital over the course of the last couple of years in particular and we are very focused on enterprise-wide applications and reusability across the expanse of our business as opposed to maybe investing in individual applications business by business.", "Last thing I will just comment on is as we have become a more global company, we are very focused on how we source our labor, particularly around processing as well as technology development and maintenance and we are doing so in much more cost-effective locations where we can get an abundance of skilled labor. ", "So, I would expect us to continue to advance our operating cost agenda and to continue to advance productivity in particular. This would be real productivity somewhere in the range of 3% to 5% per year.", "", "Dave Wichmann", "Justin, to clarify on the run rate, the Q2 run rate is a good run rate, but it will be increasing for the remainder of the year.

Do you think we are entering a period that is the same or different from kind of the BBA \u201898 to 2002 period?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I will offer kind of a global kind of response and then maybe ask Tony Welters and Larry Renfro to also offer their views. I think that the programs have been successful. I think they are recognized as having been successful and I think they are also recognized for the value they bring and the innovation.", "At the same time, I think there is going to be real rigor applied to these programs and I think that it is going to be a more rigorous environment would be the way I would describe it, but also one that I think could be pretty opportunistic, because I think that there are challenges, just broadly, in the Medicare sector.", "There are challenges in terms of what the underlying costs are; there\u2019s obviously demographic trends that are moving in that direction. I think the trust funds are under some degree of pressure and I think in that situation, we offer the private sector a lot of good opportunity and a lot of solutions in response to those very real needs and that\u2019s why we have thought that this has been a compelling market for sometime.", "It\u2019s large; it has a interesting, diverse senior population that\u2019s growing; and it has real needs with respect to delivering quality care at lower cost. I think we have great resources to offer the country, if you will, with respect to that need. Tony, Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "This is Larry Renfro. This goes back to I think a comment that, Steve made earlier. I believe, from a focus and execution standpoint, if we concentrate ourselves on sales, the medical and operating costs, couple that with the opportunity that it\u2019s going to present itself in the industry, we really believe there is a huge opportunity here to move forward and a lot of this is just going to have to do with us executing and that\u2019s the plan.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "So, can I ask two yes or no questions? Do you expect the market to shrink as it did post-BBA, yes or no? Do you expect payments not to keep up with medical trends for multiple years, yes or no?", "Tony Welters", "It\u2019s Tony Welters. I don\u2019t like to answer yes or no questions, because I don\u2019t know. I will say this. The MA program is a maturing program now. The government is more experienced with it now. As a result, they\u2019re pushing a greater value proposition. You will see a heavier emphasis around cost containment, heavier emphasis around demonstrated quality and outcome.", "I think that, for those enterprises that are prepared to demonstrate that they have a value proposition superior to others, I think they can have a long and prosperous opportunity inside Medicare. MA and remember this is a small subset of Medicare. The challenge for government is; how do they reduce the rate of increasing costs in Medicare, not inside MA.", "", "Larry Renfro", "I\u2019ll just try to get closer to your yes or no. I mean, I think, in the response that we offered, we think that this is, as you suggest in the long-term, an expanding market opportunity. We also think that there will be responsible financial support to it because we think they\u2019re going to get good value for it. So I would be positive on both questions you asked.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Charles Boorady - Citi.", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "I\u2019m wondering if you could just step through how to think about the Medicaid outlook for the next several quarters. Specifically how is the enrollment growth going to play out from rising unemployment and any new contract wins and how that might be offset though by the higher loss ratios that you sometimes see on new enrollees who were previously uninsured, and also risks from a state budget short falls?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I would say our outlook on that is also in general positive, but I think Rick can add a lot more background to that.", "", "Rick Jelinek", "Charles, Rick Jelinek. As mentioned earlier, I think the outlook is positive around growth. New procurements, there\u2019s probably not going to be a large onslaught of large procurements in the next 18 months or so. That poses well for us, because we had such a diversified book of business and in virtually every market we have the ability to grow and expand either market share, product base, or geographies within a state and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on right now is executing on the existing markets that we have.", "From a standpoint of the new members and the increase, we estimate in our book that for every 1% rise in unemployment there is somewhere around 50,000 additional lives that are added to our book and that timeline is dependent upon the eligibility guidelines in a given state and the processes for eligibility to determination and backlog and that sort of thing. Usually that will come on in a four to nine month period following the unemployment events. So, you could extrapolate from the economy what that will look like from our role.", "The other piece there is that we will continue to see progression in our business in fatality form in terms of getting the benefit of Tennessee, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, New Mexico, and Connecticut on a full year basis and getting that business up and going where those members are not new on Medicaid, they\u2019re just new to our program. ", "So, we\u2019re not going to have the same new member durational cost issue. So, our broadness of our business helps to in essence absorb some of the higher costs on the new members coming in from the economy standpoint. So I think, all-in-all, it\u2019s positive from a growth perspective.", "Obviously, we\u2019re watching the state budgets closely to make sure that the revenues are matching our medical expenses. In those instances where that\u2019s not the case, we\u2019re going to work with the state on is there ability to modify the makeup of the service structure or the program or administrative requirements that we might have in place in order to save the state money. ", "As the last resort, we can reduce our counties that we operate in and I guess as a very last resort, a form of underwriting for us is to exit the market altogether, but where we sit right now, we\u2019re not contemplating that in any of our markets.", "Charles Boorady - Citigroup", "So, I guess that top line growth is really easy to see and it\u2019s pretty strong growth. It\u2019s the only end market really growing robustly right now, which is terrific. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is the bottom line impact when you also factor in the margin risk. ", "So, would you sort of expect to see loss ratios rise because of the state budget pressures for a period of time, while you\u2019re absorbing the new enrollees and then see a better bottom line impact in future years? Do you think you can manage to bottom line growth in Medicaid?", "Rick Jelinek", "From where we sit, we obviously want to try to manage both and you are mixing a couple of different issues together. One is margin percentage and one is absolute earnings for the enterprise. ", "We think that we\u2019re in a good position to grow the absolute earnings of the enterprise and while there might be some short term margin pressure related to the new members, it\u2019s not going to be substantial to in anyway get out of our range of acceptability for the business operation. So, I think there\u2019s a strong outlook there.", "The other side of it is that we have entered into a brand new product category over the last couple of years in the long term care in the ABD business. That is a more stable book of business. These individuals have very high and medical costs and a large amount of inefficiencies exist in the system and we think we bring a very strong value proposition of increasing quality and reducing costs to the program. ", "My viewpoint is that I think where the pressure is going to be in Medicaid over the next few years is more on the fee-for-service programs as it is on the managed care side of it.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think that response to that exchange is a good example of us having to focus resources in a specific marketplace like Medicaid. A lot of pressure margin comes from all side, but I think we\u2019re very focused and efficient in converting new members into a good state and diversifying the new member costs against our personal care model and our medical cost base, which I think is favorable. So, I think that\u2019s why we are successful in the Medicaid marketplace.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse.", "Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse", "The first question was the day\u2019s sales outstanding were up to days sequentially. Was that just a late Medicaid payment or I guess what market segment is that coming from is that economy-related and then what was the impact on cash flow?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, Days Sales Outstanding has been it increases at the beginning of the year related to government timing of payments, both at the federal level. We did see although collection efforts on the commercial side we\u2019re very strong, we did see certain states deferring payments. We have collected them since, but there was some state payment timing and that did impact cash flow and net-net it was inconsequential to our operating cash flow for the quarter.", "Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse", "Steve you mentioned the opportunistic opportunities for M&A in the current environment. Obviously, you\u2019ve done a couple of transactions. I guess how are you thinking about that going forward in the context of a broader reform are you taking sort of a wait and see-to-see how this reform shapes up, what the opportunities that come out of it are, or do you think that the time is right to strike while the iron is hot now?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I think, given the fact that we have been active somewhat responds to the question. We have a lot of confidence in our business and in our business model. We are very much committed to that diversified business model and continuing to build it and expand it in a thoughtful way. Ultimately, we are constructive and positive in terms of reform, that it will offer opportunities in the marketplace.", "That we think we can respond to and enable in a pretty effective way, and we will be looking for to continue to build our resources along those lines. So, we are not necessarily doing a wait-and-see in terms of reform. I think the broader issues are is that there is a core cost challenge in the marketplace.", "There is clearly a need for the kinds of services and responses that we offer and where we see that we can build our business, we will see those opportunities and I think that has been consistent and I think we have proven it through the course of this year as well. So, we are not necessarily holding back in terms of waiting on reforms.", "Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse", "If I could squeeze the last one in there\u2019s been a lot of talk in the context of reform of changing the way reimbursement and fee-for-service payments are structured to providers. Have you guys thought about that at all in terms of how you contract with your providers in potentially changing some of those arrangements any sort of innovative programs you guys are thinking about from a reimbursement dynamic?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, quite a bit. We have actually several initiatives in specific markets, pilots that we have worked not only on our own but in collaboration with I think the Colorado Medical Society would be one, with IBM in Arizona, in terms of new approaches to payment and reimbursement. I think Rituxan is on the phone. I don\u2019t know if Greg, if you can hear me, if you want to comment on that? I\u2019m not going to wait to see if we have a technical difficulty.", "I would say that we have probably got more activities going in terms of different approaches to pay-for-performance, if you will, than perhaps any company in this space. There are pilot stages in specific markets, because if you understand the nature of healthcare, it is local in nature so you really have to begin at the local level. We think there is Merit in several that are going on. So, I think we are quite active in that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer.", "Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer", "I wanted to come back to Medicare, focus specifically on the capitated portion of the business. So I guess the first question would be if you could quantify how much of the business actually is capitated on enrollment or a premium basis. Second, any major differences in the bid process for the capitated versus the fee-for-service members? Then just you\u2019ve got any color on how much of the reimbursement for the capitated members is directly tied to the Medicare fee schedule versus how much is negotiated each year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, that is a mouthful, but I think Jack Larsen can start to pick on some of it and if we don\u2019t remember all the rest of it, while we\u2019ll just ask you to refresh it.", "Jack Larsen", "Carl, good morning, Jack Larsen. We do have a significant amount of our business that are in capitated relationships and they have been that way for many, many years. Approximately 40% to 45% of our membership are in some form of capitated arrangement, either for primary care or more globally for the full set of services and you\u2019ll have to indulge me. What was the second part of your question?", "Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Co.", "The second part was just, if there\u2019s any differences in the bid process between capitated and fee-for-service?", "Jack Larsen", "No, no. They\u2019re identical at the bid level.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Carl, I\u2019ll just clarify though that is for Medicare Advantage in terms of capitation. Across our entire book, our capitation is less than 10%. It\u2019s about 8% or so across our entire book of business, including commercial, Medicaid and Medicare.", "Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Great, in the last part was just in terms of the contracting with the capitated Medicare providers. Is that directly tied to the Medicare fee schedule, or is that something you don\u2019t negotiate with the provider groups each year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "It really varies by type of capitation, whether it\u2019s a global, professional and then there is contractual arrangements around it, but they are tied to fee schedules and the bulk of them are tied to premium that we get from CMS, so as a percent of premium.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ana Gupte - Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C.

I would say that we are involved, on a daily basis, with respect to these initiatives that AHIP has I think represented the industry well and engaged well.

We do recognize it as one of, as I think said in my prepared comments, a series of tax or surtax-related initiatives that they\u2019re struggling for in terms of finding pay-fors for the legislative interests.", "We would be more inclined to focusing on initiatives that are focused more on the real core costs than these kinds of techniques. I don\u2019t know, Tony, if you have any further? Simon?", "Simon Stevens", "No, I think that\u2019s absolutely right. I mean, we understand the argument for and against changes to the tax treatments of employer-sponsored insurance, but as a minimum, we think that whichever route Congress chooses, that we support tax equity as between health insurance bought by individuals versus health insurance sponsored by employers.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Okay. As a very big Part D player, can you comment on what you think the implications are of the doughnut hole coverage by Big Pharma? Will that likely incent more branded drug usage and potentially move seniors more quickly to the catastrophic end? Will you likely have to change your plan designs to accommodate that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Simon, do you want to respond to that?", "Simon Stevens", "Yes, I think we obviously await any details around what this proposal would look like when operationalized and until we get that, it\u2019s hard to be clear about the effects. Obviously, as you are implying, not all seniors used branded drugs in the doughnut hole anyway, so one of the things that obviously Congress and the administration would want to be attentive to is ensuring that there are no distorted incentives on the back of this that might actually reduce the use of the generic drugs where that would be more cost-effective for seniors themselves.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Last thing, on Tricare, can you comment on your build out of the network and what the implications are for SG&A in 2009 and then should we be looking at unit cost synergies on the provider side as part of the upside, 2010 and beyond from a network contracting perspective?", "Simon Stevens", "This maybe an area where it might be again little frustrating, but the actual award process is really not complete. So, we\u2019re going to be limited in terms of what we can say with respect to the Tricare program and what kinds of initiatives will be involved and what kind of efforts and costs. Obviously, there will be a transition initiative on our part.", "Obviously, network is a part of that, but we\u2019re going to have to stay away from anything that responds to the specifics around those initiatives or numbers around them, because the awarding process is actually still active and we really can\u2019t comment on anything that would influence it at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "I\u2019m going to ask you a question, you might not want to respond to, but before you give me an answer or non-answer, I want to read you something.

There was only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares. ", "First, the company has available funds; cash plus sensible borrowing capacity beyond the near term needs of the business. Second finds the stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value conservatively calculated. To this we would add a caveat. This is the relevance to my question. Shareholders should have been supplied all of the information they need for estimating fair value. Otherwise, insiders could take advantage of their uninformed partners and buyout their interest at a fraction of true worth.", "So far, we haven\u2019t done that because the buyback hasn\u2019t been too successful. What is your view presently of the intrinsic value of the business and at what level would you kind of divert your cash flow to more conventional uses rather than stock repurchase?

First of all, I think our pricing disciplines are well impact and I can have Gail respond to this following my comments, but I think that we explained that the care ratio was really more a response to the impact of flu and on a consolidated basis to the impact of the mix where we are seeing a relative weighting towards more of the government business which has a different care ratio profile.", "At the commercial UnitedHealthcare level, COBRA has a small impact on it, but those are the elements driving it. We do not see the pricing environment, which continues to be quite competitive, to be really a factor in this ratio. Dan, would you agree?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes, I would; I would agree, Steve. Our perspective is we are endeavoring price to a stable loss ratio overtime. We had a couple of factors, as Steve and Mike both commented on, in the quarter with respect to the flu as well as some additional COBRA expense that made that drift up on a year-over-year basis, but we are still inline with our expectation on the full year at 84%.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think we are quite satisfied with our pricing discipline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Costa - FTN Capital Markets.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Yes, just back to the swine flu for a minute, the first question is if it was 40% on the commercial book and 20% overall, it must not have been there much in the Medicare book.

You haven't changed your MLR assumptions. Is there something else that\u2019s an offset to the swine flu?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. I think, in the first instance, I will have Rick responded to Medicaid and then maybe Mike in terms of the broader outlook in terms of our perspective for the year.", "Rick Jelinek", "On the swine flu side, for the Medicare side, we are estimating it\u2019s about 20 basis points for the quarter, roughly.

Mike?", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Even though it is more kids and I assume more this is moms taking their kids to the doctor.", "Rick Jelinek", "Well, it was a regional variation, so it wasn\u2019t consistent across the board and what we saw is that, in those areas where the was a lot of news reports and TV going on, it didn\u2019t matter whether you are a kid, an adult, a mom, that there were people going to the doctor and looking to see whether or not they had H1N1, even as they might not have had clear symptoms of the flu, just more to be cautious and obviously, there\u2019s costs associated with that.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay, thanks and then in terms of the outlook going forward for the company as a whole why it didn\u2019t change your MLR assumptions going forward?", "Mike Mikan", "Well, we\u2019re assuming that the flu, H1N1, will moderate, will go down to normal levels.

So, we\u2019re expecting that it will start to tail-off as it has been shown in the CDC data with influenza-like illness, and that ultimately will end up picking back up late fall or I mean into the winter, into the first quarter of 2010. ", "Should it pick up in greater degree, as it did in 2008 for the first quarter, obviously that would be an impact on our cost trends, but as of right now, we\u2019re not assuming that.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "Even though if you look at the CDC data, it was much greater in June than it has ever been for the flu before?", "Mike Mikan", "Yes, and we\u2019ve captured that in our costs.", "Peter Costa - FTN Midwest Securities", "But you\u2019re not expecting it to come back stronger at the end of the year?", "Mike Mikan", "We\u2019re expecting a flu season as we always do into 2010.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Which is typically a pretty healthy expectation.", "Mike Mikan", "Yes, so it is about $175 million to $200 million for us.", "Stephen Hemsley", "That would be something I\u2019d say too, in the Medicaid book is that you asked if there is a material difference. We do have a fairly high level of flu on an annual basis that is normal, because of the maybe your comment around disproportionate number of moms and kids, so this is the incremental impact on top of that.", "Peter, to your point this is at some unprecedented level, pandemic kinds of, we do not have a pandemic in our outlook for the balance of the year and wouldn\u2019t exactly know how to actually do it. So, if that is your point, we have a healthy estimation going forward, but we do not have a pandemic in our outlook.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Perry - Wells Fargo.", "Matt Perry - Wells Fargo Securities", "I\u2019ve got a question long term on Medicare. If we think of rates coming down next year and then probably the Medicare Advantage subsidies being removed sometime in the next several years and think of those as explicit changes and then think of maybe implicit changes this administration is making versus the last administration, maybe in more regulation, more scrutiny of Medicare Advantage and the private sector\u2019s involvement in Medicare. Can I get you to comment on what you might think a reasonable long term margin outlook is in the Medicare Advantage business and maybe Medicare in general?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I\u2019ll just kind of respond broadly and then see if Larry or Tony wants to trim it up, but again, on the long term basis, we are relatively positive on this. We knew years ago, as we started to concentrate more into this space, that there would be times when there would be greater administrative and financing support and times when that would be more challenging and we\u2019ll somewhat ebb and flow overtime. ", "In the long term, history has proven this out over several different administrations, that there has been a general expansion into the private sector in some form in terms of Medicare and the needs of the group are compelling and the capabilities to respond are in entities like ours in the private sector.", "Whether it comes forward in contracts, whether it is in programs, whether it is in direct membership or in care management programs, we think, long term, there is a need to respond and to serve this population in a more modern way, and that we are positioned well to do it. That was very much the positioning as we went into this. It represents a huge, huge cohort of the overall healthcare marketplace, and that\u2019s kind of the perspective we bring to it. Tony?", "Tony Welters", "Two things: One, I would encourage people to take a step back and look and Medicaid managed care and how it has evolved overtime. As a reference point, I kind of like to think about welfare reform. ", "You may recall that states, for almost 15 years, experimented with welfare reform before the federal government taking all those lessons learned and then introduced the comprehensive approach to welfare reform, highly controversial, but very, very successful. I think that, when you think about issues around healthcare modernization reform, the federal government will look to states. States have tackled the issue of cost and quality and have pivoted in the direction of an integrated approach with the private sector.", "I think, as you think about the long term, it\u2019s very reasonable to assume that the experience that states have had will find its way during the course of the next several years into the national debate and therefore into the proposed solutions for addressing for the fundamental cost issues as we think about Medicare overall. I think those lessons are real tangible lessons and I think you\u2019ll see a trend line in that regard.", "Matt Perry - Wells Fargo Securities", "Steve, if I could maybe ask you to look in your crystal ball and think about the opportunities in Medicare, broadly and then the opportunities in the commercial to say, sector broadly over the next several years, which of those businesses do you think offers a better return on capital invested over the next call it five years?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I\u2019m not sure my crystal ball is quite that precise. The really are two distinct opportunities and the positioning of our business for years has been to really focus on core competencies around information, around technology, around expertise in care management, and then be able to focus those competencies to the different market needs and different market sectors.", "We see that there will be some probably coverage expansion in the commercial marketplace, but with economic pressures for sure and see that as a compelling opportunity that we\u2019re well positioned for. In the government sector, that version of that is largely the same in terms of these are sponsors of health benefits that are trying to deal with costs. We\u2019re really well positioned to respond to them in a different way that is appropriate to those government entities that sponsor those.", "So year-to-year, those returns will vary, but we look at it more in a total context and really don\u2019t want to get into a discussion of either product line or market segment return, because basically what we\u2019re leveraging is information, our technology, our care expertise, and our networks across all of those market segments.", "Well, I think that is it. I think we were generous with respect to time and the questions were quite good. We are quite positive in terms of the prospects of our business. ", "We are performing strongly from an operational point of view progressively, perhaps stronger than ever before. We are very focused and committed around reform and the opportunities it presents itself in the long term and in the near term. We think we are endeavoring to optimize our quarter-to-quarter performance.", "So, we thank you for your attention and we\u2019ll be back next quarter. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to respond in a more specific way to areas that we couldn\u2019t because of competitive activities in terms of Medicare, Tricare and things like that.

I would like to welcome everyone to the UnitedHealth Group third quarter earnings conference call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period.  (Operator's Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "This call and its contents are the property of UnitedHealth Group.

This call will reference non-GAAP amounts.  A reconciliation of non GAAP to GAAP amounts if available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's investor pages at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "This call contains forward looking statements under US federal security laws.  Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.  A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found on the reports that we've filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filing.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and our Form 8-K dated October 20, 2009, which may be accessed from the company's investor pages at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Good morning.  This morning we reported solid and consisted third quarter results led by cash flows of $2.7 billion and earnings of $0.89 per share, driven by a strong combination of growth and performance from our services businesses and increasingly effective ongoing medical and operating cost control.", "These results reflect the efforts of our 75,000 people in consistently delivering value and service to our customers and the healthcare community across a broad spectrum of need.", "Based on our performance to date, we are confirming 2009 earnings of approximately $3.15 per share and revenues of about $87 billion.  While this includes an elevated level of H1N1 related medical costs in the fourth quarter, our outlook could be negatively impacted if the prevalence of H1N1 is sustained at a high enough level throughout the entire quarter.", "Today we'll discuss these results and our 2010 outlook against the backdrop of a challenging economy and proposed healthcare reform legislation.", "To begin with growth, the services side of our company increased revenues by $723 million in the quarter, a strong 15% gain year over year.  Ingenix was up 26%, Prescription Solutions grew 16%, and OptumHealth expanded by 9%.  These businesses had solid and consistent growth driven by demand for services from physicians and care providers from across the public sector, from pharma, and from unaffiliated payers.", "We provide a diverse range of innovative services that help optimize the healthcare system, improving healthcare quality and consistency, transparency and accountability, and affordability and access.  Examples of these services include large scale consumer disease prevention and wellness programs, healthcare financial services, managed behavioral healthcare in a benefit parody environment, specialty pharmaceutical care, and healthcare consulting, information systems, and data analysis.", "In health benefits our third quarter revenues grew 7% or 1.4 billion year over year.  We grew organically by 900,000 people in public and senior benefit program through the first nine months of this year which includes 275,000 people in Medicare Advantage and growth of 460,000 in risk-based state Medicaid program.  These results underscore the importance of our balanced and diversified approach to the healthcare benefits market.", "Third quarter pressure on our commercial benefit businesses reflect our nation's broader economic and employment challenges.  Participation in our commercial benefits decreased by 275,000 people this past quarter with employment attrition driving more than 80% of this decrease.  Absent employment attrition, the number of people served in fee-based products actually grew in the product and over the past six months, and the decrease in people served to risk-based products was also significantly smaller than reported.", "Inside our fully insured loss numbers we continue to improve our customer retention and to expand the uptake of new products and programs.  ", "Turning from growth to margins, we earned a net margin of about 4% of revenues through the first nine months of the year after accounting for $1.5 billion in income taxes.  With a net margin of 4% our businesses drive their financial results by averaging modest earnings per customer while serving very large numbers of people with an ever increasing array of modern and innovative benefits and services.", "Our third quarter operating margin was stable year over year.  The steady performance reflects success in advancing affordability in the two key areas of operating costs and medical costs.  On the medical cost side, our medical trends continue to track to our expectations, reflecting longstanding clinical care management skills and ever improving technology applications for both forecasting cost and at managing care.", "Our consolidated third quarter medical care ratio of 82% increased 30 basis points over last year's third quarter performance.  In addition to H1N1 flu cost, this increase reflects the elevated initial medical cost of providing service to new Medicaid members who had not previously been in a coordinated care plan.", "Third quarter results included $190 million in favorable development in our previous estimates of medical cost, suggesting that historical medical cost trends were well controlled.  This compares with $130 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Our businesses continue to improve clinical resource utilization and to realize the benefits of our operating scale.  ", "We have been focusing sharply on operating costs over the past 18 months as we've said on these calls.  The operating cost ratio of 14.5% improved by a half percentage point year over year as adjusted, reflecting faster growth in revenues, the headcounts, and similar related operating costs.  We will continue our efforts to lower our operating costs to support healthcare affordability.  ", "Looking at margins by business group, all of our year over year growth and operating earnings this quarter came from our services businesses which improved by $109 million in total.  Prescription Solutions was, by far, the best performer in this quarter as it continues its path of growth and improved scale, business maturity, and growing specialty pharmacy program.  Its growth has been driven by Ovations and AmeriChoice as well as unaffiliated customers.", "Ingenix and OptumHealth extended their steady margin performances.  Behavioral and dental benefit costs at OptumHealth were in line with our expectations for this quarter.  Both businesses have effectively aligned their operating costs and level of business growth experience this year.  ", "Our health benefit companies overall operating margin of 6.2% decreased 60 basis points year over year, principally due to shifting mix as well as some unusual H1N1 medical costs.  We estimate that we incurred about $60 million in H1N1 related medical costs in the third quarter and costs of the H1N1 virus are also a significant factor on our fourth quarter outlook.", "UnitedHealthcare's third quarter medical care ratio of 84.6% increased 80 basis points year over year, largely due to its share of additional H1N1 costs and the increased concentration of enrolment.  Looking ahead, UnitedHealthcare now forecasts a fourth quarter medical care ratio just above 86%.  We anticipate our consolidated ratio will be in the mid-82% range compared to 80.8% in fourth quarter 2008.", "Our commercial benefit pricing remains balanced, disciplined, and fair.  Our fourth quarter expectations include higher than typical flu cost this fall, continued impact and seasonally higher medical expenses typically experienced in the final three months of each year.", "Let's turn to healthcare reform in the continuing legislative process in Washington.  Our views, priorities, and approach have remained the same throughout this year.  We are committed to helping modernize the healthcare system so that it better serves all Americans at a lower cost.  That's why we continue to advocate with policymakers for coverage for all Americans and that's why we continue to believe that universal care will only be sustainable if legislation effectively tackles the underlying cause of the problem, namely that healthcare in this country costs too much.", "We have been consistent, even aggressive, with policymakers that reform legislation who must address access and cost, and do it systemically if we are to achieve a high quality and economically sustainable healthcare system.  We have been concerned with some proposals in congress which not only fail to adequately address the fundamental cost drives, but would in fact lead to higher costs.  This would place even greater pressure on already overburdened citizens and employers and this is not a future problem that might occur at a later date.  ", "There are proposals that would add new taxes on benefits and healthcare products and services and ones that cut Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals.  They would likely increase costs on the healthcare systems and shift that burden to the private sector and negatively affect the health benefits of the 160 million Americans who currently have health insurance primarily through the nation's employer-based system.  ", "It's worth nothing that our company alone already pays more than $1 billion per year in state fees, assessments, and premium taxes, that are built into healthcare costs.  Insurance reform proposals that fail to fairly bring everyone into the system will be stabilized insurance markets and coverage pools causing costs to rise on businesses and the citizens who already are participating responsibly.", "We are continuing to engage actively with leaders in Congress and the administration.  I was in Washington just last week for meetings and will be back again this week.  We are brining practical solutions, innovative ideas, information and data to the debate to ensure that we modernize the nation's healthcare system and rein in rising costs to pressure coverage today.", "As a commercial enterprise, we continue to invest in practical innovation that leads to better surface and better medical outcomes and lower cost through better use of our great healthcare system.  Those capabilities have increasing and enduring value, and to be sure, we will assess the positions of our businesses and our participation in our (inaudible) markets and will take whatever actions are necessary to respond to legislative changes in the best interest of customers and shareholders.", "Our nation continues to weather a fragile economy and we cannot lose sight of the impact on healthcare legislation on job development and global competitiveness of the American economy.  However, as I said earlier, we continue to believe this is the time to modernize and of just reform healthcare on a truly systemic basis so that universal access can be sustained without significantly greater cost to taxpayers and those currently with benefits.", "Now we'll offer you a perspective on the cross currents we foresee as we conclude this year and enter into 2010.  Our concerns are consistent with those of our last quarterly call.  The economic recovery appears to be slow developing and uneven at best.  Unemployment continues to rise and the debate over additional stimulus spending suggests the government's concern that renewed economic strength is not imminent.  This backdrop will impact demand for some of our businesses.  We expect our fourth quarter, ac commercial enrolment loss, to be somewhat better than the third quarter with employer-based attrition the most significant factor.  ", "In 2010 we project our commercial membership decline will slow meaningfully as compared to 2009.  Our reputation for service and value has risen sharply and that trend will continue to accelerate.  Customer retention is strongly improved and our broker and consultant relationships continue to strengthen.  In our commercial risk business we expect to continue to maintain steady pricing disciplines in response to perspective medical cost pressures.  Much of this pressure is driven by insufficient government reimbursement to care providers and further shifts in the cost of the commercial sector.", "Our public and senior markets businesses should increase the number of people they serve this year, again led by Medicaid and Medicare Advantage.  Growth in these two programs will likely be slower in 2010 than in 2009 as we expect fewer new people from large new state programs in Medicaid and our Medicare Advantage Benefit has been reduced in response to dramatic government driven rate cuts to that program.", "We remain cautious about the state Medicaid reimbursement environment and we are exposed to a meaningful portion of the 5% rate cut that CMS assigned to the Medicate Advantage Program for next year.  We have plans to offset the impact on margin beyond the benefit design changes we've made for 2010 by improving performance across all elements of our Medicare Advantage businesses.  However , we will not assume a perfect matchup on those plans in our 2010 outlook.", "We expect growth in revenues from each of our enterprise services businesses.  Mix shift and economic circumstances including loss of membership with UnitedHealthcare will likely challenge OptumHealth margin performance.  Prescription Solutions will effectively discontinue its use of performance based pricing in 2010 and that will impact its margin percentage in earnings.  We anticipate that Ingenix will continue to be our highest margin business next year.", "In total we expect 2010 to be a somewhat more difficult year than 2009.  We will see membership and local competitive pressures in risk business.  The loss of commercial risk business over the course of 2009 creates headwind on margin dollars for UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth for 2010.  And H1N1 flu will remain a risk.  ", "Effective medical cost management and operating cost control will be key to preserving our margins.  Our preliminary estimates are for revenues to grow somewhere in the range centered around $89 billion for operating earnings to decline year over year and for 2010 earnings per share to be in the broad range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share.  While there clearly could be downside to this range, there could be upside as well.", "Cash flows from operation should continue to be solid in relationship to net earnings this year and next.  Share repurchase will be an element contributing to earnings per share.  The market factors, including the status of the healthcare reform, will influence the timing and level of repurchases in fourth quarter 2009 and in 2010.  As in the past, we will refine these numbers and further delineate them as we get closer to 2010.  We've made no adjustments to accommodate healthcare reform, and health reform legislation if signed into law may necessitate a revision in our 2010 outlook.", "So let me briefly summarize the key points from this morning.  Third quarter results provide a good measure of our diversification and internal performance discipline.  Our services businesses delivered all of the year over year earnings growth in the quarter.  All business groups performed well relative to our expectations, and operating costs were well controlled and our pair ratios were solid.", "Our innovation, service, and the overall value we provide our customers continues to strengthen, as measured by growth for many of our businesses.  We're concerned about some directions health reform is taking, but will redouble our efforts to help achieve meaningful sustainable changes that address fundamental issues of affordability and access.", "We're understandably cautious about the challenging environment for 2010.  We will pursue our goals in 2010 working to perform at the highest level possible.  In the longer term, the outlook remains compelling.  Large and critical human and social needs are still to be addressed.  The healthcare system cries out to be made more efficient, modernized, and effective, in an integrated system.  Our nation's healthcare resources need to be used optimally and appropriately for the benefit of the most people possible.", "Our company has the capability, the resources, market positions, and insights, that enable us to play a meaningful role in meeting those needs.  ", "And finally, should health reform affect our long-term positioning, we will move thoughtfully on behalf of our customers, owners, and other stakeholders.", "This is a first look at 2010.  We plan to update you on our progress at our annual investor day which will be December 1st in New York, and with that we'll open up this call to your questions, but with one understandable caveat first.", "I suspect many of you are interested in how various policy proposals might affect our business or the industry.  Since so much is in flux right now and sensitivities on these issues are as high as they have ever been, we appreciate your understanding of our reluctance to speculate or respond beyond broad directional theme.  As usual, we ask you to limit yourself to one question or topic today in deference to time, and I thank you for your interested in UnitedHealth Group.  And if we could begin questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Your first question comes from Gregory Nersessian with Credit Suisse.", "Gregory Nersessian \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Hi, good morning.  My question was actually on Prescription Solutions, another very strong quarter there, exceeding our estimates again.  I was wondering two questions, one if you could just remind us how the Part D earnings are allocated between Prescription Solutions and Ovations and then second of all, how much of the earnings there is driven by the performance-based pricing that you mentioned you won't renew for next year?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "I would offer that Prescription Solutions continues to grow in its capabilities and maturity as a business and I think a lot of this is a reflection of that continued strengthening of that business, but I'll ask Jackie Kosecoff and then perhaps Larry Renfro or Tom Paul to respond to the second half.  Jackie?", "Jackie Kosecoff ", "Good morning, Gregory.  First of all, Prescription Solutions has a third party contract in terms of its service to Ovations.  So we work separately in that regard.  And you are right, Prescription Solutions has had a good 2009.  We've benefited from improvements in (inaudible) and generic penetration rates, higher than anticipated Medicate membership growth, new external earned sales of nearly 600,000 lives, improved client retention, and in addition, performance based (inaudible) and network contracting that came in earlier and greater than anticipated and has greatly benefited us in our Part D business.  ", "These network contract savings have already been built into all of our clients' 2010 pricing and we're not likely to achieve the magnitude of contracting improvements in 2010 that we saw in 2009.  Tom?", "Tom Paul ", "In terms of our relationship to our Part D products in regards to the performance pricing changes, ultimately from a Part D perspective we see minimal change in our 2010 bids.  We submitted our bids which were approved under a range of standard margin that we've used in the past and we continue to expect that we'll fall within that same margin in 2010.", "Gregory Nersessian \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Okay.  Jackie, just in terms of the Part D question, is it fair to say that more than 50% of the Part D earnings show up in prescription solutions rather than the Ovations?", "Jackie Kosecoff ", "That's not a question that we're going to answer right now.", "Gregory Nersessian \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Okay.  And then my second question was just on your contracting.  I'm hearing a lot of anecdotal evidence that there are a number of community hospitals that are feeling the economic pinch and looking to get pricing from managed care.  I'm wondering how you're approaching your contract on I guess both a commercial and maybe the Medicaid side next year with a lot of these community hospitals that may be on the brink.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "I'm not sure that there is a particularly different approach in terms of how we have been responding to our relationships with the delivery community.  The facilities have been under pressure for the last several years will just continue under those pressures. So I'm not sure there is a particularly distinctive approach that we're taking with respect to our relationship with the delivery community.  We think it has been a constructive one and increasingly we're sensitive to those kinds of issues as we engage with them and continue to maintain and build our network. ", "And I would like to limit these to one question each, so with that I think we'll move to the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Charles Boorady with Citi.", "Charles Boorady \u2013 Citigroup ", "Hi, thanks.  Good morning.  So I will keep it to one question, just looking for your 2010 and longer-term target for the UHC loss ratio.  At about 84.5% it is well above your peers and above historical normals and I'm wondering if you see this as a new equilibrium or if you target improving that loss ratio next year and over time?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Well, I think that this does ebb and flow over time.  If you really take a look at this over a long enough continuum of many years these patterns do establish themselves.  I think we endeavor to improve our performance relative to our specific book of business as an ongoing kind of concept of the business.  But I'll add that I think there is nothing I think that is specific to this.  I would say that mix also represents a significant element in this and that's why I reference our book of business.  But beyond that I would Gail or Mike if they \u2014", "Gail Boudreaux ", "I think Steve hit the critical part.  The impact is really mix.  We've talked about where we've held our trend in line with our expectations and we continue to monitor it so I think that that really hits the major points of where we would track our loss ratios as we think about going forward.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "So I would just finish that by saying I think it reflects the book of our business, but I would also tell you, we are always looking to improve our performance and I don't think that will ever change.  Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital.", "Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Thanks.  Question relates to your customer contracts on the commercial side with the large groups, small groups, and then individuals.  What sort of contract terms do you have in the case that you guys would incur some additional fees or taxes that you didn't know about when you originally signed these contracts?  I.e. can you go in the middle of a contract and reprice them, I guess, effectively?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Well, I don't know if I want to get into the specifics of that.  I mean, we maintain relationships with customers that are, and we endeavor to have them multiyear and to be responsive to the different factors in the marketplace.  Typically there isn't an element of that nature in terms of change in our relationships, but I would also that this is a question that comes from the reform agenda, there has also never been a circumstance quite like this.  So I would describe our relationship with our customers as being both contractual and non contractual in nature and kind of leave it at that if that is where you were headed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Rex with JP Morgan.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Thanks.  Just wanted to kind of step back again on your commentary on 2010 and just kind of look at it more broadly.  So it seemed like you would be implying about a 10% drop in op earnings for 2010.  I was wondering if you could just help us kind of understand kind of order and magnitude in at least your biggest businesses, commercial and Medicare kind of the contributing factors, and maybe just so we can kind of understand order of magnitude from those businesses.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Well, we are giving you, as we typically do at this time of year, kind of a broad directional sense of 2010.  There are a lot of factors and we delineated several of them in the script including the commercial headwinds into 2010 just from the commercial membership reductions from 2009.  We expect 2010 membership performance to be measurably better, but not necessarily a positive and we have pressures from Medicare that are well established, a rate environment in the Medicaid marketplace.  We have the beginning startup of our tricare business.  I mean there are a number of factors \u2014 the introduction of efforts around 5010 and ICD10.  ", "So I think there are a number of factors that lead us to kind of lead us to set on this outlook at this time and we really can't give you anything that would be more delineable than that, but I actually think that's quite a pretty robust list.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen & Co. ", "Hi there, just delving into Medicare Advantage a little bit.  Could you talk about \u2014 you said it's not going to be a perfect match and there's a broad range of assumptions out there. Can you comment on that and your long-term strategy there?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Sure.  I will give this to Larry Renfro, but I think, our long-term strategy for one is that we think this is a very compelling marketplace.  There are perhaps more challenges to the Medicare population than perhaps any other in all of healthcare in opportunities to make it perform better both in the government fee for service version and in the private sector version.  And that will take a very focused effort around optimal care management, really focusing on that population, better application of technology and modernization of the product \u2014 so we think there is really a real future in meeting the needs of that population.", "In terms of the nearer term to 2010, we have a number of programs.  Larry, do you want to \u2014", "Larry Renfro", "Christine, I know what we're talking about is the 5% rate cut and we've already addressed what I'll call a meaningful portion of the 5% with benefit design as well as improving performance across all elements of the business.  The three main focus areas that we're concentrating on now is cost management, operating cost, and growth.  And what we are trying to do is to beef all these areas up in order to get as close to the number that we're trying to fill in this gap.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America ", "Okay, thank you.  I just wanted to confirm something that was in the press release.  The numbers that you disclosed about the favorable development, we're talking about the 2009 numbers.  You refer to the 190 as net favorable development and then we talked about the 2008, you referred to it as total development.  I just wanted to make sure that those two numbers are in fact comparable and whether you were making a distinction there between net development and total development as far as what might be re-accrued.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "I don't think so, but Mike, can you \u2014", "Mike Mikan ", "Well, we're comparing the development that was re-accrued in the third quarter of this year which is $190 million compared to what was recorded at the same time period in Q3 of 2008 which was $130 million.  So the comparative is 190 versus 130, but I don't think there was any distinction between net and total.  I wouldn't draw any meaning from those words.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs  ", "Hi, good morning.  Just curious about the share repurchase outlook \u2014 your buybacks were quite limited in the quarter and it wasn't clear from your comments if you had reflected any amount of significant share purchase in your EPS range for 2010.  You reference health reform, can you just comment on what your thinking is there?  ", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Sure.  And I'll let Mike handle most of this, but I do think that we are largely on track for our share program in '09 and we did offer that it will be a factor in 2010 as we see it.  It could be influenced by external factors.  We always leave that open.", "Mike Mikan ", "Hey, Matt.  As you know we entered the year with expecting to purchase more than $2.5 billion of shares in 2009.  On a year to date basis we have repurchased 66.5 million shares and so that's a substantial portion.  We still expect or are planning on, depending on market conditions, to repurchase more than $2 billion this year.  Some of it is just timing, Matt, on dividends.  And we did have a large debt repayment in the third quarter and we're going to continue to maintain a conservative financial position during the economic climate in the environment that we're operating in today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS ", "Thanks, good morning.  Just a question on swine flu here.  Can you talk about the pace of change that you saw in the third quarter as far as how the $60 million number totals up, how the costs have looked in the severed segments, and then what's explicitly built in for that fourth quarter, just around number there?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Justin, are you referring to H1N1?", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS ", "Yeah.", "Mike Mikan ", "Justin, as we disclosed in the second quarter, we had estimated that we incurred incrementally $50 million of H1N1 flu related costs.  We did see, as I'm sure others have as evidenced by the CDC, influenza-like illness data that an acceleration or an elevation in the later parts of the third quarter.  And that's pretty comparable in total costs to what we saw in the second quarter.  In terms of by category, we are seeing a significant elevation in the commercial book of business and in the Medicaid business.  We are not seeing the same level of acceleration or elevation in the senior business.  So you can get the order of magnitude by business and we continue to believe that we\u2019re going to see an elevation as we are seeing into the fourth quarter, and at some point in time we'll peak and subside from there in the quarter.  And I think if you look at the elevation as we entered into the third quarter, we're expecting that to continue well into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Good morning.  Actually just a followup on the flu question.  Certainly the prevalence data that is out there for ILI is nontrivial at this point in time.  And just in addition to your response to the previous question, could you provide us maybe a per member per month number that you tend to see for ILI during the flu season?", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Generally we are not interested in getting into that kind of a level of a metric \u2014 the next thing you know we will be quoting quarter by quarter flu PMPM metrics.  I'm not interested in responding at that level of detail.  I think suffice it to say that we have a tremendous amount of resource focused on monitoring our cost on that and mitigating them as best we can, but also responding to the needs of customers.  ", "During these kinds of times, I think our programs, as it relates to influenza both on the vaccination and so forth are quite progressive and I think that we have had a pretty good handle on these costs through the course of this year.  We have provided for them in the fourth quarter.  I don't know if anybody can fully predict how an effort like this is going throughout the country, but I think that we've done a pretty good job through the course of this year and I think that we will see how it plays out in the fourth quarter.  But I don't think we really should be responding on a kind of PMPM basis on a particular item as variable as this might be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "", "I'm sorry to go this place again because we've discussed this in the past, but you run a very fine company, but your capital management is just way off base.  If I was a director of UnitedHealthcare, I would be paying a recurring dividend, particularly in this environment where there's an above average amount of uncertainty.", "You constantly reference cautious about a challenging economy, et cetera, et cetera \u2014 what do you think your stock would sell at if your board of directors approved a 40% payout of your guidance number 315 for this year?  I calculate that to be a dividend of $1.26.  The S&P 500 yields 2.2%.  $1.26 dividend and a 4% yield, your stock would be trading at $31.50, up 26% from where it is.  So I think your capital management program is depressing the value of the stock and it's as simple as that.  ", "We've had this conversation before and sometimes it pays to turn a leaf and take a new policy.  I have in front of me the results of your historic buyback programs and it really hasn't really done anything for the shareholders.  I believe we have spent $15.6 billion from 2005 to the end of the second quarter of 2009 and average price of $43.93.  ", "So it's really not done anything.  There is consistent insider exercise of options and sales with the exception of the CEO which I admire for his large stake, but it seemed to me if you paid a dividend of 40%, that would still leave you 60% of $5 billion with $3 billion to build the business, to buy back shares, and to do other things.  And I think for ac company that size to take a 100-0 approach, meaning no dividend and all directed to repurchase where the repurchase has been kind of flawed and miscalculated, there's a mistake.  And I say this constructively because I admire you guys.  You run a very fine company, but I can't find many companies of that size that don't pay dividends.  It just seems to be in your industry and in your industry they all exercise options and sells while the company says our stock is undervalued and we're buying.", "So I'm sorry if I'm overbearing, but it's getting very frustrating to me that you respectfully take the questions, but I don't get a good answer why there's no cash dividend of consequence.  Your shareholders are suffering from coupon shock, there is no return on short term \u2014", "Stephen Hemsley ", "I think I have the nugget of your question on this.  ", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "", "It's not a question.  It's actually a statement.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Oh, I am very much aware of that and if you would allow us to respond, I think we have tried to have \u2014", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "Thank you.  I'm interested in your response.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "\u2014 constructive conversation with you on this.  We do appreciate and respect your point of view and believe it is not solely yours and that it is the point of view of others as well.", "We think it's very important in terms of the deliberations about capital structure, particularly in the backdrop of a challenging economy, an economy that could be challenged for a considerable period of time, and an unknown around healthcare form, and I think that we have taken steps in terms of the positioning of our investment portfolio, the positioning of our overall capital structure relative to debt, the reduced level of share repurchases that were made in 2009, and I think that as this runs its course, healthcare reforms clarifies to some extent, we will then look at what the capital structure should be going forward and I think that's the way we responded to you in the last \u2014", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "No.  But there's a big difference.", "", "Stephen Hemsley ", "Healthcare reform is not yet really \u2014", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "You spent $1.6 billion in buying back stock.  What is the difference in spending $1.6 billion in buying back stock and having the money leave the company that way as opposed to spending $1.1 billion and paying a cash dividend and let your shareholders decide what to do with the money.  You've given out the $1.6 billion.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "You'll allow us to go through a thoughtful process relative to where our capital should be allocated going forward, given the diversity of our business, how healthcare reform could play out across the spectrum of our businesses and market opportunity.  We will then set a capital direction going forward which may very well include the dividend, but I'm not committing to that at this point in time and I think that we could all, at this point in time, for the general timeframe around what healthcare reform in terms of this phase might be in terms of timing, and that's our response.", "Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors", "But do you understand that the $1.6 billion in stock repurchase is a form of dividend?  You are giving out the money.  It has left the company forever.  You gave $1.6 billion.  $1.26 dividend would be a bit \u2014", "Stephen Hemsley ", "I appreciate your point.  I think we've responded and as I said, we respect your point of view and the point of view of others on this and we will take this up when the reform period runs its course and we have better clarity with respect to what our capital structure need might be going forward and I appreciate your input.  Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "", "Just trying to get some for the reform exposures in context, can you just walk through what the number of individual numbers that you have currently are?  And then in the commercial business, what your breakdown in enrolment is relative to a small group, less than 50 lives, versus bigger groups.  And then just as a followup to that, just if you have any estimate on what percentage of your members might be exposed to this high value dollar tax that they're proposing on the Cadillac plans and how you think the market would potentially respond to that.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "This might go into the category of areas where things are so open and fluid right now, I'm not sure that's fully appropriate to respond to that, but Simon, do you want to give a sense of where things are on those and then to the extent that there is a response in terms of membership, Gail, a response?", "Simon Stevens - Executive Vice President", "", "Yeah.  So, Scott, obviously we're not going to speculate at this stage given the situation\u2019s still very fluid and sensitive.  The Cadillac tax proposals alongside other tax proposals are just one of several competing versions of how to fund health reform and nobody knows at this stage exactly what will emerge from the congressional debate that is still to come.  But on the general question of impact, obviously the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation has said that ultimately the taxes wind their way through to consumers either directly in consumer prices or in the form of reduced benefit, and that's the experience of course in states where the premium taxes exist, as Steve said in his opening comments.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Good morning, Scott.  In terms of the numbers, the end of the third quarter we had 4.1 million members in the combination of both small businesses and our individual market.  And as you might recall, our small business includes members from 2-99 lives.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ana Gupte of Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co", "", "Good morning.  My question is about COBRA.  You didn't say anything about COBRA and its contribution to the upward pressure on your commercial MLRs.  So could you give us some specifics on what percentage of your commercial (inaudible) right now, what MLR it's running at, and then going forward into 2010, do you see at least in the back half of the year, some tailwind as the stimulus subsidized population starts to roll off?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Hi, Ana.  Let me put a little bit of context around COBRA.  I think as we talked about on the last couple of calls, our COBRA membership has continued to grow over the nine month period.  We started the year at about 1.5% and we're now over 2% of COBRA in total and we continue to track that certainly as unemployment continues.", "In terms of the take-up rate of COBRA, that take-up rate's remained relatively consistent, but we do think that the stimulus has certainly had an impact on COBRA.  Overall as we think about the wear off of stimulus, at this stage we don't really have a prediction on COBRA declining dramatically.  I think we'll have to see how unemployment continues to track along with attrition.  ", "In terms of the overall cost structure, we feel that we've still got it covered within our medical cost ratio of 84 plus or minus 50 basis points, so we continue to follow that.  And we've also been watching those members quite closely and trying to get them involved in our care management program because we think we can add real value to them in helping them manage their care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "", "Hey, good morning, everyone.  Steve, you mentioned in your prepared comments the cross subsidy arising from the differential provider payments from the commercial and the government payers and I'd just like to be curious your sense as to how well understood this is by employers?  And if you look out three to four years, how does the industry manage that dynamic with those employer customers as that subsidy potentially expands because of things like the industry tax, the $6.7 billion being proposed.  I mean, do they realize where their payment rates are for providers versus the government?  Do they fully understand that differential?  And then just from a customer relations standpoint, how does the industry manage the expansion of that over the next three to five years?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I think the answer to that somewhat varies by the size and sophistication of the customer, but I would say on the upper end of our customer base, they do understand it and understand it increasingly well and I would suggest that the activities that have been going on over the course of the past year in terms of the national reform debate have elevated the consciousness of this and employers are quite engaged with respect to their concerns about the level of cost shifting and the cost shifting that may occur going forward.", "So I think the larger employers are already attuned to this.  Their sensitivities have increased, and I also believe it is moving down market as smaller companies are realizing that impact.  We do see employers engaging and participating and expressing concern with respect to the overall cost elements of the, at least the proposed legislative initiatives at this point in time, and the amount of shifting that they represent in terms of coming into the private sector to support the expanded program.", "And so I believe that they are getting increasingly engaged on this.  How we work with them continues to be an advocate of a more modern system, a more reform system where there is good transparency with respect to cost and accountability and to really get behind the kinds of things in reform and modernization that we have been advocating in terms of focusing on cost, changing the way care is paid for, moving away from volume and more towards value, and employers are embracing that.  And more and more are amenable in participating in programs where these new, more modern approaches, are engaged.  ", "So in some respects the sensitivity or visibility on this has actually increased the amount of innovation and change.  I don't know how else to answer you beyond that, and I also think it's going to be sustaining.  I think that employers are dedicated to maintaining benefits and to do it in a progressive way, and I think the reform activities have kind of brought a new energy into that.  It is a challenge, but I also think we've got a lot of solutions for it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Baker of Raymond James.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James", "Thanks.  I was wondering if you could give us some additional color on the 2010 commercial selling season?  It sounds like it went better for you.  If you could give us a sense of some of the underlying factors in addition to service improvement, whether it be Optum or where you stand relative to discounts, particularly in light of the renewed focus on trying to widen that gap?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll ask Gail and maybe Dawn Owens to respond a little bit to these, but again we are, at this point in time, giving just broad direction so our response is going to be more thematic.", "Gail Boudreaux", " ", "Yeah.  Good morning.  I think as Steve mentioned, we're still in the middle of the 2010 selling season so these comments are definitely thematic.  As we look at the season though, I think the key thing, particularly for our larger employers, were around strong network, strong cost division \u2014 I think they very much value clinical programs, ability to use data to drive healthier behavior. I think we feel very good positioning around our service improvements.  Our metrics are at the best they've been.  We've also present a lot of time in terms of positioning our products at the local market and that's paid off.  There is a real focus on affordability and I think our leading position in consumerism has really helped as employers look to make sure that employees are engaged, thinking about healthier behaviors.", "Some of the emerging trends which I think tie very well to our innovation agenda, thinks like our connected care, employers are looking at on-site clinic, for example in biometric testing.  And again, this is all to drive better outcomes to help manage the cost curve.  So as we look at that across both large and small employers, you see a real focus on affordable products, and I give you two examples.  We launched a product catalyst and are simply engaged in our local market and I think we're seeing some very nice traction in that.  And on the national accounts we're also seeing, in addition to unit cost focus, a real focus on driving better behavior across our clients.  ", "And Dawn maybe has some comments around Optum and the kind of things you're seeing too.", "Dawn Owens", "Sure, Gail.  Thank you.  As we approach the selling season, we saw a couple of things that I would note.  One is because of the interest around cost management, we saw an increased level of activity around the products and services that we offer.  From wellness prevention to really integrated solutions that get at transparency, consumer behavior change, and ultimate cost management, better decision making, better outcomes.  And I think the capabilities that we're able to deliver, whether it's our e-Think platform or the integrated clinical behavioral model really not only help UnitedHealthcare in their selling approaches in the commercial marketplace, but also our independent selling efforts to large employers, state based programs, and even independent health plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Costa with FTN Equity Capital Markets.", "Peter Costa - FTN Equity Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning.  I just want to get a little more clarity on the 2010 guidance if you can.  You talked about giving or targeting the same margins in Medicare and having that approved in your rates.  So are you expecting lower membership in Medicare there then to contribute to the lower earnings for next year?  And then on swine flu, can you give me sort of how much you expect swine flu or H1N1 to affect the numbers in 2010 on the commercial side?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure.  I don\u2019t' know if we can offer specifics on something as granular as swine flu in 2010, but Larry, I might ask you to respond to Medicare.", "Larry Renfro", "Sure.  Earlier when we talked about the 5% rate cut, that was the number that we were talking about that's the gap, and I think that our position on what I'll call the growth for next year, it's early innings for us to give a firm commitment or a thought on this, but I will give you a direction and that is we believe the industry is going to grow and we believe that we'll grow slightly, but it won't be the type of growth that we had in 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Perry with Wells Fargo.", "Matthew Perry - Wells Fargo", "Hi, good morning.  Some of your peer companies have talked about an issue with provider upcoming or revenue maximization from provider groups.  Wondering gif you're seeing any of that in the third quarter and whether if you are seeing it you could spike out whether it's more prevalent in Medicaid, Medicare, or the commercial business?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I might ask Mike to respond to that.", "Mike Mikan", "", "Hey, Matt.  I would start with \u2014 we have seen coding intensity in our cost trends for years now.  That hasn't changed per say.  We monitor it regularly.  We analyze it by major category on an inpatient outpatient and physician level.  We analyze it by type of service as well as admission by geography and by line of business so we've got a good grasp of this with data over time so we understand where there are variations.", "From time to time we do note variations whether in a local market or by a line of business or type of service.  We aggressively manage where we note those variations, but in aggregate, we're not seeing any increase in the weight of change in coding intensity.  ", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) .", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well actually, if there really aren't any more questions, maybe we should just wrap this up.  I want you to obviously be aware that John Penshorn, Mike Mikan, and others, will be available through the course of the day for questions.  ", "I thank you for your participation in the call today.  I can assure you that we are very focused enterprise.  We're focused on performing.  We have been aware of the challenges through the course, as far back as the end of the first quarter in terms of what 2010 could be.  We have some real traction on those, but we're being realistic about the overall climate that we're in and I assure that we will put our best performance into 2010 and are hopeful that the reform efforts proceed in a constructive way that really does advance the agenda for the entire nation.

Today, we will focus our commentary in three key areas, 2009 financial performance and our early 2010 outlook, our progress against some key market facing themes discussed with you over the last two years, and lastly some thought about market needs and requirements going forward.", "The results from Massachusetts on Tuesday may have affected the legislative outlook, and we're not going to comment on the outcome of health reform today. Whatever the result, we continue to believe that the heart of the issue is a need to thoughtfully stage comprehensive efforts around controlling costs, and modernizing the health systems in order to expand and sustain access to affordable health.", "We will do our best to make whatever changes, which may be enacted successful, to appropriately control costs, modernize and simplify the system and to improve access to affordable quality care in this country. As you read in our release this morning, the performance momentum that steadily progressed over 2009 continued in the fourth quarter. We reported solid fourth-quarter results with earnings per share of $0.81 and operating cash flows of $1.3 billion.", "All key performance metrics for the quarter were in line or improved, relative to our expectations. Full year 2009 results included just over $87 billion in revenues or 7% year-over-year growth. Earnings of $3.24 per share and cash flows from operations of $5.6 billion improved year-over-year by 10% and 16% respectively.", "Cash flows were 1.5 times net earnings. We managed through many unforeseen obstacles to achieve these results, including significantly higher unemployment trends, anemic short-term investment yields, the H1N1 outbreak, slower buying behaviors in the market for health services, COBRA benefit extensions, and unexpected state actions on insurance premiums and more.", "The performance drivers in the quarter were consistent with those throughout the year, discipline in commercial pricing supported by better product positioning market to market, steady and effective management of medical and operating costs, strong membership growth and market share gains across public and senior products in markets, and double-digit percentage revenue growth in our services businesses.", "We see many of these performance drivers carrying forward into 2010. While we are pleased to have exceeded our financial commitments in 2009, we are equally encouraged by our advances throughout 2009 in key areas, where we are demonstrating our ability to better serve people, which enhances our potential for growth in 2010 and beyond. In 2009, the satisfaction levels improved meaningfully for every key constituency, consumers, physicians and care providers, employers and benefit sponsors, brokers and consultants.", "Our proactive engagement with regulators, medical societies, and elected officials also had a meaningful and positive impact in 2009. Service and response metrics, processing and response accuracy all improved steadily each quarter. Integration efforts advanced. Some 93% of our total commercial, public and senior membership now resides on end-state operating platforms. That percentage should be 95% by the end of 2010.", "These are impactful advances and we\u2019ll continue to be unrelenting in our dedication to service and fundamental execution discipline. Our commitment to practical innovation over the past year and more resulted in the introduction of the Diabetes Health Plan, The Consumer Activation Index, the Personalized Health Score, and integrated eSync personalized care platform, and our Connected Care Telehealth Program.", "We had advanced our clinically integrated premium networks across 20 clinical specialties in the vast majority of our markets. We are piloting new types of physician incentives to support improved care and developing medical home programs in more settings than any other payer, including the government.", "UnitedHealthcare is benefiting from its work to more effectively translate local market insights to national level initiatives, and conversely national imperatives into more effective local market execution. The results include stronger local market relationships, more effective local market deployment of new products, better recognition and response to serving local market needs and variations, all while steadily advancing national scale, productivity and cost advantages.", "We are consciously nurturing a more mature, externally oriented culture and expanding our social responsibility agenda. You can see these reflected in our own employee engagement levels, advancing 600 basis points over the past 24 months, which portends [ph] well for continuing to improve performance. Our health services businesses continued to steadily diversify.", "We edged into the next set of market adjacencies, including revenue and claim cycle management, consumers health change consulting services, global employee assistance, and prescription decision support in Europe, while strengthening our position in electronic health records software.", "Through these efforts individually and as a whole, we believe we are steadily elevating the value we bring to our customers and markets, and meaningfully strengthening the reputation of our company and our relationships with the people we serve. These efforts will continue. Collectively, they are our fundamentals. We are committed to consistent execution and continuous improvement in these fundamentals, quarter-by-quarter as we have been emphasizing for nearly two years.", "Our financial position also continues to strengthen. We have reduced our debt-to-total capital ratio by more than eight percentage points over the past 18 months to 32%. We recently announced $750 million debt tender offer for a portion of our notes. This debt repurchase is expected to further improve our financial flexibility, while reducing our net debt service cost in 2010.", "Before we discuss our respective health benefits and health services businesses, as we begin this new decade, it is worth looking back briefly. When we entered 2000, UnitedHealth Group revenues were just over $19 billion. On a gross revenue basis, our business was about 60% commercial benefits, 35% public and senior benefits, and 5% health services.", "Entering 2010, we see over $90 billion of revenues with roughly 40% of growth revenues in commercial benefits, 40% in public and senior benefits, and 20% in health services. And over the next decade, we see opportunities to naturally diversify further into healthcare IT services, healthcare financial services, the deeper integration with primary care, the pursuit of international market settings and more.", "The scope of our business model is unique, and allows us to look at healthcare market opportunities very broadly. This includes our view of the coming healthcare modernization era, where we will pursue an opportunistic path and help enable change. In 2009, combined revenues in our health services businesses grew to $21.8 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase. Earnings from operations of $1.6 billion increased 20% over last year. The prime contributor to this growth was Prescription Solutions, where revenues reached nearly $14.5 billion, a 15% year-over-year gain, and pre-tax earnings grew an impressive 98% to $689 million.", "Ingenix also grew strongly even in a challenging economic environment. Ingenix increased revenues 17% in 2009 to $1.8 billion and earnings from operations to nearly $250 million, and this is after investing significant amounts in start up efforts around payment and revenue cycle management, comparative effectiveness research, international markets and electronic health records.", "OptumHealth revenues grew by 6% in 2009, and delivered the best overall external growth year in its history. The continued decline in the UnitedHealthcare commercial enrolment obscured that external market growth. It continued to impact OptumHealth\u2019s margins. New business from public sector customers tends to have lower margins than commercial risk products. That business\u2019 mixed dynamics should reverse as the overall commercial risk market strengthens.", "As we look across our health benefits businesses, 2009 played out largely in line with our original expectations, albeit somewhat weaker than commercial enrolment levels as national unemployment trends were more severe than we had anticipated; more than half of our 2009 commercial membership decline was driven by attrition.", "For the fourth quarter, our commercial enrolment was slightly ahead of our Investor Day outlook, posting an underlying growth of 40,000 members before employment-related attrition. The full-year commercial decline was offset by stronger than expected growth in the Medicare and Medicaid markets, and we're positioned to expand our services in the military in early 2011.", "In total, health benefit revenues increased 7% to more than $81 billion. We effectively managed both medical and operating cost trends. These cost containment capabilities are becoming more mature and consistent, particularly as our benefit businesses become more integrated and simpler, using more shared services and common clinical care management processes.", "Turning to our early outlook, momentum from 2009 is carrying through in our earliest 2010 indicators. We expect first-quarter commercial membership to be slightly stronger than our Investor Day outlook. We should be flat to slightly positive in first-quarter fee-based business even after attrition.", "On the risk-based side, we should come in slightly favorable to our prior guidance of a decrease of about 500,000 members in the first quarter. Attrition continues to run at a high level, and will be a concern all year in this economy. Across our Medicare portfolio, with 8 million consumers choosing UnitedHealth group Medicare product in 2009. Recent enrolment period demonstrated once again the value of privately managed Medicare products for America's seniors.", "Going into the enrolment period, there was considerable uncertainty about the Medicare Advantage program caused by benefit reductions, premium increases, plant closures and the ongoing healthcare reform debate. In spite of that uncertainty, demand for Medicare Advantage plan industry-wide remains solid. Our Medicare Advantage business is expected to grow nicely for 2010. We attribute that growth to a focus on affordability, managing our portfolio of benefit offerings with a steady long-term view, and our ability to adapt our plan offerings to the challenging rate environment.", "Seniors continue to recognize the real value of our Medicare Advantage products, and have voted their convictions by trusting their healthcare to our plans and our strong network of quality providers. We expect first quarter net growth to be above 100,000 CVS in Medicare Advantage with strong mix towards the network-based products and 225,000 Part-D standalone participants.", "That is a stronger start than we originally expected in this sector, and the Health Net Northeast acquisition will add further to our totals. First quarter Medicaid membership should grow in the area of 100,000 to 125,000 people in line with our 2010 plan. Our services businesses are all stronger as we move into 2010 than when we entered 2009.", "We are on track to achieve 2010 revenue growth plans here as well. We expect consolidated 2010 revenues to grow above $90 billion. We have reconfirmed our 2010 earnings outlook at $2.90 to $3.10 per share. That outlook does not include any proposed federal healthcare reform elements that could potentially be faced in this year.", "We believe this earnings range to be appropriate given the Medicare and Medicaid rate pressures, the loss of Part D performance pricing of Prescription Solutions, ongoing COBRA costs, and lower commercial membership levels going into the year. These headwinds will be strongest in the beginning of the year before any mitigating efforts can get full traction, and this pattern does not appear to be fully reflected in the first quarter consensus earnings estimates.", "For 2011 and beyond, we will factor in business and market changes driven by healthcare reform and modernization, whether incremental or comprehensive. We believe coverage will expand and increasing healthcare costs will continue to make our work to promote access to quality care even more important. No matter what form change ultimately takes, there will continue to be very strong market demand for affordable, quality care, demand that will create the next generation of growth in our markets.", "That future includes new ideas and committed actions around payments and incentives for quality care, development of integrated accountable care capability, transparency around quality and performance, and paperless end-to-end defect free service, further innovation around product designs to achieve lower price points, a much stronger commitment to drive outcome based payment arrangements, and a clear need in the seniors market for continuous improvement in total cost and values, which will encompass both operating and medical costs performance gains.", "There will be companies who will \u2013 who can and will respond to these needs, and we intend to be one of them. Doing so will require the focus on fundamental execution and intelligent adaptation we described in Investor Day last month. We see that more than 300 million Americans will continue to need to get care, and that this care needs to be intelligently coordinated, financed and delivered and documented across the system.", "Our goal is to be involved in that process through both our services businesses and our benefit businesses. In total, there is an exceptional opportunity to build an enterprise to successfully serve these important social needs. We are interested in your questions this morning, with the understanding that the health reform situation is very fluid and sensitive.", "As usual, we will ask that you limit yourself to one question topic today in deference to time, and I thank you for your interest in UnitedHealth Group, and we will turn it over to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Can you just provide an update on the pricing environment that you are seeing at this point for commercial for both the risk-based market and then the ASO [ph] market, just in terms of the level of price competition you saw for 2010 renewals relative to last year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Gail.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure, good morning Scott. Let me start with the risk-based market. That market continues to be competitive, but I think as we\u2019ve talked about we have seen some firming in that market for the last couple of quarters, and we would expect to continue to see that type of activity. We had a very disciplined approach, and I think our ability to keep our medical cost trend very consistent and predictable, and our ability to manage our medical costs has helped us with that level of consistency.", "On the self-funded side, again that market over the last several years from a fee-based perspective remains very competitive, and again I think the story there is the same. We had a very consistent approach and have not done anything traditionally different. As we look to 2010, based on the fee-based membership that we reported, and we think it is going to be slightly positive and up in the first quarter. That is a fairly significant improvement for us year-over-year from 2009 to 2010. So, that is some very good moment for us, but from a pricing perspective, pretty consistent for us year-over-year.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And Gail, how would you just characterize the blues on the risk pricing side for 2010 relative to 2009?", "Gail Boudreaux", "In terms of the blues, I think the answer is pretty consistent to what I said on the risk side that we are seeing some pockets of rate increases, obviously as they take their base rates up. But it is different geography to geography, but overall there is some firming going on there.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Christine Arnold with Cowen & Co.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Good morning. Your PDP in Medicare enrolment are all poised to be better than you thought they would be at Investor Day. It is that your fee-based revenue is going to be up; your commercial enrolment is going to be better than anticipated. Can you help us understand, what offsets those, such that you are not increasing guidance or is this just conservatism?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I would point out that it is January, and let me then reaffirm kind of what I would say those headwinds are. This is kind of an economic environment that is unparalleled in our lifetime. We have meaningful rate pressures in the Medicare and Medicaid environment. We have the loss of lock in pricing in the Prescription Solutions business.", "We had a number of unforeseen obstacles at this time, when we entered 2009, and we have no sense of what will be coming down the road. So, I think it is quite early for us to offer any indication other than that environment hasn't changed from about a month ago when we had our Investor Day. And that environment is quite challenging, and I think that that is the \u2013 what we need to be conscious of. We have a lot of work to do in 2010 to hit the guidance that we have offered.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Carl McDonald with Oppenheimer.", "Carl McDonald \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great. Thank you. Some of the smaller private plans that I\u2019ve talked with over the last couple of weeks have suggested that in their commercial business, they think utilization is rising. So, when you look at your business, excluding to the extent you can the flu, COBRA expenses, do you think the underlying base utilization, based on your recent claims data is unchanged up or down, any noticeable trend there.", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, maybe they should answer that kind of in an enterprise wide level. So, maybe Mike, maybe you could, and then if the other businesses want to add some color.", "Mike Mikan", "You know, we really haven't seen any real change in underlying utilization. I would tell you though, we continue to be very focused on our clinical management programs. We have been talking about them for several years now, and we are really starting to see traction there. So, our utilization continues, if you just look at commercial as an example to be flat to down, and we are seeing other favorabilities in the Medicare and AmeriChoice Medicaid work as well.", "So, I don't know what the rest of the market is seeing, but our underlying utilization continues to be stable to down, especially on the inpatient side.", "Carl McDonald \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. Good morning. Q4 favorable development for the current year looked higher than normal compared to prior years, did that favorably impact the quarter or did you reaccrue, and I guess what came in better for the first nine months than you were thinking, and does that have any impact on your cost trend outlook?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Let me try to answer it this way, let me give you some context on our view of reserve development. First, as we have said for some time, our reserving methodology and processes remain consistent with prior years. Second, we continue to be proud of our ability to predict cost and estimate actual usage, and I think that is evidenced by our prior year development in 2009. For 2008 and prior years it was one half of 1% of prior year medical costs, which we think is well within a normal range of variation.", "With respect to current year true ups, there are several factors that have impacted our initial estimates between the quarters in 2009. First of all, we had significant growth in the government business, as you know, about 300,000 additional Medicare Advantage lives, 565,000 additional Medicaid lives. We\u2019ve continued to see advancements, as I just talked about in our clinical programs that as the data trues up, that starts to prove out to be favorable.", "The operational advancements that we\u2019ve talked about over the last several quarter at our investor conference, you know, we've seen some of the best performance we have seen in the history of UnitedHealth Group, and as that performance continues to improve, as the data catches up to that, we have seen favorability, and then frankly, just the volatility with the abnormal flu season has created a fair amount of volatility in our reserve debt.", "That is just to name a few, but overall, we feel we\u2019ve got good data and insight into all these items, and are very comfortable with our 2009 full-year estimate, and with your last question with respect to trends, we wouldn't change our outlook on trend at 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, yes, thank you. Could you just talk a little bit about the AmeriChoice business, and if you can give us any sense geographically how that is running and what markets, you know, you are finding challenging or you expect to be challenging, particularly challenging in 2010 versus where you are having better results?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I would be happy to. I would point out that they have actually had perhaps their strongest year and really well positioned. So, Rick.", "Rick Jelinek", "Matt, we're coming off a very strong year as Steve mentioned, and one of the strategic positioning points that we started on a couple of quarters ago was to diversify our portfolio so that we're not over-reliant on any single customer or product line. So, from an outlook standpoint, we feel really good about our current positioning and the breadth of our state, and while some states will continue to face challenges going forward, we are working closely with those states on rates for the coming years.", "Today, we have about 40% of our 2010 calendar year rate locked in, and so we have got little ways to go to get clear visibility on some of those other markets, but generally, we feel relatively comfortable across the board. There are a couple of markets that we will watch closely in terms of assuring that revenue is meeting the medical trend requirements, and if they are not, we will take a closer look at working with the state on benefit designs or other structural changes to assure that these programs are working for the long term, and in particular 2010.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Good morning. My question is on the impact reserves from the Health Net acquisition. You outlined in the earnings release that $250 million increase in medical cost reserves due to the acquisition, and I'm curious as to the driver of that. It is my understanding was that Health Net was going to be responsible for the run of claims cost in that business.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Justin, without getting too much into the devise [ph] on the transaction, that is a balance sheet, as we acquired the legal entities, we assume the balance sheet obligations. It gets trued up through a purchase agreement adjustment that they ultimately take the claim cost, as long as it is on their book. So, it's a balance sheet transaction, which ultimately gets trued up and we feel comfortable with that process.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay, so there was no impact to the quarter specifically from any kind of increase or decrease in Health Net\u2019s reserves as you brought that on?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No. That would \u2013 it would net to 0. We don't see any benefit or detriment to that.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Charles Boorady with Citi.", "Charles Boorady \u2013 Citi", "Thanks, good morning. I wondered if you could comment a little bit on capital deployment, you alluded at the Investor Day to the potential, you know, increase the dividend, and you've brought that to cap down 600 bps in the year and have significant cash as apparent. So, we're clearly out of the credit crisis so I am wondering if you can characterize for us how you plan to deploy the cash this year.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I think we described at the investor conference that we were through the course of 2009 really evaluating financial flexibility, and that's kind of been our path. I think we have made some meaningful inroads in our math. We have made acquisitions also through the course of the year, and we like to make sure that we are maintaining our financial flexibility, not only to invest internally in our business, but also for acquisitions.", "So, I don't think there really has been any kind of change in our thinking along those lines, including as we said there, you know, really evaluating whether a change in our dividend policy is appropriate and we said we would take that up as kind of the reform situation clarified that it is still in the mix obviously, but we expect there will be some clarity on that early this year. So, Mike, do you have anything further? Did that get to your question?", "Charles Boorady \u2013 Citi", "Yes. So, the debt-to-cap at around 32%, I mean, should we think about it as being closer to 40% by a certain period of time or you know, at one point you're more comfortable with a high leverage ratio?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No. I would just say broadly kind of on a more middle-of-the-road kind of environment, you know, 35% something like that as a kind of a middle-of-the-road suggestion. That can vary meaningfully between 30% and 40%.", "Mike Mikan", "Hi, Charles, it's Mike. You know, we are comfortable with the business given the \u2013 in its current state, again health reform not trying to predict either way on impacts of health reform, but in its current state as we said before, we think that the businesses \u2013 our diversity, the growth aspect, the risk profile and support, a higher debt leverage than where we're at today. We've talked about that over time. We put out annual guidance based on what we know of, you know, ending the year somewhere between 30% and 33% debt-to-total cap and we are comfortable with that in, you know, with our current expectations.", "Charles Boorady \u2013 Citi", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Rex with JP Morgan.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks. A question back on the UHC book, and I'm thinking particularly about yields on both the risk and non-risk businesses. And so, I guess just first it looks like the commercial risk yield continued to strengthen in the 4Q, and I guess as I am thinking about the 2010 should we expect the effective yield, so that it is kind of net of kind of product mix shift and such to continue to strengthen like we're seeing throughout 2009, maybe not at that pace, but continue to come in above that level, and then specifically on the ASO book, you know, one of your competitors last week talked about lower PMPMs in the ASO business for 2010 as employers eliminate some specialty products, I am wondering if you're seeing that impact on your ASO book.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Gail?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Hi John, let me start with the premium yield question first. We are pricing on our risk business to our forward view of medical cost trends, and we look at our premium yields and you commented, those are tracking in line with our expectations, and I think the best judge of that is looking at the fidelity of the medical loss ratio as we\u2019ve discussed over the last couple of calls, once you adjust for COBRA and H1N1, which obviously were not predicted when we set that. So, I think you know, our philosophy and our approaches remain very consistent around our pricing, and I think ultimately our yields and bottom line our medical cost ratio.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan", "So, would it make sense we should expect those yields to continue to rise in 2010 then like they've \u2013 kind of this trajectory we've been seeing in '09?", "Gail Boudreaux", "You know, again we are pricing to what we believe is the forward view of cost. So, our \u2013 again it is the stability of the medical cost ratio that we are really tracking to, and I would point you back to you know, our medical cost ratio that we shared with you at Investor Day at 83%, 83.8% plus or minus 50 basis points, and I think within that range it gives you a good sense of our expectations.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.", "Stephen Hemsley", "You know, and John I would actually say that we've seen some really good market response to the kinds of services that you're referring to, maybe Dawn could comment on that.", "Dawn Owens", "Hi John, Dawn Owens, OptumHealth. You know, when we look at the employer market, we've had our strongest year ever 2009-2010 selling season with not only pipeline activity up in that market across the board in all the services we offer financial, clinical care management, wellness, behavioral health, but we\u2019ve translated that at a higher rate in to close, actually with a 25% conversion rate on closure. That is both in partnership with UnitedHealthcare on an integrated basis as well as an independent cross carrier externally focused agenda. So, we're actually seeing very strong demand for the services and a marketplace that is interested in productivity, health, wellness in ways that we can offer. So, we feel actually good about that market and have diversified well into it.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan", "So, net-net on your ASO book, would you expect you know, PMPM revenue to, you know, not be worse than flat in 2010 over 2009, when you think about. So, it sounds like you are saying, you are seeing attrition of those specialty products. So is that a fair assumption?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Our expectation is our revenue would be relatively flat. So, our penetration rates have remained fairly stable. John, this is Gail Boudreaux.", "Dawn Owens", "And John, (inaudible) that we are talking about two different businesses. So, OptumHealth\u2019s direct employer business also has different \u2013 an additional revenue streams in a large employer marketplace, which would account for this additional external growth that we talked about within OptumHealth.", "John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And Optum had more external, it's external growth here as 2009 was probably its best, and its pipeline is probably at strongest level. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. While I understand you cannot comment on the outcome of reform as you are doing your scenario planning internally, has that changed or would it change your view on the various portfolio businesses that you have. So, health benefits you know, versus health services, domestic versus international, MA [ph] commercial relative to Medicaid and then consolidation for capabilities relative to horizontal consolidation.", "Stephen Hemsley", "That's a really \u2013 it's an excellent question, but I set back a few years and put kind of reform to the side, and say if you really look at the market in terms of what the compelling needs of the markets are relative to benefits and relative to services, and how the market needs to be brought along to a more kind of what I'd say modern state, and the demand for more services and a more seamless integration of services all thrown in with the kind of consumer trends that have actually been building over the last 10 years.", "That's what we have been responding to. That's how we have positioned our existing portfolio of businesses, and there are common you know, core elements of what reform is trying to get at. So, if you just put that aside and just focus on the core fundamental market needs, that's what we are responding to. They align with reform because of the same issues and challenges. So the answer to that is we wouldn't change at all. We think that the construct has been really built for that kind of response, which is why we feel we could, we can position ourselves somewhat differently, and we're going to continue that pattern. So, you have seen over the course of the last year steps into natural market adjacencies, and I think you can expect to continue to see that.", "Ana Gupte \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi thanks. Good morning. Steve, could you just talk a little bit about given the challenging economy, you know, health care costs continue to clip along you know, ahead of wage growth and given the unemployment situation, what are you guys seeing from customers in terms of pressure to help deal with rising cost. Has there been a heightened awareness of it and I guess along those lines, how do you guys think about impatient pricing strategy and, you know, looking out a year or two, any read on potential direction of benefit structures more broadly?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, it is all about cost and there is you know, business operators are looking at, they are committed to the benefit. They are looking at optimizing those benefits and staying with them and trying to get a better cost outcome that's actually been partly why there has been a good response in terms of more of the care management programs, the dedicated kinds of programs like diabetic health plans, et cetera because those are effective tools of getting at in an appropriate way, better of cost outcomes for their dollars.", "So that is really where they have really been working, they have been to the extent they have a broad portfolio of different benefit types across their companies. They've been trying to rationalize those benefit types. They've been just trying to manage their programs and get at cost and to engage their employees, because they also recognize that it is the consumption patterns that is driving a significant portion of their trend and they think that they can influence those consumption patterns in a very positive way, and a positive way for the health of their people.", "That's really where it is, those discussions are very, very consistently company to company, and that is why we\u2019ve been really driving our clinical programs, as Mike talked about utilization, management and so forth. These companies want to see demonstrated performance along those lines and that's where our themes have been. Gail.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Just adding to Steve's comments, I think there are three core themes that our largest customers and across our book are looking at one, is managing their total cost. I think it has been very important to them this year. The second is improving the health status of their members. So, getting more value for the dollars that they spend, and the third I say is getting consumers more actively engaged in their program. We have had some very good momentum in the marketplace, because our programs directly address that. Things like our Consumer Activation Index that we shared with you.", "On the provider side, we are very focused on making sure that we are paying for cost and quality. So, our premium designation network where we are trying to steer more of our members to plan, design and incentives. The second area that I would point to is we have a number of initiatives around patients at medical homes, where Steve said in his early comments have more of those than anyone else in the country, including the government.", "And we are tracking the results of those very closely. The Diabetic Health Plan would be the third I would point to. We had \u2013 we introduced that a little less than a year ago and have seen wonderful up-tick from our customers, because it is a very focused program that drives results in a targeted population. So those are really the themes that employers are looking at, and again it's around managing total cost for driving better quality and outcomes for their health, for the population of their employees.", "Doug Simpson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Did it get to your question?", "Doug Simpson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay, thanks. Next.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Brian Wright with Colin Stewart.", "Brian Wright \u2013 Colin Stewart", "Thanks. Is there any potential impact on the \u2013 on your bank from the deposit tax, the proposed deposit tax?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We don't think so. We don't think that those accounts have \u2013 are subject to that tax, but we will \u2013 you can sense of lack of surety here. So what we will do is we will follow up and make sure that we get back to you with a more confident answer.", "Brian Wright \u2013 Colin Stewart", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time\u2026", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, that concludes our \u2013 the questions in line. In closing, we'd like to just quickly sum up that we think UnitedHealth Group delivered a relatively strong financial performance in 2009 despite a difficult economy. In addition to meeting our financial commitments, businesses continue to steadily advance in service, innovation, scale, national scale, and local responsiveness and continued to diversify. We are entering 2010, we think as an operating enterprise much stronger than the beginning of 2009. We are respectful of the challenges that we are facing in 2010, and we think we are really positioned well for the next generation of growth over the next several years to come.

The program is distinct from, but aligns with our Diabetes Health Plan, a use of biometrics screening to drive wellness in our new partnership around healthy eating, nutrition possess in the work shops.

These reports are available on unitedhealthgroup.com. We have more activity in the pipeline as we remain committed to be in a progressive and innovative voice helping advanced healthcare monetization.", "Let\u2019s turn now to an update on our major business groups beginning with health benefits.

This strong start brings us to 2 million seniors in that product set and puts us on the course to grow as many as 250,000 for the year.", "The product mix was favorable, 70% of the net growth coming from network-based products. This growth was carried over the Part-D offerings as well, where we grew by a total of 505,000 for the quarter with 240,000 of that a new standalone Part-D members.", "Reflecting the overall economic climate, we continued to have steady Medicaid growth. We added 145,000 beneficiaries this quarter, and now served more than 3 million through this business, which is dedicated to state-based government sponsor benefits.", "A member engagement and care management program have become steadily more consistent and effective in addressing the care needs of these often underserved credits. UnitedHealthcare commercial membership performance improves significantly over the last few years and was above our initial expectations and that is in the phase of continued high levels of unemployment and related attrition.", "Self-funded benefits grew 170,000 consumers this quarter propelled by annual enrolment from large customers and strong sales in the mid-size employer markets. For risk-based benefits our first quarter decrease of 275,000 people was meaningfully better than both our original first quarter outlook and prior year first quarter results.", "Persistently attrition levels driven by the economy prevailed in our commercial health benefit businesses. Attrition losses exceeded organic sales growth again this quarter, put another way, we would have reported net commercial growth, if there had been no attrition during this quarter and that would have been in true the last quarter as well. Realized premium yields have been as planned and are on track with projected 2010 medical cost trend.", "Our commercial benefit sales recovery has been steady and broad based. More than 60% of our local markets delivered year-over-year growth in both risk and fee-based commercial benefits.", "Growth has been driven by in a way of simpler and lower price point product, align the local market needs in preferences including consumer directed high detectable plan in order to we now have more than 3.3 million consumers enrolled.

Earnings from operations of $334 million were slightly better than expected for the businesses are all on their earnings targets for 2010.", "The operating margin percentage for health services is lower year-over-year as we have projected and communicated last call. This is driven by two main factors.", "First, the continued grow that OptumHealth in large long-term public sector contracts. They have lower relative margins; combine with the commercial health benefits market that\u2019s contracting under current economic employment conditions. That trend should reverse with employment levels recover.", "Second, to return to more normal PDA margins following the discontinuation of performance based pricing of the under the Medicare Part-D program, but these franchises now receive variable pricing adjustments throughout the year rather than lacking and committed purchase prices upfront.", "Prescription Solutions continue to grow at top line with the 16% year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter with normal margin levels. The business federally advanced in scale and capabilities little finest position is strong alternative to a very concentrative PDA markets. ", "Ingenix continued and exceptional growth trends first quarter revenues increased by $120 million or 31% with growth driven by traditional businesses and recent acquisition, revenue backlog increased by more than $1.5 billion year-over-year to $2.3 billion at 29% gains.

OptumHealth financial and its striking growth in the quarter with half of accounts now reaching $2 million and assets under management reaching $1 billion.", "We\u2019re raising our 2010 expectations for these businesses as well. We expect our combined revenues to grow 12% to a range of around $24.5 billion, we project a combine operating margin of about 5.5% recognizing that margins very significantly across this portfolio from 3% for Prescription Solutions, the 15% or more for several Ingenix products categories.", "Looking at consolidated results for UnitedHealth Group first quarter revenues of $23.2 billion increased 5.4% year-over-year driven by stronger membership growth relative to expectations.", "Medical cost for 2009 in each of our risk-based businesses of lower than we had estimated, in part this reflected lower levels of H1N1 influenza and the integration of effective consumer engagement in clinical management.", "The severe winter in several U.S. markets, particularly, in the Northeast reduced discretionary use of the medical cared system during the first quarter. The consolidated medical care ratio for the quarter of 81.3% reflected those conditions, and was impacted by $490 million in favorable reserved development, compared to $200 million last year.", "A consistent focused on clinical performance fundamentals, which help in drive appropriate trends in health system utilization. The Medicare Advantage hospital days for 1,000 members decreased by a total at nearly 8% over the past three years, while maintaining access and improving clinical quality.", "In commercial, medical care management results are favorable as well. We achieve these results for our customers by more effectively reaching people as they engaged health system and providing with useful information by fundamental, execution on care management.", "There is more opportunity around appropriate times based medical cost containment, including developing more sophisticated performance based payment contracts, and broadening the use a variety of integrated care models such as medical home, modern reimbursement arrangements with accountable care organizations in the life.", "Our consolidated first quarter operating cost ratio came in favorably at 14.1%. In large measure, this reflects the continued strength of our efforts around service, quality operational integration in management discipline. The efficiency reflects the improvements in our customer and care provider service metrics, which are clearly been recognized in the broader marketplace.", "The consolidated operating cost ratio includes the impact of our strong health services mix, as its direct operating cost to proportionally much greater than that of our health benefit businesses alone. We proceed significant additional opportunities in operating cost management. We will steadily advance integration in alignment to get closer to our end markets and customers while retaining enterprise wide controlled processes in system.", "We\u2019ll also drive savings from better sourcing and purchasing discipline, increased use of proven modern technology in further gains and quality. For the full-year 2010, our revised UnitedHealth Group outlook puts consolidated revenues at about $92 billion. We see our consolidated medical care ratio at 83.2% or lower and operating cost in a range of 14.6% plus or minus 30 basis points.", "We expect operating earrings be in a range of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion for the year with operating cash flows of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. To project earnings per share in the $3.15 to $3.35 range, this includes the impact from an increase in our expected tax rate which we estimate will cost above $0.07 per share this year.", "Turning to the \tpost perform environment, the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act mandates far reaching changes and how healthcare benefits will be acquired and administered. The broad outlines of the law are known, but how will be implemented is understandably not per say.", "Accordingly we\u2019ll the cautious with assumptions and comments that how the provisions will actually work, our stage will approach implementation and how the laws will ultimately being interpreted.", "Is important to underscore, that we have firmly committed to making this new law work as successfully as possible to the American people, our new Medicaid paper is just one example. So, as our decision yesterday do ensure there is no gap in coverage for dependence gradually from power.", "Some of the most immediate changes impact underwriting practices in the individual and small business commercial market. They concern guaranteed issue requirement, the elimination of lifetime element co-addition on policy rescissions and extensional dependent benefits to age 26.", "We supported these elements and are fully prepared to incorporate the economic effect to these changes into our underwriting processes. We expect these changes will proceed in an orderly fashion and they are included in our revised 2010 outlook. Actuarial soundness and integrity is the core of responsible benefit underwriting pricing and regulatory over side. So we believe price changes required by rising medical cost trends and the cost associated with the revised underwriting rules required under the act will ultimately prevail across the states.", "Medical cost ratio requirements will go into effect in 2011, so those enter in the pricing and actuarial considerations as well. These types of requirements of existed per years in several markets include in New York, New Jersey, more recently in the New Mexico. There are several unknowns about how these rules were specifically work, but we should know more after the energy of initial work from the National Association of Insurance Commission are just completed and made public and we will be providing comments on the commercial and medical cost requirements as well at the Department of Health and Human Services by its May 14\u2019s headline.", "The Medicare Advantage rates for 2011 were announced April 5, they will within the range we had expected and they appeared to be manageable for us, we are well underway in planning 2011 benefit design that submissions are due on June 7. We have set for sometime now that our Medicare Advantage business must ultimately be able to perform better and fee-per-service Medicare on a comparable benefits basis and with care follow be considered.", "We believe, we can achieve and for saying that standard in the majority of our local markets. Since undertaking that performance goal almost two years ago, our Medicare Advantage business has strengthened measurable in basic medical cost, in operating efficiencies, in quality metrics and effectiveness of service and distribution and we expect to see steady growth again in 2011.", "Our senior market plan is straight forward. We will continue to focus on the same four points that have been driving successful this year. Adjusting benefit levels in Medicare Advantage, preserving the benefit that consumers value the most, adding earnings through the targeted growth from current and new products, further diversifications in natural senior market adjacency and further intensifying both medical and operating cost management. ", "Turning to the uninsured, this administration plans will significantly expanded subsidize health coverage for an estimated 32 million addition people, split roughly evenly between Medicaid and the commercial market for coverage, or roughly 10% of U.S. population. We are uniquely positioned and fully intend to help serve these people, however, that coverage expansion occurs. We have the products, the cost structure, the technology, the experience, and the innovation to help at remarkable levels with that significance.", "This government driven expansion place extraordinary demands and cost pressures on the health system, which we believe our health service businesses are uniquely capable at helping to address. We are well positioned with health of expansions and health information technology and our [fraud] efforts and administrative simplification, as well as the development of the modern infrastructure that will support demand and services.", "We have set for some time now that the UnitedHealth Group business model was built for change, adaptability and scale. We would prove that in the months and years to come as the new law works its way to our society and economy. We\u2019ve diverse experience in both the commercial and government sectors and in doing competencies in information, technology and accessing management of care.", "We actively developed and deployed practical innovations at large scale, we can operate in the increasingly regulated world of health benefits and the less restricted markets of health services and the patient protection and affordability care that will need and engage all of these assets.", "To wrap up, we feel positive about our continuing fundamental execution and the results we are delivering for customers and we can identify important opportunities for growth under healthcare reform. We\u2019re interested in your questions this morning with the understating that we do not yet fully know all of the impact of healthcare reform in our businesses. We ask that you limit your question, topics today and that (inaudible) time and I thank you for your interest this morning in UnitedHealth.", "With that we will open it up for question. We\u2019ll give them a minute (inaudible).", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "First question just is on how you\u2019re thinking about the individual business now in the post reform environment and do you still view this as a fully sustainable business and then may be talk about some of the primary changes that you expect to make to the business, I know Steve, you just mentioned some of the underwriting changes, but may be some of the other adjustments you may need to make for example relative to broker commissions.", "Steve Hemsley", "We do think it is a very viable space, the one that is going to be important kind of in the broad spectrum of the healthcare markets going forward under reforms.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "It has actually been one of the areas that has really been a bright spot in terms of our risk- based growth over the last year. Scott, I\u2019ll ask Gail Boudreaux to comments with respect to kind of the prospectus of the individual market.", "Gail Boudreaux", "There is a couple of questions in there, so let me take them in order of the way you asked, the first, I think as Steve outlined, one of the issues around the individual business versus understanding the impact of the medical lost ratios and we know what the minimum thresholds are going to be but obviously don\u2019t know yet in terms of how the definition, what\u2019s going to be included in that lost ratio as well as how that\u2019s going to be implemented, so as you think about that, that process is underway with helping human services asking in The National Insurance Commission with some guidance and as Steve mentioned in his opening comments, we will also be providing guidance.", "In terms of the individual markets, specifically clearly that market is more sensitive to some of the changes that are coming. The products on hold to put in perspectives are more affordable than market products. And when you think about distribution cost in the market; well distribution cost on a per member per month basis are equivalent to the one in small business market as a percentage of premium is dealing with a smart premium base and as a result that percentage of premium is larger on that and other factors lead to a lower medical lost ratio in the individual market.", "Just put again in perspectives and I\u2019ll talk about commission a little bit in a second, I want to give you a sense of how we think about the business. We have had nice growth in that business, as Steve mentioned, but to give you a sense of the impact for our sub business right now represents about $2 billion of revenue on a roughly $92 billion base growth, relatively small percentage of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s overall revenue.", "The second question specifically on commissions and how we\u2019re thinking about that? Our distribution partners have been important part of the individual and on our group business and we expect they will continue to be a very important part of that business going forward. As we look at our arrangements we paid compensation differently based on our different business segments et cetera, and that can arrange from a percentage of premiums all the way to a six per employee per month. So again going back to the issue on the individual market, we do have arrangements, our relationships the opportunity to make changes we have that based on reform or other options and at this stage we\u2019re looking at an effect in the overall impact that we know more about the overall factors that I talked to you at the beginning.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Josh Roskin] with Barclays Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess just a question on the prior period reserve development and how we should think about, I know it is only sort of one quarter in and I guess if I look at it as a percentage of prior year costs it\u2019s now little bit more consistent with sort of a ten year average. So should we think about this as a more normal course of business and probably being consistently reserved for in the current year?", "Steve Hemsley", "I don\u2019t know how it relates to previous years in terms of what we should project in the future, but I want to reiterate and I said this last time on the fourth quarter call that our reserve costs remain the same today and that our total prior period development is consistent with previous years, [Josh], as you mentioned, at or below 1% of medical cost. The prior period development experienced in the first quarter is a continued theme that we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the later half of 2009, both themes I talked about as you may recall on the fourth call.", "If we had numerous changes in 2009 in our mix of business within our risk customer base, the government business as you may recall grew sharply while commercial business declined, this obviously creates some volatility in our claims data. We continue to benefit from the operational improvements we\u2019ve been discussing for some time now, as I stated before, our auctorial models take time to adjust through those continued improvement in quality and accuracy of our claim payment.", "We also now are seeing that we have lower utilization in the fourth quarter than we had originally estimated as we didn\u2019t see the level of benefit rush, we typically see in the commercial business. When we take into account H1N1 flu and that we continue to see that experience true up favorably, all of these would contribute to a larger development in the first quarter. We booked, as we stated for years, [Josh], to our best estimate, we don\u2019t forecast favorable development, but I want to remind you that our reserve processes are consistent, centrally control and haven\u2019t changed over the year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just a follow-up on that comment on utilization, you talked about lower utilization as I remember back in the fourth quarter as well, could you comment, how that trend progressed in the first quarter and maybe specifically around the facilities?", "Steve Hemsley", "", "We did see utilization in the fourth quarter continue to subside, so if you look at our trends overall for 2009, we had given a range of an estimate of around 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, that is trued up favorably. We\u2019d still be in that range, but it would be at the lower end, where we expect to see comparable trends for 2010 specific utilization, we saw favorable utilization in the first quarter related to flu, the later flu season as I know, you know and we had the storm impact [all these]. That being said, you know, we continue to see utilization in facilities to moderate and over specific to all the actions we put in place across our health benefits businesses, not just the commercial business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "I was [specific] you guys don\u2019t generally breakout development by product line, but I would (inaudible) living room here to 79% commercial lost ratio, with them a lot more, even if you add 500 basis points, you\u2019re still pretty significantly under that. So can you give some sense kind of, it sounds like you had a significant amount in commercial? And then as a follow-up, could you just take about kind of your expectations for Medicare Advantage versus where you kind of came out?", "Steve Hemsley", "", "Mike, can you respond the -- when you asked about where we came out on the Medicare Advantage, we put that in context for me Christine.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "Kind of relative to your expectations, how much of the results you feel, you really know right now versus how much has flowed through from 2009?", "Steve Hemsley", "", "Okay. Mike, you want to answer the first part.", "Mike Mikan", "The commercial loss ratio, Christine, as you know we reported an 84% medical loss ratio for commercial on 2009. We expected a slight decrease in that loss ratio on 2010, there\u2019s no expected H1N1 flu. You know our business is seasonal; our loss ratio within the commercial business increases over the year, especially into the fourth quarter, where we expect that deductibles were off and utilization will increase.", "Last year, as I just mentioned the part of the favorable developments, we did not see that level of increase, you can surmise that a portion is related to the economy could be so, but we do anticipate that developments -- that utilizations will increase.", "In 2009, we had a fair amount of favorable developments in the last two quarters. We don\u2019t forecast favorable developments, so if you just take the natural progression of our loss ratio throughout the year including the up-tick in the fourth quarter, you would get to our revised estimate of 83.5% plus or minus 50 basis points for 2010.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "But how did the -- if we were to restate 2009, commercial loss ratio with this positive development in \u201909, where was the commercial loss ratio on \u201909?", "Mike Mikan", "It would still be within the range that we did plus or minus 50 basis points, it would have trued up favorably. But I would not draw the conclusion that all the development was on the commercial side, I would say was evenly mixed with the benefits businesses.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "So if it\u2019s 84% reported in \u201909, I can take 50 basis points off that and say it was no better than 83 trued up in \u201909?", "Mike Mikan", "Christine, I would say that it would stay within that, I don\u2019t have the exact number, it\u2019s 84 plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Steve Hemsley", "So, let we move to the next question, that was three prom counting. So next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "United continues to have a very strong balance sheet and as you\u2019re reporting this quarter, debt ratio is down, cash (inaudible) $1.9 billion, you raised your cash flow projections a bit. I\u2019m just looking, has there been any change or maybe evolution in your thinking in terms of how you expect to deploy cash over the next few years, and in particular, I\u2019m interested in your discussion, your thoughts on a larger shareholder dividend?", "Steve Hemsley", "May be I will comment on that. We have, I think, over the last couple of years, I have been just thinking in terms of how well the balance sheet has been managed and kind of the financial affairs. The cash flows are strong, it does not change our view of how we would deploy that capital. We still see our priorities being whenever we can find opportunities deployed for growth and strategic expansion of our business model that is our primary focus. It also includes the continued investment in kind of the continuous improvement of our existing businesses and I think that that\u2019s been manifest in a number of the performance gains over the last couple of years, we continue on that path and then a view that we should be both buying shares as well as having a dividend and we have signaled in the past that we were pursuing and evaluating, strengthening our dividend levels and that we were looking for the reform period to pass along those lines. So we are moving down and progressing on that and that a stronger dividend has been in our sites for the last two years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Rex - JPMorgan.", "John Rex - JPMorgan ", "I understand kind of the vagaries of the [red drying] process. One thing I just wanted to focusing back kind of where the first question was and maybe if you can help to [levels] that a little bit and thinking about on, if you look at our loss ratio in individual book, if you look in our loss ratio in the small group book, if one were to strip commissions out of the revenue line, so as it\u2019s reported, on average kind of for those two books. What would be the basis point impact in the report in MRC? And then just kind of the second part of that is, are you building in flexibility for \u201911, given you writing business that extends into \u201911 right now? Are you building in any flexibility to impact how you pay commissions and the commission levels depending on how well this comes out?", "Steve Hemsley", "So the flexibility part, I guess, the first part you\u2019re going to have to receive\u2026", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "Okay, if you just stripped commissions out.", "Steve Hemsley", "Yes.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "In those book, so it\u2019s commission are one of the big reasons that loss ratios appear low in an individual book for example, and if you were just to strip commissions out of the line, pick it up, pull it out of there completely, so say you\u2019re paying $10 on commission and a $100 (Inaudible) business, you strip it out, here is your new MCR. So what I\u2019m trying to get is, a sense for your book of business, because I kept the individual book, if I took the small Group book, strip commissions out of the revenue line.", "Steve Hemsley", "I would have to say that on this one, this is going to take some calculus and I don\u2019t really think that we should be kind of doing that in the venue so. We\u2019ll be available throughout the day for questions, because I can\u2026", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "I guess we\u2019ll make (inaudible) just, is it fair to say that I mean, that is obviously several hundred basis points of impact here reported MCR, and I was just trying to get your sense of the range.", "Steve Hemsley", "Well, I\u2019m not sure we can answer to that and I\u2019m confused by the commissions and the MCR.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "Commissions are embedded in your revenue line, right? So it deflates, the fact that in your revenue line deflates the MCR.", "Steve Hemsley", "Right.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "So, if were to pull commissions out, your MCR goes up.", "Steve Hemsley", "So that even more intensifies my first response and that is, you are asking a very complicated question that we really don\u2019t want to [speculate] on that. So we\u2019ll answer that for you through the close of the day, if you would call back.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "Okay that\u2019s fine. And then just, how about flexibility on the 11 commission levels depending on how do this falls out?", "Steve Hemsley", "", "I think Gail had answered that, that\u2019s basically our relationships with the distribution channels that have been and have been for years flexible and variable, the fact that how those operate. So I think we have a wide range of options available to us as we work with the distribution channels, but also that it is important that it is a factor in the health care landscape and has to be recognized.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "But I guess my point was could you writing business right now that goes into \u201811, could you still affect that business that you have already written that goes into \u201911 at this point or would that have to come later?", "Gail Boudreaux", "In some instances, yes; I mean, as we said, we do have a variety of relationships across our different distribution channels and we\u2019re in the process of having those discussion with now and effecting the overall impact. But again, there is a lot in this space, so I know as I said before, and I do want to reiterate that this product is a complicated product and we do believe that the distribution channels are going to be important now and in the post reform environment. So it does really based on the different relations we have.", "Operator: ", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "I had some question about the guidance, because it looks to me like when you take into account the upside in the quarter, just offsetting a little bit by the higher taxes in the quarter, it looks like you are basically leaving the rest of the year guidance unchanged even though it seems like the cost trends were a little bit better and then we saw it in Q1 and revenue just coming in better then you thought, so if you give any color there on the outlook for the rest of the year?", "Steve Hemsley", "", "I\u2019ll try to put it in the perspective, I appreciate the fact that we have -- I think we had a very solid first quarter and that the business are performing at very strong consistent levels and our normal trends are tracking some what above our initial expectation. But I think if you recall from our investor conference and our call in January, there are meaningful headwinds in 2010, that really not disappeared, but just the first quarter and the first quarter was affected by strong reserve developments.", "So we think our performance outlook for 2010, which has been meaningfully advanced is really a pretty fair reflection and trying to strike an appropriate balance recognizing that we still have a very troubled economic environment, employment levels are roughly 10%, 16% if you really get to the true level of  unemployment we\u2019re still seen a high levels of attrition. The 2010 Medicare rates were quite a challenge to address and we have to address them over the course of the year there are state budgets across the Medicaid landscape that are under pressure.", "As we mentioned earlier the Part D drug pricing changes have occurred and as you mentioned the tax was so - there are number of things to be considered have to recognize it for the first quarter and we think our new guidance range is a pretty fair representation of kind of where we are in the year, we might hope to do better if in fact the employment outlook were to change, but I think where we\u2019ve set guidance is a pretty measured spot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Lake - UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Just a follow-up first quickly on the commercial side, you took down and lowered guidance by about 50 basis points consolidated, but I didn\u2019t see anything on the commercial MLR, do you have a spot number there or should we think about it\u2019s more of a consolidated?", "Steve Hemsley", "We did take down the commercial MLR from -- we were at 83.3% plus or minus 50 basis points on Investor Day and we took 83.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Okay. Just wanted to confirm that, so essentially you\u2019re saying that the other businesses such as Medicare Advantage, Medicaid are doing better than commercial even though commercial was down 400 basis points or so year-over-year, is that a way to read this?", "Mike Mikan", "Justin, can you clarify, you\u2019re talking about full-year outlook?", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Yes", "Mike Mikan", "I don\u2019t think there is a 400 basis points for full-year outlook, so that\u2019s\u2026", "Justin Lake - UBS", "No I am sorry, I\u2019m just talking about the commercial market MLR, I mean this year versus last year, I guess that was actually about 250 basis points better year-over-year. So I guess I am really just trying to think about the Medicare margin expectations, it seems like it was a little bit better than what you expected, it is actually running better than commercial?", "Steve Hemsley", "The question has the commercial outlook has improved by 30 basis points, and the consolidated outlook has improved by -- ", "Mike Mikan", "Exactly. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s running better than commercial so to speak. So, I don\u2019t know exactly, where we\u2019re getting that data Justin, but I could spend sometime afterwards trying to understand your analytics around that. I would say that we are seeing as evidence by the favorable development that we size. I mentioned across all the Health Benefits business and the performance that where we went through the focus on the initiatives for the Medicare, the senior business.", "We are performing few or better than our expectations. So you are seeing improved performance across the Health Benefits and Steve laid all that out in the sprit. So, if I would have jump in Justin, I\u2019d say that yes, you\u2019re seeing improvement basically all the benefits and I know you have been appendant to kind of our dialogue over the last several quarters increasingly.", "We are looking at our businesses from a benefits point of view and health services point of view and on the benefit side, we have been taking that in very positive and measured steps to further integrate and harmonize our businesses across all the benefits landscape, and so that they all benefiting from better and more effective clinical care management, they all benefiting from consistence operating cost, experience.", "Our integration efforts have been moving forward on a quarter-by-quarter basis, very nice progressing move there, which reflected itself and really positive result with respect to the constituents we reserve customers care providers etc. Strengthening our reputation market response and absolutely improving our experience with respect to medical cost management, which is arguably one of the core responsibilities we have, but it is across all those and we look at it as the more uniform business.", "Steve Hemsley", "Justin, if you\u2019re just doing the math on it, why the full year consolidated medical care ratio is lower than the full year UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio and if you\u2019re attributing that to government business, I would only note as I\u2019d seeing the financial models out there appropriately. So, we have services businesses that impact that as well and then need to make sure you take that in a consideration.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "I guess my point is just the commercials improving by 30 bips, the overall improving by 50 commercial staff, that means the overall, the ex-commercials out of something like 75% to 100%. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out where the other businesses are doing much better. Is it Medicare Advantage? Is it Part D? Is it just across the Board? ", "Steve Hemsley", "It\u2019s across the Board.", "Mike Mikan", "That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said, including Medicaid.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Of course, and then just a quick follow-up on the commission side?", "Mike Mikan", "That would be about the fourth question, if I (inaudible) it, go ahead.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "The commission on individual and small group, I know they vary. Can you just tell us, what an average commission structure looks like for individual and small group right now?", "Mike Mikan", "Justin, I\u2019d say one is that, I thing it various widely. It does change in terms of the United States market as far from homogenous. It various market-by-market and I also think it's pretty comparatively sensitive. So I prefer not to respond to that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Steve, if we look out over the next three to five years, obviously it challenging fiscal backdrop for the U.S. We\u2019ve got this continued cost shift onto the employers. With reform implementation moving forward, how do you see the relationship between payers and providers evolving and just because if you could maybe tough on potential move from a product standpoint to maybe more network based offering to bring them cost, but also should we be looking for payer provider partnerships or alliances, just how do you see that evolving, again looking at a couple years?", "Steve Hemsley", "I would say, comeback to some things that we have struck in this conversation before and that is the fundamental issues underneath, reform or if that had not been reform remain the same, there is pension allowance, fair in appropriate access across the U.S. population, there is significant cost pressure that would as to the market dynamics in those cost pressures vary. As I\u2019ve said earlier, not a homogenous market it\u2019s more than our [compelling world of length].", "Health markets in this country, they do very significantly, but those pressures are real and I think you\u2019re going to see the payers and care providers work more closely together in different kinds of than using agreement to be able to respond to their needs to the marketplace more effectively and to get out more appropriate, more efficient use of our overall resources to reserve more people in the country and so you\u2019re seen and have been seeing efforts being made in more modern kind of capitation arrangements.", "We\u2019re seeing efforts made in medical home initiatives. We are seeing efforts made in pilots around much tighter, more intergraded kind of relationships and networks you\u2019re seeing, networks variations going on in terms of the breadth of the broad networks, and narrow networks, and variable networks etc. So I think you\u2019re seeing all of the above as the off search for kind of a solution that increasingly those are happening more and more together in a more collaborative context, and I might ask Gail, who receives it everyday, if she could respond to it.", "Gail Boudreaux", "In addition to Steve just outlined, I think the basic theme is, we\u2019re are going to continue to see affordable consumer (inaudible) product and throughout driving out of the few things, we have a number of things in the market already, when we talk about position or hospital partnership, we\u2019ve already talked about patients in a medical home, we have practiced for world, our positions were we\u2019re paying for qualities versus just volume and I think that\u2019s going to be a significant thing going forward.", "We\u2019re working on gain sharing arrangements through their special as to try to drive appropriate behavior around certain lines in specialty like cardiac. So there are number things in terms of the contracting methodologies in addition to work at optimist during in integrating the clinical and network care, which is also really important part of what we are doing.", "The last thing that I\u2019d ask, just significant transparency, we think that transparency will become a very important piece and we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that consumers have access to the right information to make the right decisions about their care. So, those would be the emerging theme.", "Steve Hemsley", "I think it\u2019s a great question. I think it also plays itself out, when I think about federally qualified health centers in the Medicaid business, etc., and we - maybe you have a prospective [offer].", "Mike Mikan", "I think that one of the things that\u2019s very important here is that the delivery system in our company has one thing in common, and that\u2019s the focus for the patient. The patient is where we intersect together and they increasingly now whatever happens from this going forward and intensifies the positive opportunities for that relationship.", "I would also add to Gail comment that we are also increasingly now in the delivery systems focused on signs and the ability to take signs and translate it into better quality. So much of what\u2019s Steve emphasis in his opening remarks were our capabilities to reach people and also to engage delivery systems based on signs and recommendation.", "If we have any hope to be able to prevent disease and to be able to just treat it cost effectively and ultimately in our investments and opportunity to have the data, the analytics, the information that people necessary to engage not only the consumer, but also the delivery system in an integrated way. So for us those things that we\u2019ve been sounding of the fundamentals being going forward and ultimately those are themes of collaboration and co-operations, not a function.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Carl McDonnell - Oppenheimer.", "Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer", "I think just a little pretty sensitive time politically for the industry, I mean reformers task, but as you\u2019ve pointed out the administration, there\u2019s a lot of desecration in terms of allow large implement. So how concerns that this earnings report the higher guidance into combination is going to reignite some of the negative sense I guess against the Group and result in some tougher implementation to the new regulations?", "Steve Hemsley", "I think first and foremost, do you have to reflect what the business is actually performing. So I think we have a responsibility on that level and have to meet that responsibility. So I also think that if you take a look at the performance of our business it is driven more by organic revenue growth and membership growth and market responses to think that we offered, the innovations that we advanced etc. Those are the same kinds of things we think this administration also as it appetite for and trying to advance and modernist the health system.", "Our interests are actually quite align on those levels and we had said for sometime that we are going to dedicate ourselves to be at enabler of modernizing and reforming the health systems, so that it works better and more effectively for all Americans and do it as the best we can and we have a very fluctuate diversified, I think model that serves across the market and I think that they want capable organizations, we\u2019re trying to advance that agenda and we\u2019re going to be committed to that.", "So that\u2019s the way we had work with them over the course of the last year, that\u2019s were we will continue to focus our efforts and work with them and I think our interests are more align and then they are separate and I also say that our results are what they are and that\u2019s what we have to report.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein", "My questions on the near and long term outlook from Medicare advantage, the first part of it is for 2010 relative to 2009, as you\u2019ve implemented your premiums and by downs. Can you give us a sense of what do you expect to margin compression to be, once you taken to account the loss ratio on any G&A improvement?", "Secondly, is there anything you\u2019re learning from the short term experience now that you have all the detail on quartiles and quality benefits and so on for what the sustainable margin proposition would be? And then finally, I had a question on relative positioning if you will for the various products in the senior market, you have got - I may have believe you and AARP perhaps have introduced this new Medsup offering and then if you could comments on those Humana, CIGNA alliance in the [employee market]?", "Steve Hemsley", "Well, we are just about to have added time with that question. I know we will try. So Ana, we will try, so [Larry], would you (inaudible), Ana you might have to (inaudible) so might have to help me with some of those questions. But I\u2019ll start and then we would kind of get into it. Last time when we signed out at about the - what we call the largest single rate cutting (inaudible) history, we started putting together a group of initiatives to help us maintain our 2010 operating earnings.", "At the December Investor Conference we talked about forward (inaudible) as a focus. We talked about benefit designs, growth, local cost managements, and our strategy of cost deduction. During AEP and the first quarter of the year, we have executed extremely well according to that plan. The result would be up where we are with that guidance versus our new membership.", "We also put together a lot of cost cutting programs and really initiatives that we instituted or implemented in the first quarter and at this point in time most of those programs are on target, they are on target, but we won\u2019t see the full benefit of those until the last six months of the year. So if were to make a comment on 2010 in our performance, we would say that we\u2019re still extremely confident in where we\u2019re going to be.", "Second question, I might not get these in order, but let\u2019s talk about the Humana, CIGNA partnership. We obviously have been operating and currently with the partnership very similar to that for a few years here and that\u2019s how we line up our group (inaudible) business with our commercial side. So Gail will drill on that stuff, we have our own competitive way of going after that and we won\u2019t comment on some of our strategy because a lot of things go into that, but it was an interesting future moves (inaudible).", "As far as - I think, you asked a question about product mix and what we think in terms of we\u2019re well performance for 2010, so let me build in a couple ways. If you looked at our metrics in terms of claims, utilization, unit cost, really the metrics that we look at in terms of how the business is running, we would tell you that they are all in line with our expectation.", "In terms of member mix and product mix, member mix is very broad based and the product mix today is favorable over last year and 72% of our new members are network-based products versus private-fee-for-service. And as far as the Medsup coming, I mean obviously we work very closely with AARP on all products and we have a common goal of trying to offer a variety of products to the same population. So we believe that post reform that Medsup and supplemental programs that are going to be very, very much and beyond and leave it by the seniors, should I get everything.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I guess overall, only just need a final sort of wrap up, should we take it that Med advantage is one piece of your senior business, but you\u2019re positioning yourself in multiple products and possibly multiple channels and customer bases too. Just sort of how to rounded out senior business (inaudible).", "Mike Mikan", "Absolutely, if you look at post reform, one of our main goals is outperform fee-for-service as Stephen stated, and part of that processes is looking at adjacencies of  products that should put alongside within your market segment.", "Steve Hemsley", "So, with that we\u2019ll just wrap it up by saying our first quarter results did exceed expectations in membership growth and revenue and cash flows and earnings. We\u2019ve seen organic membership growth in Medicare offerings, in Medicaid, in self-funded deployers, I know we are seeing meaningfully smaller declines in fully insured offerings.", "We\u2019re seeing increasing demand for our products and services across our Health Service business and we\u2018re consistently managing medical costs across our benefit businesses and operating costs across our entire enterprise. I would point out that healthcare reform is really just in the beginning stages, it is only a beginning, it will present challenges and will present significant opportunities that we are preparing to meet both at exceptional levels.

This morning we will share with you a review of our second quarter performance, a brief assessment of our 2010 performance at the halfway mark and some early themes for 2011.", "In the second quarter we again delivered consistent, positive performance across our businesses. Customers and care providers are seeing and responding to the increasing benefits of our steady focus on fundamental execution, coupled with the advantages of our scale and our commitment to the steady advancement of practical innovation that translates to more affordable cost and a better healthcare experience for them. Collectively these drive value for our customers, consumers and the healthcare system in total and they anchor our growth in financial performance.", "Second quarter financial results were once more highlighted by stronger than expected revenues, related to stronger overall business growth. We earned $0.99 per share, down slightly on a sequential basis, due to the greater level of favorable reserve development in the first quarter.", "Second quarter cash flows from operations of 723 million brought our year-to-date cash flows to $1.9 billion. This morning we will update our full year 2010 financial outlook. We now estimate 2010 revenue of about $93 billion, up approximately $1 billion since our April call and an increase of more than $2 billion over the December revenue forecast.", "Despite the weak U.S. economic environment, we're driving to a full year organic revenue growth rate of 6%. Once again in this quarter, four of our businesses had year-over-year revenue growth in access of 10%. We now expect full year net earnings in a range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share, led by diversified revenue growth and continued operating and medical cost discipline all supported by the advancing benefits of our scale.", "Let's turn to an update of our two major business groups. We believe our health benefit businesses serving the employer, individual, Medicare and Medicaid in community program markets, all gained market share this quarter and delivered revenues of $21.6 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Operating earnings increased to more than $1.5 billion. In the public and senior sector, we added a net 165,000 consumers in the quarter, bringing us to a total addition of 800,000 people served through the first six months of 2010.", "Better than expected growth in Medicaid, Medicare Advantage in Part D is driven our portfolio of strong consistent and reliable benefit offerings, in tune with the distinct needs and local market preferences for the communities we serve. Our team is steadily improving cost management in Medicare and senior products while advancing the consumer service experience and above all preserving the benefits seniors care about the most.", "Our sales and distribution processes have worked more effectively this year than ever before. In Medicaid, our positioning as a committed community-based organization that cost effectively provides quality care in local communities is translating into growth.", "Economic weakness continues to move people to state sponsored programs but we're also growing through new contract awards such as our recent success in Mississippi. Operating margins expanded year-over-year both in the quarter and through six months to an increasingly effective cost management and the advantage that our operating scale provides in this weight constraint state budgetary environment.", "Perhaps, most significantly on the commercial benefits side this quarter, we grew by 70,000 people, led by growth of 95,000 in risk-based offering. Nearly two-thirds of our local markets grew risk-based membership and nearly half of our markets generated fee-based growth in the quarter.", "These methods show the steady advancement of a strong turnaround from this time last year. There are a number of reasons for this momentum, even in the face of a challenging economy. We are using ever improving local market focus and engagement while leveraging the advantage of our national scale to deliver more specific, market relevant and cost-effective products at affordable price points.", "Our consistent accurate and responsive service is now emerging as a distinctive strength. Customer retention is strong with year-over-year improvements in every line of business and every region for our risk-based offerings.", "Product innovation has resulted in strong performance from newer, more affordable consumer engaged designs that deliver increased value to both employers and consumers. We are appropriately managing medical and operating cost in a more effective consistent systematic fashion and this success further improves customer value and growth.", "For the full year 2010, we now see overall health benefit revenues of more than $86 billion, a 6% increase over 2009. Rough make up of those revenues would be nearly 41 billion in commercial benefits, nearly 36 billion in Medicare and senior offering and a full 10 billion in revenues from our Medicaid business.", "Our health services businesses include OptumHealth Ingenix in prescription solutions all of which worked to modernize and advance healthcare as a system. We help drive better medical outcomes while lowering costs, deliver more efficient and consistent access to healthcare resources and advance consumer education, engagement and care provider performance.", "Our offering support the millions of Americans who work inside the health system to make the system perform more effectively and consistently. Our health services businesses continue the momentum we brought into 2010. Second quarter combined revenues grew 16% year-over-year to $6.2 billion and combined earnings from operations of $357 million were once again better than we had expected.", "Ingenix continued its strong growth spreads, second quarter revenues increased by $108 million or 26% with growth driven by the companies increasing government and care provider business opportunities along with some small acquisitions.", "Revenue backlog increased by a $117 million year-over-year to 2.3 billion, the portion of our backlog that we expected to deliver within the next year grew 15% year-over-year to more than 1.6 billion [ph]. Ingenix results include roughly $20 million year-to-date incurred in startup and development expenses for offerings to new products in markets both domestic and overseas.", "OptumHealth grew its revenue 7% year-over-year led by public sector contract awards and third party market growth which has been the pattern for the past couple of years. OptumHealth operates critical components of our health services business platform on both consumer and care provider dimensions.", "Through OptumHealth we connect patients and physicians using evidence based information, technology and personalized outreach that help drive better health outcomes. OptumHealth is increasingly engaged with physician and other care providers in more integrated care delivery. For example, our Colorado Connected Care Telehealth Network links to Denver based Centura Health network physicians with four rural health centers to deliver specialty care to medically underserved community and we are expanding our information and care delivery capabilities to other settings such as through various medical group partnerships, our own expanding clinical operations in the South West and our Evercare Geriatric Nurse Practitioners. OptumHealth\u2019s effective applications to those widely varied settings illustrates our growing capabilities to adapt to the diversity of care delivery settings in the U.S.", "Ultimately, this deeper integration into direct care setting driven by information and system based processes will enable us to improve the cost and quality of care delivery regardless of care venue or ownership structure. OptumHealth in our broad health services platform are critical to this effort.", "Like Ingenix, OptumHealth has invested more than $20 million so far this year in start up and development expenses in support of expansion capabilities and products serving the new healthcare markets we see emerging post-reform.", "Prescription Solutions continue to grow at top-line with 19% year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter with normal PBM margin levels. Some of you recently toured our direct mail facility in Kansas City and saw the modern operating technologies and high performance platform that serves our PBM customers. Prescription Solutions continues to make right investments to position the company for innovation, improved clinical and benefit integration and continued growth. ", "We are affirming 2010 growth expectations for our health services businesses after increasing them just 90 days ago, and expect our combined health services revenues to grow 13% around $24.5 billion in 2010. Looking at UnitedHealth Group's consolidated results, second quarter revenues of $23.3 billion increased 7% year-over-year driven by stronger organic growth across virtually all of our businesses. ", "Our UnitedHealthcare clinical management and care management efforts continue to show positive results. Medical cost performance is favorable to our expectations. The second quarter result is building steadily on the progress from our first quarter of this quarter and the second half of 2009.", "External factors also influence this outcome year-to-date including the more moderate flu season this spring and lighter overall system used in the northeast in the first quarter due to winter storms. The second quarter consolidated medical care ratio of 81.5% reflected these internal and external factors and was also impacted by $270 million in favorable reserve development, as compared to $30 million in last year's second quarter. ", "We expect to see greater healthcare consumption in the second half of 2010 after a moderate initial six months this year, and as we experience the typical seasonal increase in cost under high deductible policies, which continue to grow, and represent a larger share of our commercial risk business. We also anticipate slight uptick in medical costs in the fourth quarter due to healthcare reform related benefit mandate, and are including the ramp up of those costs in our 2010 outlook and forward pricing model. ", "We project this year's UnitedHealthcare commercial medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% plus or minus 50 basis points. Our consolidated second quarter operating cost ratio of 44.4% was well within our expectations and reflects the strength of our service, quality, operational integration and cost management discipline. ", "As noted earlier, our updated UnitedHealth Group 2010 outlook puts consolidated revenues at about $93 billion. We see our consolidated medical care ratio at 82% plus or minus 50 basis points and operating cost in the range of 14.6% plus or minus 30 basis points. We expect to see increased operating cost in the second half of the year due to the shortened and intensified Medicare Advantage selling fees. ", "We expect operating earnings of 6.6 billion to $7 billion for the year with operating cash flows approaching $5. We expect net earnings per share will increase year-over-year to a range $3.40 to $3.60 per share. We expect to fund about $140 million in dividends for the quarter and the repurchase up to $2.5 billion in stock this year. ", "As always share repurchase can be affected by a number of factors including the level of business expansion activities that occurs. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our health service and businesses. Currently, health services contribute about 20% of our operating earning. We think that it is underweight relative to our opportunities in that factor. Pursuing our natural areas of interest and confidence and health services could move it up toward a 30 to 40% range of operating earnings over the longer term. On health benefits side, we're likely to be more opportunistic in assessing mergers. Health net of the northeast is a great example of an opportunistic transaction with a positive outcome for all parties involved.", "Looking forward towards 2011, there are some clear head wins which are virtually all external. They include an uneven and jobless economic recovery, continued low interest rates which effect the earnings contribution from our cash and investments and in certain view of the state Medicaid rate environment given the pressures on state budgets, a comparatively more modest net decrease in federal Medicare rates than in 2010, increased medical and operating cost pressures related to the affordable CARE Act, the Mental Health Parity Act and expenses to prepare for compliance with the federally mandated ICD-10 [coding] HIPAA 5010 standards. We also won't have visibility on the potential impact for minimum Care ratio regulations for our commercial business until the Department of Health and Human Services announces its guidance.", "The list of positives heading into 2011 reflects an organization executing for its customers with rapidly advancing consistency and value. Our revenue growth rate is accelerating and we believe we are gaining market share as we aggressively and broadly address fundamental affordability.", "We are managing medical costs ever more effectively and consistently and we have outlined areas for further improvement in coming years. We are moving quickly on our plan to remove $1 billion in operating costs over roughly four to five years and are working on a patch to exceed that amount.", "Across the board, our health benefit businesses have improved our local market focus and value and cost positions. This has advanced customer satisfaction, retention and growth, which provides scale advantages to our services, operations and cost structure.", "The health services businesses should benefit from both the affordable CARE Act and stimulus funding as it eventually is deployed. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue to have good financial flexibility and we continue to nurture a broad pipeline of innovation at many levels inside the businesses as well as a natural market adjutancy beyond the edges of our businesses.", "Sustaining and strengthening our culture of innovation, innovation that is practical and benefits customers, Care providers in the healthcare system overall is critical to our future. We have asked one of our most entrepreneurial operating executives, Rick Jelinek to lead our new emerging businesses group and Rick will be joined by other talented executives with strong entrepreneurial backgrounds as well.", "This group will focus on translating internal innovation for applications beyond our businesses current week as well as helping to drive external innovation through our venture capital relationships and investments. Jack Larsen will assume Rick's role as CEO of the Medicaid business while Tom Paul is becoming CEO of the Medicare business. Both of these individuals will continue under the overall direction of Larry Renfro and Tony Welters. These and other changes will come forward as the year progresses and we continue to adapt to the changes we anticipate in the new American Healthcare market.", "In conclusion, we serve the full spectrum of the market and we offer the advantages of scale in an innovative and service oriented culture. You can literally see us adapting as an organization to the new demands of healthcare policy, the new American healthcare markets that are being traded and the new opportunities they will bring.

We will also have an opportunity to discuss our businesses and our 2011 outlook rater in greater detail at our investor day, which will be at New York on Tuesday, November 3rd -- November 30th, excuse me. So let me repeat that; on Tuesday, November 30th. We don't want you showing up there on the 3rd.", "I will now turn this call back to the moderator to take control of the questions and answers. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen", "Good morning. My question relates to reform. You indicated that reform in Mental Health Parity will likely increase the trend. How do you think about that and can you give us some examples of what you're doing to mitigate that and to make it more predictable?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah. Christine, as you can appreciate, that answer varies greatly across the different settings and the end use. So there is kind of no pin point answer to that, but I think Gail Boudreaux is probably best positioned to respond to that.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Good morning, hi Christine. It's Gail Boudreaux. In terms of your second part of the question which is how are we mitigating some of the trend, I think the focus -- our focus has been on affordability and overall how we manage that affordability with our employers. So we continue to be very disciplined around cost management, managing unit costs and working with our employers around different solutions, around product offerings. Lean products have been particularly important this quarter, where we saw very nice growth in those areas.", "Our simply engaged products grew by 78% as one example of that. We're also seeing interest in value based network type products and I think those have begun to gain traction again in many of our markets across the country. So if I would summarize it, I think it's a couple of things, that our product placement in local market and it's our ability to help our employers manage their medical costs both through our care management program, some of our disease management programs and the last thing is the engagement of the employees themselves if they're interested, how do we get those employees engaged to biometric screening and other things? So it's pretty much a combination of all those things, as employers look to manage their total cost structure.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Thank you, next question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "", "Hi, thanks and good morning. Also reform related, I guess, could you talk a little bit about maybe the spending. I think you mentioned in some of the segments, some investments that you're making. But I wonder if you could break out what your investment spending is regarding reform this year and then if you could help us understand what the impact is on the 2011 selling season, are you seeing different patterns emerge from employers and benefit managers?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "I think we'll parse this up a little bit. I might ask Mike to offer a view about our total level of spending. I think have been keeping that in check and we are kind of deployed across our businesses with respect to healthcare reform. And then I think as terms of examples, I might ask Andy Slavitt and Dawn Owens to give some of the examples of its kind of efforts we're making in terms of investments.", "Mike Mikan", "Hey Josh, this is its Mike. Steve laid out in opening comments investments that we are making broadly speaking within Ingenix and OptumHealth, I'm not sure I'd would like to quantify all of those is you know health reform and our business growth prospects are pervasive across all our businesses. We make investments every year and it's all with the idea of growing our businesses, so, we laid out some examples for you, but I wouldn't want to quantify them as obviously it's a very diverse business.", "That said, if you just look at our operating cost, we're well within and even better than our original expectations. Remember at the Investor Day, we laid out an operating cost target of 14.8% plus or minus 30 basis points. We reduce that as we teamed into the year managing our cost better than we had set our plan to. We continue to drive productivity improvement. ", "So, all of these investments are embedded in that and are offset with the productivity gains that we're making, we're going to continue to drive that into the future.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Okay and then the 2010 selling season?", "Mike Mikan", "Just one second, Andy and Don, you want to offer a couple of examples?", "Andy Slavitt", "Sure. Josh, hi Andy Slavitt of Ingenix. So, Ingenix's second quarter continue to see strong growth, at 26%, Steve, I think remarked that we've had year-to-date about $20 million in investment so far through the year in the areas you might expect. I'll pick two, EMRs and meaningful use and program integrity and fraud prevention are two strong growth areas.", "So, we continue to see a high growth horizon, and also we're planning to continue to invest heavily in the opportunities to get us there. Don?", "Dawn Owens", "Yeah, and then from the OptumHealth perspective, we're looking at how the opportunity exist to get closer to the actual care delivery system, if you look at what everybody is looking for its integration of cared, patient-centered care and so forth. So how we take our tools and our capabilities and build them into the healthcare system to optimize both the access of care as well as the delivery of care.", "And the Centura Health System example that was sited earlier in the opening remarks of the call, is a wonderful example of where we see the transit, translation of what we've been doing in the commercial marketplace with employers that can really help and apply in the direct health delivery stage as well and so, that is really where our activities in efforts of focus within OptumHealth.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Josh, give me 2011 again, what is your question?", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "It's just with the impact in reform on the 2011 selling season, are you seeing different patterns behavior from your employer groups and your benefit managements?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think I had offered two versions to that, Gail, may be on the commercial side, but then I think we should be talking about the government side because of the change in the selling season on that, Gail?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Good morning, Josh, in terms of the 2011 season, behavior pretty consistent with what we're seeing. Employers are focused on managing their total cost and as I said a few moments ago it's really all about affordability. We're in the midst of the 2011 season right now for national account though, from that perspective, again, we're seeing three things. ", "Total cost management focused on getting in price engage and getting more value out of the programs that they have, so they are very interested in the care management with this management program and so that behavior has been very, very consistent.", "And we're obviously working with all of our employers to make sure that we implement the provisions that go into effect in September, as part of the renewal process.", "Tom Paul", "", "Josh this is Tom Paul and regards to the Medicare program I think as you are aware the open enrollment period beginning January 1, going to the March 31 for this next selling season is eliminated. So, that is requiring us to move much of our sales into the annual election period which begins on November 15 and concludes on December 31.", "But it is requiring us to really to move much of our preparation and on boarding of sales agents and marketing materials etcetera at an earlier stage but we are well positioned to accomplish that. The second thing that I would bring up that is important for this selling season is the special election period that will incur as a result of the change over and the Private-Fee-for-Services marketplace throughout the industry and as a result beginning in on October 1 there is a special election period for individuals and plans that those plans won't exist after '11.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, I would like to win on but I would say in total that I think we are well prepared and we expect to pretty responsive marketplace. Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "", "Yes I was wondering if you can talk about how your pricing on the commercial risk products has evolved during the year. Clearly the trend that you were experiencing in the second half of last year was at least it seems was significantly higher more pressure than what you see if you actually brought down your pricing and I am asking it partially does it looks like the yield is lower or is that a more of a function of product mix and where you see that going in the back half?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think Gail is probably best to respond to that.", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "Good morning. In terms of, there is a couple of points to your question, one is as with the yield question first, that is a results of the change in mix and if you think about yield it's a combination of geography line of business, customer segment etcetera.", "Our medical cost as you can see from our results have been very consistent over the last several quarters but we continue to price the same way we have which is to that forward view of our medical cost.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so you wouldn't characterize it necessarily the way that I have with sort of step down function from second half '09 to first half of this year.", "Gail Boudreaux", "It's really a mix issue and as you know we have put a lot of new products into the market as well, some of those have a benefit design and again we are pricing to what we believe is our view of the cost in those products. So, it really is a part of mix both geography and product as well as market customer side.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "And were you seeing a meaningful change in the employer appetite on the risk side for the linear benefit products?", "Gail Boudreaux", "We saw a quite bit of growth this quarter. We are really pleased with the growth we saw as you saw from our results of 95,000 of fully insured growth. A lot of that growth did come from linear products where employers particularly in the small end of the market are very focused on managing their overall cost. We also saw a nice uptick in our employer retention numbers which again I think is an example of our ability to offer them a suite of products where they can offer multiple choices to the employees but yes that has been a very positive improvement in our positioning in the market place.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you and next question please.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "", "Thanks I was wondering if you can just give us a little more precision on what you are seeing in the utilization trends in the first half, it appeared to be fairly light slack utilization trends, kind of what areas were surprising to you? And then as you look at the second half, obviously you are looking for a significant uptick there and so maybe like aside from the seasonal impact two-tier utilization commercial books what elements you think will drive utilization higher in the 2H?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think maybe Mike --", "Mike Mikan", "I will start from let's say a broad perspective John. We last year at the end of the year; we had anticipated the flu season, H1N1, we expected a normal flu season within Q1 of this year. We have as you've seen through our prior period development, we've seen that true up favorably, that continued into the first quarter as we had a lighter flu season. We did have the storm impact in the northeast that Steve had mentioned, and then frankly we've just seen lighter utilization across all cost categories. We are now expecting our trend to come in favorable to what we had originally estimated at 8% plus or minus 50 basis points. We would revise that to be more in line with 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points today, and again that's really utilization across the board. I'm not sure I would isolate anyone individual item, there are many. I would know though that unit cost pressure continues to be the principle driver of trend, but that being said, we are seeing favorable utilization. And with respect to the latter, the second half of the year, we always see as you know an uptick especially in our commercial line of business as a result of the deductible wear-offs, so there\u2019s seasonality, and we should also mention that lighter flu season that we saw in the first half. Obviously, we don't expect that to replicate in the second half. So, we\u2019ll see an uptick in our medical loss ratio as we always do in our commercial business in the second half of the year. ", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "And are bed days running negative at this point, commercial bed days?", "Mike Mikan", "I would say we continue to improve our bed day performance year-over-year. I would say they are flat to slightly down, and even driving that. A lot of that is directly related to the clinical programs that we've implemented over the years, and we continue to see improvement. ", "John Rex - JPMorgan", "Thank you.

There are signals in the market that you\u2019ve begun communicating with brokers on commission levels for 2011. I'm just wondering if you could share with us what you're thinking in regards to the timing and magnitude of the changes and maybe if you could give us any specifics on the individual versus the (inaudible) market?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think that's clearly. Gail?", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "Good morning, Justin. On the individual markets, we did send a letter to our brokers because we don't know the ultimate disposition of the medical cost ratio, and we are concerned about the impact that could have on individual market. We sent a letter in May indicating that there could be changes in January when we knew, when we know more about what happened. Brokers are an important part of our distribution channels in that marketplace, and the reaction of our brokers has been they are happy that we are being upfront with them. But at this stage we haven't been specific as we just don't know what the true impact will be. In terms of the reception that we got from the brokers, we had a very good quarter in our individual business. We grew, we got strong sales still and our distribution channel have been I think very positive for us, so that\u2019s something that we continue to work on, and that's really -- we've seen the activity in that market, and many of our competitors have followed our lead in that regard.

We're just trying to obviously stay flexible and stay communicating with our customers and our brokers about that but we don't know.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Thank you very much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you and maybe next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, thanks. I was wondering if maybe if you could comment on the NAIC process so far? Do you have any concerns regarding the resolutions that are passed so far, if there are any outstanding issues that you're looking forward to giving input on?", "Gail Boudreaux", "With respect to the NAIC process, we've been very involved in the process over the last few months in giving inputs to both the NAIC and Health and Human Services and appreciate that opportunity. You have been encouraged by what I guess I would characterize as broad day support and recognition from employers in particular as well as individuals in states about the need for cost containment and the value of the clinical program and the recognition quite frankly that the Care management, disease management programs have real value in the system, that they do three things, one they improve quality up here and help us reduce unnecessary costs and ultimately improve people's health. From that prospective I think that's been encouraging and employers who are selecting and picking these programs have started to engage in the discussion and provide support about the importance of those programs. In terms of the overall definition, when we look at how it's defined, what the Health and Human Services does once they have that decision, again we really don't know and we'll be waiting for their input and to the final resolution of that.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So are there any kind of house setting issues that you feel are some of the more important ones that we should be following?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Actually we don't. We are engaged in the process but it is their process. The determination will be made and we expect it will be partially made. So I think that's all we really can offer on that subject.

How are you analyzing increased medical costs related to family coverage for children up to age 26 towards the end of the year and how much of your higher cost expectation in the second half of the year is related to that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Maybe I -- I'm not sure we can answer that in a degree of precision because that is a pretty specific narrow question we have -- that kind of varies significantly about what were already in the benefits, what the books, how the books were already positioned on that. I don't know Gail if you have an observation on that but I'm not sure that we can really give you a precise answer to that question.", "Gail Boudreaux", "The only thing I would add to Steve's comments is that we're taking a look at this in the large group on a customer-by-customer base. It's obviously been different from where they are today versus what the provision impacts then has a range of answers and on the small end of the market we're looking at it by product-by-product. So rather than give a specific answer, I think an awaited answer to that off flows, I think that would be misleading.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Tom I just want to make sure we're clear. All of those items are reflected in the revised trend that I just gave and also in the UnitedHealthcare loss ratio for the year at 83% plus or minus 50 basis points. So we reflected those additional cost of the second of half in those forecast.", "Tom Carroll - Stifel", "Okay, so in terms of magnitude this doesn't seem to be a, I guess what I would call a material unknown for you right now, is that fair?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I agree with that. That is not a material unknown we've incorporated that into our thinking going forward, or we've incorporated it into our benefits, pricing going forward and into our outlook.

Just relative to the final reg which I know that there was some concern in the industry just around some of the rules included, and if you think that there is going to be any changes to how that business is ministered, or how plans approach managing behavioral cost because of the final parity rules?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Hi, the new rules went into effect in July of this year. They go into effect on the effective date or renewal date of the group, and so while we have some clients could have gone effective in July, the majority of our business goes into effect in January. The areas of impact are both quantitative IED parts of the benefit plan design around cost sharing for consumers as well as non-quantitative to medical management network components, and we are very much on track with respect to our compliance with new directory with our customers, our health plans, and so worth making the appropriate adjustment to their plans into out practices to make sure that we are compliant, so that's concluded in our pricing, it concluded in our operating approach, and suddenly it causes employers and health plans to take a step back, look at mental health management in light of the broader health reform, and make some changes and adjustment, but I think we've been very much on the forefront both of communication, consultation and solutions with our clients to help make sure that they can maintain to focus the cost management and stewardship and support to patients in this very important area of service provision and coverage.", "So, we've been very busy to prepare for the implementation in the effective date, but at the end of the day it's just adjusting our model to make sure that they are confirming a new client.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "And do you have an estimate of what the aggregate impact on behavioral cost trends are from the parity legislation?", "Dawn Owens ", "It's not just towards the answer that you heard for Gail, it really depends on client-by-client, where they are coming from. We had a number of clients because of state parity regulations that were already very fully in line with many of the parity provisions that were impacted at a federal level, and so it can be extremely modest raw material depending upon where out client is along that spectrum.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Thank you, next question please?", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Good morning, my questions are about two reform provisions on the small group markets. So the first one is on Grandfather Clauses, I was wondering if you're seeing lower switching than you were seeing in five years in lower product design changes, so in essence maybe their retention is related to this, and potentially could change the role of brokers in that market? And the second question was on tax credits for small group low wage employees, did you see that to be a meaningful driver of membership growth membership growth going forward?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "Gail?", "", "Gail Boudreaux", "In terms of the two questions, let me start with the Grandfathering question on the impact of small groups. The rules on grandfathering interim rules has just come out so as it relates to switching at this point, I don't think that we really know at this point the impact that that will have on small group. On of the biggest concerns and I'll go back to this is affordability for small group customers and when you think about how the rules are written today, they can't shop or move their coverage, they can't change the precautionary provision and they're eliminating the math of taking change on deductibles.", "Given that the biggest driver organic affordability, I don't believe that, that is driving other retention. I think it's really the offering in the markets run affordable product if we do see employers buying those leaner product designs, so I think that addresses the first question.", "And in terms of the second question on tax credit, we are supporting our clients with ways to calculate those credits, we think that there's an opportunity to help them in this marketplace, so we're working with small employers across the Board for them to take advantage of that where it's appropriate and we put in place, calculators and other support towards them.

I think it's too early to tell. We're very encouraged by the opportunity to reach a sect of employees that have historically been lower waged and have not had coverage, many of them, and we think that, that offering will be positive.", "We haven't seen a lot of switching in our normal market outside of when the benefit plans; we are seeing a lot of purchasing however it may plan. So, the market is very fluid and again it's all based on total cost and affordability, particularly for this small employer.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks.

Our capital approaches and so forth remain as a -- have been and we think we have a very, very significant capacities within our organization. Mike?", "Mike Mikan", "Stuart, I want to clarify. We have not -- said that our target is 40% debt to total cap. We've said that we believe this business can support around the 40% debt to total cap level.

What I can say is as we have seen in the last several quarters favorable reserve grew up across all the benefits businesses.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And Peter on the second part I mean that is, we have been focused in spanning across broadly the healthcare benefits markets for several years now. So, we have been looking across all the markets and see them in a more fluid state trying to basically take our cost positions, our service model, our information and focus them on how we could best serve those individual markets recognizing there is going to be movement across them and we think the exchanges represent potential in other opportunity to segment a market place and pursue them with our offerings and Gale maybe you want to add to that?", "Gail Boudreaux", "", "Peter in terms of the individual market and how that plays out in exchanges I think it's too early to predict. There is going to be a lot of variables that affect the commercial marketplace not at least of which is the economy over the next several years and quite frankly there is still a lot to be defined yet how the exchanges are going to operate. One example we are already working in private exchanges, the great example is the National Restaurant Association and the individual market today sell through internet exchanges is pretty extensively. So, we have lot of experience, we are going to continue to work with other states if they bring up exchanges and we have seen that already in several states.", "So, I think our approach we are going to try different product offerings, different ways to reach consumers, we are going to learn from that. We feel like we have some really good results over this quarter that based on trying different products again putting them in the marketplace, testing them, that we will learn really what consumers are interested as part of that and be prepared for 2014 when the exchanges come into play.", "So, our approach is really learn as much as we can, test a number of things, really use our innovation agenda, and we have a very strong individual product portfolio today with some very nice traction and offerings that afford consumers a good price point. So, as I think about exchanges in the commercial market and individual, our goal is to be prepared as the rules are defined and as we test things in the market.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Maybe Rick you could give a few thoughts.", "Rick Jelinek", "", "Peter, Gail covered that very well from a individual standpoint I guess. I might add that in addition to the precursor elements that we participate in, in terms of online shopping tools in the individual and small group market we also interface with other intermediary type programs today, 1-800 Medicare. There are various examples in Medicaid as it relates to enrollment brokers, and how we interface at the state level, and so balancing our experience with the regulated entities on the federal and state side would be more open market on the individual side is where we are bringing together our competencies to prepare for the future. But it's still new and there is a lot of information terms in rates that have to be written; even in the absence of those detailed regulations, we have groups inside our organization today that are beginning to flush out the participation requirements of the cases that we know about, and the ultimate positioning across the enterprise. ", "Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks so much.", " ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James", "Thanks a lot. My question relates to the AmeriChoice business. Back in the investor day, you gave a expectation regarding your rate outlook kind of low single-digit in light of state budget challenges and [FMAC] being in a balance so to speak, I was wondering if you are in a position to at least update that or timing on what you see now?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jack Larsen?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure. Hi Michael. So we did have a point of view at the Investor Day Conference, so low single-digit rates. As you all know state rate constraints have been something that are not new to us AmeriChoice. We are in the same position we were then, we still expect those kinds of rates. Much of our rate increase for the balance of this year would be settled up here in the next 30 to 60 days, as states finish their own internal budget discussions, and we're working with them and making sure we stay close to that whole decision process.", " ", "Michael Baker - Raymond James", "Thanks. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Credit Suisse. ", "Charles Boorady - Credit Suisse ", "", "I wonder if you could expand on the scope of the new business group that Rick Jelinek will be heading up just in terms of the total financial commitment, and over what period you expect that to be deployed, just how significant could it be? And would these monies be expense as part of our internal development of new business or incubations, or do you see it being invested in, to show it up as an investment on your balance sheet if it's in the form of making minority investments in other companies or investment in venture capital funds that focus on health businesses you think are interested?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, maybe I'll start and then I'll ask Rick to comment as well, but really this stems from an increasing emergence of innovation really across all of our businesses as well as the -- I think a number of the opportunities that healthcare reform is really putting pressure on. I think those things and some of the questions that were asked earlier in the course of the morning were around enduring themes about new approaches to affordability, new patterns or opportunities in terms of getting access and distribution of product into the marketplace. A whole spectrum of issues that you can only imagine from healthcare reform as well as our efforts to really expand and broaden innovation really across our businesses.", "Rick Jelinek", "In some instances, I think our capacity to take these kinds of thoughts and translate them into spawning new businesses that we needed to put more resource more focused, more dedication to that, and this is really an effort to do that that this isn't going to be a reporting business group. From a formal point of view, this is really a focus on getting some strong entrepreneurial resources focused on these opportunities and we expect that most of it will be largely expense in nature and kind of pulling these efforts together across our enterprise where we're already spending money. Some of them could be investments. I hope you know that we already make a number of investments and invest in the venture community and invest in a number of other areas. We have to plans to change in that agenda but maybe I'll get closer to it and have Rick and his team engage with it more directly. This is really making sure that we pool resources together to make sure that we optimize our opportunity as we continue to expand our innovation agenda and as healthcare reform opportunities emerge on the marketplace.", "Mike Mikan", "I guess I would just add Charles that over the last decade we built a very adaptable organization that can respond quickly to emerging opportunities in the changing market, an example that might highlight in the past then our response and I guess ultimate leadership position in areas such as Medicare Part D or consumer directed health plans, health banking, health technology and the like and like most of you we believe the pace of the market will quicken over the next decade and so this focus intent is to take advantage of that so that we can identify these opportunities early and act swiftly. And given that we are just creating a group, what the plan is, is to instill the business objectives of this into our 2011 capital and business planning process and so we'll accommodate that into our next year's plan. So we're exited about the opportunities and think this will create some additional business and growth for the company.", "Charles Boorady - Credit Suisse ", "It sounds brilliant and United does have a long track record in competing six special businesses and I'm trying to put parameters around, are we talking about 50 million a year, 100 million a year, or just kind of ball park on the capital you'll be -- additional capital you'll be putting into this effort above and beyond what you've already been doing on a run rate basis.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well maybe a couple of points I'd like to make sure that we come back and reinforce. One is we are deployed throughout our businesses in innovation and responded to the marketplace. I think you heard some of that from Ingenix and from Optum today. That's not going to change. This is really coming on top of it. The amount of capital we're deploying there, I'm not going to really respond to that. We'll talk about that I think a little bit more when we do our investor day review but I think most importantly is the intensity around pulling resources together that already exist across our enterprise and making sure we are basically taking two bits at the apple, that we're deploying through our businesses and then we're coming on top and looking at entrepreneurial opportunities over and above it. I don't think its something that is going to be required that much in terms of capital et cetera.", "Charles Boorady - Credit Suisse ", "Great thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning. Steve, obviously there is a lot of market focus on the coming MLR floors and pricing in general. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit broadly about your expectations looking into 2011 and beyond and your relative level of confidence and the outlook for commercial, the commercial risk business specifically and if you could tie that in just to how are you thinking about capital deployment in the share buyback program versus the dividend, versus the dividend you raised last quarter. Just relative to this uncertainty how are you thinking of making that investment in share buybacks?", "Stephen Hemsley", "", "My answer is kind of twp parts to that, obviously we don't know where regulations are going to set with respect to the care ratios and the impact in the commercial market place and then as we said earlier in our prepared comments, there are certainly a number of external factors as they were last year, as we headed into 2010 that we are concerned. I would offer that almost those factors are continued.", "We progressed well through 2010, we're positive about 2011. We see our businesses getting stronger and momentum building and I'm just really taking about core capability. We are seeing the market respond positively in that regard, so we have a positive outlook on our business and on 2011, relative to the markets perception of us and their response. All of those are encouraging and its quiet broad based in both out benefits and our services businesses.", "We just don't know about where the care ratios will sort out and we will respond in a constructive and hopefully creative way as they do. So, I can't really offer more on that, it hasn't really changed our perspective in terms of the overall direction of the business. We are committed and think positively about the benefits we face, when we think about reform, it will just put pressure on enduring things about affordability around modernizing the system about being more responsive in terms of what the needs of individuals are and we think we can respond with our capabilities, with better information, technology and care sight.", "We do think we are underweighted on services and that we have opportunities to deploy those same free confidences in a very impactful way across healthcare services and so we are -- in our head allocating more of our expansion capital in those directions. The end of the day, it doesn't really change -- it hasn't changed our capital outlook. We are investing in our core businesses, we are maintaining, we think a prudent capital structure and I think Mike responded to that earlier, we are committed to a dividend, we thought and contemplated that for more than a year.", "We expect that our dividend to -- we think we came out in a market relevant position and expect to maintain that and look at all the metric with respect to how our dividend is positioned and consider it each quarter and each year with our Board. I would say more broadly is the more allocation and focus on the healthcare services sector.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay and then Mike, if I could just ask as you were discussing leverage, should we be thinking about the leverage comfort range or however you want to say it. Maybe being a little bit lower right now and -- would leverage all else being equal maybe, drift back up, call it late 2011-2012.", "Mike Mikan", "Well I got it I think you got to take into consideration all the opportunities that are in front of us and the timing of those. I am not sure that I would change what we've said; we're operating at 30% on a debt to total capital. We are committed to the share repurchase program that we put out for 2010, the dividend that you've just referred to and we've got ample flexibility with a strong balance sheet to invest in the business both through organic and the expansions and I think as I stated earlier in terms of what the business can support, we feel very comfortable that the business can support and we've said this for years and we've grown and diversified since then that the business can support 40% debt to total caps. So, I think you got to look at it is as fluid and we're going to remain flexible and very prudent in our capital investments.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And really unchanged from when you stand back and look at this, our capital positioning and the half of these that we have really provide a really great opportunity for us to continue to expand and grow the business, on both sides of the benefits and services, maintain a prudent capital structure, maintain dividend and maintain a share buyback. The capacities of the organization are quite remarkable on those levels.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl Mcdonald with Citigroup.", "Carl Mcdonald - Citigroup", "Thanks, historically, the strategy there was been to price to trend and start to improve margins of the overall business, do you think that's still a viable strategy today? I'm sure if you said it differently, if you are looking at the pretax margin of 7% give or take, can that still go higher in this environment assuming the similar business mix?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I think that, I think the issue is -- I think that you can still price to trend. I think that is the appropriate long-term positioning of the organization and I think the interesting thing is the mix of the business, how you have to take a look at the totality of our healthcare services business and the diversity of it how we serve all of the market sectors as they move from one layer to the next, the tremendous leverage that exists given the fact that we have integrated our technology, in our operations that are increasingly integrating those, so I think there is tremendous capacities to deliver better value in the marketplace and to grow and to price to your underlying cost trend and continue to advance that business.", "And then on the services side, I think healthcare reform has, I've said this before, put the kind of dynamics into the marketplace around affordability, around need to modernize and simplify that the allocation of capital there, represents a growth opportunity for us or an organization that has been dedicated over the years the information technology and healthcare expertise. So I think we're pretty positive with respect to what the prospects would be if we really engage in trying to advance the healthcare system which is I think the mandated health reform movement. Next question.", "Operator", "And there are currently no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back to management.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, we thank you this morning, we did have, we think very solid strong second quarter results and striking elements be accounted characteristics in the acceleration of organic growth and I would say the increasing quarter-by-quarter effectiveness of our overall programs with respect to managing very appropriately medical costs and our operating cost.", "And while people are justifiably focused on health reform, this is really only one element of the market dynamics. The market broadly present challenges and great opportunities and we are really preparing to meet them and to the respond and we thank you for your attention this morning.", "Operator", "", "And thank you ladies and gentlemen this will conclude today's conference call.

I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] ", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. This call and its contents are the property of UnitedHealth Group. Any use, copying or distribution without written permission from UnitedHealth Group is strictly prohibited. ", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we\u2019ve filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 21, 2011, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will review our first quarter results and how those results underpin our outlook for a strengthened full year 2011 performance. ", "To put the quarter in perspective, we are serving an ever-increasing array of customers across the healthcare system. Our portfolio of products and services is growing, and they provide opportunities for deeper involvement and penetration in serving customers' need. They enable us to deliver more comprehensive solutions, and as a result, we are developing longer, more durable and more expansive relationships.", "We are delivering products and services that are more affordable in how they are designed, delivered and how they perform. We are driving higher quality and lower-cost outcomes and better information and interoperability on behalf of our customers. As a company, we have become more flexible and innovative in our products, services and approaches. And we're getting better at combining these in practical ways to meet specific customer and market needs.", "We are developing new products and new ways and venues to serve our markets. Today, we can be found in retail settings, social networks, mobile applications, delivered in clouds, in true connectivity, embedded in alliances and associations and inside care provider systems and care settings, as well as delivered through consultants, brokers and agents serving the spectrum of market segment.", "Every quarter, we are becoming more aligned, more integrated, simpler to understand and easier to do business with. We are today more easily recognized and more accountable to our customers under the UnitedHealthcare and Optum brand. Our products, service and performance commitments meet and exceed customer expectations, are more trusted today. We are more invested in relationships and more innovative in our solutions. These themes resonate powerfully in our people, and while there is more to be done, we believe it's making a difference in our business performance. ", "So as we update our view of 2011, we now forecast full year revenues to approach $101 billion, nearly $2 billion above our initial forecast from November, and a nearly $7 billion increase over 2010 results. We expect per share earnings for the year to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05 per share, an increase of $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. We see operating cash flows strengthening to a range of $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion.", "In the first quarter 2011, our revenues exceeded $25 billion, an increase of nearly 10% year-over-year and nearly double the rate of growth in the first quarter one year ago. Product revenues grew 23%. Fee revenues advanced 17% and premium revenues grew 9% year-over-year. Operating margins were stable at 8.7% in the quarter, with a strong mix of higher-margin service revenue offsetting a 10 basis point year-over-year increase in both the medical care and operating cost ratios.", "With higher revenues, a slightly lower tax rate and fewer average shares outstanding, first quarter net earnings grew 18% to $1.22 per share. These earnings were supported by strong cash flows from operations of more than $1.2 billion.", "Our strengthening reputation for service, value and innovation, combined with balance and trusted local market engagement continued to produce consistent growth for the UnitedHealthcare Benefits businesses. We grew to serve 1.25 million more people across these businesses during the quarter after adding 1.2 million in total in 2010. We are increasing our 2011 growth outlook to reflect the momentum from the first quarter performance, while still factoring in an expectation for a continued stagnant employment outlook. ", "First quarter results for UnitedHealthcare showed particular growth serving the commercial and Medicare Part D market. In commercial markets, we grew nearly 800,000 people in the quarter. More employers using fully-insured products retained UnitedHealthcare benefits in the last year and many more people chose UnitedHealthcare during the open enrollment season than we could have anticipated.", "Employment attrition was also a less negative factor this quarter. In government-sponsored benefit markets, we were privileged to serve 450,000 more people in the quarter. This was led by growth in Medicare Part D and supported by consistent and strong contributions from Medicare Advantage and supplemental health benefits. Seniors continue to be drawn to our Part D value proposition, which combines stable benefits, broad formulary access and reasonable prices for consumers, supported by award-winning service from our PBM OptumRx. ", "We served 360,000 more people in Part D across all product categories this quarter, despite being required to consolidate plan and withdraw from 5 low-income regions representing more than 200,000 pharmacy members in 2010.", "UnitedHealthcare grew its Medicare Advantage business by 95,000 people in the quarter. This included 285,000 seniors from very strong net new sales, 35,000 from an acquisition and a decrease of 225,000 seniors from market and product exits and programs that were not funded at sustainable levels. ", "Medicaid continued to perform well, led by growth in newer markets, such as Mississippi and Florida's CHIP program. In total, this strong and diverse growth performance helped UnitedHealthcare's first quarter earnings from operations grow more than $200 million year-over-year. ", "While the incidence of influenza was substantially higher this quarter than last year, overall medical cost growth was restrained. Outside of flu, we continued to see a more moderate level of medical system utilization in part to the effect of severe consistent winter weather conditions across significant portions of the country.", "We remain concerned about the drivers of medical cost growth, the most significant of which continues to be unit price increases. We follow long-standing discipline to pricing to match expected medical cost, and we continue to expect a return to higher utilization patterns this year and into 2012.", "The commercial medical care ratio of 78.6% decreased 40 basis points year-over-year and reserve development continued to be favorable. Our first quarter commercial results include a pro rata estimate of our full year care ratio rebates payable, which we increased meaningfully and factored into our updated 2011 outlook. ", "We also benefited from positive prior year reserve development in our Senior Public Program businesses. Coupled with effective medical cost results, first quarter performance was favorable to our expectations. Again, we expect a return to higher levels of health system utilization, as the year progresses.", "UnitedHealthcare businesses sharply reduced the ratio of operating expenses to revenues year-over-year. This occurred even with the addition of 750,000 consumers in fee-based programs, which have much higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues. This strong cost performance was driven by ongoing operating cost initiatives and the benefits of leveraging our scale by increasing coordination and systems integration across UnitedHealthcare's Health Benefit businesses.", "I should also mention that ours is the first organization with full HIPAA 5010 core certification. This is an important milestone in efforts to simplify healthcare administration in part by standardizing electronic information for healthcare payers and healthcare providers across the system. ", "In summary, UnitedHealthcare delivered another strong quarterly performance, driven by broad-based growth and fundamental execution focused on serving customers with innovative and affordable benefit products. It is well positioned to keep performing over the course of 2011. Longer term, we believe UnitedHealthcare\u2019s focus on innovation, affordability and ever-higher service for care providers and customers will continue to drive growth. ", "Moving to our Optum businesses. I would observe that over the past year, we have improved the alignment of our Health Services businesses to better address emerging opportunities in that growing realm. Earlier this month, we announced our Health Services businesses are unifying their external market presence under the Optum master brand. The change reflects the continuing evolution of these businesses and is focused on making it easier for the broad healthcare marketplace to understand and access our full range of capabilities for modernizing health systems and improving population health. ", "Our Optum businesses serve key participants in the health system, from life science researchers to care providers of all varieties and sizes to plan sponsors and consumers. A quick survey of recent market successes will give you a sense of Optum's growing scale and diversity. We expanded our total population health solutions to almost 600,000 new consumers associated with Fortune 500 employers, commercial payers and state-based programs. We closed new business providing pharmacy benefit management for roughly 400,000 consumers in settings as diverse as the labor plan market to independent health plans.", "Our EHR medical necessity compliant business serving care providers continued to see exceptional results closing contracts with some 178 new hospitals in the first quarter. In Connectivity, we secured our seventh statewide health information exchange customer. We also had several wins in the provider and integrated delivery systems segment of this marketplace. A number of hospitals purchased our computer-assisted coding solution to support their transition, the new ICD-10 coding system. And in consulting, we have a number of new awards from federal and state agencies, including the study of health outcomes for children with autism. ", "A market-leading diabetes prevention and control alliance continues to build momentum. Elements of this program are available in 29 communities today, including New York City. We launched new health plan customer for the alliance in February, and are in discussions with other health plans this month. We strengthened the alliance with the addition of Albertson's and Krogers supermarkets with their strong retail pharmacies. We will continue to introduce the alliance to new communities this year while adding capabilities to serve beneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid plan. ", "During the quarter, we implemented the new federally sponsored Telehealth project for the Navajo Nation, connecting health information and treatment data electronically to support complex children's neurology care in remote parts of Arizona. This project increases patients\u2019 access to specialist physicians while improving physician productivity and capacity. ", "These examples are intended to give you a sense of the breadth we offer to market as Optum and how we leverage capabilities and connectivity, intelligence, alignment and total population health management to help diverse customers solve specific challenges. This includes large growth opportunities in serving as an enabler of the integrated care model in various configuration to meet local market circumstances and including the early versions of ACOs as they evolve in the months and years to come.", "The goal we hold in common with all participants in healthcare is to help deliver higher quality, more consistent and sustainable levels of healthcare delivery, better patient satisfaction and optimal resource use, working locally to help improve medical outcome and to lower costs.", "In the first quarter, Optum's total revenues increased 20% year-over-year. Revenues increased 13% at OptumRx, 33% at OptumInsight and 37% at OptumHealth. We have strengthened recent acquisitions by integrating their capabilities into broader solution sets that we then introduced to our growing customer base. This deeper penetration strategy is accelerating revenue growth and is an important driver in the increasing pipeline of business opportunities that Optum is capitalizing on today.", "Sales of UnitedHealthcare have also grown meaningfully due in part to its overall member growth, which embed Optum services. OptumInsight's 57% or $30 million year-over-year earnings increase was the highlight of the quarter. OptumInsight expanded its operating margin by almost 2 percentage points through improvements in revenue mix, meaning sales with more software and less labor content and favorable leverage in operating cost. ", "OptumRx earnings were flat year-over-year and OptumHealth earnings decreased $34 million, both in the ranges we expected as we began the year. Both reflect efforts to realign, and re-baseline these businesses in 2011, positioning them for future earnings growth. Optum's overall results reflected 2011 realignment of businesses between segments and related revisions and service agreement, which we previewed at our investor conference last November.", "We expect Optum will continue to perform well over the course of this year. Optum is positioned to help customers address the growing pressures of state and federal regulation in cost containment and consumer and client expectations they face for quality and affordability.", "As we offered in our opening comment, we now forecast revenue will approach $101 billion in 2011. We provided the revised financial outlook summary sheet this morning that takes into account the stronger-than-expected start to the year and updates our expectations for various financial metrics across businesses. Our press release includes financial tables that realign historical business segment plans related to our current presentation format. This simply updates the preliminary information we provided at our investor conference. ", "We estimate our 2011 results will include up to $0.15 per share for an assessment of our pro rata portion of a policyholder claim of Penn Treaty, an unaffiliated potentially insolvent long-term care insurance concern. We have never sold long-term care insurance to understate licenses. The state insurance guaranty association laws require we and other insurers fund this company's obligation despite our having nothing to do with it. ", "Accounting rules do not allow accrual of these costs until Penn Treaty is deemed insolvent by a court of law, which has not yet taken place. We anticipate this will occur in the second quarter of this year. We expect higher levels of health systems use overall and the typical seasonal earnings patterns in commercial benefit, plus the potential $0.15 per share assessment, if it is recorded in the second quarter, will pressure results on a sequential basis for UnitedHealthcare, while Optum expects slightly higher operating costs as we continue to invest.", "So clearly, we anticipate second quarter net earnings per share will come in meaningfully below the first quarter results. We estimate 2011 full year earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.05 per share, driven by revenues above our initial outlook and slightly stronger margin. We believe this range prudently reflects our strong first quarter performance and appropriately considers challenges that may present themselves over the course of the year. ", "With the advances in growth and earnings, we now forecast cash flows from operations of approximately $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion this year. We continue to value financial flexibility and maintain strong liquidity and regulated capital position. Our first quarter debt offering was well received by bond investors. We believe our operating results and the continued strong financial positioning, combined with improving market sentiment around the risks of health reform, positions us well for a return to the debt markets later this year, if we choose to do so. ", "In conclusion, we see expansive market opportunities opening to health benefits and health services. And we have 2 strong platforms in place to pursue these opportunities. We're delivering consistent fundamental execution and solid operating and financial performance. These are driving diversified growth, improved physician and consumer satisfaction and higher customer retention. ", "It is still early in the evolution of a newer and more modern health care environment, but we are offering innovative approaches and capabilities to improve fundamental health service performance, higher quality and lower cost on behalf of all constituents. The market uptake for these innovations is accelerating. ", "We're interested in your questions this morning. As usual, there'll be one question per person so we can speak with as many of you as possible. And I'll now turn this call back to the moderator for your questions. And thank you again for joining us this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel [Stifel Financial Corp.]", "Thomas Carroll", "These are very strong earnings we're seeing here today, certainly greater than expectations. But how should we think about how these earnings relate to potential rebates that United might have to pay back, I guess, what, late next year? Can you quantify this for us some way?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I'll let Gail and Dan Schumacher respond. But I will offer that they have been fully considered in our results and our outlook.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Tom, obviously, we're very pleased with the performance we had in the first quarter. We revised our full year outlook. So in doing that, we also increased our quarter and full year expectation of our rebate meaningfully. And I think the other thing that's important to remember inside that is that we made some very nice progress in markets where we are operating today above the minimum threshold. So all of those things are taken into consideration, both in the quarter and on the full year, and it's fully reflected.", "Thomas Carroll", "So your premiums today include an offset for some estimate that you made baked in for rebates?", "Dan Schumacher", "Absolutely.", "Thomas Carroll", "And there's no way to quantify that for us today, even just a range?", "Dan Schumacher", "I guess what I'd say, Tom, is there's a lot of elements that go into our decisions as well as our performance. And that is simply just one of them. And we don't individually isolate those other elements, and similarly, we don't plan to with respect to rebates.", "Thomas Carroll", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Just a question on the MLR as well, I guess. You cited in the press release moderated levels of overall health system use. So you spoke a little about that in the second half of the year. Should we assume that the trend is continuing to show lower utilization or is this just the same level of low utilization? And then, I guess, does that include -- when you talk about rebates, does that include your assumption that you're going to pay out the rebates or are you making some assumption that you may be giving back premiums in some of those markets where you may be below the minimum?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Josh, when we talk about our trend guidance, we're thinking about that in terms of our core trend and our realized trend, and we don't incorporate rebate into that conversation about trend specifically. Obviously, coming into the year from a trend perspective, we did expect it to go up. We expect it to go up on the combination of the introduction of the reformulated coverage expansions, a more normal flu and then also a return to more normal utilization trend. And what we saw in the first quarter is that we did experience the coverage expansions and actually from a flu standpoint, we saw something that was a little bit higher than normal, but utilization broadly was lower than we had expected. And that was due in part, as Steve mentioned, to the winter storm season. So as we look at the balance of the year, we expect some more normal utilization trend to emerge. And we've incorporated that in our view. So when you think about our calendar year realized trend, we now have an expectation that's closer to 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, so down roughly a point from our Investor Day guidance. But I think it's really important to recognize that this is a calendar year realized trend, and it doesn't reflect our forward view into 2012. So we do expect trend to increase, and we're pricing for it. We expect to see continued unit cost pressure, which is a primary driver of trend. And we also expect more normal levels of utilization, which, frankly, have been abnormally low.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then, Dan, I'm just sorry, on your rebate assumption, are you assuming that you're going to pay those rebates? Or are you assuming that you're going to make other changes in the market that may get you closer to that MLR minimum?", "Dan Schumacher", "We assume that, as we make our decisions around the performance of our business, we're working to manage the rebates, obviously. And then we compare it against the thresholds and then we have an expectation of paying rebates where we exceed them.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks. And I want to congratulate you, Steve, and the company for maintaining the focus throughout this difficult period of reform. My question on medical cost expectations. And you talked about your expectations for utilization to pick up later this year and into 2012. And I'm just wondering if that's just based on conservatism. Or do you see evidence beyond the flu of it picking up? And are the assumptions you're using implicit in your rebate accrual the same as the assumptions on your guidance for medical expenses this year? Or can you be conservative in the accrual by assuming utilization doesn't pick up while you're assuming it does pick up for purposes of estimating medical trends?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan?", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I had to wrap it all into one question.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, it's actually a very good question. It's fair.", "Dan Schumacher", "So Charles, on the utilization side, as we step into this second quarter, we do expect utilization to increase most immediately related to -- we don't expect a carry forward of that winter storm season, obviously. And then it's really in the second half of the year that we expect to see that more normal utilization trend emerge. As we look at both our trends, our pricing, our involvement and work up our aggregate performance for the year, we then determine what our rebate is. So I would tell you that these factors are all correlated in our determinations, and they're fully reflected in our forward guidance.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And it actually relates to the previous question too, and again I reaffirm. Similar to 2010, we continue to see trends moderating, and it's moderating in the utilization and not in unit costs. So while we see those realized and then respond to them appropriately, that does not change our forward view of where these costs may ultimately go and that we don't think that these trends are sustainable. So an actuarial science would be on our side on that. And accordingly, when we think about our product and pricing, we think about a more normal trend.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. I wanted to talk about the Services business this year. I guess it's not clear to me why the OptumHealth margin outlook is down from the previous guidance. I mean, down year-over-year makes sense given the health parity cost and the mix shift. But based upon the fact that your commercial membership guidance is higher, and the state sponsor, I guess, is more or less in line, I would have thought that, that mix shifts would have improved at least versus prior guidance. And then just kind of following on to that, at the Investor Day, you gave kind of long-term margin guidance for all the Services businesses that were above where they are today. And I guess only OptumInsight is better now, but the other two are -- I just wonder if we could get some color about it. About what's going on there, particularly in OptumHealth, but then just kind of generally in long term in those businesses.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Do you want to take this, Mike?", "Michael Murphy", "Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I'll take an initial response, then I'll hand it over to Dawn Owens for further on OptumHealth. But as you may recall back at the Investor Conference, we did talk about 2011 being a rebate climbing year for several of the businesses within Optum. A couple of things that have changed since then, obviously, from the results you'll see that we've exceeded growth expectations, which we're very pleased with. And it's a good start on exceeding our expectations. But back in that time period we had made an estimate around what the re-baselining, some of the changes that we were making between the business segments. And frankly, as we trued those up and got to actuals those did impact OptumHealth's results. So even though we beat the revenue target, and the related operating earnings were generated from that as well, it was offset by just the re-baselining that we put through the estimates. So vis-\u00e0-vis what we projected, it's obviously a different result. But we're very confident and pleased with where we stand today. I'll hand it over to Dawn to talk maybe a little bit about some of the opportunities. But I would also say, Kevin, with respect to Optum, we showed some pretty significant growth as you noted in OptumInsight, and we're excited about that. In OptumRx, we continue to see strong growth, but we continue to make investments in that future platform. So again, back to the Investor Day conference, we're pretty pleased with early traction that we received. Dawn, you want to add anything to OptumHealth?", "Dawn Owens", "Sure, yes. I would say carrying on, Mike, to what you said. I mean, we feel very, very good about the growth that we achieved in the quarter. The external performance on sales growth across the board in our businesses contributed to, we believe, very strong momentum as we go throughout the year. Mike explained how that carried through to the earnings and what impacted that. But we see opportunity, not only in our traditional markets and serving sponsors and payers with our total population health solutions, but you're starting to see evidence of that coming through and applying those services into the care delivery marketplace and in other new venues for our businesses that really gives us strong momentum as we go throughout the balance of the year and look forward.", "Kevin Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess this quarter\u2019s kind of consistent with the view that, or historical precedent that the top line comes in better than we think but the margins end up coming a little bit lower. I mean, is there a view that kind of 2011 is, in fact, going to be the trough number and that 2012 we can see stable or improving margins in those 3 business lines?", "Michael Murphy", "Yes, I think what we feel good about again is the early traction. But as we look to the future, we think that you're going to see absolute operating earnings growth and margin expansions throughout our businesses.", "Kevin Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thanks. I just wanted to come back yet again to the med utilization questions. And so I wonder if you can break down to us in just the major 4 categories in terms of what you're seeing on the utilization trends there, which was kind of most surprising versus where you stood a few months ago in your expectation. And are any of them actually running negative in terms of units consumed?", "Dan Schumacher", "John, this is Dan. On the utilization side, I would say that, frankly, it's down broadly. It's down across -- down, I should say, more moderate across all those categories. If I were to highlight one area in particular, I would say inpatient is an area where we've seen more pronounced moderation. And we actually, in some instances, are seeing that negative. From our perspective, it's a combination of factors that contribute to that. Obviously, the broader factors around the economy are at play in there. But also, we see the progress we're making from our clinical agenda inside there. We see it in metrics that aren't influenced by the broader economy. Things like readmission rate, as an example.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And so bed days would be the only one you'd be seeing absolute negative territory though over the 4 main buckets?", "Dan Schumacher", "It certainly varies across the individual businesses within UnitedHealthcare platform and by geography. But overall, it is flat to slightly down.", "Gail Boudreaux", "John, this is Gail Boudreaux. Just a couple of points because I know we're focused on utilization components here. But I just want to bring us back to as we think about medical cost increases and trend, remember that 2/3 of our pressure is really on the unit cost side. And that intensity has not stopped. So while we have seen some lower utilization, we do expect that utilization to increase as we pace through the course of the year. The unit cost pressure particularly on the inpatient side, I think remains very intense. And we should continue to think about how we manage through that, which we're very focused on.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And that's running in the same area you've been in, right, in terms of the unit cost on the inpatient side, your typical year-over-year?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Yes, that's correct. And if you go back to our guidance overall on the unit cost side of that trend, it was in the 5% range in total.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. My question\u2019s about your recent OptumHealth acquisitions and the outlook for 2011 and going forward as well. Can you provide some color to us on how that fits into your stated strategy as you expected at the Investor Day, what the capital deployment has been? There's been a number of small things that has been done. And what the revenue and earnings potential are for those?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Ana, can we clarify, are you speaking just of OptumHealth or are you speaking of Optum, the Health Services Businesses in total?", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "In total.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, as you know, the Health Services platform, we've been building and investing in health services for well over a decade. And throughout that time period, we've brought in businesses and capabilities that add to that platform that ultimately can help us achieve what we're trying to with our customers and that is to improve the healthcare system. And so as we look to the future, we continue to believe that acquisitions or strategic acquisitions are going to be a component of that. Of late, you've seen some acquisitions like Inspiris, if you will, is one of those and that's an area that is targeted around the chronic and sick population and managing those through nurse practitioners and primary care providers dedicated to that population serving multiple different payers in the marketplace. It's things like that, that we've been bringing into the fold that ultimately will fill out the broad capabilities across our Health Services platform. And I'll remind you that, across Optum, we serve all constituents. So it's a very diverse set of capabilities. Ultimately again, with the idea that we can bring services to better the healthcare system, and we're going to continue to pursue acquisitions where it makes sense.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Just to follow up to get some more color. Does it seem right to say that you may be moving now more away from data exchange and software support to investing in higher-touch clinical services like you talked about just now, either phone-based or primary care, selectively in some local markets or broadly speaking?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I'm going to ask Andy Slavitt, the CEO of OptumInsight, to answer a portion of that. But I want to interject with, I don't think it's fair to say that. We're very much invested in use of data and analytics and in connectivity solutions. One thing that we believe does differentiate us from others in the health services marketplace is we build solutions, but we build it from insight, from operating from within inside the system. So whether it's providing care delivery services like within Southwest Medical or just providing nurse practitioner services like we've done for a decade within Evercare, all of that instruct the types of solution that we bring to the marketplace. But Andy, do you want to comment on the first part?", "Andy Slavitt", "Sure. I think, Steve revealed the elements of our strategy that are at work in both the organic growth that you're seeing as well as the M&A-related growth. He talked about helping health communities become connected, intelligent, aligned and then allowing them to factor in the human element by managing the health of the population. We think there's a demand and a need in many of the markets we serve for all of those capabilities. And so we are seeing strong performance from the acquisitions that you referred to in the last part of last year. But also, I think as Steve said, that\u2019s because of the fact that the portfolio as a whole, strengthens any individual offering in what we\u2019re able to bring to the market. So this is a strategy that, as Mike said, will have some of the M&A continue to be in the portfolio. But it will really be to enable that strategy that Steve and Mike laid out.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Dan Schumacher", "If I would just -- I think -- to your question, I think we have 2 investable platforms that you're referring to. We'll continue to be interested in technology and information. And we are increasingly seeing how that enables our ability to actually engage in the more integrated clinical care activities and more effectively. So we really have a pretty virtuous situation where we can invest in both and they strengthen each other, and the acquisitions that have been made have been strong performers. So we're very pleased with the ones that occurred last year. And we\u2019ll continue to build this business.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks. So I just want to ask about the pricing environment here and particularly in light of the entire industry adapting to the new MLR, minimum MLR rules, coupled with the buildup of surplus at some of the not-for-profit plans, as well related to that, the lower trend experience. What are you seeing broadly in terms of pricing across your different markets? And how variated is it?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Matt, this is Gail Boudreaux. We see the market as remaining competitive and rational. Plans are raising premiums based on what they see as their underlying escalation in medical costs. And that has remained consistent as we've talked about on these calls. As I've mentioned on several of the calls, we do see certain instances in a few markets where in a couple of key situations where there is some aggressive action, but it is not any kind of a trend or anything that is a wholesale pricing philosophy or change. So I think that makes it a very rational market. The other thing I just think we should all consider too is that, as plans have to invest in order to be compliant with all the regulatory changes. So they've got some significant capital expenditures coming through HIPAA 5010 as well as ICD-10. And so I think that's a factor as well. As we think about our own pricing, we remain very consistent. We price to our forward view of cost and that's really driven by our expectation of where we see utilization and unit cost trending. So that has been very consistent.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thanks. Wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts here on the Medco contract just relative to your target of growing the PBM. And then also maybe an update on the TRICARE West protest and whether you have any increasing confidence that you might be positioned to win that business after the appeal was sustained?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'll comment on Medco, and I'll have Gail comment on TRICARE. But the answer is really no different than we have offered in the last couple of exchanges. We\u2019ve been, as we've said before, well served by Medco and continue to be strong partner. Our OptumRx business continues to grow and has grown nicely from an external business point of view. Its capabilities continue to become enriched and are robust. They\u2019re very strong in specialty pharma, et cetera. And so we really have a lot of positive options in front of us. I will say that we will basically set a definitive direction over the course of this year, given the time frame of the Medco relationship. But we're really well served at the moment and have a variety of options in front of us and feel very good about how we are using those resources for our businesses and for our customers. So I wouldn't suggest that we're offering any new direction to you at this time. And TRICARE...", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure. Scott, I think as you noted, on April 6 the Department of Defense upheld our protest of their July 2009 West Region TRICARE contract that they awarded to the incumbent administrator. They have indicated to us that they will be updating their solicitation of the contract. As you know, this is distinct from our ongoing protest around the award in the South Region as well. We believe that we have a superior proposal, and we look forward to demonstrating that as part of this protest process because we think that we can bring real value to the beneficiary in this area.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG", "And the Logistics Health acquisition that you just did, is that part of trying to position even better for the TRICARE bid or is that a separate strategy in terms of just increasing your military health and sort of in wellness and services capabilities more broadly?", "Dawn Owens", "Scott, this is Dawn Owens. Logistics Health or LHI will become, upon close, a part of OptumHealth. And we really see it as a platform that allows us to take our population health solutions and apply them to a very important part of our constituency base, the military service men and women of our country. They provide very specialized services related to pre and post deployment that we think we are a natural complement to and are excited about their inclusion in the overall Optum services portfolio.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks. Another angle on utilization, which is if you've got any data that shows you historically that when utilization does come back, if it shows up first within different areas of the commercial market. So as an example, is it right to think that you see utilization come back first in large group accounts and then it's a little slower to respond in individual? And then secondarily, if you've got an updated estimate in your commercial loss ratio for this year.", "Dan Schumacher", "Hi, Carl, this is Dan. In terms of how utilization emerges, I would suggest that there isn't any particular difference across either geographic category or by customer segment, frankly. It comes back broadly, and it leaves broadly and comes back broadly. With respect to the loss ratio, we now expect our full year loss ratio on the heels of a combination of our Q1 favorable development, our lower utilization, and then obviously that's partially offset by our higher rebate estimates. We now expect that to be 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. So we're down about 170 basis points from our Investor Day guidance. I think, one thing I'd like to note is, as you look at that difference, 40 basis points of it is simply just adding in our Specialty business and then the balance is really those other factors. So starting from the first quarter and then thinking about how it progresses over the balance of the year, obviously, we don't expect any further impact of the winter storms. We don't expect further favorable development. We do expect the normal wear-off pattern of our deductible. And then we expect a return to more normal utilization over the balance of the year. Those are the things that are coming together to inform that 82% guidance.", "Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Clarifying question on the trend here. Excluding places where you saw winter storms, so presumably Arizona, California, some other places. Florida didn't have storms. Was utilization up or is it up excluding the winter storm effects? I'm just trying to clarifying whether you're seeing it or whether you're building in something you think you'll see. And did you see in-group growth or attrition in the first quarter?", "Dan Schumacher", "Christine, this is Dan. On the utilization side, we did see utilization up just more modestly than we would have expected outside of the storms. On the attrition, I'll turn to Gail.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure, Christine. One of the challenges actually of identify and segregating it, we did see attrition in the first quarter of this year. But it was down from last year. We also though, as you know, had extremely strong overall enrollment growth across all of our Benefits platform. And particularly, the almost 800,000 new consumers we're serving in the commercial market. Inside of that, we had very strong open enrollment results particularly in our self-funded national account business and that contributed. So when you try to segregate attrition, we still expect attrition to be a factor to this year particularly in our self-funded business as you look at our guidance going out for the rest of the year. However, our strong service platform, I think the products we put in market and the value that we offered our customers was clear in our open enrollment where we gained a lot of in-group members versus our competitors.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So excluding storms, were bed days up?", "Dan Schumacher", "Bed days excluding storms were flat to slightly down depending on the geography.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Thank you. I wanted to go back to the topic of capital deployment. As part of the recent WellMed acquisition you obtained some point-of-care facilities or clinics in Florida and Texas. And I also saw that you're funding some clinic development or expansion in California. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your long-term strategy as far as your point-of-care presence goes both in clinics and/or ACOs.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'll let Mike address this. But I would not describe any of these kinds of activities as particularly new. We have been in the clinical care activities, particularly around integrated models, in various ways, in markets for quite some time. And as we continue to advance our services business, it's very natural for us to pursue opportunities in markets where we see the potential, the kind of solutions that we can bring or offer value. Mike, do you want to comment about specific activities?", "Michael Murphy", "Well, I'm not sure that I have a lot else to add other than, as Steve said, we've been in the delivery business for some time. We have a broad range of services. We seek to bring capabilities and integrated solutions into the care delivery marketplace, whether we're serving them and partnering with them or, in fact, allocating capital, ultimately to the same end-state. And that is to create a more sustainable, more affordable and high-quality community. And as Andy stated earlier, we have fundamental beliefs that there are some core attributes around those sustainable communities, and that is they\u2019re connected, intelligent and aligned. And we bring all of our capabilities to bear to achieve just that. Whether we're partnering or investing in, or somewhat neutral to, we're ultimately seeking the same end-state as I said, and that is to achieve a better outcome in the communities that we serve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a confirming question here. Is the $0.15 from Penn Treaty, was that in the original guidance of $3.50 to $3.70?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave, do you want to comment?", "David Wichmann", "No, the Penn Treaty estimate of $0.12 to $0.15 was not in the original estimate. And it has been included in the revised guidance that we gave you today.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Thanks. And then just real quickly on some of the accounting for the MLR. Is it right to assume that PPD on an absolute basis -- when we see that start to decrease, I know you're not assuming it in your guidance. But assuming that any favorable development may get rebated away, is it correct to assume that over time -- sort of, you've reported $440 million this quarter that, that would become -- that should go down?", "Dan Schumacher", "Chris, this is Dan. I wouldn't read anything into development versus rebate. At the end of the day, from a reserve standpoint, we have a very comprehensive and consistent process, and that remains unchanged. So at the end of each quarter, we determine our best estimate of the ultimate claims in [indiscernible] and we do not have any expectation of development forward. In terms of why we've seen some of it particularly in the second half of last year and into the first quarter this year, obviously, we had more moderate utilization, and that showed up in the second half of last year and carried into the first. And we also saw an improvement in the time of claims submission. And that acceleration also contributed to our development.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Coffina with MorningStar.", "Matthew Coffina", "I just wanted to follow up on the Medco question. So could you tell me anything about where your capacity utilization is currently in the PBM? And sort of what incremental cost would be involved if you did decide to bring that business in-house?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We've said this before, and I'll have Bill Munsell confirm if I'm wrong. We have substantial capacity, and we have made investments over the last 2 years that continue to strengthen our OptumRx platform. I think we have virtually the full range of motion in that, that exists today. And we have meaningful capacity. Is that -- Bill?", "William Munsell", "Steve, I don't know what else I could add to that other than, and we've actually said this on the call too, we continue to invest in the capabilities of OptumRx so that we have the flexibility depending on what we ultimately decide we want to do.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. Some of that is in the building conversation that we've been having around Optum in total. So that is unchanged though. That is not new. We have been in that mode for about 2 years now.", "Matthew Coffina", "But I can interpret that as meaning that you wouldn't incur any incremental cost bringing that business in-house?", "Dan Schumacher", "No, we have been building the platform. So we have been incurring those costs.", "Matthew Coffina", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking my question. Just on the issue of inpatient pricing. It sounds like utilization there remains dampened and the price trend\u2019s still an issue. What are the strategies of the company looking out over the next 12 to 24 months to deal with that issue? And maybe just if you could give us color on what you hear from employers in terms of their willingness to consider more narrow network-based products. Just any color you have around that will be great.", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail. I think first we\u2019d put overall hospital environment into context. Hospitals are clearly feeling the pressure and the burden of low cost reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid and that has put pressure certainly on their commercial reimbursement. We look at -- as we said a few moments ago, we look at overall medical trends. It's the unit cost side, and it's the in-patient aspect that has the most pressure. Our strategies are really a couple. We are really focusing our future reimbursements on paying for performance, trying to get away from just unit costs increases. But moving to more pay-for-value as a way to mitigate that. And we have been doing that now for the last several years, and it's an ongoing strategy. In terms of employers, as we look at our growth over 2010 and into 2011, we are seeing very strong response from them around programs that do have some narrow network components. We're looking for any way to have affordability. So I think it's a bit of a mix depending on the size of the client but there is interest in value-based performance network and that's part of our contracting strategy with hospitals and physicians, as well as how we're working with employers.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up. When we think about G&A over the balance of the year, there's some cross currents with the Optum investments in the ASO growth, but then you've got -- as well as the branding. But then in the quarter, it came in a little light of expectations. How should we think about kind of the seasonality over the balance of the year as compared with last year? Should it look similar or are there reasons why it would deviate?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Doug, just answering that question across UnitedHealth Group. Our operating costs tend to trend higher throughout the year, generally higher in Q4. As you know, that's the AAP period for Medicare.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And then we're doing all of our preparations for our seasonality in the early \u2013 during the winter period and whatnot. So generally we're hiring Q4, and Q2 and 3 generally average out to be closer to full year average. Although, I will remind you that in this instance, we expect the Penn Treaty assessment to land in Q2. It may slip to Q3 depending upon when the court rules. But again, that's a $250 million assessment. About 100 basis points of operating cost during that time period.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Can you go through a little bit more about your date and claims payable and the drop there. Historically, you suggested that you pay claims when they're due. Is this a change in your payment policy? Or is there something else that's causing the dates of claims payable to drop? And then what do you expect to happen going forward?", "David Wichmann", "It's a good question, Peter. It's Dave Wichmann, again. It doesn't have anything to do with the pace upon which we\u2019re paying claims. It has more to do with the pace on which claims are being submitted by physicians. And this is in part due to the strategies we have across our business to enhance EDI submission because that has a tendency to reduce manual handling and, therefore, errors as part of that. So we're receiving claims about 2 days faster now than we did this time last year. The other day that was lost is about -- it relates to the way in which the Health Net transaction was recorded. So it elevated the days in 2010 as a result. But no changes in terms of the payment practices only in terms of submission rates from physicians and the hospitals.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment on how the Medicaid RFPs are shaping up relative to expectations. Which geographies we should anticipate United being focused in on, and then what your longer-term margin expectation is for that business.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Let me just provide a couple of overall comments because I think you hit it. There's a lot of opportunity right now in the pipeline for Medicaid. We think we are extremely well positioned given the breadth and scope of our business and are excited about the opportunity to respond to that. So I'll ask Jack Larsen, our CEO of Community and State, to give you some more specifics on what we're seeing in the market and your other questions.", "Jack Larsen", "Thanks, Gail. Michael, I was hoping this question did come up. We've been talking about the numbers of RFPs and the size of the pipeline now for several quarters, and you're right, there is a lot of activity right now. I guess the way I would think about it is that what we have seen in the RFPs is pretty much what we had expected over our discussions in the last several months and quarters with our state partners. I think they're shaping up quite well. I think you can count on us to take a good hard look at all of the RFPs that are there, and we're going to be very aggressive where we think we're well positioned to serve both eligible beneficiaries, as well as our states. Short of that, I'm really not in a position to comment on particular strategies or particular states that we're going to participate in.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "How about in terms of outlook for margins longer-term. Obviously, a number of favorable dynamics happening today.", "Jack Larsen", "Yes, I think the outlook for margins longer term, clearly the state fiscal situation is going to be a very difficult thing for them to contend with over the next year to two. So the rate environment will tend to be a little bit turbulent. I would say I would expect margins going forward to probably have some compression at the care ratio level. But I think we're well positioned to do a very good job for our states with respect to managing our administrative cost and also get to work on some of the elements of acute cost through our various medical care management programs.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks for the update.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it reflects the strong leverage in that business. So thank you for your questions and for spending time with us this morning. Maybe just a couple of wrap-up thoughts. We started 2011 with good momentum. But we remain very aware of the challenges that may arise during the balance of the year. I think this performance momentum reflects our continued focus on fundamental execution, commitment to high levels of service, practical innovations that are meaningful to our customers and an emphasis on building relationships. We believe this approach will serve us well, and we think we have 2 great platforms, well defined to pursue opportunities in the marketplace with Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We're grateful to serve the many people that we do, and we are sensitive to responsibilities that it represents. And we thank you for your attention this morning. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. This call and its contents are the property of UnitedHealth Group. Any use, copying or distribution without written permission from UnitedHealth Group is strictly prohibited. ", "Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 19, 2011, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Unitedhealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review second quarter results. Across this company, we continue to focus on fundamental execution. For us, this means consistently serving customers and other stakeholders with excellent and with practical solutions-focused innovation. Improving fundamental execution is far from glamorous, it's blocking and tackling that take years to accomplish in incremental steps and its never really fully finished. ", "Today, market and customer satisfaction and other reputational measures for both our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses are at strong levels. In many instances, market-leading, based on credible independent sources. While we are grateful for any and all market-based recognitions, we also know we are not yet where we want or need to be. ", "Society is looking for innovative organizations that could be trusted to provide consistent, reliable and modern approaches to solving the challenges of healthcare, whether that means constructive approach to participating in health benefit or information exchanges, developing ACOs or providing innovative consumer-centric benefit offering. In any context, we understand a positive reputation will become increasingly valuable, our commitments to practical innovation, deeper relationships with the people we serve and strong follow-through on our brand and reputational promises are strengthening our businesses. The work required to accomplish this brought growth and market share gains to the first half of 2011. ", "Second quarter revenues again exceeded $25 billion, increasing $2 billion or 8.5% year-over-year. Growth was led by service revenues, which increased 17% from last year's second quarter, driven by growth in Health Services products and strong and consistent gains in fee offering in the health benefit businesses. ", "Operating margins of 8.3% were stable year-over-year, improving 10 basis points despite the impact of health reform, including significant cost for readiness and compliance and the advent of minimum care ratio thresholds. ", "Overall, revenue growth in higher margin service offerings was offset by investments within the Optum services businesses, as we continue to re-baseline that platform for higher growth and earnings contributions going forward. ", "In total, second quarter net earnings grew 17% year-over-year to $1.16 per share. These earnings were supported by strong cash flows from operations of $1.2 billion. ", "UnitedHealthcare's 3 businesses added more than 180,000 people, using its medical benefit products in the second quarter. It grew in every major product category, despite the fact that the benefits marketplace typically has fewer new business opportunities in the second quarter. ", "In the first half of 2011, the number of people UnitedHealthcare serves with medical benefits grew by 1.2 million, on top of nearly 1 million people added over the course of 2010. This 6-quarter addition of 2.2 million more people, almost entirely through organic means, places this among the strongest growth periods for our company. ", "Growth was led by the employer and individual business, which grew by 100,000 people in the quarter and contributed nicely to the nearly 900,000 person increase in the past 6 months, a growth of 1.1 million people year-over-year. Customer retention rates improved in 2011, in both the fully-insured and self-funded offering. We performed well in national account open enrollments this past January, when employees who have multiple health plans available to them, chose UnitedHealthcare more often this year. ", "Based on first half 2011 results, we're increasing our full year outlook for fee-based commercial growth by 100,000 people to a range of 650,000 to 750,000 people for the year. Both UnitedHealthcare Community & State and the UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement have had strong growth as well. These businesses increased by 80,000 people this quarter, and 315,000 people in the past 6 months, plus another 250,000 people in stand-alone Part D plan in the past 6 months. ", "We grew by 20,000 people in Medicare Advantage products this quarter, and have added 115,000 people through the first half of the year. Even after absorbing the first quarter decrease of 225,000 people from market and product exits and programs that were not sufficiently funded or were fully discontinued by federal regulation. ", "Our Medicaid business grew by 40,000 people in the quarter, and is tracking for the sizable year-over-year increase of 225,000 people in 2011, despite state's heightening eligibility criteria in the wake of decreases in federal matching dollars for their programs. ", "Overall medical cost trends through the first half of 2011 remain moderated, in part due to lower growth in consumption across the system, and in part because our effective, targeted efforts demands the total cost to health benefits. Though it is important to note that unit cost increases continue to be significant, in fact, the single most important cost driver, we expect a return toward somewhat more normal utilization trends in the second half of this year and into 2012. ", "Our second half 2011 outlook factors in more challenging year-over-year comparisons in both utilization and reserve development. Our consolidated care ratio of 81.4% decreased 10 basis points from last year's second quarter, as the commercial medical care ratio decreased 120 basis points year-over-year.", "Second quarter 2011 reflects $180 million in overall reserve development, down from $270 million in the second quarter of 2010. ", "In summary, diversified growth performance across our health benefits platform, coupled with effective cost management, helped UnitedHealthcare grow earnings from operations by nearly $200 million year-over-year to $1,760,000,000. This came despite a lower level of reserve development than in 2010 second quarter, and the implementation of medical care ratio regulation this year. ", "We expect pressure on UnitedHealthcare's gross margin percentage in the second half of 2010 and into 2012 due to increasing rate pressure from government customers and more normal overall utilization trends. UnitedHealthcare Community & State is now receiving annual rate adjustments from the majority of its members. Those rate increases are proving to be lower than we had expected and in some situations, even negative. ", "While states will typically adjust care provider fee schedules to reduce unit costs as well, the low reimbursement rates still impact the medical care ratio. UnitedHealthcare has some long-standing leverage to use in mitigating these overall pressures. These include stronger clinical engagements and medical cost management efforts, disciplined operating expense management, process and technological modernization and related productivity and scale efficiency. ", "In our Optum businesses, we continued to develop and strengthen our position in areas of rising importance to the health system, largely themed around comprehensive population health management, as well as modernizing and better integrating healthcare delivery and financing. ", "And as I'm sure you noted earlier this month, Larry Renfro, now leads Optum as Chief Executive Officer. Larry's experiences in healthcare, technology services and financial services across all ranges of business development and scale, will be invaluable as we advance our Optum services platform. Our strategy and direction in Optum remains consistent, and Larry has hit the ground running. ", "In the second quarter, Optum's total revenues of $7 billion increased 19% year-over-year, bringing first half 2011 revenues to $13.8 billion, up 20%. Second quarter revenues increased 12% at OptumRx, 24% at OptumInsight and 46% at OptumHealth. OptumRx increased revenues by growing the number of customers served by 1.8 million people year-over-year, including more than 850,000 from new external business. OptumRx revenue growth also reflects a greater mix in specialty drugs, which carry much higher revenue per script. OptumInsight, had a strong sales quarter, with momentum in serving both payer and provider markets. ", "Many of the growth drivers emerge from the market changes created by health legislation. They include customer needs in the areas of advanced computer-assisted coding, ACO development, quality SAR rating and compliance-related services. OptumInsight's sales bookings growth of 106%, and backlog increased to 60% year-over-year in the second quarter, further improved revenue visibility and confidence. ", "OptumHealth second quarter revenue performance was driven by strong and diverse growth. This includes growth in services for payers and expansion of Clinical Care Services. Optum's earnings from operations were just slightly stronger than we expected, increasing $4 million year-over-year in the quarter. These results continue to reflect 2011 efforts to align and re-baseline these businesses, and position them for further earnings growth. OptumInsight, provided strong earnings again this quarter, with year-over-year growth in operating earnings of 45%. OptumInsight expanded its operating margin by nearly 2 percentage points, through improvements in mix of product lines and customers. ", "OptumRx earnings decreased by $16 million year-over-year and OptumHealth's earnings decreased $7 million. However, OptumHealth's performance was better than expected due to a combination of results from a performance-based contracts and the earnings contribution from stronger-than-expected top line performance. OptumHealth earnings are expected to step down from here to a lower level for the second half of the year, consistent with the re-baselining and reinvestment themes set forth in our previous 2011 full year outlook for the business. ", "In total, the Optum results show increasing business momentum that is indicative of the traction our capabilities are gaining in the market across care providers, payers, including the government, employers and other participants in the healthcare system. ", "As we look to 2012 and beyond, our businesses broadly addressed the expanding needs of the health system, from healthcare coverage to services that improve the overall health of population, to services that modernize and integrate across the system. As a single company with 2 independently-managed business platforms we draw on core competencies in data, technology and clinical expertise. We are uniquely positioned to help resolve vital issues such as care quality, affordability, access, the effective application of health data and information, connectivity, better consumer and care provider decision making at the point-of-care, incentives for a better performing health system and healthier lifestyles, in compliance with evidence-based medical treatment. We take a total systems view of the health economy and pursue solutions through all logical channels, with the goal of improving the way the system performs for people, and how effectively people use that system. ", "UnitedHealthcare serves benefit customers and Optum serves the broader health marketplace, including care providers and payers. UnitedHealthcare provides tremendous scale, size and market diversity that cannot be found elsewhere. And in turn, allows Optum to quickly pilot, perfect, scale up and more rapidly commercialize new offerings across a broad client base and population. ", "For example, in post-acute care delivery, OptumHealth arranges for nurses and nurse practitioners to support Primary Care physician in serving the needs of chronically-ill patients with complex medical conditions. OptumHealth's post-acute care services are deployed nationally but more important, by more than 20 health plan customers including UnitedHealthcare. ", "In Maricopa County, there is a competitive set of hospital systems and primary care resources, as well as specialized physician practices. UnitedHealthcare has significant Medicare Advantage business in this market and asked OptumHealth to develop a delegated care model that will improve quality and cost for its Medicare members. OptumHealth responded with the Lifeprint Clinic, the Lifeprint contracted care network, which includes over 500 primary care physicians in more than 200 physician practices. ", "UnitedHealthcare's membership and community presence, coupled with Optum's data, technology and care delivery experience, were all critical to the launch of this model this past January. But more significant, Lifeprint overall market goal is to serve the broad Maricopa County population, to populations with other health plans in that market. ", "Across the state, the Tucson Medical Center was looking to reconsider its infrastructure and processes, so it can deliver more effective services to its community. They selected Optum to help them build a market-based accountable care structure, our resources will serve the Tucson Medical Center, benefit UnitedHealthcare customers through UnitedHealthcare's participation in that market, and become available to other health clients in that market. This arrangement will help make healthcare more sustainable across the Tucson Community. ", "Each of these examples draws on our experience in coordinating clinical resources and services, our leading technology and access to actionable data and information. Together, they illustrate our comprehensive health system strategy, with our capabilities leveraged for the benefit of all the constituencies in the health system: Patients, physicians, hospitals, employers and other payers, including government payers. ", "While we expect UnitedHealthcare to perform as the leader in the payer community, the multi-payer nature of the system means that our health systems solutions from Optum, are much broader than the need of UnitedHealthcare alone. ", "Looking into the future, we believe the healthcare market will evolve from fee-for-service to fee-for-value or pay-for-performance in a multitude of way, shapes and forms. To do that, modern benefits designs and related services will become more connected and integrated. They will ultimately flow more closely together from the consumers, providers, payers and systems perspective. Our 2 platforms are ideally positioned to help lead the way. ", "Now returning to financial and operating performance. Today, we are increasing our outlook for full-year 2011 financial results based on continued momentum and solid performance in the first half of the year. We expect revenue growth of more than 7% year-over-year, which brings revenues to $101 billion in 2011. With the higher revenue outlook, solid margins in the first half of the year and a projected 2 percentage point reduction in tax rate from the second half of 2011, we estimate full year earnings in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 per share. We project cash flows from operations of more than $6 billion. ", "This view reflects our caution about gross margin in the second half of 2011, but also includes our estimate of our pro rata share of the policyholder claims, of the potentially insolvent Penn Treaty, a long-term care insurance concern, with which we have no affiliation. While we forecast these expenses in the fourth quarter, we of course, have no ability to control the court's timing or process. ", "In conclusion, we're delivering solid fundamental execution for our customers, both within each of our business platforms and on a cross-platform basis. We are gaining market share. We continue to invest in practical innovation and distinctive branding. From our shareholders perspective, the results of these efforts is strong and sustainable revenue growth, solid margins and consistent cash flows. At the same time, we're fulfilling our broader mission to both help people live healthier lives, and make the healthcare system work better for everyone. ", "We'll offer more discussion and examples at our Annual Investor Conference, which will be held in New York City, on Tuesday, November 29. We also expect to provide color on our expectations for 2012 at that time. We're interested in your questions this morning. As usual, there will be one question per person, so we can speak with as many of you as possible. ", "I will now turn this call back to our moderator for your questions. And again, thank you for joining us this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "I guess, I just want to talk a little bit, I know you're going to sort of start to stay away, it sounds like you're going to stay away from 2012 guidance. But maybe you could tell us, sort of a 2 quarter -- are there any changes to your long-term expectations? Anything that we should think about in terms of big deviations from your long-term guidance? And then more specifically, I guess, we're getting into the National Accounts selling season and maybe if you can give us a little color as to expectations for 1/1/2012, and maybe relative to how well you did this year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I'll kind of thematically respond to your first question, Josh, and then I'll ask Gail to kind of comment on the National Accounts outlook. I would say there really isn't anything that I would offer as being a radical departure from our approach to our business or our markets. I actually think that the steps we've taken over the course of the last, let's say, more than a year of coming into the focus on fundamental execution, the commitment to innovation, a stronger and more expansive view of our culture, are all elements that are going to continue to mature and grow within our enterprise. We remain very focused and disciplined with respect to our businesses and like the balance we're striking relative to the orientations of local market engagements. And we're positive about 2012 in terms of our outlook. We expect to grow in terms of the number of people we serve, and we expect to grow in terms of the performance, improvements of our performance, serving customers. So I believe there are a lot of approaches that we've taken for 2010 and '11, will apply again in 2012. We'll consider to be a continuing challenging environment from an economic point of view, from a rate pressure point of view in terms of Medicare and Medicaid rates, regulatory pressures that I think you all can appreciate the challenges in the marketplace, and we continue to, I think, approach those challenges and have been successful to date, and expect to continue to be. Gail, you want to comment on national business?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure. This is Gail Boudreaux. As you know, we've had a certain very strong selling season in National Accounts this year, and we are pleased with what's happening as we expect 2012 to also grow. It's still early. We're still in the middle of the process. Got a very strong value proposition as we think about our service results, we're going into this year with really good service results. I think offering clients a very good clinical proposition, as well as our consumer engagement strategies are taking hold. As we look at our current results when we think about 2012, one of the positive signs is that, customer retention has been strong this year, and we expect that to continue, and we expect to continue to expand our footprint in the accounts that we do have. As we look at new business opportunities as has been the case in the past, many of those are staying with their incumbents, although again, a very good time for us, is that we're expanding our footprint. So again, early but a sign of what -- we'll see growth in 2012.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "And just a follow-up, Steve, just so I make sure I understood. You guys have talked about a low-teens earnings per share growth rate long term. There was nothing in your commentary that made me think that 2012 was different than the long term. Am I reading too much into that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, I think you read it correct, Josh.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just want to go to more color in what you're seeing in med utilization. I mean, I think your commentary was it's much the same. But I guess what I was looking for, is looking across your different lines, the major lines, commercial Medicare Advantage, Medicaid. Are you seeing any divergence in the utilization patterns from what you've been seeing over the last 6 months, or are those all running similarly?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think, Dan Schumacher can respond pretty well on this.", "Dan Schumacher", "Let me talk about commercial first, and then I'll compare and contrast that to the government businesses. But I think it's important to remind everyone, as Steve made in his prepared remarks, that as we look at our overall cost trend, the unit cost component is by far the greatest driver of our cost increases year in and year out. And we continue to see significant pressure there, and it's an area of intense focus for us. So in terms of the overall cost trend, it's really the unit cost. Stepping into the utilization specifically, in the first half of the year, we did see in the commercial business, an increase in our utilization trend, and that was higher than what we saw in 2010, but still lower than what we have seen historically. And as we look at the second half of the year, our expectations that we're going to see an increase again in that utilization trend, in part due to the lower comparison period in 2010. So as you look at 2010, the most restrained and moderate utilization came in the second half. But then on top of that, we expect consumption levels to increase on a more normal seasonal pattern, as well as the wear-off of our deductible. So as you look at the commercial space, overall, we still expect our trend to be in the 6.5%, plus or minus 50 range that we guided to last quarter, although we would expect to be trending towards the lower-end of that range. As you compare that to the government businesses, similarly in those businesses in the first half of the year, we did see an increase in the utilization trend over 2010. And it was actually a little bit higher than what we saw in the commercial business. But again, as you look across UnitedHealthcare, it was lower than historical patterns.", "John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And just your utilization overall, you've comment before, you're -- at least on the bed day component, you're still running flat to slightly down on that, is that correct?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes, that's fair. If you think about the components around utilization, I would suggest that the places where we've seen more increases, really, in the outpatient and physician settings, and our in-patient has remained relatively restrained.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG", "I'm wondering if you can provide an initial assessment on the exchange regulations that were recently released by CMS, and now after having a chance to review those regs, how you're viewing the overall market opportunity for the exchanges?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. Maybe I'll start out, just by setting some guidelines. Given the fact that they've just come out and there is a comment period, we're not going to comment at very specific levels with respect to the -- those regs. We will kind of offer kind of a restatement of the things that we're looking for, that I think would be important as those -- that original guidance is ultimately formed into regulations. And, Gail, you want to take that up?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure, Scott. As Steve said, we've been very engaged, constructively engaged in both the state and the federal level in providing input around the exchanges, and we are planning to provide comment as part of this process, as part of the proposal we're making. I think you know, that there are also more regulation still to come out, so we're sort of in the middle of that process. What's important though, in terms of the guidelines as we think about the development of the exchanges, is one that they should -- we think they should be set up in a manner that recognizes healthcare is local, and provides states with some significant flexibility in how to structure them based on the market dynamics. We also think that it's important that they provide opportunity in the market, so that there's competition, choice and innovation that's incented as part of the design. And finally, I think having a level playing field, that's a critical part of the exchange. We said this a few times, that we see opportunity in the exchanges, but the level playing field component's important as the states begin to adapt their rules around exchanges.", "Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG", "And are the risk adjustment proposals that they've laid out, do you think those will be sufficient? And do you think a reasonable way to think about this is that they're essentially leveraging some of the structures that they've used in Part D in Medicare Advantage? Or do you see differences in the approach around risk adjustment, and with some of the risk corridors they're proposing?", "Gail Boudreaux", "In terms of the risk adjustment, clearly, they're looking at how they structure that in the Medicare space. We -- there's a lot of opportunities to look at that across the commercial space as well, and we would want to ensure that they're fair and actually sound practices, so also providing guidance on that. Again, we're in the process of comments, and we'll be providing comments in that as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank", "My question is on the OptumHealth business. And obviously, you've talked about making a fair amount of investments here that have depressed margins a bit. But at last year's Investor Day, you've laid out a case for margin improvement over time, and getting back to target margins would be significantly accretive to earnings. I'm just curious if you can give us an update there, in terms of we're now 6 to 9 months past that, you've made these investments. Just in terms of how you see that performance kind of trending over the next couple of years and when do you expect to get to those target margins you kind of laid out at the Investor Day?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Again, I'll kind of, layout kind of overall themes, and then ask the team to pick it up. But if you stand back and look at Optum, we are committed to advancing that as a more integrated platform at the beginning of this year. We've taken steps such as the divestiture of the CRO. We have realigned portions of our business between UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and made adjustments accordingly for that. And we've said that we would be making investments, not only in new businesses that we think have value, but also in strengthening the performance of the businesses that we have. And I think those things have gone exceptionally well. The emergence of this platform, I think is very positive, and we are very positive about the margin performance. We said this was going to be a baseline year, and we're going to execute to that. We think we'll be -- through the majority of it this year, there'll be some activity that will, particularly with respect to OptumRx that will pull into next year. But, John, do you want to pick that up?", "John Penshorn", "Sure. It's John Penshorn. I just want to respond, add on to what Steve has said. I think we've seen very good market response to our business platforms, we've seen very good growth. As Steve mentioned, we continue investing in our platform, that investment is affecting our short-term operating margin. As we've said in the Investor Day, 2011 is a baseline year. We expect strong operating earnings in 2012, with operating margin expansion. And we're very comfortable with our long-term operating outlook that we set for our 2 businesses.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank", "And what's the definition of longer-term? And also, if you could just throw us any commentary you might have on the PBM and the make-whole relationships specifically? I know people would be interested in?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay. Well, that's a slightly different subject, but I'll respond. We expect, obviously, see comp improvements in 2012, and we expect to build from there. So we meant 2011 to be a baseline year, and I think you'll see 2012 will prove that out. In terms of the PBM, our positioning there has really not changed. OptumRx continues to serve us very well. All of our government programs, our specialty pharma and increasingly external commercial customers, and Medco also continues to serve us well. And as we've said consistently, we are assessing our options and our opportunities, knowing that we can serve our customers, as well as our shareholders well, really in either direction. And we are really addressing the nature of that Medco relationship. That really won't occur until later this year. And the contract doesn't expire until January of 2013. So really, our position with respect to our PBM is unchanged.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to ask you about rebates. You've commented a couple of times about gross margin compression in the second half on higher trend and government rate pressure. But I guess I didn't hear anything about rebates, how those impact numbers, seasonality, how should we think about that? And then also, any color on how rebates are impacting your thoughts about pricing, or how about your competitors are thinking about repricing their books, any indication there?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, go on.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Kevin, let me take the seasonality fees, and how we think about rebates. At the end of the day, our rebates are based on a full year earnings outlook, and then it's staged in by quarter, based on the percentage of revenue that falls into each quarter. So it's essentially, pretty close to linear. So there's no seasonal impact on our results related to our rebate determination. In terms of pricing, I might turn that to Jeff Alter to talk about what we're seeing in the market.", "Jeff Alter", "Thanks, Kevin. This is Jeff Alter. We're not seeing a lot of widespread evidence of people making pricing adjustments due to their rebate. There are pockets here and there of fully insured pricing that, I'll say, are a little more competitive than other years, which could be competitors adjusting to their loss ratio. And if it is, we believe it will be pretty short-lived in duration. As we've said before, there's a lot of investments ahead, ICD-10 and other regulatory compliance. So we believe that our competitors are taking a rational approach to their reserves and to their pricing. And we continue to remain disciplined in our pricing, pricing to our trend.", "Kevin Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, just to clarify, when you talk about the gross margin compression, it sounds like on the commercial side, it's more normal return to utilization than real pricing pressure. But on the government side, there's some -- there's equal trend and pricing pressures, is that the way to think about it?", "Jeff Alter", "Yes, that's fair.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just a bit more clarification on the 2012 pricing comments. I guess, how should we think about 2012 premium pricing, given the prolonged lower utilization that we've been seeing here over the last several quarters? In particular, do you expect more, I guess what I would call, coordinated pushbacks from states on commercial premium increases into next year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Gail?", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux. I think to get sort of round-off conversation we're having on our pricing. Our approach, our fundamental approach and discipline in pricing hasn't changed, and so we are always pricing to what we believe our forward view of costs are. So just taking a sort of walk through the components, we start with what we believe is the forward dealer trend is, adjust for products change in geography, as well as market segment. And then we essentially, take a look at using our local market knowledge, the medical loss ratio of threshold, where we believe that prices should be. In terms of your second part of your question around the state, what we're seeing at the states, really vary by state to state. And I think what's fundamentally important is we build up our rates based on a actuarially sound process, and that's how we file our rates. And when we go to the states to talk about those rates, making sure that it's based on that process, as well as the forward view of cost, is what's important. And that's the discussion that we've been having with the states as part of this process now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "A couple of questions. You're recognizing that this is a year of investment spending and your long-term target has been 20 to 40 basis point of SG&A improvement. Is it reasonable to think that we start to see that next year? And then is it possible to put parameters around kind of what you're thinking on the commercial MLR? I think you were saying 82, plus or minus 50 basis points last quarter, is that still reasonable?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, maybe I'll have Dave respond to the cost question, and Dan to the care ratio.", "David Wichmann", "It's Dave. What you're seeing in our numbers, Christine, is a significant, a pretty significant shift in the mix of our business towards the services business, as well as self-funded. And that mix shift is what's contributing to the increase in the operating cost ratio in the period. And in fact, if you look at the benefits business independently, you'd find that there's a 50-basis point reduction in the operating cost ratio for that business. And that has largely contributed to by virtue of the things that we've been discussing in the past, which is the significant improvements that we've made and the quality of our service, which I believe is reflected both internally with much lower defect rates on our claims, much higher satisfaction levels on our calls. But also now and I think validated through several sources over the course of the last 30 days or so, externally. So all of that, I think is contributing to that. We've also seen significant increases in our levels of automation. We've been very focused on advancing EDI and auto-adjudication as examples, although more broadly working to try to automate all of our business processes more effectively. Also, as I believe you recognize, we've done a lot work on our integration activities and we decommissioned several of our adjudication engines. And I believe we've lined this out before but Mamzies, [ph] 2 of PacifiCare's, several instances of Fassett, [ph] and many other adjudication engines. So we've made great progress with respect to that. And then we've also, really advanced our efforts around sourcing and procurement broadly, and have been realizing the benefits of our substantial scale over time. And I believe those are all manifested in the realizations of a very significant run rate benefits. We believe they're under the $300 million to $400 million range recognized in 2011. And then what you're seeing though is the offset of the kind of the dilutive effect, if you will, of the mix shift towards a fee-based business and the higher a percentage of our business that's with Optum.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Right. And then just specifically, to Optum, it feels like this is a big investment year, and we've also got some good growth, it's hard to see x acquisitions, kind of what's going on, and exactly how much you're investing there. Is it safe to say that it's kind of peak investment year? I mean, you said, re-basing with respect to some of those investment spendings. So we can expect improvement on to that SG&A load into next year?", "David Wichmann", "Christine, I think that's right. With the exception of the OptumRx business, that business is going to continue to take some investment into next year as we really get, bring the scale and the attributes to it that we're really looking forward, so that they can actually be a more integrated and kind of more robust platform serving that marketplace. So while there'll be some in that, I think the majority of our investments in the Optum business, the rest of them will be -- will pretty much run their course in 2011.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Great. And on the commercial MLR?", "David Wichmann", "Commercial MLR, our expectation is similar to what we're seeing on a trend side. We would expect our loss ratio to be in that 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points but trending towards the lower end of that range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Just following back up on some of your comments in the Medicaid business, clearly there was a more cautious tone there. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for, without utilization sort of staying below the trend that you're expecting, would we -- are you guys anticipating sort of margin compression on an operating basis over the second half of the year? Or you think you can still squeeze out some increases even in a more difficult rate environment?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jack, you want to react to that?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure. Chris, Jack Larsen. I guess, just maybe to put a finer point on what we have seen in our second and third quarter rate negotiations, and then how it will affect our second half performance. I think the pressure we have all been talking about now for multiple quarters, we really saw in most of our rate discussions, about 2/3 of our member months have some type of a rate negotiation associated with it, sort of late Q2 and into Q3. And as Steve said in his opening remarks, we expect about a 1% average annual 2011 rate increase, which is slightly lower than what we had been guiding to last quarter. But I think the important point is, the more recent negotiations have been for second half of calendar and first half of calendar 2012, have really been flat to negative. So we are going to see margin compression at the gross margin line, probably even in spite of the lower utilization environment that we're seeing ourselves in. To your question about whether we can, I think you said, eke something out, I think we've done a pretty good job in the meantime, making sure we are crisp on our clinical management protocols, as well as our operating costs. So -- and actually, in spite of the rate environment, I'm quite pleased with our operating performance for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "First question, just since most state fiscal years end in June, I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of expected rate increases in your Medicaid book, and what you're building in for second half rates?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I thought we had addressed that in the comments. But, Jack, you want to just pick that again?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure. For second half rates, for state fiscal years 2011, '12, what we're seeing is, we're about 2/3 of our member months, flat to -- mostly flat and in some cases, slightly negative.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I got it. I apologize, if I missed that in your prepared remarks. And then the other thing, maybe you said this too, and I missed it exactly in response to John Rex's question. But basically, it was, if you look excluding the flu at adjusted bed day -- in-patient bed days per thousand, were they up, down or flat, for commercial Medicare, Medicaid?", "Jack Larsen", "Flat to slightly down.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "In all 3?", "Jack Larsen", "Yes.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, great. And you're assuming they're going to come back up towards the back half of the year, in your guidance, if I understood your prepared remarks?", "Jack Larsen", "We're expecting overall utilization to go up, most notably in the outpatient and physician categories and to a lesser extent in in-patient.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Which is where it's been consistently. We do expect it to recover. And to recover in the area that has been the strongest to date, which has been outpatient and physician.", "Jack Larsen", "Right. In-patient as we've mentioned over time, we're seeing the results of our clinical agenda continue to take hold there, in those areas, where we're able to observe outside of economic impacts or broader macro impacts, where we're making a difference. The admission rates as an example, and there are other examples underneath that, that are a key area of focus for us inside our business.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I know that everyone focuses on the utilization, but the unit cost pressures are really the elements that are driving cost.", "Charles Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Yes, and you've had some successes there, in terms of unit costs. I guess, in that regard, do you see a rebound in terms of cost shift, as providers are concerned about Medicare, Medicaid cuts to them? Or have you been able to preserve some leverage against higher unit cost increases than what you've been seeing?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I wouldn't say that there's necessarily any profound change in the environment from that perspective. Gail, do you have a view on that?", "Gail Boudreaux", "The only thing I'd add to it, I don't think the cost shift for Medicare and Medicaid is anything new. And clearly, the hospitals are under significant pressure. We have, I think obviously, been negotiating to find the best economic value, but the unit cost pressure is intense. The area that we've been very much focused on in collaboration with Optum partners is trying to move more to pay-for-performance and alignment of incentives, across both the hospital agenda, as well as with physicians and in our clinical agenda as well. So I think that is really where we think we have to go to. As Steve said in his opening remarks, we have to get away from straight pay-for-fee and unit cost increases to actual pay-for-value, and to more risk-sharing environment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "One more on the utilization front, you didn't mention pharmacy, and I'm just curious, did you see any uplift in pharmacy trend in the second quarter?", "Dan Schumacher", "Matt, it's Dan. We did see a very modest increase on the pharmacy side. Again, I would go back to pointing out, as a category, the outpatient and physician settings. Overall, for pharmacy, we're still expecting a trend in that mid- to lower-single digit.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. And on a separate topic, can you comment on the Medicaid RFP environment? In terms of the recently concluded Kentucky Medicaid contract awards and also, those that are still outstanding, do the request for proposal, the way they're set up and the competition seemed to set reasonable parameters on the business opportunity for you guys?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Matt, Jack Larsen. So let me make a general comment on the RFP environment. I think there's, certainly, there's lots of opportunities in the space, the numbers that we have seen $140 million to $60 billion on the growth side. To your question about whether they provide a, I guess, a competitive opportunity for us, the answer is that, I think, yes. With respect to Kentucky specifically, that was a state that was relatively new to manage Medicaid across all its regions. The components of the proposal allowed respondents to provide both an operating cost proposal, as well as a medical cost proposal. I think from our point of view, we've submitted a very strong proposal to the commonwealth. We essentially bid their ask and quality and access parameters. And we think we put a pricing that was competitive and really, consistent with providing them a sustainable program going into the future. I think they were looking for a 3-year commitment. So I guess while we're disappointed in not being awarded a contract in Kentucky, I think it was a successful a procurement for them. There are other RFPs that are lining up there, like you were awaiting announcements on both Texas and Louisiana, and we expect those here in the next few weeks. And they represent significant opportunities for us in both of those states.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think to your broader question, it's not a homogenous market. It's a state-by-state market. So every state will take kind of its own view with this, and conduct its own process. So it's really hard to really establish any generalizations with respect to that. It really will be a state-by-state proposition, very driven by the situational circumstances of the state at that time. We're very dedicated to the space. We have been in this space for many, many years. It is clear the states are looking for Managed Care solutions, as really their best and most sustainable long-term outlet. And wherever the states really have established a posture of kind of working with organizations like us to really achieve those long-term goals, we're going to be active. But it really is a state-by-state proposition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "The first question is about the debt ceiling and the deficit reduction. One of the proposals was to introduce a deductible into Medicare supplements? And given you're leading both in Med Advantage and Med Supp, do you have any market research data that seniors might move preferentially to MA? And how does that net out across your book of business?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We had thought there might be questions about the deficit coming into this. And what we concluded is that we're going to stay out of that area of conversation. They have enough parties participating in that without any commentary from us. So we're really -- we're not going to comment on elements that are coming out of that, because they're just, at this point in time, a series of proposals. And I think it would be kind of out of line for us to comment on things that are really just kind of coming from the media about what is being presented. So we're not really interested in complicating that situation further.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So let me ask another question, then. You talked about risk-sharing in capitation. Are you at liberty to comment on there was a bundling proposal in addition to the ACO proposal for Medicare? And then in light of the CareMore acquisition by WellPoint, and then Highmark buying up or getting into West Penn Allegheny, has that changed your viewpoint on more backward integration into primary care clinics or even hospitals?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dawn, you want to comment?", "Dawn Owens", "Sure. If you think about it, in Steve's opening comments, he talked about the benefit of the 2 business platforms of UnitedHealth Group. And the size and scale of UnitedHealthcare benefit business in support of that Optum agenda. In OptumHealth, we are focused on that care delivery community in combination with the broader Optum agenda, and we see great opportunity to partner with the system as they prepare for the changes in requirements of payers from the government health plans and so forth. They need better technology to connect the system, they need better intelligence to manage patient care on a population health basis, and there is a desire for alignment. And we're participating in that in many different forms and fashion. And consistent with these comments, that participation not only benefits UnitedHealthcare, but serves the broader healthcare community with other payers participating in it and so forth. This activity is not new to us, certainly with SMA and Evercare, a long legacy of activity in this area. And you see activity in the marketplace. And while I would say, albeit different than the approach we're taking, certainly, activities around involvement with the care delivery system.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I think it's not surprising to see that others are going to be taking off as well, different approaches and to pursue that. I would offer that I think it will vary market by market because the healthcare environment in each market is different then as result, kind of where they are, kind of an evolutionary point of view. What the supply demand dynamics are in that marketplace, what the history of protocols in a marketplace vary. So I think it will be dictated largely by local market dynamics, as people pursue different approaches to these more -- the broad theme of more integrated care efforts. I would offer that going as far as going totally to the hospital is maybe understandable in that marketplace. But I wouldn't think that it would be something that you would see a lot of.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "If I could just ask one follow-up on the Optum, you have $500 million year-over-year in revenue increase, so does that already include some of the inorganic deals you've done? And what can we expect for the back half of the year? Some of the transactions still closing? Are you going to do anything more?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it reflects the acquisitions that have been made and obviously -- whether we are, whether we pursue other investments and whether we're successful with respect to other investments is really to come. But I think -- Dave, you want to respond to that?", "David Wichmann", "Sure. The first 2 quarters of this year, you can probably see that we've done several small deals, I think 2 of them are probably more significant than the others in both Logistics Health, as well as WellMed. But most of all, we're doing our capability plug-ins, line extensions and the Optum business to date. And as Steve also indicated, we're not going to comment on the kind of our forward view of M&A activity. We do continue to look for opportunities to do capability acquisitions and line extensions, predominantly in the Optum business. But we also seek opportunities to take advantage of our substantive scale, and then also opportunities to improve our presence in markets in the benefits business as well. So hopefully, that responds to your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC", "To follow up on some of the provider questions. First of all, it's lovely to see a faster than expected, the integration of Optum's capabilities to UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of the entire business. So I think that, I guess, to answer the question of how do you invest in Optum and still grow profits? But I'm curious about your provider relationships and, Steve, I've asked you this question before and I'm still stuck on the question, which is, United and hospitals in particular have very, very challenging perhaps natural adversarial relationships. I don't and I see the improvements in client physician, and this more friendly approach to the physician. But how do you achieve this end goal of building this crucially important integrated system that fundamentally changes the way we get our healthcare paid for, et cetera, and manage it without addressing the issue of this highly adversarial provider relationship with the hospitals?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. I think, Gail may have some things to offer on this but I'll frame some of it. Well, your terms in terms of highly adversarial, there are understandable interests across the spectrum of healthcare, but if you really stand back and look at what a more optimal healthcare environment would be, there will be -- it would be one that is a much more inclusive paradigm in terms of including the interest of all the participants in the healthcare marketplace, the fact that we need hospitals, specialists, more primary care. We need them to be all more effective, we need to use those resources more effectively, if we are ever going to have a more sustainable health environment, better outcomes and more sustainable cost structure. So if there isn't a broader, more inclusive view of engagement, including bringing capabilities that I think we have to offer around the use of technology, the use of information, the use of care resources, and bring them into those venues. That's where I think you'll find the opportunities to kind of change the healthcare environment from a system's point of view. And I believe that there is an opening way of thinking about that, and that's why I think you're seeing response in the marketplace and the engagement that we are having with hospitals that are far from adversarial in their relationships. Gail?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sheryl, a couple of things to your point around our relationship with both physicians and hospitals. Over the last couple of years, we've made a significant investment in really turning around that relationship. I just want to point out to a couple of things, because we are seeing the impact of that in our satisfaction results, and we're also seeing it in the recent AMA survey that came out that showed that we have not only process improvements but they also think the improvements in the relationships with them. A couple of other things on the physician side, we invested in a physician advocate, so that we could work more effectively with them and the local community. We on-shored our calls, so that we could have a much more responsive service model for physicians. On the hospital side, we actually instituted a hospital advisory council lead by Michael Boyle, and our head of contracting. That's been incredibly productive. We're working on 6 to 12 accountable care pilots, part of our goal on sharing risk and also working closely with the delivery system to ensure that we have a different partnership relationship, and I think we recognize that. And so that's been a very significant investment. And then on the back end, we deployed a team of Six Sigma experts actually working in the hospitals to help them improve their processes. I guess I'd sum it up on that, at healthcare side, as we recognize that, that's a critical partnership, and as we move from just paying for fee-for-service, and negotiating unit cost rate, you've got to ultimately find a way to partner on shared risk. And that's the philosophy change, as well as an approach change within UnitedHealthcare. And clearly, in Optum's businesses and OptumInsight, they work directly with the delivery system. We often partner with them, when it makes sense to the delivery system. So I think there's both an attitude change within UnitedHealthcare, as well as a very specific program and investment going in improving that relationship.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sheryl, I think an interesting live example is the Tucson Medical Center. And that will be, Andy, if you can comment on that?", "Andrew Slavitt", "This is Andy Slavitt. I think, picking up on what Gail said, the tone in the market has changed, I think and has evolved over the last year, in particular. Providers are asking us much more frequently questions about, how do I manage risk? How do I manage to help the population? How do I use data better? How do I partner with my payors? How do I use technology? And I think you're seeing a natural point where both providers and payers are really seeking to work more collaboratively together. As Steve pointed out, the partnership we've built in Tucson, both with the hospital, Tucson Medical Center, as well as the independent physician is a great example. They really want to change the way they get rewarded for taking care of patients. And they know they need both set of tools that can be provided from Optum, as well as the expertise on the risk side, and the attraction of members that can come from UnitedHealthcare. So I think that is not just a one-off. I think that is thematic of what we're seeing across the marketplace.", "Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC", "I was hoping that you would say all of that because that was a key component of the strategy that I believe did need that philosophical change and it's nice to see it happening sooner than expected. So thank you very much for that insight.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I was wondering if you could update us on the Medicare side of the business, as it relates to timing of the RADV audit results? Any sense of dynamics around that would be helpful?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Tom?", "Tom Paul", "Sure. This is Tom Paul. We're continuing our dialogue with CMS around this topic. As you may know, they received a volume of responses from the industry and at large in regard to the proposed change in the audit methodology. And we understand they're still working on their response to that volume. As of this time, we're really unaware of the timing associated with their next release around the audit methodology.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.", "David Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So, Steve, I understand that you're very much affirming the strategy in Optum on the heels of leadership change in Optum. I wondered if there's any change in the application or execution of that strategy? And perhaps, as a corollary to that, any, say, reacceleration in acquisition plans there? Things along those lines. But again, the base question, is there any change on the underlying application on the strategy in Optum with the leadership change?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think the baseline, like the direction that the business is going, I think a great progress has been made particularly, let's say, in the last 9 months or so, in terms of establishing that platform, making it a more integrated, stronger operational platform, and one that we're building on. So I'm reaffirming that. I think that Larry will bring exceptional dimensions with respect to building that platform. And in terms of the operating discipline, his experiences across broad spectrum of the elements that Optum is using, as well as you can appreciate, Optum has businesses that are pretty mature and at scale level, other businesses that more in the earlier stages of that. So there is really a diversity of the businesses across that platform. And that diversity needs to be attended to. And I think Larry's background and experience just plays splendidly into that environment. And we're going to continue to build and we're going to continue to invest in that platform. There's no change in terms of that direction, whatsoever.", "David Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And if I could ask a quick follow-up. On the evolution of your capabilities in clinical and Optum, are you looking at ways and emphasizing ways to move from more population health management to individual management techniques? And is that important as you move toward an exchange environment, an individual environment?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Actually, in many ways, they're one and the same. To be able to manage large population, so what you have to do is to be able to manage individuals, and do it efficiently in an enormous scale, on what levels of intimacy that are relevant. So to me, they're one capability begets the outcome of the other. Dawn, do you have anything else to add?", "Dawn Owens", "No. I would echo what Steve said, we have invested heavily in consumer base platforms that allow us understand consumer, consumer segments, understand both their clinical needs and their behavioral needs, what motivates them to change. And we're deploying those capabilities in many different ways in partnership with many different constituents within healthcare, from payers to employers to now most recently, in partnership with the delivery system, as we've spoken about some of these other activities that we have been engaged in across Optum. So we do see those 2 things coming together hand-in-hand. It's the benefit of serving 60 million consumers, and something we'll continue to cultivate and advance within this platform.", "Stephen Hemsley", "If I get back to the first part of your question, Larry's here, and maybe it would be interesting to hear a few things from him.", "Larry Renfro", "So David, maybe I can tell you this, it's been a whirlwind 2 weeks of running around and talking to various folks. But the senior management team at Optum is a very, very outstanding team. And as a result, we've been able to hit the ground running. I don't think we're going to miss a beat on this. We looked at the strategy. The strategy is very, very solid, and we don't plan on making any change to that strategy. So the end result of a couple of weeks here is that the strategy is sound, and we're moving forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley", "Most of my question have been asked, but if you could just sort of put all the discussions together and maybe in thinking about EPS seasonality in the back half of the year. Last 2 years, Q3 has been north of Q4, is that roughly the seasonality we should be looking for? And then just secondly, maybe comments on Medicaid utilization. I guess just having the experience of the last 2 years, and seeing how trend has moderated across the different pair of classes, would just be curious on how you think about the commercial side? Obviously, you've got the cost share dynamic, which one could assume in this economy, would maybe keep people or cause them to be a little more prudent in their purchasing of health care. But just curious, your view of what's driving a similar downtrend in the Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, the Medicare side?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave, is going to address seasonality and then Jack will take on Medicaid.", "David Wichmann", "Doug, I think our seasonality patterns remain intact in terms of deductible wear-offs and things that are specific to our business, and frankly, specific to the industry. So you'll see things like the operating cost lift in the fourth quarter, our open enrollments efforts on Medicare, and our staffing of nurses and things of that nature in order to get to effective 1/1 date. When you compare the second half of 2011 to the second half of 2010 though, there are some differences that are -- I think are unique to this year, in particular. And I just wanted to point them out, as kind of a backdrop to that, I just want to reiterate that it's been a very strong enrollment year. And so you're going to see that growth effect come through in the back half of the year. And as Steve indicated, that's one of the reasons why we've lifted our guidance from $4.15 to $4.25 per share, despite the significant headwinds of Healthcare Reform. And as you may recall, that number compares favorably, or that range compares favorably to the $4.10 we recorded for all of fiscal 2010. And through the back half of 2011 as compared to 2010, the net EPS performance, if you are to look at it, is almost entirely explained by the favorable development we experienced in the last half of 2010. It's quite extensive versus the absence of future developments in our 2011 guidance. As you know, we don't -- we think we do our best estimate of our claim reserves, and we don't forecast any future development whether it will be positive or negative. The other thing I just wanted to note, however, is that we -- as Dan indicated, we experienced unexpected flat utilization in the back half of 2010, and that's compared to our current forecast of a more normal utilization trends in the back half of 2011. And then also affecting the comparisons will be the minimum MLR rebate requirements for 2011, where no such requirement was there for 2010. But if our guidance is achieved, we will see that in the end, that we'll be -- we'll have significantly offset -- or offset those significant headwinds through a broad-based growth, margin expansion diversification of our business, as well as our capital management.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Great. And, Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure. This is Jack Larsen. Just to answer your questions specifically on in-year seasonality with respect to Medicaid, there really aren't any demonstrable inter-seasonal patterns of utilization for Medicaid. But you know more generally, what we're thinking about the broad trends of the boost consumption in Medicaid. I guess I would call out, perhaps, 2 specific things. One, what we have seen is an overall reduction in birth rates and keep in mind, that about -- on our population of about 3.5 million members or so, about 2 million are children and a large majority are mothers. So birth rates go down, we see lower in-patients visits, lower bed days of course, and reduced levels of consumption. But I think even more generally, it's our point of view that the overall economic factors that affect people generally. Whether they're in a commercial population or for Medicaid affect utilization. Things like being able to get off work. Things like transportation. All of those things we think are general contributors to the reduced levels of consumption [indiscernible].", "Stephen Hemsley", "So thanks. I think we have to conclude this call. I think we have actually more than exceeded our time. Again, we'd like to thank you for joining us. And kind of remember that, as our 2 businesses, UnitedHealthcare at Optum work together, that we are really making some, I think, real meaningful in-roads in terms of advancing performance within the health system, delivering solid fundamental execution, gaining market share and producing consistent strong financial results. We thank you for your attention, and we'll close the call. Thanks", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. ", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. ", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amount. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 18, 2011, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review third quarter results. We will begin with some general third quarter highlights, and then turn to a more detailed review of UnitedHealthcare and Optum's progress and growth.  As we conclude, we will offer our view of the overall economic and healthcare environment and our positioning as we head into 2012, which we will detail further at our November 29 Investor Conference, when we will review our 2012 performance outlook with you, as we did last year.", "UnitedHealth Group earned $1.17 per share in the third quarter. Our results show consistent growth and continued strong, broad-based execution across the enterprise. People are purchasing more of our offerings, and we are doing a strong job delivering ever-improving value and service to them. Deeper and more diverse relationships across many aspects of healthcare, consistent fundamental execution, practical innovation and our diversified offerings are increasingly important to driving top line growth.", "The pace of change in healthcare is accelerating, and people are looking for strong partners who can deliver comprehensive solutions to the challenges they face. Our consistent and strong third quarter financial performance was driven by organic growth, careful cost management and continued moderate trends in the level of care utilization, along with the benefits of our broader diversification of offerings to the market. ", "We have increased our 2011 earnings outlook to a range of $4.40 to $4.45 per share on revenues exceeding $101 billion.  Let's review some of the details supporting these results. Third quarter revenues increased 7% to more than $25 billion, with revenues growing 6% at UnitedHealthcare and 22% for the Optum businesses. The third quarter operating margin of 8.2% was stronger than expected and generally in line with the level reported for the first half of 2011. ", "The third quarter margin decreased year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in the medical care ratio, which was caused by premium rate obligations -- rebate obligations, $30 million less favorable reserve development and modestly higher medical utilization trends as compared to 2010.", "The operating cost ratio increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.4%, driven by the growing mix of service and fee revenues. This mix impact was partially offset by consistent productivity improvements across our businesses. UnitedHealthcare, for example, has improved its operating cost ratio on a year-over-year basis each quarter this year despite the significant cost for reform readiness and increasing regulatory compliance purposes. In total, third quarter net earnings of $1.17 per share improved from $1.14 per share in 2010 and were again supported by strong adjusted cash flows from operations of $2.6 billion.", "Now let's review how these results were driven across our complementary business platforms. UnitedHealthcare's strong growth performance has been distinctive in the market. We have increased enrollment in every major product category every quarter for more than a year. The number of people UnitedHealthcare serves with medical benefits has increased by more than 1.4 million so far this year, including 220,000 more people served in the third quarter. This is on top of adding nearly 1 million people in 2010. ", "Third quarter 2011 growth was led by the Employer & individual business, which grew by 100,000 people, half in fee-based benefits and the other half in risk-based benefit products. This brought growth for Employer & Individual to nearly 1 million people over the past 9 months and 1.1 million people year-over-year. ", "UnitedHealthcare Community & State and the UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement both had strong growth as well. These businesses increased by 120,000 people this quarter and 435,000 people in the past 9 months, plus another 300,000 people in stand-alone Part D plan so far this year.", "Medicare Advantage sales have been strong all year. We added another 30,000 seniors this quarter bringing the year-to-date net increase to 145,000. UnitedHealthcare's consistently the choice for the largest share of newly eligible beneficiaries who choose private Medicare plans.", "Our Medicaid business grew by 55,000 people in the quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 165,000. Community & State was recently awarded new business in Texas and Louisiana for 2012, and we estimate will allow us to serve as many as 250,000 more people in those states.  These awards illustrate the larger-scale Medicaid opportunity, as states continue the decade-long trend of moving the greater portion of our nation's Medicaid population into the benefits of coordinated care programs.", "Overall, medical cost trends remain moderated across the benefits businesses compared to historical  levels. Unit costs continue to be the most significant trend driver, particularly in inpatient settings. We're starting to see some evidence of increased utilization in physician and outpatient settings albeit considerably less than what we expected when we entered 2011. ", "Hospital days per thousand continued to be lower year-over-year in part due to our targeted efforts to improve care and manage these costs appropriately.  Our consolidated care ratio of 80.7% increased 60 basis points from last year's third quarter, as the commercial medical care ratio increased 110 basis points year-over-year.", "In summary, diversified growth continues across our Health Benefits businesses. UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations of $1.75 billion decreased only $85 million year-over-year as new premium rebate obligations, lower earnings for Medicaid rate pressure and lower favorable reserve development levels were offset in part by strong organic growth, effective product positioning and strong, persistent cost management. 2011 earnings are well ahead of our original forecast for the year.", "Optum continued its strong performance this quarter, with revenues increasing 22% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Growth was again driven by both organic expansion and acquisitions that support our efforts for engaging and enabling the healthcare system to perform better for all stakeholders. ", "OptumHealth's third quarter revenue increased by $1.7 billion, a $577 million increase year-over-year, driven by added capabilities and market expansions in services for payers in the military and the clinical care community.", "OptumHealth total consumers served increased by 1 million people this quarter and nearly 3 million over the past year as OptumHealth's earnings from operations grew 12% to $115 million.  For full year 2011, OptumHealth is tracking to outperform its original revenue and earnings expectations with operating margins in the range of 6% to 6.5%. ", "OptumInsight's revenues of $625 million increased 6% year-over-year after absorbing the impact from the divestiture of our clinical trial services business. OptumInsight's earnings from operations of $91 million in the quarter increased 30% year-over-year. OptumInsight had a strong third quarter sales performance with momentum across all 4 of its markets: payer, provider, government and life sciences. Again, adjusting for the divestiture of the clinical trials business, OptumInsight's sales bookings grew 32%, and contract revenue backlog increased 22% year-over-year. ", "These figures reflect the strong continued momentum in this business.  We are committed to excellence and execution and are pacing our growth to ensure we deliver at the highest levels of client service. And evidence suggests it's working. The number of clients willing to recommend OptumInsight doubled over the past year. ", "OptumRx increased revenues by 17% to $4.9 billion in the quarter. PBM revenue growth reflects a substantive increase of nearly 2 million people served through internal and external channels and the growing mix of higher-revenue specialty pharmaceuticals. As expected, OptumRx earnings from operations decreased due to investments to support future growth prospects, including its service to the UnitedHealthcare Commercial business.", "In summary, Optum's 22% revenue growth and combined earnings from operations of $320 million in the quarter reflect increasing market demand and uptake for its differentiated service offerings. We believe these well-positioned businesses will deliver meaningful value across the healthcare system and exceptional growth for years to come.", "As we stated at the outset, we are raising our full year outlook. We now expect full year earnings to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.45 per share, which will represent growth of roughly 8% over 2010 results. This forecast includes the meaningful burden of investments to comply with extensive new regulations, premium rebate obligations for the health benefit customers, some modest increases in healthcare utilization trend and intense preparation for the full in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefits.", "Full year 2011 cash flows from operations are expected to be approximately $6.2 billion, and we are on pace to repurchase more than $2.5 billion in shares.", "Beyond this year, healthcare continues to offer compelling growth opportunities, and we strengthened our position and capacities to offer ever-improving value to participants.  We are strengthening our ability to respond to those opportunities by continuing to advance performance on many fronts. We continue to build on our reputation and brands. We continue to be active and engaged at both federal and state policy levels. ", "Inside the company, we are strengthening our employee engagements and our commitment to a united culture of integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships and performance. And these efforts are driving better and more consistent value to those we serve. ", "In innovation, we join past winners, Apple, BMW and Pepsi in receiving the unique and prestigious award for the Product Development and Management Association. We are only 1 of 2 companies recognized this year for sustaining value-added business performance from innovation for more than 5 years.", "Our most recent innovation example would be the launch of our HI, health innovation, hearing device business this month. We will be offering effective hearing-assistance devices that are less costly than traditional alternatives, along with a broadly available hearing test. The devices will be available through several channels, including at attractive discounts through many of our 2012 UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage benefit plans.", "In pharmacy benefits, we are focused on advancing a fully capable, fully scale platform to bring customers an innovative and differentiated value proposition around integrated cost and total quality management. We are advancing a consumer-focused agenda with a growing portfolio of leading mobile applications, consumer transparency tools and consumer financial analytics that link retirement and healthcare financial needs that's part of a long-term financial plan.", "The energy invested in these efforts, and more like them, is important to our long-term position, performance and customer value. It must be paired with strong execution for what we expect will be an even more challenging environment in 2012.", "For 2012, we expect unemployment to remain high, and the rate of new business formation will be low, extending the pressure on employment levels and overall growth in the Commercial Benefits business. We do expect to continue our very positive momentum in the fee-based national employer market segment for 2012. ", "In the risk-based market segment, we have seen some pockets of greater price competition. This is not unexpected, given the premium rebate regulations and recent lower cost trends. We have not seen action among competitors that imply an intention to broadly discharge reserves.  We will maintain our pricing discipline and consistency and expect increased local competition will pressure our membership growth rates in commercial risk offerings in 2012.  ", "We project medical utilization will trend toward more normal historical and seasonal levels in the fourth quarter 2011 and into 2012. We have realized strong, favorable prior year reserve development this year, which we believe is unlikely to be sustained in 2012. Importantly, if commercial reserve development recurs next year, it will be fully considered in premium rebate calculations, just as in-year development was this year.", "For these reasons, we expect the consolidated medical care ratio to continue to trend up year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2011 and into 2012.", "We entered the MA marketing season with strong offerings for 2012 to emphasize value, benefit stability, great service and with a proven sales organization. So we expect continued strong Medicare Advantage growth next year.  ", "In Part D, we expect to lose 450,000 to 550,000 low income, subsidized auto-assign members in 19 markets, where our bids were above the benchmark. This will impact revenues, and to a lesser extent, operating earnings for UnitedHealthcare and OptumRx. Part D bidding approach continues to focus on sustaining high-quality broad-access programs that meet the needs of the market. Our bids were similarly above the benchmarks for low-income beneficiaries in most regions in 2008, and we foresee price-driven business such as this moving back and forth among auction participants over time, and we remain committed to our broader, longer-term oriented market approach.", "Premium rate increases for government-sponsored benefit programs are expected to remain low and operating costs in 2012 will continue to reflect investments in compliance and reform readiness as we continue to respond to added administrative requirements from the health reform law and ICD-10. ", "At OptumRx, we expect increased investments in service and operations, personnel and anticipation of the repatriation of our UnitedHealthcare Commercial business during 2013.", "For 2012, OptumHealth expects strong top line revenue and earnings performance to be driven by an increase in clinical services, new military offerings and expansion more deeply into consumer services. Our 2012 cash flows from operations will need to absorb the cash flow impact of the initial premium rate -- rebate payments.  And lastly, we expect to increase in the corporate tax rate for 2012 to around 36%. ", "Considering these pressures, achieving an earnings per share advance, as we expect in 2012, will require diversified growth in both the Services and Benefits businesses, excellent operating and medical cost control and the effective use of capital. These are fundamental execution elements in our business -- of our business, where we have great strength and will continue to concentrate.", "Strong fundamental execution in these areas will be key to earnings growth in the years that follow. We see significant opportunities stemming from bringing our resources to serve the healthcare needs of many different people, those with lower incomes, the exponentially growing numbers of seniors, dual eligibles, the uninsured through Medicaid and exchanges and the military. We believe the PBM market opportunity and the broad and growing demand for services and technologies that help the components of healthcare to better connect, better operate and perform as a more integrated system will be sizable.", "To recap, we believe our long-term growth prospects are excellent. We're optimistic about our prospects for sustained multi-year earnings growth, driven by diversified revenue expansion and strong consistent execution on cost control. We are realistic about the challenging current market environment and the challenging earning comparisons we will face in 2012. We will incorporate this cautious view when we provide our outlook for next year at our Investor Conference on November 29, and we hope many of you will join us at this event.", "We're interested in your questions this morning. As usual, there will be 1 question per person, so we can speak with as many of you as possible. And I will turn this call back to our moderator for your questions. And again, thank you for joining us today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott J Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was hoping to get the Washington update from you, and maybe just hone in on the super committee and talk about some of the key issues that you may be monitoring there? And how much risk, if any, you see from those potential proposals for the business.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, Scott. And I think monitoring is the correct term. We certainly have been positively engaged in a dialogue at both federal and state levels over the last couple of years and continue to advance an agenda of a more modern healthcare system, opportunities that we think that can change the cost trajectory for important government programs, things of that nature. But I think it would be inappropriate for us to actually comment about the processes that we really are not directly involved in and are monitoring just as you might be, both at the committee level and if there is subsequent alternative in sequestration, if I could ever say that word correctly. So I don't think we're going to comment on that, other than to suggest that we're monitoring it, as I'm sure you all are. A lot of the materials and activities that we have been engaged in and continue to be engaged in, we're hoping are considered in recognizing these processes. But I don't think we can comment further beyond that.", "Scott J Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Steve, maybe just thinking about framing sort of the overall scope of this. When we compare it just to the whole health reform process that we just went through, how would you compare, I guess, sort of the potential impact or just extent of the issues they're talking about relative to the broader healthcare reform process that the industry just went through?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'm not sure it really compares on that level. And there's a much wider range of activities that can be pursued, particularly, as it relates to principally the government programs and so forth. So I'm not sure that those 2 are really comparable. I would say though that perhaps similar to reform, I think anything that goes -- goes forward has to be shaped to effectively translate to the realities of local markets and the environment that we're dealing with today. And so at some point in time, whatever comes forward has to get translated at a practical executional level, and I think that's always a challenge. I really don't think these processes other than that common thread are necessarily comparable. Cory Alexander, do you have any other observations on that? The answer is no.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Trying to figure out how to jam multiple questions into one here. But, basically, Steve, I want to make sure I'm interpreting...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. We're onto you on this one. Yes, so...", "Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just want to make sure  I'm interpreting your cautionary comments on 2012, as every year this year, you tend to be pretty conservative and cautionary on the following year. But am I right in interpreting that your EPS growth may fall below your long-term average target of 13% to 16% a year? And if so, can you just bullet for us what the most important headwinds and tailwinds are for you going into 2012?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. Well I think we did a pretty strong job of delineating the headwinds if you like me to go through those. And they are considerable, and that's why we are being cautious, with respect to our outlook. We were not, in this year, near that long-term growth range. And I don't think the environment has changed dramatically there. So we're also not giving guidance or direction today. We will do that at the Investor Conference, so I will stay away from that as will my colleagues through the course of the morning. The challenges are considerable. And it is a difficult environment. It is both on a broad economic level and in the healthcare domain, when you consider the number of factors that we're engaged in. We have operated effectively through that environment in the last couple of years, and we are poised to continue that and to double down on our efforts on that basis. But I think caution is the appropriate tone to set at this stage in the environment, both on the broad economic plane and in the healthcare domain. You -- I mean, you are as versed on these issues as we are. From a positives, we have a lot of growth opportunities, and we're, I think, a much stronger, and more capable organization today and more diverse in our offerings, in our reach into the marketplace. And we intend to pursue those things aggressively. I think we have opportunities to improve our performance as we do each year, and I'll ask if my colleagues want to add anything to that. No participants on that...", "Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So the big tailwinds that you mentioned, Steve, the non-risk enrollment growth -- you've got the Texas and Louisiana Medicaid. And I imagine, the CMS comments around 10% Medicare Advantage growth next year for the industry wouldn't be achievable, if you weren't growing your enrollment around at that level as well. Are there any other tailwinds to talk about for next year that could move the needle?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We have strong national performance business. We have had a growing pipeline of productivity and innovation and integration benefits that we have been pursuing. And we are really kind of institutionalized in terms of pursuing and capturing those each year. So I think there is a lot of things about our organization. I would say our reputation and our persistency in the marketplace, our ability to hold on to business even in challenging conditions is much, much stronger than it has been in the last few years. And I think a lot of that has translated into kind of performance. We meaningfully outperformed in 2011 compared to what our expectations were going in. And while I think that, that will be a challenge in 2012, given a number of headwinds, that's certainly our goal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Do you think your commercial risk margins will be up or down in 2012? It sounds like you thought pricing, at least in pockets, was getting more aggressive. You talked about your assumption that the cost trends would be up next year. So when you put those 2 together, where do we end up from a margin perspective?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, again, we're not going to be answering details with respect to 2012 guidance. I really am not interested in piecemealing this. We will respond kind of thematically to what we see in terms of pressures in the commercial marketplace. Gail?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "Sure. Let me frame sort of the comment, as Steve said,  we're not going to comment on 2012 margins at this stage. But part of your question was around what's happening in the commercial risk-based business. And I guess, I'll touch on and follow up on the comments Steve made around pricing in the marketplace and the competitiveness. We are seeing a more competitive marketplace, but I think what's important to note is that this isn't an across-the-board change. It really is in selected markets. And I'll give you a few examples. For example, the California market where we're seeing some segments of that marketplace being much more competitive with a few specific competitors, as well as in some pockets in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, which are more segment or customer-based type of situation. From our perspective, we've stayed very disciplined in our pricing. As we have historically talked about over the last several years, our fundamental process hasn't changed, and we do expect that to pressure our 2012 financial growth somewhat. The guide grills around this, which I think makes this a little bit different than what's happened in past years is that many of the competitors are dealing with reform implications, rate review and still have to make investments. So that's why we see this as specific to certain markets and not a real broad-base change, but still some increasing pressure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.", "John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just want to make sure I'm kind of based correctly on how you view the '11, so the jumping off point. Do I think of your '11 kind of the clean -- kind of think of a clean run rate as the x Penn Treaty, when I think about kind of where were jumping off from? Or do you incorporate saying kind of that would be offset by lower development, rebates or anything else like that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think, I'm going to let Dave respond to this a bit, but I think that it is -- you should be careful about just taking run rates and running them into next year, I think, each year. And that's why the pretty impressive list of challenges needs to be considered. I'll use the premium rebate as just one example. The reserve development this year -- for prior years was not affected by the rebate calculations. Next year, all reserve development to the extent it exists will be affected. So those kinds of things really kind of throw that kind of run-in modeling off a little bit. Dave?", "David S. Wichmann", "Steve, I'm not sure I have a whole lot more to add more to that. John, you picked off, I think, the 2 important features. One is we do have Penn Treaty still forecast in the fourth quarter, and as indicated in the past, that's in the $0.12 to $0.15 range. And then we do have substantive prior year development in 2011, which will not recur in 2012. And as Steve had indicated, to the extent that it does, a good chunk of that will be given back to the market. So that, I would characterize as being the most substantive, besides the list of headwinds and tailwinds that Steve articulated in his opening comments.", "John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So when you're talking, you were talking to EPS growth for '12 -- you're basing yourself on the GAAP guidance of $4.44 to $4.45 not the $4.55  to $4.60. Is that fair to say?", "David S. Wichmann", "Yes, I think that's fair to say.", "John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just the color, again, '11 -- so coming off year '11 with the trend having run lower, and as  you've approached '12 from a pricing perspective, how much -- so you approach it with a view that trend is going to reaccelerate appropriately. Can you give us kind of an order of magnitude, how much would trend have to reaccelerate to where it was kind of just matching the expectations you built into that forward -- the forward pricing?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't think we can offer that kind of precision. And I think it might be -- it can somewhat -- inappropriate to talk about our pricing at that level in a forum like this, John. So I would offer it -- and I'll let Gail kind of correct me on this if I get this wrong -- I'm going to offer it that we, basically, look at the current state, and then assess that the more moderate levels of utilization perhaps would not be sustained that we would go back to more historic levels off our current baseline. And that's the kind of approaches we might take broadly. And we're not trying to sit back and say we're catching up on 3 years or something like that. Gail?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "The only thing I'd add to Steve's comments, John, are that terms of the fundamental approach, it's stayed the same. And remember, we're pricing to a long-term medical loss ratio and across 350 different intersections, so they have -- we look at the geography, the product and trying to make sure that we are projecting appropriately our forward view of those costs in that pricing. So there is a number of things other than a straight-line assumption on just the trend that go into the factors on our pricing across our markets and our segments as well. So it's a little bit more broad than what --  is just assessment of a broad-based national trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was wondering if we could just drill into what exactly the message is on the commercial cost trends. I think, Steve, you were saying that you're continuing to see moderated levels relative to, I guess, historical norms, but now you're starting to see a slight uptick. So maybe just what exactly is the message there? Are you starting to see what you would consider normal trends, or are we still sort of well below that? And then from your best information, what's causing that increase on both the inpatient and the physician side? And again, I just want to make sure it's -- this is just commercial. You haven't seen anything in Medicare or Medicaid?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I'm going to let Dan respond to this, but I think we're going to respond across the expanse of the Benefits business. I would say that I think, we have seen higher levels across all of 2011 compared to 2010. And then Dan, you want to pick it up?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, good morning, Josh. As always, I need to start with the reminder around the composition of our trend. Our trend is -- unit cost is by far the largest driver in our underlying trend, so utilization is a much smaller component. So with that said, I think what we're seeing in utilization is really an extension of themes from last quarter. So our utilization trend in 2011 is up over 2010, and that's true in commercial Medicare and Medicaid. It's still below historical norms, but I would tell you that Medicare and Medicaid are closer to historical norms. As we look at the composition of that increase, it's really a blend of a couple of factors. The first is really the low comparison period in 2011, in particular, in the third quarter where it was very low in 2010, which will also be true in the fourth quarter, because the fourth quarter of '10 was very low. We're also seeing increased consumption levels, and that consumption is going up and in the outpatient and physician categories, most notably. And on the inpatient side, we continue to see a more restrained utilization, so that's still trending flat to slightly down, and that's true across, again, commercial Medicare and Medicaid. The other item that's impacting our trend is also the increase in our treatment costs for Hepatitis C, with the introduction of 2 new pharmaceuticals in the month of May. As we think about the full year guidance from a commercial cost trend standpoint, we expect that now to be slightly below 6% on the full year. And similarly, we have updated our medical loss ratio guidance to around 81% on the Commercial business as well for 2011.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Just so I get this straight, it sounds like now the cost trend for the full year is actually a little bit lower than what you said last quarter. But last quarter, you didn't mention any -- even a moderate increase in utilization. So I guess, I'm just confused. Is -- are cost trends relative to what you saw 90 days ago? Are they higher now than what you were seeing? Or is this continuing to run below expectations, but maybe not as much below expectations?", "Dan Schumacher", "So I think what I shared last quarter is that we did see an increase in our utilization trend on a year-over-year basis. And we did see a further increase in that sequentially, at albeit a little bit lower than what we had expected.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So if I were to kind of summarize, 2010 was quite an extraordinarily low year. 2011 is running slightly higher than that and pretty much across the board. And we are seeing some elevation, not so much in the inpatient settings but in the other settings, and that we're still off what might be historic norms. But we're seeing some trend pickup, right? And I think that's pretty consistent with the way we've seen it all through the year. So I don't know if we're signaling anything particularly new here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more details around the bringing back the rest of the PBM. Any thoughts about how much incremental spend there is next year? And then how we think about normalized margins on that business overtime?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. I think, at this -- I think Bill Munsell can respond to this, I think, pretty effectively. Bill, you want to take this?", "William A. Munsell", "As I try and answer this question, let me provide a little context in doing that. And I'd like to start off from the standpoint. And we've talked about this several times in the past in this forum and others like it. But we've enjoyed a unique relationship with Medco. In that relationship, UnitedHealth Group has retained the responsibility for all of its benefit designs, its formulary management, its rebate contracting and its retail pharmacy network contracting. On the other hand, Medco adjudicates and pays our retail pharmacy claims and provides home delivery service to our customers. So in essence, Medco has provided us an array of administrative services to what is really a very well-established pharmacy function within UnitedHealth Group.  As Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are investing in OptumRx to enhance its information systems and technology and to increase its scalability. We're also integrating some of the capabilities of our sister companies, such as OptumHealth's eSync platform, which helps combine medical and pharmacy data and OptumInsight's data analytics and predictive modeling tools. The transition will add more than 12 million commercial members on a stage basis. And we'll begin that process in 2013. We've developed our transition plan and are currently working with folks at Medco to incorporate what they need to do in that plan.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So is there any sense about just the amount of incremental investments, and then what you think you can ultimately do on that business once the business has fully transitioned back?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. We've invested, maybe year-to-date, kind of in the range of about $35 million, year-to-date, in that process. We'll probably finish off the year at about that same -- that quarterly rate, so just under $10 million a quarter that will escalate meaningfully next year. I don't want to specify the number. We will specify it at the Investor Conference. But it will be a meaningful uptake on 2 levels, not only the readiness of the structure of it, but we're going to have to be staffing in the latter part of the year, as we begin the process of transitioning. So that will be meaningfully higher than this current year level. And obviously, we are pursuing this because: One, we think that this can produce for us a distinctive offering in the PBM space, one that perhaps is more integrated, a little -- more modern, a little more technology-oriented, more consumer-oriented; and we think that we can perform and compete at the highest levels in this space and produce the kind of returns that have been historic in this space. So that's our ambition. And I don't think we can really comment any more specific level beyond that.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That makes sense. I don't know if this is a question that you're going to -- for the Investor Day. But in the past, you talked about being able to grow the margin across all the services businesses, do you still feel that way, or is that a longer-term target? And it sounds like the PBM might have a hard time growing margins next year with this investment, but...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. I think when he have made those kind of comments, that it's always been with the longer-term point of view. We certainly aspired to -- we think the margins in these businesses can be strong and can be strong as they get scaled and as these businesses mature. But that has always been a longer-term ambition. We really aren't commenting, in terms of like next year's numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just first, a quick clarification. Steve, in your prepared comments, I know there's been a lot of questions around 2012, but you did specifically say there will be earnings growth, and we'll know -- we'll get the EPS guidance specificity at Investor Day, right? And that's off the current guidance of $4.40, $4.45, right?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That is -- that's our expectation.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then my question is just on the government margins. And 2 things. One, on Medicaid, can you give us any update on one, I think, you threw out a rate number expectation of about 1% for next year in the second quarter. Any update there? And also, what you're seeing on cost trends in Medicaid, specifically, if you're seeing any uptick? And then what you think -- just some color on government margins for next year, breaking up Medicare and Medicaid, and what you see as kind of the headwinds, tailwinds from a margin perspective, knowing that you're going to grow membership there?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Well, I'll have, Jack, kind of respond, I think, principally to the Medicaid questions. We really haven't been breaking those margins out and have no expectation to. But I think, Jack can respond a number of the other questions you asked.", "Jack Larsen", "With respect to your first question about the 1% expected rate increase for full year, I think we have very good visibility to the majority of our member months that were subject to some type of a rate action, 90 days ago. And we will see about a 1% average annual rate increase across full year 2011, so feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of what that may portend for 2012 and some of the headwinds, tailwinds, a significant portion of the member months that had their final rate action here in the last few weeks and months of the quarter really came out flat to slightly negative. So to the extent that these rates are set on a state fiscal year basis, they're going to present a headwind, at least for the first half of 2012. And we'll certainly have more to say about the extent of that headwind when we get together in New York here in a few weeks. I'd say with respect to cost trends specifically to Medicaid, I guess, I would defer to Dan's comments. He really answered for all of the Benefits businesses, and we're really not seeing anything different than the aggregate Benefits business, and that is good performance on inpatient bed days, with a increasing rate of trend in, specifically, outpatient, physician and then the prescription Rx category for us, so fairly consistent.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And just on the Medicare side, I wasn't asking for specificity, but just any color like you gave there, as far as knowing what the rates are, knowing what the benefits you set in the marketplace? Any x PPD any thoughts on what a Medicare margin might be just directionally a headwind, tailwind?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes. Again, following up on Steve's comments, not particularly talking about the margins in the Medicare space, but you can talk a bit just to show a little bit of color on 2012 and where we see the Medicare Advantage business from a growth perspective. We're coming up a strong sales year, as Steve mentioned in his opening remarks, and feel very well-prepared for the 2012 selling season. We're in day 4 of the annual election period and are pleased with our competitive positioning across our portfolio and at the local market level, with a strong attention to premium stability with the vast majority of our membership remaining in a 0 premium plan, benefits that resonate strongly with the consumers, as they've told us. And then the value-added services and benefits, again as Steve mentioned under the innovation category of his opening remark, with the inclusion of the hearing assistant devices that we think have been really resonating well within the marketplace and getting good consumer response. So we're very optimistic about 2012 and would be happy to share more details in November at the Investor Conference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "As we think about healthcare reform and the Supreme Court, there are several ways that, that could play out. If it was the case that reform was upheld but without the individual mandate, could you talk about some ways that the industry or United could evolve to adapt to that sort of environment?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Maybe I'll offer some opening comments, and then -- but it would essentially continue to drive the costs up because of the mix of participation in the marketplace in general. And there are states today that have those kinds of environments, and those states have higher cost structures. But they are -- they're open markets, there are a number of competitors involved. We participate in some of them. That's pretty much it.", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux. The only thing I'd add to Steve's comments is we're preparing our business for the future, regardless of what happens with any rulings that occur. So as you think about exchanges and preparing to be in a more consumer-focused marketplace, adding transparency tools, preparing our products with more affordable price points across the boards, we're looking at all of those things and we're the process of getting ready for that now, and we're seeing some of that implemented in the marketplace, as we speak.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And just a follow-up. On the states that do have that sort of situation, currently, it -- does that generate a different margin outlook for those products? Or is that something that you're able to adjust to and maintain the sort of margins that you get across the rest of your book?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think -- I don't know if Jeff wants to answer. New York is kind of one of those markets, I think, it  generally elevates the cost in total of the marketplace.", "Jeff Alter", "Sarah, it's Jeff Alter. Predominantly New York right now has an individual market for the past 15 or 16 years with guarantee issue, community rated. Costs are very high, but on a margin -- we still have margin on that product. It's -- it is on a much higher rate in a shrinking market, as it has progressed because of the cost.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Because of the cost, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "My first question is a clarification. I think I might have just missed it, because it went kind of quickly. Did you say that you expect Optum growth, in terms of earnings in 2012? So can we think about lower investment in OptumHealth, offsetting higher investment on the PBM? And then can you speak to the duals? Where you see that opportunity and how that might evolve for you?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I'll have Jack and Gail kind of address the duals. And I don't think we offered any guidance with respect the Optum or any of the other businesses at that particular level. We did say we expect Optum to continue to grow and that we expect it to grow profitably. But there will be costs associated with a number of the investments we're making to PBM, in-sourcing and so forth. So we'll go through the performance of the individual business units with you in November. So we really didn't comment on any particular business, in terms of its bottom line performance.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And so you're just saying revenue is going to grow in Optum. You said nothing about earnings either in total or any of the divisions?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That's right, for Optum or any of the businesses in UnitedHealthcare. We'll cover that when we go through specific guidance. I really don't want to  piecemeal this through this. What I was endeavoring to do was at least portray the environment, I think, that we're involved in, and how we're positioning it against that environment. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "The CMS office of Integrated Medicare, Medicaid programs has really infused the whole notion of coordinated care, with respect to those who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid with a lot of momentum. And it really began last summer with the introduction of their 2 contracts and states really taking that ball up and developing really responses -- LOI responses as to how they might participate in that dual program. I think at last count, we saw about 37 states responded with that nonbinding LOI. Just as a point of reference, we are partners with about half of those states in the underlying Medicaid program and also offer currently dual Special Needs Plans in the majority of those states. So in terms of how it plays out for us, I would tell you that we have been synthetically providing integrated care to duals for many, many years, starting with our dual Special Needs Plans, on to our ongoing Medicaid plans and then a decade or so ago, with our Evercare Institutional Special Needs Plan and nurse practitioner-based program. So I think it plays out well for us. I think we're going to see real acceleration of activity in the next few quarters as states move ahead and begin to flesh out, specifically, what they intend to do with these pilot programs. I think CMS is going to continue to review those pilots and move some ahead with further support. I would hold out really the State of Michigan is probably in full position on this. A couple of months ago, they have basically decided to move about 250,000 of their dual eligibles into managed care, and we're working very closely, certainly, with that state as they move forward. So we're very excited about the opportunity as a company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you just comment a little bit more on the pricing environment. I'm interested in -- if you can, if you're seeing any variation. Where in those markets you touched on California and the Northeast Mid-Atlantic, where you are you seeing some more price competition or rate pressure? Is it from for-profit or not-for-profit carriers? And does it seem more in the individual side, the small group side, large group? Just any more granularity you can give?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of my earlier comments, I guess, the only specific I give is that, again, it isn't broad-based, and it often is -- in some of those markets, it's client specific, as we near the end of the year. And I think some competitors are looking at just their positioning. In California, we're seeing it in, actually, in a couple of the market segments just given some of the actions that have been taken by a few competitors there. So I don't think, from my comments before that it is broad-based. It is very specific. It's unique circumstances in a marketplace that a -- a competitor's positioning is. And I do think people are broadly being rational about their position in the market. And as I said, we are staying very disciplined around our pricing and our position in those markets as well.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And lastly, are you seeing in the commercial market any noticeable acceleration in a preference for self-funding, particularly at the smaller employers size that would normally look at that option?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "We haven't -- I wouldn't say we're seeing an acceleration. We've seen a movement to self-funding overtime. It has not accelerated meaningfully. We are seeing some movement down market, but I don't think it's -- I wouldn't characterize it as significant acceleration. We also have product offerings in that category that move downstream, but we still have a pretty robust, fully insured risk business in the small group, and that's the preference. What I am seeing is a huge focus on affordable product offerings, so we've put a lot of products into the market that are what we consider value-based networks and that focus on wellness and provide incentives for employees. And that's been very popular, and those are some of our fastest-growing product offerings in the marketplace today. So there's a real focus on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I don't know if you can answer this question, because it's not about cost trends and it's not about pricing and it's not about 2012 guidance. I'm going to go back to what I usually go back to, which is what I'm really interested in and what I think I'm seeing more in both your published and oral remarks today is the intersection and synthesis of the Optum services with the Benefits business. First, am I seeing that? The second part of this question is to the extent that you can measure it and to the extent that you can quantify it, what would be the impact on the Benefits business -- if I can frame it that way -- on the Benefits business of whether it's OptumInsight's tools and working with hospitals to become more cost-effective partners, get them readmissions et cetera, or OptumHealth ability to work with both consumers and employers and other participants to make more intelligent decisions and pursue better cost trends for everyone. Can you measure that at all? I mean, I guess, what I would say is when you look at your 2011 numbers, and as they have developed over the year, what might your margins have been in the Benefits business without the benefit of Optum?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So just to kind of -- first of all, this is a broader perspective question. It really speaks to the full range of the healthcare marketplace and the healthcare environment we work in. We see those, that whole marketplace, evolving towards a more integrated state, a more end to end, a more connected, a more aligned kind of universe in healthcare and that one would logically imagine that, that more aligned -- everybody has commented about the fragmentation of healthcare for many, many years -- that, that more aligned marketplace should perform better. And the agenda of our businesses in the engagement in the marketplace on both the benefits side and the services side is to facilitate that alignment and integration and to move it along and participate in a productive way, plain recognizing we play a -- more than a role in that. I think that's been our agenda for several years. We are really just at some levels, kind of getting the first-generation of traction or scale at it. And I think, one would logically believe that you should get a better-performing marketplace. Your business, if you are moving in this direction should perform better. Ultimately, you'd get a more sustainable cost, and you get a better end-to-end experience, as you get both the consumer and provider participating in a way that is using information at the appropriate point and using the -- using more modern faculties, if you will, in the healthcare space. And I think much of that agenda, is starting to -- you're seeing the first -- the beginnings of that. I think the only way to actually measure it is to look at certain clients that have moved along in that continuum a little bit more aggressively, so you jump down to a -- almost a client environment, where there is that kind of -- you're closer to that, and they tend to perform better, they'll use their own book of business. Our own employees, where we have been kind of a first mover in on the benefits side  in terms of how we engage on the delivery side and use the tools that Optum has, you get better performance. And I don't know if -- Gail, you want to add to that?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "Sure. I'll add a few comments to Steve's overview. I think we have the unique platform with our 2 businesses. And I think it really does, when we work together on this, it does provide us a much better platform. And I think about it, pretty simply, it's using better information which we get from OptumInsight and the tools, helps us make better decisions which Optum helps through its care management capabilities embedded with our programs with our customers, fundamentally, drives better health. And that really is the foundation of the programs that we have. So as I think about those, we have many clients that we work together in a very integrated way and other clients who work separately and do that across our entire book of business. But together, it's hard for us to break it out, because the programs and information are embedded in how we manage our business, Sheryl. So I think, that, for us is what's unique about the platform we have. We can take some of the best tools across our 3 Benefits businesses and apply them and integrate them with the results. And I think our National Accounts business is probably one of the best examples of driving a lower trend year-over-year, better employee engagement though our programs, and quite frankly, very high satisfaction rates. So that would be my gauge of the external market's value of an integrated program.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And I think the winners in this, at the end of the day, while I think our business will prosper by enabling that kind of agenda, the winners are the consumers who should get a better, tighter more engaged and take on the tools to become more responsible consumers in healthcare, and the care providers who are using their resources now more productively, more the way they have intended to when they entered that profession. And then, if we can use those resources more effectively, there's a dividend to society in that, and that's kind of -- we're hoping that there is some modeling that plays to that agenda, but it is the long-term proposition.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Right. In the meantime, the stock is down 7%. So couldn't you be a little more optimistic about 2012?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'm disappointed to hear the stock is down 7%, but I think what we're trying to do is to kind of prudently lay out the challenges for 2012. But I didn't think we were holding back on the notion that I think, we're a much more capable organization, that we'll engage the marketplace very effectively. We did it in the 2011 and exceeded expectations. And we're focused on continuing driving that agenda up. So we are not discouraged, if that's the message.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just quickly, what's the cash at the parent? And my real question is what portion of your commercial risk businesses is in rebate status?

Hemsley", "Very market-specific, but Gail, do you want to comment on that?", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "Sure. In terms of the pricing. Obviously, we're pricing, as I mentioned, a 350 different intersections. And we're trying to price closer to the pin around medical loss ratio. Clearly, those that are above medical loss ratio status we're managing to get within that realm, and that's where we think there's opportunity to continue to work through those markets. So we won't disclose or get into kind of what percentage of our markets are in, what status, again. But I think if you get a sense, we had a pretty very disciplined process. There's a lot of intersection points around that pricing. And clearly, we're working to get closer to the pin around all those intersections and offer, I think, competitive viable products in the market. So we think there's a broad footprint, and we offer that today in our markets, and that will be our continued goal.", "Peter H.

Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Sounds like you're still working on your back-end systems for OptumRx to produce that differentiated approach, that being ultimately the integration of medical and  pharmacy data. I was wondering when you would have kind of end results ready for the consultant community to try and influence the way they evaluate RFPs?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Jackie, do you want to respond to that?", "Jacqueline B. Kosecoff", "We've been working on improving OptumRx consistently over the last 3 or 4 years and believe that we, actually, are quite competitive right now, and we'll continue to be even more competitive. We're hearing from consultants that OptumRx is well positioned, has a rising profile in the national accounts market in particular and is increasingly seen as a thoughtful alternative to the big PBMs. Just to add a tad more color, we have recently introduced a whole new web portal system. We have new tools which we think are state-of-the-art to help members and our clients decide how to reduce healthcare costs and pharmacy costs in ways that match their corporate DNA. And we have some very new tools that we've developed in concert with some OptumInsight to help with data analytics and predictive modeling.", "Michael J.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the self-insured national accounts market, and hopefully, this is a little more positive and more tailwind-oriented. On the group retiree market, we're hearing that as many of 5 to 10 million group retirees could be moved in the next 2 years to MA and apparently 50 plus percent of employers are planning to that in the next 2 years. Given that you have a very strong presence in employers and in MA, should we be considering that as a bolus that comes in for 2012? Can you comment on the pipeline?", "Tom Paul", "Sure. Yes. this is Tom Paul. I think we talked in 2011 that the group retiree marketplace in '11 was a bit flat, as employers were coming off of health reform discussions and delaying their decisions. But as you just noted, there is growing interest. And we are seeing that in our 2012 pipeline. And I think that the common theme around that is employers are looking for a more affordable solution for their long-term retiree strategy. And as you noted, Medicare Advantage is a strong offering that meets that affordability question. And so as we're seeing sales for 2012, and quite frankly, across our entire portfolio, whether it be Med Sup, Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D, we are seeing sales that are returning to more normal levels in that group retiree with a pickup in MA, as well as in Part D. Because of the change in the RDS status as a result of the health reform law, a number of employers are looking at changes in their drug program, which over 2012 and 2013 is continuing to afford us many opportunities in that marketplace.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So you would think that the 5 million maybe over 2 years is a reasonable estimate for the industry as well?", "Tom Paul", "I think the -- I don't want to comment specifically on the numbers to give you an indicator, but I do think that there is significant opportunity across the employer space.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And related to that, to MA, but not in group retiree, you have Med Sup and MA.  Med Sup is somewhat under the gun right now with the deficit committee. As you're selling and you're entering the selling season with the individual market, is the opportunity to upsell someone who's got Medicare supplement in Part D to MA and even for you, with the big Med Sup program you've got as much as twice the operating profit dollars, are you seeing more of a trend towards that? And are you proactively driving that?", "Tom Paul", "True. This is Tom again, I'll respond to that. So I think that's the beauty of having a Medicare portfolio that crosses each of the products offered in the marketplace. I will say that within our consumer population, there are distinct characteristics that attract -- or within individuals that attract them to  medical supplement versus Medicare Supplement versus Medicare Advantage or even to add on to Medicare Part D. And so each year, as we approach the marketplace for their consumers, we're very attentive to what their needs are and then provide the best product that meets their individual needs.  And so we actually have been seeing transition from individuals from the Medicare Supplement marketplace into the Medicare Advantage marketplace over the past year or years. And we would expect to see that in 2012. But we'd continue to see Medicare Supplement as a solid offering for a distinct segment of the marketplace, and especially because of the benefit features that it offers.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then finally -- I might be the last one anyway asking questions -- so on the OptumHealth side, again, the consultant seem to indicate that the disruption that the express Medco merger could potentially go on even if the deal closes is benefiting Optum and Caremark, so are you projecting a bigger uptick in sales for 2012? Just so we see something for 2012 ahead of the big Medco, bringing in a Medco contract in house, because right now, it seems like it's more about all these upfront investments, but you don't realize the top line tailwinds until 2013. But can we see some of that in 2012?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't know if that national business moves at that speed, but there is no question that we see upside we would not be pursuing this marketplace, we see the need in the marketplace, recognize, I think, that we've had, for years, very strong capabilities in this space if we didn't see significant growth. And I would agree with you, the marketplace will be in some level of disruption with that kind of activity going on. So it should be an opportunistic marketplace. I just think we have to be baselined about how that business will come to the marketplace. But I believe, that we will be very, very competitive for it.", "Operator", "That question will come from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just -- you've touched on a lot of questions. Just on the inpatient unit prices, where do you think you stand right now relative to the #1 carrier within your respective markets, obviously, the blues. And just how do you think about the opportunity to better control the in patient unit costs going forward? And then maybe, just if you could also touch on what trends you're seeing in acuity across Care, Caid and Commercial that will be great.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I think our competitive position in these areas has consistently advanced. And I think we're very, very competitive today. But I'll let Gail kind of respond to that.", "Gail K. Boudreaux", "Sure. I think as you look at our growth in the National Accounts space, which is highly sensitive to that unit cost issue and overall value proposition, we've continued to improve our positioning and feel that we're very competitive across that space. So I think from that perspective, we continue to do it, but beyond just unit cost, I think that the other elements we add around care management, value proposition products, wellness have also played into that. And I'll ask Dan to comment on your note about acuity.", "Dan Schumacher", "This is Dan Schumacher. On the acuity front, it does vary across the different Benefits businesses. I would tell you in the Medicare space, it's been very stable. We haven't seen any meaningful change with respect to acuity on the inpatient side. Whereas in the commercial space, we have a long-standing increase in acuity year in and year out that really relates to the underlying aging of the population, and so that's no different this year than other years.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, is part of that acuity also the lift in commercial? I mean, can you tie that back to the economy, and just a bias where the lower acuity treatments get put off?", "Dan Schumacher", "No, I would say it more relates to the overall demographic trend. That's the larger influencer of it.", "Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then if we just think about inpatient unit costs as the driver of trend, I mean, is it -- is it your view that as we look out 12, 18 months that, that will continue to be the single biggest driver of care cost trends? I mean, is there any dynamic you can foresee where that would change and not remain the biggest driver?", "Dan Schumacher", "My view is that it will continue to be a very significant driver. And we're working very hard inside the organization to change the way that we orient our payments to reward value. And we're making some progress in that regard, as we look at gain-sharing opportunities, all the way through to the full capitation and risk arrangements.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And to be honest, it has been the driver several years. So it's not a new trend. It's just -- with utilization environment, it just becomes more pronounced. ", "So thank you for your interest this morning. Sum up quickly, I think UnitedHealth Group is performing well, delivering consistently strong and fundamental execution. We remain very focused on customer and external market needs, those we serve, very focused on innovation, very focused on driving value. While we are mindful of the challenges in 2012, I would suggest that our success, in terms of the capabilities and building the capabilities of this organization as we have demonstrated through 2010 and 2011, that we are poised to take on 2012  at exactly the same way. And we look forward to discussing this with you further at our Investor Day in late November. So thank you very much", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 19, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will discuss our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2012. As we said at the start of the year, we are committed to further improving our overall performance in 2012 with continued focus on fundamental execution and practical innovations that serve to modernize the health care sector from health benefits to health services. ", "As we've told you consistently, we greatly respect the headwinds facing us this year. Yet longer term, fundamental market needs for improved health care access, affordability, quality and simplicity continue to grow, regardless of legal or legislative processes. These enduring needs define the dramatic market opportunities that stand before us, as we continue to evolve and grow. ", "Steady growth across our enterprise is evident today. It ranges from the honor of serving TRICARE beneficiaries to services and technologies supporting integrated care and forward-looking accountable care models. From significant new pharmacy management engagements to states accelerating their pursuits of managed Medicaid solutions to employee benefits for state governments and large commercial employers, from expanding Medicare market dynamics to statewide health information exchanges. ", "This breadth of growth reflects the diversity of the UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses, their complementary alignment and the value of the core competencies of care management, information and technology they both leverage. ", "In the first quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.31 per share on revenues of $27.3 billion, an increase in revenue of 7% year-over-year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 40 basis points year-over-year due to higher medical and rebate reserve developments and continued focus on delivering affordable, high-quality health care. ", "As expected, our operating cost ratio increased 80 basis points, driven by the continued strong growth in services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, combined with the investments we are making to advance our Optum businesses and particularly our pharmacy services. Adjusted cash flows of $1.1 billion were in line with our expectations. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 31% and $1.1 billion in available cash. First quarter annualized return on equity was once again strong at 19.4%. ", "Let's review our business results starting with UnitedHealthcare, which is accelerating its distinctive and broad-based growth pace. After adding 2.6 million consumers with medical benefits over the past 2 calendar years, UnitedHealthcare grew by another 1 million people in the past 90 days. That number is now expected to grow by another 700,000 to 900,000 through the balance of 2012, and we have successfully secured the TRICARE West contract effective mid-2013.", "UnitedHealthcare is serving sophisticated employers by combining advanced technology with personalized approaches that really reach consumers and help them take more control of their health. We are advancing newer more consumer-centric products for smaller businesses that value affordability and cost control. ", "For consumers, UnitedHealthcare offers affordability, responsive service and an enhanced care experience through our innovative mobile technology offerings. And we offer government sponsors a reliable partner who provides cost control for their budgets and high-quality branded offerings to serve their constituents. Execution of these value propositions at the local market level, one consumer at a time, drives consistent sustained growth.", "Let's review some of the details. In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew fee-based benefits to serve 765,000 more consumers. We added 65,000 people in Medicaid, more than 250,000 in Medicare Advantage and 105,000 in supplemental Medicare benefits. In the process, we strengthened our business nationally with distinctive chronic care capabilities through the acquisition of XLHealth. Our Medicare Advantage business now serves 2.5 million American seniors and beneficiaries.", "As expected, risk-based commercial enrollment decreased 190,000 people in the first quarter, with about half of the decrease due to conversion to fee-based products by large public sector clients that we retained. And because of additional in-year engagements, we are now increasing our membership growth projection for UnitedHealthcare by more than 750,000 -- with 750,000 people to a range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million new consumers for 2012. This includes growth of 1.1 million to 1.2 million people in fee-based commercial benefits due to the combination of strong retention and new business awards for both new and existing customers in the national account market. We have also received recent awards for a midyear 2012 implementations of state employer programs in Texas and Nebraska. ", "Full year risk-based commercial membership is tracking with our previous outlook in the down range of 100,000 to 200,000 for 2012. Including XLHealth, we foresee an increase of roughly 350,000 people in Medicare Advantage for 2012. Our 2 pending South Florida acquisitions would increase this further, both are locally prominent businesses with well-earned reputations for good management and fundamental local execution. And this is an important region for expansion, as South Florida continues to grow its senior population. These acquisitions strengthen our market presence there.", "We project our Medicare Supplement business will exceed the upper end of our prior outlook for the year. And as you know, in stand-alone Part D, the market bid [ph] well below UnitedHealthcare in many regions causing the decline of 615,000 people in the first quarter, more than we had originally projected, with most of it in the subsidized, low income market segment.", "Medicaid business growth remains fully on track for the year. We gained the largest share of membership in the first phase of Louisiana's new program this past quarter. We hope to continue to serve well as subsequent phases are introduced. And we recently were privileged to receive a new award in Ohio.  Again, we are increasing our overall outlook for 2012 medical benefits growth by more than 750,000 people across the full spectrum of our product offerings.", "UnitedHealthcare's first quarter margin of 8.1% was stronger than planned, as results benefited from favorable items that are not considered recurring in nature. They include $130 million in favorable true-ups to our 2011 commercial rebate reserves as we updated our estimates and complied with final federal and state regulatory guidance received during the quarter, as well as including favorable medical reserve development across all UnitedHealthcare business units. ", "Our next commercial premium yields are coming in consistent with our November outlook. Our commercial care ratio is now expected to be at the lower end of our original outlook and is affected by the first quarter's favorable items. We now expect the ratio of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points, for the full year.", "Based on first quarter data, there is no cost to change our forecast for commercial and medical cost trends this year of about 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Unit cost remain the primary driver of medical costs. Utilization trends remain moderate, with outpatient usage continuing to be the strongest utilization category and inpatient activity remaining restrained. ", "We continue to develop innovative programs to advance the quality and affordability of our products and improve our underlying cost structure, and UnitedHealthcare's operations performed well in the first quarter. The strong growth in customers and consumers across businesses was handled smoothly with positive responsiveness and strong customer service. Operating costs were well controlled. Overall, we're please with UnitedHealthcare's start for 2012.", "Optum, our health services business platform, is unique in the marketplace. Offering a depth and breadth of capabilities, which help modernize the health care system. Our enabling tools and services support health care providers, payers, employers, governments and consumers. We align these capabilities along 8 distinct markets, which we size at $500 billion in the aggregate, and our current share at only 6%. All of this we detailed for you at our November Investor Conference. ", "We see accelerating opportunity over the next several years as the market evolves from narrow, highly fragmented, single product purchase decisions to customers seeking larger, more integrated and comprehensive solutions. In such an environment, we believe Optum's capabilities will be increasingly differentiated. ", "Optum revenues of $7.3 billion in the quarter increased 8% year-over-year. Our integrated care delivery business was a significant contributor as it continues to develop and as we expand our footprint in this marketplace. This gain was partially offset by the sale of our clinical trials business late in the second quarter of last year. ", "In pharmacy management, we expanded the number of people served and saw a growth in specialty pharma and mail services. These offset the higher-than-expected decline in Part D volumes and revenues. Compliant services for hospitals and payment integrity services for payers were strong in the quarter. Technology offerings and related service revenues benefited from Optum's rising market profile and reputation. ", "Across our provider facing markets, our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions differentiate this. One much discussed example is the growing development of accountable care organizations, an opportunity we define more broadly than regulatory definition alone. As core fiscal and demographic pressures accelerate, the need for providers to connect and integrate, share data, deploy predictive technology and assume risk will also accelerate. This is an intersection of capabilities where Optum is exceptionally well positioned.", "In general, strong sales to health care providers and plan sponsors lifted sales bookings for technology and related service offerings 18% year-over-year. The OptumInsight contract backlog increased 25% to more than $4 billion, both as adjusted. We continue to project overall Optum revenues in the area of $30 billion for the year. ", "First quarter Optum earnings of $252 million were in line with our expectations. The 30 basis point margin decline and decrease of $27 million from the fourth quarter and $70 million year-over-year was primarily due to planned investments across our business infrastructure. Pharmacy services being one of these, and the decline in Part D volumes partially offset by incremental earnings contribution from newer businesses, such as integrated care delivery. ", "Across the entire Optum platform, we are adding significant capabilities as we prepare to take this enterprise to a new level of performance. And we anticipated these factors would impact our year-over-year comparisons for the first half.", "And as we shared with you at our Investor Conference, we're committed to more than doubling Optum's 2011 operating earnings by 2015. This requires a focused, clear and simple plan. And let us as give you a few of its key elements. Optum expects to drive roughly 1/2 of its earnings growth through 2015 by expanding revenues from key product groups across its 8 core markets. Those 8 markets serve as the foundation. They are less mature, less regulated than our health benefit businesses, and fully lend themselves to the application of our core capabilities in care management and delivery, data analytics and technology. ", "Examples of opportunities for Optum's growth include integrated care delivery, coordination of services for the frail elderly and serious chronic care needs under expanded state and federal programs, expansion in compliance services in a dynamic growing regulatory environment, pharmacy management awards from external clients, and broader development of outsourced technology and services for benefit plans and care providers.", "The second major component driving us towards 2015 target is the repatriation of all UnitedHealth Group pharmacy management services by the end of 2013. And finally, there will be a sizable contribution from the tighter integration of businesses, products and processes across Optum and stronger overall operating cost management. These opportunities lie in tightening alignment and performance around our 8 markets and related product sets with a more mature approach to larger and longer term customer relationships. ", "We will meaningfully reduce costs across all of Optum by leveraging Optum's enterprise resources and new leadership team. We'll focus spending more directly on improvements in service and further innovation. This requires the right personnel and the right roles, so we continue to move our best leaders to areas that play to their strongest skill set and bring in new talented executives where they can add value.", "We believe this plan will release meaningful growth and earnings in Optum by focusing resources on markets where we see a high probability of success, repatriating our pharmacy business, maturing and better integrating our products and businesses and simplifying our administrative structure. Optum is solidly on track with the plans we discussed last fall to deliver operating earnings in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for 2012. This is a moderate advance from 2011, while still shouldering significant incremental development expenses of well over $150 million in 2012.", "We are committed to distinctive earnings performance and capital returns. We previously characterized 2012 as a buildout year and we expect steady progress over the course of the year. We are confident in our commitment to achieve a doubling of the return on invested capital from the Optum platform by 2015, and indeed see the long-term opportunities for this business as significant and our market position as strong.", "To sum up, against the challenging environment, UnitedHealth Group had a strong first quarter characterized by growth across the enterprise, continued cost control, positive earnings and effective financing and capital use. Based on these early results, we now project revenues of $109 billion to $110 billion and net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 in 2012. This is a $0.17 plus increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. ", "Cash flows from operations will advance as well to a new range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. These projections are measured and prudent, an appropriate first quarter posture. They recognize growth momentum, while weighing significant pressure points on some of our businesses, including that revised reserve estimate benefited UnitedHealthcare's first quarter medical care ratio and operating earnings. Medicare Part D memberships in volumes are behind plan at this point, impacting both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. ", "The opportunity to provide services in 2013 to military families through TRICARE will require meaningful ramp-up expenses and capital. In-year growth in fee-based benefits and services is putting upward pressure on the operating cost ratio. Premium yields on risk-based products are constrained by government budgets in a tight but rationale competitive environment. We continue to expect a gradual rise in medical system utilization over the balance of the year. ", "Sequential second quarter earnings per share could run behind what we reported for first quarter 2012, more in line with the second quarter of last year. Continued investments in building our Optum businesses will keep its second quarter margins in check and UnitedHealthcare should perform at a more natural earnings run rate than it did this quarter. ", "As always, we are committed to delivering our best performance. We like our market position and growth prospects. We have the opportunity to shift -- to grow share at UnitedHealthcare, and we have the opportunity to advance Optum to a new performance level by better serving the broad needs of the participants in health care. Central to both are our core competencies, our commitments to quality, service and innovation and a collaborative, accountable high-performance culture that pulls it all together. ", "I will now turn this call back to our moderator for questions. I apologize that we never seem to get all of you in despite holding to one question per person. And again, thank you for joining us today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you guys go over a little bit more about trends and utilization in the quarter? I know you said it stayed -- you had no reason to come off your 6% guidance. But can you talk about specifics around some of the sub segments of utilization, inpatient doctors and then also, just if there'd be any regional differences or by product?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "This is Dan Schumacher. So I would be remiss if I didn't start the conversation with a reminder that our trend, the vast majority of our trend is driven by unit cost increases year in and year out on our commercial business. So with that said, I'll move to utilization. From a utilization perspective, we have incorporated in our outlook historically, as well as going forward, a progressive increase in utilization over the balance of the year. And we had incorporated a portion of that in the first quarter. And as we look at our first quarter results, they're tracking right in line with our expectations, which is to say that we saw a modest increase in utilization in the first quarter. As you look across both the platform as well as by categories, we saw that increase pretty consistently across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial. And then as you look at the categories, as Steve mentioned, outpatient is the place where we see most increase. And on the inpatient side, we actually continue to see that very restrained. Our hospital bed days are actually flat to down in each of our businesses across the platform.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "All of which is pretty consistent with what we've been seeing.", "Dan Schumacher", "Absolutely. And that's why our view on our trend for the full year remains unchanged. So we're still at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If I were to subtract out all of your favorable PPD in the quarter I get a higher loss ratio than you suggested in your guidance. So is that to say that maybe put back up a lot of that PPD in the quarter?", "Dan Schumacher", "I wouldn't read into that. Certainly, when we get to the end of each month and quarter, we are picking through our best estimates of ultimate reserve outcomes and ultimate medical expense, so we have no expectation of development forward. Certainly, the development we recorded in the first quarter influences our 2011 trend, which is a little bit better than what we were thinking when we closed out the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "To follow-up on the favorable reserve question. Can you break down how much of that came from each of your subsegments? And when you report the $530 million, does that include the loss ratio rebate impact in commercial -- for the commercial portion of it?", "Dan Schumacher", "Ana, this is Dan Schumacher again. First, I think, one important reminder is that when we're talking about development, that is measuring a change in our medical reserves, whereas our rebates are incorporated in premium. So development in and of itself is not influenced by rebates. Certainly, our rebates are influenced by our development. In terms of where we got development this quarter and where we saw it, we saw it broadly across all 3 of our business platforms, including commercial, Medicaid and Medicare.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. So I'm understanding $530 million, the rebates were accrued on the premium line item. Then the $130 million that you came in sounds like more favorably. Is that because you overestimated trends for the last year and so you over accrued? And can you just give us some color on that?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. On the true-up of our rebate accrual for 2011 in the first quarter, there are a host of factors that obviously influenced that. We're measuring it across 350 intersections. And so there are changes in estimates. But also importantly, there were changes to state and federal guidelines that it came down in the first quarter that influenced the rebate result for 2011.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And what specifically, if I might just finish up there on what the guideline changes were?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. On the federal side, it was with regard to how capitations would be treated. And on the state side, it was more around how the definition of small group would be, whether it went from 1 to 50 or 1 to 100.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Great. I guess, maybe just following up then on the rebate comments. Just want to understand a little bit better, when you guys -- obviously, when you accrue on the cost side of margin for a favorable development, do you have -- or, sorry, for adverse development, do you do a similar thing on the rebate side? Do you build in like a margin for favorable development that we might expect in Q1 to have generally a positive true-up there or is that more a specific line? I just want to understand how unusual this 130 is.", "Dan Schumacher", "Kevin, this is Dan again. It is -- that is the adverse margin deviation you're talking about. That's unique to medical. That's not something that relates to the rebate. And I would tell you that this is a unique item for this year. But I would say it is -- the rebates and the reserves are basically estimates. They are done based upon the performance of the book. And as a result, those estimates change like any accrual from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So it is just a normal factor. It does not have a structural element though, as you suggest as the adverse deviation would be.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Then one quick one. Is the cash flow guidance simply just the lower rebate payout in 2012? Is that why it's that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "No. I think there's a variety of factors. The cash flow guidance is really a result of the improved earnings performance of the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask you a question about duals. And as you evaluate and talk to states and look at the blanket of opportunities, could you give us a sense of how many situations do you think its going to be more of a direct to the incumbents process versus how many situations do you think you'll be actually able to show your frail elderly care capabilities through XL and INSPIRIS, et cetera, and actually compete for perhaps even a larger share?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think that's framed very well, it's a good question that we'll kind of go at it in 2 directions. So we'll start with UnitedHealthcare, but then I think Optum will also comment on the duals.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me frame that broadly because I think you asked the right question, which is who's -- how well are you positioned to compete in the duals market. And from our perspective, we think we're extremely well positioned because we have really strong franchises in both Medicare and Medicaid, and serve a number of the chronically ill populations already through our complex care. The XLHealth acquisition also offers us some very unique capabilities, the in-house calls and we're looking to deploy those more broadly. So we think that the combination of both our footprint in Medicaid at the state level working very closely with these populations, as well as the skills that we bring to Medicare, offer us those capabilities. And I know that the combination of what we're bringing from our Optum site as well. I'm going to ask Jack Larsen, who leads our Medicaid business, to give you some comments specifically about some of the state opportunities that we're looking at and then we'll ask Optum to share with you some of their capabilities as well.", "Jack Larsen", "Jeff Larsen. I guess I would say at some level, we are working with all of our 25 state partners. As you know, many of those states have posted the outlines of the demonstration plans seeking stakeholder comments. And then, ultimately, proposing it to CMS some time later this spring. I'd say where we are an incumbent Medicaid or incumbent Medicare dual slip plan sponsor. I think we're in very good shape. I think we bring the best of both of those worlds to bear for the benefit of the dual eligible population. So whether it goes to somebody who is not in the state or to an incumbent, I guess, I would say, as I look at our opportunities, I really like our position in most of our states. Let me ask Rick or I guess Larry to take a look at the services...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Larry, do you want to take duals from an Optum perspective?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Larry?", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure. I'm going to pass this to Rick Jelinek in a second. But I just wanted to make a comment on kind of the market and some of the things that we're seeing. We're being approached as, what I'll call an unregulated infrastructure services capability. And as we proceed down the road on this, there's a couple of organizations within Optum that Rick will talk about and how they kind of fit. But as Gail said, this we see as a very, very strong opportunity and we're pretty well positioned. Rick?", "Rick Jelinek", "Thanks, Larry and thanks for the question. This is Rick Jelinek. As you know, we are a very large service provider to dual populations today on both the Medicare and Medicaid side on behalf of UnitedHealthcare, but as well as on behalf of state customers and other payers. We're a provider of primary care services in physician offices, as well as in long-term care facilities for residents that are permanently placed in an institutional setting and dual eligible. We also provide a series of specialty services through our PBM, our behavioral health businesses and another network products like our transplant services business, which are also covering a large population at the dual eligible market. And maybe most importantly, we have a full range of care management and disease management programs for all levels of care that are done telephonically in the home setting through our organizations like INSPIRIS and within provider setting. We can deliver these programs at scale. We have excellent outcomes on the business and we're doing this today with, as I mentioned health plans and directly with states. So we feel we're well positioned across all of our UnitedHealth Group businesses. We think we have some very compelling integrated solution for the dual market.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So whether it's directly through a program through UnitedHealthcare or through enabling support through Optum, we will serve that population.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Thank you very much especially for the explanation of how United is intending to grow Optum. Unfortunately, I can't use my one question to ask about Optum. I need to ask a question about the commercial membership situation. I know that you did discuss this several times that you did expect there to be a contraction in the number of lives that you serve. But if you could, I'd like to understand this because given all of the improvements that you appear to be making in affordability, simplicity and the appeal of the products, the service of products, it seems a little bit contradictory, as it were, that you would be losing lives on the risk-based products. So can you just walk me through what the situation is there and what the opportunity is to turn that around going forward?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Why don't we start with Gail and then Jeff Alter can respond.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux. So first, our overall growth was very robust as you saw in the commercial market space. We grew 575,000 total lives and had very, very strong fee-based growth. So we're really pleased with that. As you look at the risk-based growth, we knew that was going to happen. And let me sort of walk you through the pieces of it. We lost 190,000 lives in the quarter, but that was really driven by a couple of large public sector conversion accounts and one large public sector loss. If you look underneath the membership for the quarter in risk-based, we actually had a robust small business group, growth in small business rather, which we think is a strong indicator of the value-based products we put in the marketplace. And we would expect to see improvement over the year, given our guidance of 100,000 to 200,000 loss, which is our expectation. So the big driver for the loss was really the conversions in the large public sector accounts that occurred in January. And then maybe I'll ask Jeff to comment on just out of the products that we're putting in the marketplace and your view of the state uptick in that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Sheryl, it's Jeff Alter. Just to add to Gail's statement, the kind of the overall top level is a little bit deceiving as to kind of the fundamental growth that's going on in our marketplace underneath -- on the fully insured business. We're seeing some very nice uptake on some of our more value-based products now or in network, some with gatekeepers. So we're actually very pleased in the performance of our new products, as well as our overall fully insured block of business.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And I would just add, that's a very competitive sector of the marketplace. We are committed to holding on to pricing disciplines. And I think that's clearly a factor in that small group risk-based category.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "How do you think of the risk reward of bidding in state insurance exchanges as opposed to offering a similarly structured and priced product outside of the exchange? And where are you in the process of establishing this product that would mirror the low-cost exchange option in key markets with respect to development and understanding the margin that, that product may have?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, that one could take the balance of the morning. But I will start with UnitedHealthcare in terms of kind of the technical side of your question. And then, perhaps, a perspective from Optum as well. So want to start with this?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me frame your question first broadly, because I think you have a couple of different things embedded in your question. The first around the positioning on the public exchanges. One, we're in the process of -- we're actually engaged with the states and we are taking all the necessary steps inside of our organization to prepare. As we look at that, all the guidance is not out, so we haven't made our final determination. But as you think about the preparations that we're making around value-based products, network configurations, clinical engagement, all of those things we are putting in the marketplace now. And we have many of our members already, cost and effectiveness of those products is already in place. So to answer your question, we're looking at that market now and we're preparing for the public exchange. On the private exchange side, we believe that cost and quality will be important, consumer engagement will be important and effective clinical models. So those 3 components. And we've got products in our market today that we are in the process of introducing and have begun that process.", "Larry C. Renfro", "This is Larry Renfro. From the Optum side, again, it's kind of like the duals. Optum is positioned as what I'll call an unregulated infrastructure with a lot of services and capability. And I think the way that you could think about it is that we can enable as open architecture. Meaning that, if you're familiar with, and most people would be familiar with 401(k) plans and how 401(k) plans kind of have open architecture with investment products, the way Optum is structuring its technology is to have that type of open environment for different health plans and so fourth. So we actually do that with a private exchange today, and we believe those capabilities are going to play well in the future.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So Mike, the discussion on duals, direct participation through UnitedHealthcare and enabling participation through Optum.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I want to revisit a question I asked last quarter because I think we crossed wires. And ask maybe a little bit more clearly. Could you talk about how you are steering to various providers? How you're lowering overall cost and where you are? What inning are you in and what mechanisms are you using to steer utilization to the lower overall cost providers?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I might frame it from the perspective of how are we incenting the marketplace to use the best resources, and those resources to perform at their best levels. So I think that's more in the United health care domain and maybe start with Gail and Jeff.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Christine, let me try to frame your answer at a couple of different levels and hopefully get to the specifics that you're looking for. As we think about this, the value comes from really a combination of a couple of levers. The first is network configuration, which you just mentioned. But importantly is plan design and how we engage consumers and care and cost decisions. And the third is clinical engagement. So we build the products, we're looking for essentially a 10% to 15% price differential. Specific to your question around network configuration. The difficulty in answering it broadly is it does vary market to market and based on how the delivery system is configured and structured. But to put an example on that, when you look at our premium designation network, which we've had in place now for over 6 years. It includes 21 specialties, 145 markets. Roughly, when you look at physicians who practice at a quality and efficiency around evidence-based medicine in the 75th percentile. Roughly 50% of the doctors qualify in those specialties to be in the premium designation network. And of those doctors who qualify, their cost are about 19% less than their peers in those markets. So that gives you a perspective of the kind of scale we're talking about. And importantly, within those markets, we're also looking for an improvement in quality. So knee surgery would be a great example. Those premium designated doctors have about 60% lower complication rate, which drive the lower cost profile. The same thing with spine fusion, roughly a 42% lower complication rate for our premium designated doctors driving a much lower cost profile. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of the kind of dynamics that we can drive in the marketplace.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And what inning do you think you're in? Is this a note [ph] a constant process?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "It's an evolving process. And I would say we're in the early innings because we've had the premium designation network for roughly 6 years, so that's very mature. But now we're moving up this continuum of more pay per performance against the last -- we've quoted a number of roughly 15% of our in-network spend is in these type of arrangements. We're looking to significantly increase that number over the next few years. So I would say early inning, there's a lot of improvement in data and technology. But over the next several years, that's going to dramatically improve because products are being built around this and the networks are being configured that way.", "Jeff Alter", "Christine, it's Jeff Alter. One of the other areas -- we've done a really nice job starting with the premium designation program, creating products around premium designation. And then just as of April 1, we just released our next-generation consumer tool called My Health Care Cost Estimator. We really think this is the next inning, if we want to continue the baseball analogy. This tool allows our members to be better consumers of health care. It gives them a health care shopping experience that allows the member to compare prices and quality for physicians. And since it's released, we've gotten very positive feedback from our clients and the people that we serve. Mainly because it's a really highly functioning tool that delivers the information in a simple, very personal way. And it's a experience that goes beyond just a web tool. It's integrated with our customer service model. Our treatment decision support models and any questions that the members might have around that. And it really is a first-generation release, the game changer, what we think is going to be really revolutionary will happen some time in the midsummer where that data will be actual contacted reimbursement rates. Therefore, that level of pricing accuracy that the member will experience as they shop for health care, as they do other products is really going to change. We think that's -- this could be a good game changer for the second half of the game.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Christine, I also wanted to clarify one thing in terms of the 50% of our network spend is in pay per performance modality. So I just want to make sure that was clear because I know I was talking about premium designation as well.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And I'll just summarize by saying, basically, what you heard is an alignment that's really, never really happened before. An alignment between how products are designed, how our consumer engagement tools are designed to work with those products, also designed to work with our clinical programs and how those clinical programs are designed to work with our high-performance networks. And that alignment and the enablement across of it has never really, I don't think has ever gotten to these levels before so -- and we think this is very early.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Interested if you can help spike out when you think about the 1.1 million to 1.2 million fee-based member adds. How that's breaking out between large public sector client wins versus employers? And then maybe talk about some of the key factors that are driving your share gains in the public sector market, particularly against the nonprofit blues?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We'll respond to that. I don't think we'd respond specifically to competitors. We'll just talk about the market in general.", "Jeff Alter", "Scott, it's Jeff Alter. The majority of our growth in the first quarter happened in employer based, traditional commercial. Some of the increase in our outlook for the future is the big wins in Texas and Nebraska. So to sum up both sides of that growth, I would say that our value proposition, the network economics that we drive. But more importantly, the recognition that some of the tools that we spoke about, our product design, some of our network configuration designs really are beginning to take hold and to be noticed as different than everyone else. And that's -- that has powered our momentum to date and continues to change our outlook for the future for growth particularly in public sector and some of the larger commercial clients.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And how much runway do you think you still have on the public sector? Do you have an estimate of what your share of those commercial, large public sector clients is right now?", "Jeff Alter", "I don't have specifics. But there are still a number of large states that are not our clients that we would hope that our success in our existing state relationships and the 2 new ones coming up this year will open eyes in other states as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'll try and ask a quick one. I guess I was just surprised not to hear about the favorable weather, I guess for you, unfavorable weather, as well as the impact of leap year. So just curious if that had any impact in the first quarter as it relates to medical cost trend and/or your MLRs?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, if you'd like to hear about that, we've got the right guy for you, Dan.", "Dan Schumacher", "So last year, obviously, we had a bunch of inclement weather. This year, we've got a little better flu. Those 2 things are about a wash across the entire platform. And certainly, the extra day in the first quarter of this year is adding to our medical expense in the first quarter this year as compared to last. And those I think are the components.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "But when you talk about your 6% frame. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out is that an apples-to-apples sort of a PMPM base trend? Or is that inclusive of the fact that you had additional services because there was an extra day?", "Dan Schumacher", "Our trend is on a full year basis, obviously. And it is at the core a PMPM comparison, per member per month comparison. And so it would incorporate the extra day. And then as you look at the composition of those days over the balance of the year, there's some ins and outs and washes. It gets muted over the full year.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So it's only say like a 30 basis point impact for the whole year. But apples-to-apples, your trend would be lower without this leap year? Your MLR would be lower without it, right?", "Dan Schumacher", "True.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "My question is related to medical trend and maybe to continue from Christine's question. Just when you step back and look at the overall secular trend and how much below that secular trend we are right now. I want to understand how much of that is cyclical factors versus structural factors? And Steve, you outlined several of the structural changes that you're driving as a company. So maybe you can answer this in 2 ways. One, how do you measure this pace of structural change? What's on your dashboard for number of ACOs, percent of physicians and known group, things that you really monitored to measure that pace of change. And then, b, how much are you bending the trend as a company versus what is simply cyclical weakness in medical trend?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Maybe I'll start this and then hand it off. But I would say, you ask a difficult question, it basically go through the flow of the medical cost trends and be able to parse it as cleanly as your question might suggest. We would love to be able to do that. I think it's -- that is -- that would be quite a challenge. I would say the things that we do measure are things like how much of our total spend is going towards performance and the continued upward trend of the amount of spend that is based upon performance-based metrics, et cetera. We measure things like a basic utilization measures. And we know, from our health care affordability program, that we are getting traction on those and those are fundamental improvements. I think it is very difficult to measure the impact the consumers are having on this by how they are using products and the influence they're having. It is interesting to observe how consumers behave when you put these tools in their hands and put the right kind of incentives in place. I'd also say it's equally interesting to observe how providers respond when these transparency tools go forward and they begin to measure themselves against others who are providing services in their market, et cetera. We'd love to be able to take those kinds of inputs and parse them neatly. But we -- I'm sure we can build a model, but it would be just that. And do you have anything to add to that? It is a great question and it is clearly something we have models on, spend energy on. We do think these elements are all having an impact on it. Can we offer, particularly in the economic background in which we're operating in, that this is a structural rebase lining of medical cost trends? We don't have a basis for that at this point in time. And I think you can see from the guidance that we provide that we are watchful and very respectful of medical cost trends and the more moderate utilization realities that we have been seeing. So I think that's a best answer we can probably give you at the moment. That's a very good question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just 2 maintenance-oriented questions here. Obviously, you bought in $1 billion of stock in the first quarter. Is your guidance for the year still $2.5 billion to $3 billion? Or given the first quarter number, is the run rate tracking a little higher in terms of your internal models? And then secondarily, can you give us a sense for the TRICARE startup headwind?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dave?", "David S. Wichmann", "Chris, this is Dave Wichmann. We have not changed our guidance with respect to how much share repurchase. We're still estimating somewhere in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We did repurchase about 18.5 million shares for total cost of about $990 million in the first quarter. So we would look to expend the balance of that range over the course of the last 3 quarters of this year.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. And in terms of TRICARE, we are obviously tooling up for that. We've got maybe in the zone of $60 million of costs related to TRICARE preparation between ramping up operationally, as well as some capital investments that have to be made.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And that $60 million, is that in -- was any of that spent in the first quarter?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Not in the first quarter, but it's in our outlook.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Hemsley for any closing remarks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you. So in closing, I'd like to quickly summarize what we have said today. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum are on track in meeting our expectations. We are seeing steady growth across the enterprise in virtually every business segment. The breadth of that growth reflects the diversity of our businesses, how they work together to complement and support each other and the enduring value of our competencies and technology information and care coordination. We're increasing our outlook for 2012 net earnings and membership and cash flows. We remain committed to further improving. ", "Thank you for joining us today, and that concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated July 19, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our second quarter and first half 2012 results and discuss the near-term outlook for our businesses.", "In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned, $1.27 per share, an advance of 9% year-over-year, on revenues of more than $27 billion, which increased by 8% year-over-year. Our consolidated medical care ratio of 81.3% reflect strong performance on medical cost results that were slightly better than expected, primarily due to favorable reserve development. The operating cost ratio of 15% reflects continuing growth in services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and the investments we are making to advance our Optum businesses, particularly pharmacy services. Efficiencies from our multiyear operational improvement efforts partially offset this cost growth. Adjusted cash flows of $2 billion brought first half 2012 adjusted cash flows to $3 billion, up $650 million year-over-year. Our financial flexibility continues to be distinctive. In the first half of this year, we grew our dividend payment rate by 31%, extended our share repurchase activities, closed 3 acquisitions in Medicare and still maintained a debt-to-total capital ratio of 30% and $1 billion in available cash. Annualized return on equities for the first half of 2012 was 19%.", "Let's review our business results, starting with UnitedHealthcare, which continues to sharpen its innovative focus toward greater simplicity, quality, affordability and consumer value. UnitedHealthcare provided medical benefits to nearly 36 million people at June 30, an expansion of 1.7 million year-over-year and an increase of 305,000 in the quarter. Second quarter revenues increased 8% to $25.5 billion, and the outlook for new business remains strong.", "Looking forward, recent successes include affirmation by the government of our mid-2013 TRICARE award for military benefits to serve nearly 3 million military personnel and family members, the Kansas and Ohio awards for Medicaid benefits and the selection of UnitedHealthcare by Texas and Nebraska to provide health benefits to their employee. These awards, unless publicized engagements we're winning day in and day out, reflect our commitment to serve, to execute and to innovate.", "Breaking down second quarter results, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual year-to-date growth stands at 550,000 consumers served, which reflects a decrease of 25,000 people in the second quarter, as we expected. Favorable cost trends and overall client satisfaction remain key positives. Our service reputation remains strong, customer retention is high and response in our newer, more innovative products and technologies continues to grow.", "The values \u2013 the value of our network \u2013 our networks deliver in care quality and cost containment is high, but we are seeing an ongoing shift in market priorities. Large sophisticated buyers are placing their business based upon well-aligned consumer and care provider engagement, aligned to effective clinical management capabilities. Collectively, these elements have positioned us to continue to add value and grow our self-funded business into 2013.", "For the risk-based market segment, the competitive climate continues to be aggressive but rational. This remains consistent with what we have been seeing for more than 1 year. Some pricing we see in select regional markets seems to reflect the assumption of ongoing lower medical trends, while some pricing strategies seem to be simply based on the avoidance of any rebates under minimum MLR provisions. We expect this market to continue to be highly competitive into 2013. We will hold fast to our disciplines and accordingly expect continued pressure on our risk-based product membership. We believe customers and our company are better served by consistent and predictable pricing supported by our realistic view of forward cost trends.", "In Medicaid, UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to grow steadily, adding 210,000 people served this quarter and a total of 275,000 people year-to-date. New implementations and new awards in 2012 include Louisiana, Texas, Washington State and Kansas. In Ohio, we received awards for both the traditional Medicaid population and for duly eligible residents. We now serve Medicaid programs in about half the states in the U.S. This includes services such as behavioral health care and pharmacy benefits, which they customers increasingly seek to integrate into their Medicaid offerings. Service to the duly eligible and integrated benefit offerings both play to UnitedHealthcare's historical experience and strength.", "As with our commercial benefits, UnitedHealthcare Community & State remains disciplined in ensuring we achieve an appropriate return on the capital we have invested. We continue to take a prudent market sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing relationships. We remain committed to partner with states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. But we will withdraw from programs within states or change the nature of our service to those programs as needed in instances where we see that commitment to viability weaken.", "UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement completed 2 acquisitions in Florida and also have the strongest organic growth this quarter among all participants in the Medicare Advantage market, based on CMS data. Our growth demonstrates the value for consumers of our Medicare Advantage plans, which includes our focus on benefits popular with seniors and their positive experience receiving well-coordinated care from a strong network of local physicians. In total, we increased our Medicare Advantage participation by 85,000 seniors this quarter and are serving 340,000 more seniors through the first half of 2012.", "Our filed 2013 benefits again offer market competitive plans and focus on the benefits that seniors tell us they value most. We anticipate continued steady growth next year as well because of the ongoing entrance into Medicare of millions of seniors, our expanding market presence and the consistently high consumer value our programs offer. Overall, we expect to UnitedHealthcare will serve between 1.8 million and 2 million more consumers this year, making 2012 among the strongest and most diversified membership growth years UnitedHealthcare has ever experienced.", "Turning to margins and medical costs UnitedHealthcare's second quarter operating margin of 7.5% remained in line year-over-year. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio in 2012 to be in the range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. This is an improvement to our outlook from last November and is based on results from the past 6 months, including reserve development realized to date. We forecast our commercial Medicare care ratio for 2012 to come in toward the lower end of the range we most recently provided, which was 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. And we continue to forecast commercial, medical cost trends this year at about 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Unit cost increases remain a primary driver. Utilization continues to increase modestly. Outpatient usage continues to rise, with increases across all markets, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid, all consistent with our last quarter. This is more reflective of an increased number of patient visits and procedures than the more intensive services on a per visit basis. Some of this increase volume results from our efforts to encourage more appropriate use of health system resources, with patients receiving service on an outpatient basis rather than via full inpatient admissions. Use of physician services is generally stable, and inpatient activity remains restraint.", "UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy costs are again showing the benefits of our intensive management. We will improve upon these approaches still further as we engage OptumRx to administer our commercial offerings and pharmacy programs.", "While we're executing well, we remain cautious because pressures on the benefits market remain significant and continue to build. The commercial sector is competitive. Job creation and new business formation are weak, which impacts growth. Great pressures in government programs are intensifying, and rates in some Medicaid venues are even slightly negative. Unlike prior years, these current Medicaid rate reductions are generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or provider fee schedule reductions. We have discussed the funding challenges faced by state programs a number of times and are now more clearly seeing the predictive effects of those pressures in the marketplace.", "In the senior market, Medicare Advantage rate increases have been minimum -- minimal for 3 years or more. Changes to quality Star definitions that were made after the measurement period was completed will adversely impact rates for many Medicare Advantage market participants for 2013. This backdrop suggests year-over-year gross margin pressure in the back half of 2012 and into 2013 in health care benefits. In this environment, UnitedHealthcare will focus on using new product offerings aligned to more modern consumer engagement techniques and effectively engage our focused clinical programs and high-performance networks to achieve growth with fair margins and capital return. We are also intensely focused on reducing operating costs, becoming leaner, more streamlined and ever closer to the customer.", "Turning to health services. Optum produced revenues of $7.3 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% over last year. The OptumHealth and OptumInsight businesses posted 21% and 16% top line gains, respectively, with the latter adjusted for divested businesses in 2011. Growth drivers included expansion in integrated care delivery and continued growth in compliance services and clinical and operational performance tools.", "Our technology and related services offerings continued to show strong market acceptance, with the Optum revenue backlogs again growing more than 20% over last year. This growth was led by strengthened data and information infrastructure solutions for government customers, compliant services for hospitals and performance tools for payers. Future revenues will also benefit from the integration of services in the new Medicaid award in Kansas.", "In the pharmacy services, we are implementing some recent large customer awards, which will modestly benefit second half 2012 revenues, and we continued steadily growth of specialty drug and mail services. But these impacts are more than offset by the decline in Part D volumes that began in January of this year.", "Optum's mission is to make the health care system work better for everyone. We leverage enterprise-level capabilities to drive more positive outcomes, reduce costs and simplify and improve the health care experience for all participants across the system. We size our addressable market at 500 billion and steadily growing. As a business, we're continuing to create what we call One Optum, evolving Optum into a more integrated enterprise, intensely focused on customer needs across the 8 distinct markets we serve. The businesses are lining to deliver the more comprehensive and sophisticated and sustaining solutions customers require in an increasingly complex and changing health care environment, solutions that bring greater and more consistent quality, speed, efficiency and lower cost.", "Our One Optum efforts are creating a progressively flatter, more integrated organization that is simpler and leaner, more understandable and more responsive to customers. Our Optum cost structure is also becoming leaner, and we're better leveraging the scale of the enterprise. We are strengthening and more tightly aligning shared services and operational support and administration, and removing redundancies that are the historical result of organizing smaller businesses around specific products. When combined with this flatter, simpler organizational approach, tighter alignment enables in an evolution from a product-oriented enterprise to one focused on more integrated customer solutions. This opens up opportunities to serve larger, more comprehensive and longer-term relationships established with customers at more senior executive levels.", "Optum's second quarter operating earnings of $320 million were in line with our expectation and improved $68 million sequentially. We accelerated certain investments this quarter to move faster on integration and better position Optum for future growth. With our first half performance, Optum is on track to deliver full year operating earnings consistent with our projections. Second half earnings will benefit from the improved leverage from our One Optum efforts and seasonably favorable revenue trends in a number of our businesses that are driven by year-end business dynamics. We continue to see operating earnings of between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which is modestly above 2011. This despite absorbing incremental development expenses of more than $150 million in 2012. We expect to further build on that performance into 2013 and remain on path to doubling Optum's 2011 earnings by 2015, driven through organic growth, operational efficiencies and PBM in-sourcing.", "To sum up, in a challenging environment, UnitedHealth Group's strong second quarter and first half performance were characterized by broad-based growth, strong service and execution for clients, continued innovation in products and services, solid margins and positive earnings and cash flows. We want to thank our 100,000 employees for their compassion and their commitment to the people we serve. Every day, they're working intensively to deliver dependable consistent service, innovating and building the capabilities of the future. And their capacities to adapt quickly to changing markets remains critical to our future.", "As always, we have concerns about today's challenging environment in the health benefits market. These are not new. There continues to be more downward than upward pressure across the health care landscape. We expect this environment to prevail for some time due to the employment malaise and imminent regulatory changes. State budgets are clearly constrained for Medicaid. Medicare funding is similarly pressured. Deficits leave policymakers with little room to address long-standing funding issues.", "Long before expansion markets, such as exchanges, due eligibles and broader state Medicaid expansions, are fully established and productive, industry regulations and taxes will be imposed and realized. Our diversified position is a strength as we work to address these headwinds, but we have respect for the challenges ahead and believe market expectations should remain in check and aligned to these realities.", "Based on our results so far, we have increased our 2012 outlook for revenues to $110 billion and earnings to a range of $4.90 to $5 per share. First half earnings benefited from reserve development, as well as the first quarter rebate adjustments, while second half results will include TRICARE startup costs.", "While we always endeavor to perform to our full potential, we expect earnings per share in the second half to be slightly lower than the first. Longer term, we expect significant market expansion and see opportunities for market share growth. Consumers and benefit sponsors want more for less. At the most basic level, they want higher quality care at a more affordable cost. Consumers have demanded and received more for less in virtually every other segment of our economy, and health care will not be immune. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions. The private sector provides a more flexible and open, better managed, higher-quality health care experience than traditional passive indemnity programs built solely on leveraging fee-for-service.", "The commercial market has been consolidating for some time, and that trend will continue. To capitalize on the opportunities of the future on a national or even multi-market basis, it will be essential to invest in and create leading innovative capabilities and competitive operating cost structures. These have been underlying themes in our businesses for some time.", "On the Optum side, the market for health services is just beginning to ripen. Optum is an early-stage enterprise relative to the scale of what we believe will ultimately develop in this sector.", "We look forward to providing you with a full view of our 2013 aspirations and expectations at our annual investor conference, which will be held in New York City on Tuesday, November 27.", "I will now turn this call back to our moderator for questions. And again, thank you for joining us today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I was looking, Steve, to get a perspective from you on the consolidation that's ongoing in the government segments and particularly the large transaction that WellPoint and Amerigroup conducted recently. And can you tell us what your thoughts are on strategic alliances versus consolidating more regional players sort of in a more of a national sort of broader-based M&A play?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure, Ana. Obviously, we won't comment on specific transactions. But I think I kind of hit it in the end of my formal comments. And that is the demands in the marketplace broadly, whether they\u2019re in the commercial side or the government side, are just continuing to increase, become more sophisticated, more complex. And the responses to them, we think, deserve a very focused response and need to be scaled. So we've kind of taken those philosophies in our own business for many years, and have focus our responses to those kinds of markets with dedicated business units and has sought to expand them and grow them and build their capabilities. So it is not surprising to see that kind of activity we have said that will be coming, and it really has been happening for probably 15 years or more. So we, as I said in my final comments, we expect that to continue. Now in some respects, we've accomplished those things, both through relationships in the marketplaces and alliances. And in some instances, we have chosen to invest. I think you're going to see both those kinds of responses in the marketplace. And I think both of them can work depending upon the specific market that you're dealing in.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then a follow-up on that. So the excess cash flow that you have, if you could provide some perspective on the priorities on health benefits relative to health services and on the benefits side, commercial versus government, then on buybacks and potentially, future increases in dividends?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. So again, our financial position remains strong. Our cash generation capacities remain strong. That's really no change from the past. So our approach with respect to capital allocation hasn't changed. Since it relates to expansion activities, we are interested in continuing to build on -- across our business broadly. We look at it, not just in market segments also, but in the cultivation of capabilities. So basically, all the above is my, I'm sure, unsatisfactory answer to you because we're really interested in building and see opportunities to build in virtually every one of our business areas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.", "Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, a question on Medicare Advantage. Steve, I think you mentioned steady growth expectations as we've seen in prior years, but that continuing to 2013. But you followed that up with a comment about, we've seen rate increases kind of at a minimum for the last few years and that perhaps is going to lead to some margin pressure second half this year, maybe in the first half of next year. Just maybe pull those 2 comments together. Does that suggest perhaps a more aggressive strategy to grow market share? Maybe spending a bit of margin here now to perhaps accelerate Medicare Advantage growth over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll kind of comment broadly, and then let Gail and maybe Tom respond. But I would say one is, that environment really isn't any different than the one we've been having for the last 3 years, probably at least. And we really align to philosophies around steadiness of managing our benefits and being consistent in the marketplace, and we have historically tried to lean towards the benefits that seniors in specific marketplaces seem to respond to most effectively. I don't think things like that broadly are changing. We're really just outlining an environment that has prevailed and looks like it is not going to change any time soon. You want to add?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Yes. It's Gail Boudreaux. A few comments just build on Steve's. We have, as you know, been dealing with the rate environment in Medicare for a number of years, and our focus is on the sustainability of the benefits and the program for consumers. We work hard around affordability, how we work with physicians and hospitals to ensure that we've got the right programs underneath that, as well as improving our overall quality. So from that perspective, we've had that strategy for the last few years and we're going to continue to stay focused on that. We think that's really important to the Medicare program overall and think it can provide good value. The second issue, on growth. We're pleased with our growth. We've had, as you heard in Steve's opening comment, very strong growth in the SEP part of enrollment, as well as a strong opening to the year in AEP, so pleased with the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and in the markets that we're growing. And as you saw this quarter, we also added several acquisitions, which we think helps strengthen our position in markets, as well as capabilities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the Medicaid comments that you made. Do you think we're close to the point where we'll start to see, again, some Medicaid Managed Care participants begin to pull out of the market in order to rebalance the relationship between state governments and the private sector?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll start this and let Gail and Jack mop this up. But this -- that response obviously varies market by market. And the posture that states take vary market by market. But the answer to that is yes, that if we see situations that we believe the state isn't prepared to sustain in a particular market, we will withdraw, or as I said in my formal comments, withdraw or reposition the programs. And I think that, that discipline has to prevail just like it prevails in other parts of our business. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Thanks, Steve. Mike, just maybe echo a part of Steve's comments. A successful program between the private sector and any particular state really rests on 2 things. It really rests on a partnership going both ways, and I use partnership in the fullest sense of the word, and then really mutually satisfactory economics. And if one or both of those are missing, then I think we're not doing a service to a state and they're certainly not being well served by us if we continue to sort of slug along in a relationship that isn't really working ultimately for the Medicaid beneficiary.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "First of all, I just wanted to clarify something. Nothing in your comments should suggest, with respect to Medicaid or any of your other businesses, that you're willing to break price discipline, even if your margin might be a bit lower year-over-year. Is that correct?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We are not breaking pricing disciplines across any of our business platforms at all on the health benefits side or on the Optum side.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to hear you say that because there was an element to that question which almost made it sound like that was the question.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "No, actually, I think we answered that one that we will take the steps necessary if the economics aren't sustainable.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Yes, you did. And my real question is this. I'm fascinated by the notion of One Optum. It appeals on so many different levels, from the good business sense to the market opportunity. And I'm curious about what trends or factors you might have seen in the market that tell you that now is the appropriate time to respond in that way and/or to lead the customer, whether there's been perhaps growth in the sophistication that at a pace that maybe is a little bit more accelerated that it might have been a year ago, whether there are fundamental changes going on in the market that -- and I'm just -- I guess, I'm sorry for a lack of specificity around the question because it's -- what I'm trying to get at here is there's an issue of United leading too quickly where the market can't go. And so this is a major change. It's a different approach. I think it's the right approach. And I'm curious as to why you think that now is the right time to do this and what types of things you might be able to accomplish by having a more integrated product in transforming some of these relationships and ultimately the way we pay for and deliver care.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sheryl, I think it's an excellent observation and question. I think I'll have Larry respond. But I would offer a few themes in the onset. As we formulated Optum, brought it under a single brand, aligned the businesses, kind of base bind [ph] them last year, this was basically that market need we saw at that time. So we are really just continuing to execute along those same themes. And the One Optum is a good title in essence, that is code across our enterprise for the acceleration of that -- of those integration themes across our business. And these have been well laid out. And Larry can really run with those.", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure. It's Larry. I think with Steve's comment, as well as Steve's earlier comments when he opened up, I think you kind of know where we're headed in terms of One Optum. So let me back up for one second. We decided based on goals that we set that we were trying to go to the 15% ROIC and 6% margin by 2015, which is basically doubling our 2011 earnings, that we needed to put together a very strong and focused business plan, 3-year plan. And in putting together that 3-year plan, we are seeing the amount of attention, traction, however you want to look at it, that we're receiving from our 8 markets that we're focused on. And as a result of that, we're looking at how we're going to hit those numbers from a performance standpoint. And as we've been getting into this with our potential customers and so forth, we believe that about 50% of that will come from growth and 50% will come from what I'll call cost management, integration, alignment and the PBM in-sourcing. So if you kind of take a look at where we're at today, in 2012, we're feeling pretty good that we're in line with expectations. And when we get to, what I think one of the questions you were asking is about the markets and growth and so forth, we're seeing that we're in large markets that are getting larger, and then we believe that we're starting to really be able to learn a lot. And we're going to be expanding as we go forward.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think the market is postured for longer-term relationships that they're pursuing a broader set of aligned services and seeing the need for that. They are building capabilities and we are building ourselves into them as part of that, and they are clearly buying -- their buying behaviors are moving towards longer-term, more sustainable integrated. And the point I was making before is that probably existed 1 year, 1.5 year. So we are urgent about getting Optum, this One Optum agenda moving forward because we think the market is already there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments about pricing into next year. I mean, you broadly indicated that the environment was I think aggressive but rational. But the comments around pricing that appears to -- your competitors appear to be assuming that continuation of low utilization maybe runs counter to how we think about what's rational, and certainly, my impression of what we were seeing in the last few years. And then, obviously, your comments about expecting to lose membership implies that you don't see your competitors as entirely rational. Maybe you can just flesh out some of what you're seeing there. And then also provide some color on markets, in particular, where you feel like things are maybe more competitive?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. So really this is around the definition of rational, right?", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So Gail, do you want to take a shot?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Consistent with the comments we've made over the last several quarters, we expected the market to get more competitive, and that's what we're seeing. So, let's say we're not seeing any change in that. We talk about rational. Our competitors are making decisions based on their rebate positions, their view of minimum medical loss ratios, their view of future trend. And yes, as we said, I think in the last couple of calls, there are certain pockets where they're making those decisions, but overall we do see it as rational. When we talked to -- gave you our guidance last year and what we said in the last several quarters is that, consistent with that competitive environment, we are seeing some pressure on our enrollment. You saw that this quarter and you've seen it this year. So I think that's how it ties to it. We've been very consistent and disciplined in our pricing, and that's creating some of that pressure, but we're going to stay the course on that. And we're looking at pricing to our future view of trending costs.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then maybe just to kind of follow up on that into a different product. You mentioned that you expected some rate pressure on the Medicaid side. Obviously, you've seen a lot of RFPs. And how much of what you're seeing -- I think certainly some of your competitors have seen some disruption in states. How much of that disruption is a function of what the states are asking for because of their budget pressures or because of the competitive environment, as far as the bidding process goes among your peers, has gotten more competitive and kind of forced people to go to a spectrum they shouldn't be?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll let Jack answer that. But I think the budget issues are the prevailing.", "Jack Larsen", "Yes, I would agree. Jack Larsen. So you opened your comments referring to some of the disruptions that some of our competitors had \u2013- really, it\u2019s tough for us to comment on those particular disruptions. We don't actually participate in those programs that have gotten some of the more recent focus. I would say, overall, price rates are being pressured probably more so by state budget positions this year and then going into next year. We certainly expect a fair amount of competitive give and take on new states. I think we priced very thoughtfully on our new wins in Kansas, most recently in Ohio. But I would say, overall, it is just the continuing pressure on states trying to make more go farther than they have before.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think you can really see it aligned to the budget status of the state.", "Jack Larsen", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That's where you're going to have your problem.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups. First on the commercial pricing environment and your kind of outlook for that segment. I was hoping maybe you could just give us some perspective on this market from a pricing -- on the pricing side, just in terms of the pricing environment today is rationally aggressive. It's a term we've heard a lot over the years. Can you maybe compare it to what we think of as the last pricing cycle that we saw, let's call it 2006 through 2008? Maybe you can just give us some perspective there on how that looked. And then, on the commercial cost trends, can you talk us through your cost trends by the 4 segments? And given you've lowered your commercial or at least took your commercial MLR targets at the lower end of the guidance, does that mean that cost trends also coming in towards the lower end there, especially given pricing doesn't seem to be all that great?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think with the opening qualifier that the market circumstances and situation of a time is unique to its time. So you really can't say, \"Oh, this is 2000x or 19-something or other.\" So I think putting that aside, I think we can offer some comments on that. Gail?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Justin, your question is comparing it to prior cycles. I would look at that the environment is fundamentally different. We're in a different regulatory environment with minimal medical loss ratios. We didn't have that the last few years. And quite frankly, the utilization we\u2019re coming out of. So I don't see it necessarily as comparable to those cycles. Plus, as Steve said in his opening comments, we remained, I think, very respectful of the pressures, underlying pressures around unit costs and increasing utilization over time. And then the impact of reform provisions as we go through 2013 and 2014. So from that perspective, we see people making decisions based on their view of minimum MLR rate regulation, et cetera. So that's why, we're characterizing this and see it as a rational market. A competitive one but rational. And I guess, I'll ask Dan to comment on your questions around utilization.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "On a market-by-market, if we would really analyze each market, the activities are not -- are understandable, right?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Right. Each market has different pressures facing it based on the dynamics of the competitors that are in that market and the products that they have. And we've also managed our business very much on a market-to-market basis, looking at both national trends, but also putting products in those markets that make sense where we can be competitive.", "Dan Schumacher", "Jeff. I'm Dan Schumacher. To follow up on your question on cost trends across all 3 of our businesses. We've been talking obviously through the balance of 2011 and into 2012 that we were seeing increases in our medical trend largely due to increases in utilization, and that's coming true and playing out. We're seeing it across the platform. You had also asked about, I think, the relationship of the loss ratio to trend. With respect to our loss ratio, on the commercial side, we do expect it to be at the low end of the range, that 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. And our reported loss ratio has a host of factors influencing it. When you look at the trend on more of a core basis, our trend is coming in exactly where we expected it and that's at that 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. And I would not update that to say anything other than in the mid-point of that range.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just my other follow-up was on the government segments. And you're talking about -- I think you've taken a more conservative tone on the margins going forward. And I was just hoping you could give us some color in terms of how those businesses are performing in the second quarter in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Maybe talking either year-over-year or sequentially just been in terms of, are you seeing any pressure on those business yet? Or are they coming in better or worse than expected? Just a at the moment comment would be great.", "Dan Schumacher", "You bet. This is Dan again. On the second quarter, as you look at it, as compared to the performance in the same quarter last year, our government programs in aggregate are performing better. So we have -- they're contributing more earnings and they have a lower loss ratio in aggregate. And then as you start to break it into the pieces, our Medicare is actually performing a little better. Our Medicaid is performing a little bit worse. And the largest contributor to is the little bit more favorable development in the Medicare space.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was hoping you could elaborate on the comment that you made about the change to the Medicare Star ratings after the bids were submitted and the pressure that would put on rates and margins in Medicare Advantage in '13?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Actually I think Tom can respond to that most effectively.", "Tom Paul", "Sure. As you know, the Medicare program now has a Star rating program that includes a pay per performance. And a lot of the performance that we're doing is more futuristic. So we are working today for results in that bonus program that will actually be achieved in '15. And so when you have that kind of gap in timeframe of performance to actual payment, there can be changes in definitions in the meantime that may change that focus of your performance. And so going into 2013, there was a change in definitions around some of the thresholds or some of the performance measures around the Star ratings, which, in many situations cause plans across the industry to have a lower performance, lower Star rating than would have been achieved under the previous definition.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you're essentially saying that the CMS made the requirements harder or higher to achieve and that's resulting in lower Star ratings?", "Tom Paul", "Yes, it could have been a change in the level of requirement. It could have been a change in priority for CMS.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Meaning, a new metric that hadn't been looked up previously?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Change in metrics or a change in weighting, right?", "William C. Ballard", "Yes. It likely would be a change in the weighting or an increase in prioritization of a particular metric over another.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.", "Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I believe UNH expected to incur something like $245 million in total investments related to...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'm sorry, could you get closer because we can't hear you?", "Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, I'm sorry about that. I believe United expected to incur $245 million in investments for the OptumRx repatriation, Optum broadly and TRICARE, and then something like another $215 million in compliance costs. Given this year, given the commentary around some of that being accelerated into the first half, can you provide any additional color, maybe just how much of that we've seen in the first half versus how much is left to go in the second half? And then also beyond that, how much of that we can really count on rolling off in the '13, potentially providing the tailwind to offset some of the gross margin pressures we've been talking about across the benefits business?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. I would not suggest -- I think if that had been as meaningful as your question might suggest, we would have responded to it specifically in the formal comments. I think there has been some pull-through into the first. But I can also tell you that we will continue to try to accelerate because we're trying to go as fast as we can, particularly across Optum. Dave, you want to comment?", "David S. Wichmann", "I think, Melissa, you may be talking specifically a little bit about the cost to compliance that we outlined at the investor conference, and then also some of the commentary we made in the first quarter and how that's shaking out. So let me see if I can address this succinctly and then maybe give you a little bit more color. So with respect to the ACA, the law implementation, actually we see those costs accelerating towards the last half of the year, primarily as we prepare for the exchanges and the payment of rebates and things of that nature. So you can expect an acceleration there. Same goes -- it holds true for the PBM. As you might suspect, as we get to the kind of the last innings, if you will, in the preparation for that, we're hiring people, we're moving members onto our systems and incurring a lot of the operating costs in those final steps. So you'll see that more towards the back half of the year. 50 10, [ph] we're done. We finished that in Q1. We finished clean. It was a huge success for us. And I think we set the bar for the industry there. ICD-10 is pretty steady. So net-net, as you think about these costs of compliance, we\u2019re -- actually we\u2019ll see more of those in the second half of the year than we see in the first. Plus in the first quarter, I think we outlined a couple of things, and these are all really good news. They may sound like bad news in terms of initial costs incurred, but they're all related to the superior growth that UnitedHealthcare has been able to put in place. So for TRICARE, you're going to see a significant amount of operating cost in the back half of the year associated with getting ready for that program. Those will carry over into the beginning part of '13 until we start earning a revenue on that case. Medicaid for Ohio and Kansas, obviously, those wins are great, but we have to prep and install them, same thing with commercial on Nebraska and Texas. So all of those things really are costs to implement. It's all good news. It may show up as a little bit of a deviation on the operating cost side, but that's good. And then the last thing I'd just remind you, on the last half of the year, we're seasonally high in our operating costs, primarily as we get prepared for January and the more intensive medical utilization seasons, as well as we get ready for AEPs with staffing and whatnot. So expect overall in the operating cost side, you'll see that operating cost ratio elevate over the back half of the year.", "Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just to clarify. As we head into '13, we talked a little bit about some of that investment coming out and some ongoing. Is there any way that we can size maybe how to think about SG&A in those investments as a headwind or tailwind into '13?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think what you're referring to is principally around OptumRx, and that is the bulk of those will be incurred in 2012. There will be some that will go into 2013, but on the comparative basis, OptumRx should step up next year. Dirk?", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes. I mean, what I would say is that as you pace into our migration schedule to begin on the first of 2013 and it paces throughout '13, we will have sort of operating and training costs ramped up consistent with that migration schedule. So let's say there'll be a little bit of operating cost. But if you look, the majority of the development costs have occurred in 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask one around kind of principally XLHealth and the integration progress you're making there on 2 fronts. So first of all, I understand that you're using some of their approaches in the more, say, chronic or co-morbid portion of your MA book. And I wondered when the benefits to scoring might manifest from that activity? And then secondly, in the context of XL Plus, INSPIRIS and Evercare, what progress have you made in kind of pulling those together into an integrated solution as it relates to presentations or pitches in dual eligible opportunities?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think it's a great question. I would include our Medicaid capabilities in that as well. But Tom, do you want to start?", "Tom Paul", "Sure. This is Tom. And with the integration of XLHealth, we're looking at it from 2 approaches. The one that you didn't mention was really around the health plan side of the XLHealth, so the Care Improvement Plus plans and how we're looking to leverage their focus and their capability and their market presence in 2013, which we definitely took advantage of in our bid offerings for 2013. On the side you did mention, we are expanding the capabilities around house calls and their integrated clinical care model through a broader Medicare Advantage population with the legacy Medicare & Retirement population. We are showing good progress in that. The results of that, the work we do in '12 will be realized on a -- realized in '13, as well as the clinical advantage that we get today in identifying early gaps in care from a medical management perspective. We realize those now in 2012.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, super. And then on the -- from a duals perspective?", "Tom Paul", "Yes, those same capabilities. Again, I think we originally saw the XL capability as it's more geared toward the chronically ill. But I think we are now looking at that differently and we're rolling it out more broadly in the Medicare space, whether you're a dual eligible, whether you're in a more traditional Medicare Advantage program, where you can also benefit from that same house call visit. And so we are incorporating that into our dual eligible offerings as well.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Wherever the needs really are challenging and the care paths can be most effectively applied.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So if I could follow up quickly on that, is it possible to call out which states or perhaps, even just quantify the number of states where you think the approach by the state will provide you with the opportunity to really show off your skill sets as opposed to, say, the California situation that's just going to existing vendors?", "Tom Paul", "Sure, although I would say that when you really look at the compelling notion of how these capabilities ultimately align and integrate and the needs of the populations to be managed, I think all the states will eventually come around. So I really think it's a matter of pacing and whatever factors get -- complicate the pace, in fact, or whether they're political or otherwise, I really think that at end of the day, the states, confronted with the challenges they have, are going to have to embrace these kinds of capabilities. They're better for their populations and they're much better for their programs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Can I just ask on the Medicaid rate pressures? How does that intersect, in your view, with the federal statute for actuarially justified rates? Is that a backstop that you can turn to, to some extent? And if you can give us any geographic detail on the rate pressures, we'd appreciate it.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Right. So I don't think we're going to offer geographic details because I think we, long-term, believe that the states will eventually find -- it will be interested in sustaining these programs. The actuarial issue, Jack, do you want to respond?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure. So as you pointed out, the actuarial soundness principle is always the backstop each year as states develop and release rates. I guess I would just make a couple of observations around actuarial soundness. One, they do provide ranges. And I think we have seen in our community and state business over year \u2013 over the years sort of a movement inside those ranges, if you will, from high to low. And I would tell you that we are trending towards the lower side of the ranges most times. And the second thing is around rate pressures. There's a number of, I would say, there's a range as to what you assume from Managed Care savings long term. And there is a significant amount of judgment applied to that and most notably in new state entrants where states are doing their very best to anticipate what Managed Care savings might be. So those 2 things are certainly big variables in actuarial soundness, but we're seeing sort of points all in between.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. That makes a lot of sense. And if I could just ask just one follow-up, a clarification really. As you talked about the cost trend at 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, I got a little confused on where you said you're coming in at that on a reported basis, but at the lower end on some other basis. Dan, maybe you could just clarify what you had meant about that?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Sorry, Matt. Let me try it again. So on the loss ratio on the commercial side, we expect it to be on the lower end of our guidance. So 82% plus are minus 50 on the lower end. With respect to our trend outlook, full year commercial trend outlook, we're not making any revisions to that. We expect it to be at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Wouldn't you expect both of those together? Sorry, maybe I'm splitting hairs too much.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "There are other issues that affect those.", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes. So I was trying to get at is there are differences between those things that show up in our reported loss ratio in terms of how we look at quarter trend. So I'm saying they're not moving exactly the same. Loss ratios\u2019s lower than the guidance, our trend, we expect to be at 6% plus or minus 50.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. Just for one, for instance, the rebate adjustment in the first quarter would have affected the loss ratio, but not the core medical trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "If I missed this, just let me know because I had some phone challenges. Payables versus premiums. I know that they can fluctuate a little bit. Were there any timing issues in the quarter on the payables that you'd like to highlight? Because it looks like adjusting for PDP, in prior period development, payables didn't quite keep up with premiums. And then Steve, at your Investor Day, you made some interesting observations about 2014 and how reinsurance and risk adjustment could help to keep small players from dumping. Can you update us on your 2014 broad thoughts, recognizing that we're not in the position to make any specific projections?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll do the best I can on that. Dave, maybe you want to comment on the payable?", "David S. Wichmann", "Christine, I'm not really seeing anything on the payables versus premiums front that's unusual in the quarter, other than the fact that we acquired Medicare and Preferred Care and had to put those in our financial statements.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And then could you remind me about what specifically you wanted to probe about 2014? Because I [indiscernible].", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Well, you made some comments about small players probably not being incentivized at some point in the exchange given risk adjustment and reinsurance. And also, tax advantages. And you had some broad thoughts about how you thought that the structure of the exchanges would protect small groups from dumping and help to protect some profitability there. So I'm just wondering, now that we have a little bit more data, not much, but a little bit more and spend some time studying it?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Actually, we probably don't have any more information. And quite honestly, I would say that the implementation landscape has probably become more complicated because it's clear that there will be some pacing in terms of how this will be implemented as states have seem to have more flexibility and the administration seems to be more flexible in terms of how these will go in. But if there is going to be any sector that is going to pursue the exchanges, it's going to be on this very much smaller. And when you then take a look at that, I think that the pacing of that, if you're a prudent businessperson, you're not going to necessarily go right to that if you have benefits. It might be those who have not had benefits in the past that will pursue the exchange. And then if you are an established business, you might be more prudent in terms of watching how that plays itself out. You do get tax deductibility on benefits. Your employees are paying 20%, 25% of the total cost of these benefits so that the company is subsidizing 75%. When you begin to go to the exchanges, there clearly will have to be a re-leveling on wages. I think employers will look at that and believe that they perhaps have a more control over their benefits than they might have if they lose those benefits and have to make compensation adjustments for health care that they no longer control. I think those -- when you really get into the heads of the business operators, that they\u2019ll be measured in terms of how their response is for those that have benefits and have been committed to benefits in the past. That's why, I think, that things, perhaps, will move into more measured pace. And I think the implementation now is clearly challenging given the time frames that we have left. So if there's an update, that's all I'd offer. Gail?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "I think Steve hit the key points. The first one, we still don't -- there's a lot of unknown still around the exchanges. And two, as you think about the ranges that many experts have given on dumping from 30% to low single-digits, we do think it's going to be at the lower end of that range for the reason Steve talked about, the tax advantage that the employers have, the impacts of what employees pay right now and the penalties. So that will mute, we think, many of the people moving to the exchanges quickly in the beginning.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "It may firm up over time, but it will take time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So 2 quick ones. One, just looking at medical services CPI, there was a pretty big uptick in June. And it was driven a lot by the hospital inpatient component. It seems kind of strange that you\u2019d get kind of one month move like that. So I'm just curious, are you seeing anything on the hospital pricing side that's different?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Hospital pricing side?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "In terms of our negotiations with hospitals, I think we've shared this with you before. I mean, we're coming in, in line with the expectations we set. There's clearly pressure. There's been pressure on the unit cost side. We're moving much more of our payment to pay per performance along the broad continuum. So always pressure in the system, but I wouldn't say anything has dramatically changed, and we're doing well against the expectations we set, as well as trying to move much more of our pay to pay per performance.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Then just on the 2013 national account front. I didn't hear much. I'm just curious if you guys have a -- I know it's still a little early, but you guys are probably moving through the process. Any updates on how the pipeline looks and any sort of initial expectations for Jan 1?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Jeff Alter?", "Jeff Alter", "It's Jeff Alter. What we've seen over the last few years is that the clients in this marketplace are really looking for a long-term partner who can deliver practical innovations, like our health care cost estimator and our mobility platform, coupled with distinctive service and new models of outreach to help their employees navigate the health care system in an easier way. And they're really looking for that long-term partner who can manage their benefits and their medical trend even more important during this time of enormous change. And we performed really well over the last couple of years with this stack up. We continue to perform well. We still have -- although I know your question was '13, but we still have over 500,000 members in this space to bring up between now and 1/1/13. And then it is early. And we're in the middle of the selling season for 2013. But all indications are that our past success will continue in the 1/1 season.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So you guys were up somewhere in the ballpark of 800,000 in the first quarter. Is that sort of your baseline run rate target? Or is there anything that indicates next year will be better or worse than what we saw this year?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Josh, we're not offering 2013 guidance today. So I think we'll -- I would just say I think the market -- our service to that market continues to be strong, and we'll comment on 2013 when we get to the Investor Conference. Okay?", "So I think we should close now. I would hope that you would take away a few key points. First, that UnitedHealth Group continued to deliver a performance in the second quarter and for the first half of '12. But we remain focused and realistic considering the challenging economic and market environment that we face today. Second, we continue to focus on providing consistent value, innovation and dependable execution on behalf of the customers and consumers in everything we do. We remain committed to improving quality and access, while helping to contain the rising cost of care so that health care experience is simpler and more affordable. And lastly, we look to the -- looking to the future, we see markets expanding steadily for health benefits and exponentially for health services. So while we acknowledge the increasing competitive and regulatory pressures ahead, we believe our adaptable, diversified businesses are well positioned to grow the market and that we'll continue to grow and to prosper over the long term.", "We thank you very much for your attention today.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on our financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Third quarter revenues were $27.3 billion, increasing 8% year-over-year again this quarter. Earnings grew 28% to $1.50 per share, benefiting from strong revenue growth and improved operating margins.", "Our third quarter 2012 operating margin of 9.6% reflects strong performance on clinical affordability and favorable reserve developments, resulting in the consolidated medical care ratio of 79%. Sharp margin improvement at Optum further contributed to the 140 basis point expansion in consolidated operating margin.", "Operating costs grew seasonally to 15.7% of revenues. Execution across our enterprise continues to be strong and our financial flexibility remains distinctive.", "Adjusted cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion in the third quarter brought year-to-date cash flow to $5.5 billion, a 9% year-over-year advance.", "We ended the quarter at the ratio of debt to debt plus equity of 30% and have $1.6 billion in nonregulated cash on hand.", "Last week, we announced our merger with Amil, the leading Brazilian health care company. We see expansive, early-stage market opportunities there, and we expect Amil will become a distinctive growth platform for both our Health Benefits and Health Services segments.", "The rating agencies all reaffirmed our ratings subsequent to our announcement. Standard & Poor's had upgraded our corporate debt rating to A with a stable outlook in September; making UnitedHealth Group the highest-rated, publicly traded managed care organization they follow.", "Our unique business diversity was key factor for S&P, along with strong cash flow generated from operations. And also during the quarter, we were honored to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.", "Let's review third quarter performance by business, beginning with UnitedHealthcare, which advanced third quarter revenues 8% year-over-year to $25.5 billion, and operating earnings 26% to $2.2 billion.", "UnitedHealthcare has added 2 million people through the first 9 months of 2012. This includes net growth of 670,000 people this quarter alone, record organic growth for a third quarter. Major new clients this quarter included the initiation of health benefit services for state employees in Texas and Nebraska. We're honored to serve the employees of these states and their families.", "UnitedHealthcare grew fee-based commercial benefits by 1.5 million people in the third quarter, bringing 9-month growth to 1.25 million people. Commercial risk-based business remained flat this quarter. The commercial environment continues to be characterized by persistently weak employment and new business formation.", "The pricing intensity we see at local market levels remains unchanged from the last several quarters. Our offerings remain very competitive across the value spectrum due to our strong cost positions, effective care management, operating cost disciplines and innovative benefit designs and features. But we will remain disciplined on margins and continue to price to our forward view of underlying costs, including the insurer's fee. As we hold to these pricing disciplines, we expect to continue to lose moderate levels of risk-based membership in the near term, as we have for the last several quarters.", "Our Medicare and Medicaid businesses contributed strongly to UnitedHealthcare's third quarter growth performance, together adding more than 165,000 people over the last 90 days. We grew by 35,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage and 70,000 Medicaid beneficiaries joined UnitedHealthcare plans. We made the decision, together with the state of Wisconsin, to end our contract serving 175,000 people in one product in the Milwaukee market as of November 1, while we continue to serve 125,000 people statewide.", "UnitedHealthcare Community & State was awarded the opportunity to serve more than 20,000 dual eligible beneficiaries in Ohio beginning in April of 2013. This was part of the country's first Medicare and Medicaid eligible program award integrating all services, from comprehensive medical to long-term care to pharmacy benefits to behavioral health. We offer all of these services and are deeply experienced and skilled in integrating them to better respond to challenges for these beneficiaries.", "UnitedHealthcare's 8.6% operating margins strengthened, ahead of both our expectations and last year's third quarter results. Our full year 2012 commercial medical cost trend benchmark is likely to come in around 5.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Third quarter earnings benefited from reserve development, and we now project a full year 2012 consolidated medical care ratio in the range of 80.5%, based on the strong year-to-date results and the sharp seasonal increase in cost expected in the fourth quarter.", "We believe our consumer education and engagement efforts and our clinical management and affordability programs are meaningfully impacting the cost curve for our businesses. With benefit design improvements and effective outreach and population health management, we're increasingly helping patients receive care from the best doctors and have better suited more cost-appropriate sites of services.", "We have also grown our performance-based payment programs, which are approaching an annual run rate of $17 billion or 18% of our in-network medical spend and our ability to detect inaccuracies and erred in claim submission and, therefore, to pay more fairly and appropriately for services rendered. Together, these capabilities deliver fundamental value to clients by improving the overall affordability of the products they buy.", "Looking ahead to 2013, UnitedHealthcare's business plan is built on record customer growth, led by TRICARE and National Accounts, and strong performance in the public and senior sector. We expect UnitedHealthcare's performance in the Public and Senior Markets will be highlighted by continued market competitive Medicare Advantage offerings, continued Medicaid expansions and the compelling new Medicare Part D product offering that fully leverages our PBM capabilities.", "We expect commercial risk business to continue to be down moderately in a price-sensitive market, as we adjust our pricing to reflect our forward view of medical costs, trends and cost increases for the insurance fee provisions of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to expect generally lower gross margin percentage across UnitedHealthcare's risk-based businesses in 2013, as we said last quarter.", "For the longer term, our view remains strongly positive. We believe UnitedHealthcare is building a distinctive health benefits franchise by aligning benefit design, consumer engagement, clinical program management and network usage. This alignment continues to deliver sustainable cost and performance advantages, growth, and deeper, richer relationships with consumers and physicians across all benefit categories.", "Moving to Health Services. Optum continues to progress steadily, in line with the long-term expectations we set out nearly a year ago at our Investor Conference. Even in these initial stages as the enterprise becomes what we refer to as One Optum, the results foreshadow some of the acceleration and impact of expanded capacities that will become even more apparent as it matures in 2013 and 2014.", "Optum's third quarter revenues were $7.2 billion, and operating earnings of $408 million grew 28% year-over-year. Importantly, all segments showed year-over-year and sequential quarterly operating margin gains, benefiting from growth and from the simplification and integration investments made in the first half of this year.", "The initiatives and investments that underline the One Optum strategy continue and should benefit 2013 and '14. Third quarter revenue growth was led by OptumHealth, up 19% year-over-year; and OptumInsight, up 15% year-over-year. Optum Insight's revenue backlog continues to grow and now stands at $4.5 billion, up more than $700 million or 19% year-over-year. The depth and quality of our customer relationships are increasing as the market becomes more familiar with our Optum offerings. Some examples of new third quarter sales illustrate Optum's diverse and broad market reach.", "For a specialty drug maker, we will measure over multiple years the in-market clinical performance of a high-profile product. For a major care delivery system, we will provide technology and services to enable the development of competencies in population health and risk management. For a variety of health plans, we will deliver medical care to members through our integrated care clinics. For employers and freestanding drug benefit programs, we'll manage pharmacy benefits, including their rebate programs. And many more examples could be offered.", "Optum is making steady progress in strengthening its margins by addressing its overall cost structure, operating, processes and deeper product and business integration. We are committed to a higher performance, more responsive, more agile enterprise, consistent with results that have been realized over the years through similar approaches applied at UnitedHealthcare.", "We expect these improvements will strengthen performance for customers and unlock the scale advantage that should accrue from Optum's strong, sustainable top line growth. We have added seasoned, talented executives and aligned the organization to support more comprehensive solutions and deeper customer partnerships. We are focusing product development on these larger, broader opportunities, while continue to execute on always important, individual product sales, day in and day out.", "Our long-term view for Optum's potential remains exceptionally positive. This is a competency-based platform with leading assets that are applicable to serving a broad variety of channels. Serving customer relationships across the full expense of a health system that needs to evolve and improve performance. We operate in an emerging health services marketplace, characterized by fragmented suppliers who typically are offering narrow products instead of broader-based solutions. If we focus on our clients and the challenges they face and deliver strong execution around solutions, Optum has dramatic growth potential.", "So in sum, 2012 continues to be a strong year for our enterprise at this point. Our results show growth and balance across virtually all our businesses. We have achieved revenue growth, further diversification and stronger margins, and we continue to develop and position our businesses and business leaders for the future. With Tom Paul taking an important new role as UnitedHealthcare's Chief Consumer Officer, and Jack Larsen and Steve Nelson, both strong veteran leaders, now running respectively Medicare & Retirement and Community & State for UnitedHealthcare, 2012 should finish out strongly.", "The fourth quarter is challenging from a seasonality perspective and as you know, bears a heavy cost burden as we prepare for new January volumes and related benefit changes and as we work through the intense Medicare selling and enrollment season.", "That said, excluding any potential impact from Amil, we expect the year 2012 to end in a revenue range approaching $110 billion and an earnings per share range of $5.20 to $5.25 per share, with strong operating cash flows of approximately $7 billion.", "Quarter-by-quarter, across the UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and Optum platforms, we have been improving our products and services, executing more consistently and more strongly, diversifying steadily and regularly advancing innovations to better serve the needs of our customers. Organic growth has been strong and distinctive in both 2011 and 2012. Medical and operating costs have been well managed, with more opportunities in front of us. And as a result, we've been consistently delivering more value to the wide, diverse and growing customer base be serve. We expect strong execution to continue in 2013.", "But as we have said in previous calls, given the weak business climate and employment outlook in the United States, the mounting pressures in federal state budgets, to mention just a few some of the challenges, we continue to be cautious about 2013 earnings performance. We expect to grow revenues and earnings per share in 2013, but we view the current consensus level as the considerable challenge from this distance, given these market conditions.", "We certainly expect to continue to grow broadly across our businesses in 2013, with the exception of commercial risk-based membership. We continue to expect pressure on margins across all benefit markets. We have TRICARE implementation and PBM in sourcing to add to the operating challenges, as well as the growth opportunities.", "Optum should remain rock solid on its plan to continue to increase its contribution to our overall performance. And Amil is expected to be slightly accretive, but not really expected to be much of a factor in the earnings next year.", "2012 had significant favorable performance attributes, starting with favorable medical cost trends, reserve development and rebate true-ups that we cannot assume will carry into 2013 with similar levels of impact. We will introduce our first view of 2013 to you at our Investor Conference in just over a month from now.", "As 2012 closes, we continue to generate significant growth momentum. Our customers are responding to the distinctive competencies that underlie products and services access from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. We will continue to focus on fundamental execution with the goal of creating value, both for those we serve and for shareholders.", "In the meantime, our team is here to take your questions about market development and 2012 performance. Please, let's hold to one question per person. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I just wanted to ask you about the commercial pricing and cost trend environment. I mean in particular, of course we noticed the lower outlook on trend now at 5.5%, down from your prior outlook. Can you just talk through the components of your view that changed during the quarter and also maybe just dovetail that with whether you've seen any change on the pricing side as well?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure, I think Dan might be the best to be begin that.", "Dan Schumacher", "Matt, this is Dan Schumacher. So on the cost trend side, stepping into 2012, we did have an expectation of higher utilization as compared to 2011. We are actually seeing that, although I will tell you it is more moderate than we thought. We saw a surge in the first quarter utilization, and then that moderated from the second quarter forward. And I think beyond the consumer behaviors underneath that, I think what we are seeing is some really strong contributions from our medical affordability agenda. We work across the health care landscape, whether it be inpatient management focused on the most appropriate site of service, most appropriate course of treatment, all the way through to payment integrity; fraud, waste and abuse; and strong delivery, frankly, from our contracting, aligning more around value and quality outcomes. So all of those things are making a difference for us. As you look at the components of it, I guess I would take you back to the Investor Conference guidance and update the components from there. First on inpatient, we are seeing a little better inpatient. Again, that's really our strong management on 1-day lengths of stay, observations, conversions and things like that. We are seeing a little bit more moderate pharmacy utilization, particularly in the space of Hep C. We're seeing relatively stable position, and outpatient is actually a little bit higher than our expectation. And we continue to have strong programs really focused on the site of service behind the outpatient setting. So all of that informs our revised view of 5.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then I think I'll turn to Jeff to talk a little bit about the pricing environment.", "Jeff Alter", "Matt, it's Jeff Alter. Yes, on a general basis, we have said this before, we expected and have been seeing a more competitive market environment around commercial pricing. I don't think it's changed. It's about the same as it has been since the first few quarters of this year. So not really a market change in the third quarter. But as you know, our approach hasn't changed for a very long time. Our approach and discipline remain intact. And as Steve mentioned, we believe the result of that will be some loss of commercial risk-based membership over the next, call it 6 months. And in relation to the discussion or the answer that Dan gave, we have a very disciplined process that takes a forward view of costs. And as medical trend changes and expectations change, and some of those results change, we look across those 350 intersections of MLR. And then look at a couple other factors and try to come up with the answer that will optimize our results in each one of those given markets. So that has remained unchanged. What has changed, I think internally, is we are able to get some of these changes into our pricing much quicker than we had in the past. So...", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just wanted to talk a little bit about the commentary you made on 2013 consensus. Steve, you mentioned that, that will be a challenge. I think the consensus first is the mid-point of your current -- of your updated 2012 is about 7% growth. So I guess a couple of things on that. We've heard from the company before that it's a double-digit earnings grower. Are we just -- in sort of last couple of years, we're just sort of not seeing necessarily all of that, if you take out some of these one timers? So are we thinking about the growth trajectory wrong? You guys seem comfortable that Optum is still on pace to double by '15. And then I guess you mentioned pricing for the industry fee. Is that having a bigger effect? Is there a net income impact next year? And maybe specifically, how you plan on accounting for that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, Josh, I think that is like 6 questions rolled into 1. I really commend you for that. Our view in terms of the outlook of our business is unchanged. We have seen these kinds of challenges in the marketplace and I think we have been successful in navigating through them over the last couple of years. But that doesn't deter us from recognizing that we need to continue to operate and focus on that basis, that the economic environment has not changed, the employment outlook really has not changed. It doesn't appear to us to be -- the reimbursement environment relative to the federal and state budgets, arguably has gotten even more intense. The impact of the reform act, including the insurance fee, really begins to get in -- to come into play, as we set to begin the rate development process for 2013. So we are respectful of those elements and intend to engage them and to perform to our maximum potential through those, and are perhaps more cautious than those who set consensus of those factors at this distance as we look into 2013. If you actually take a look at our actual performance, I think it has been pretty strong over the last couple of years and we are certainly focused and actually think we are more capable and stronger than we have been in those past years. But we have to strike an appropriate balance there. And that's really all we are saying. We expect to grow revenue in earnings in 2013. We're really not intending to give you more specifics or color on 2013 guidance, other than to maintain a sober balance in terms of some of the headwinds that we see. And on a, from a growth perspective, we consider these to be kind of the headwinds of perhaps the next couple of years. But if you really take a look at the growth potential of this enterprise, the market expansions that are in front of it over the long term, Optum is performing well. It is maturing. It is gaining momentum. And we fully expect to be in line with our kind of the guidance, the longer-term guidance we set at last year's Investor Conference. So no discouragement along those lines, and I don't know what else to offer.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I understand, Steve, you're not going to give sort of specific guidance. But you talked about industry fees, so I'm just curious what the impact there is? Are you -- is there a specific percentage you're assuming that the fee will come in at as a percentage of premiums? And are you accruing for that in '13? Is that the idea?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, so it's coming into play in 2013 because it applies in that fashion. Maybe Dan Schumacher can address the insurance fee.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. So with respect to the accounting, the insurance fee is assessed in 2014 based on 2013 premiums. So we will begin at -- accruing for it in 2014 as premiums are earned, and we will actually make the payment in January of 2014. So that's kind of mechanically how it works.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And you're accruing in '14?", "Dan Schumacher", "No, we're accruing in '14 for the fee. With respect to pricing in the commercial business, we have annual policies. So those policies that begin February forward in 2013, they have months that carry then into 2014. So we are increasingly reflecting the health insurance tax in those renewals, so that we capture the cost of that tax in '14, in our premiums in '13.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just want to follow up here on the commentary, specifically around the revenue growth. Yes, obviously a strong year here across just about all the businesses on the membership side. Is there anything you can talk to just in terms of anything we should be thinking about structurally in terms of the growth that you saw in 2011 or should I say, 2012 that may or may not continue into 2013, and whether that's the strong commercial ASO business? That Medicare Advantage results? Yes, I know you had a good Part D bidding season. Just curious if there's anything we should be thinking about in terms of nonrepetitive?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think I'll let Gail and Larry comment with respect to their business platforms, but the item that we really highlighted is really no different than '12, and that is continued moderation in terms of commercial risk. But Gail, do you want to...", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Thanks, Steve. From an overall perspective as you've seen from the benefits side of the business, we've had a very strong growth trajectory over the last several years, including this year in 2012. As we think about the positioning of each of our businesses, certainly, we're coming and still into the final pieces of our selling season for 2013, but feel we're well positioned in the commercially ASO side and think we will have another strong national account season. Again, that's part of the positioning around our consumer facing products, our value-based benefit design, the innovation that we're bringing to the market. So we feel positive about our positioning in the commercial ASO side. As Steve mentioned in his opening comments around commercial risk, it's a very competitive market we're seeing extremely disciplined around that pricing components of that and we'd expect to see membership decline. But again, feel good about the positioning of our products in each of our local markets. On the Medicare & Medicaid side, from our -- as you know, we're just starting into the AEP season. Again, we feel we have a very balanced offering in the marketplace, feel good about our Medicare positioning, and Medicare Advantage had a very strong Medicare Supplement business this year and we'd expect to continue to see strong performance there and feel we have a balanced offering in Part D as well. On Medicaid, we've continued to win procurements. And again, that is a market where we know that states are facing some significant budget challenges. We see opportunities. We're pleased with the win that we had in Ohio on the dual eligibles, as well as the state Medicaid and the procurements there, and continue to get very focused on affordability and providing I think strong offerings to our State partners, both across Medicaid and Medicare. So overall, from a growth perspective, getting back to your question, I think we feel well positioned, but recognize the competitive nature of the marketplace and are very respectful of that.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. So the kind of net answer here sounds like the business momentum feels just as strong going into 2013 as it was going in -- as it kind of has continued to be during 2012. And the commercial risk business is the area where you see pressure, and that's no different than what you're seeing this year in terms of the economy. Is that a fair way to look at it?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Well, I won't comment on '13 guidance, but I'll tell you that we do feel we're well positioned.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And you've only heard part of the story because Larry Renfro can speak to the Optum side.", "Larry C. Renfro", "I think everybody knows that we have a 3-year business plan that we're operating under. We call it Becoming One Optum. And if you look at that plan and you look at the execution that we've been achieving this year, there's really 4 areas that'll give you a little detail behind that. One being financial discipline/cost management; two being reengineering/organizational simplification; three being portfolio management; and four being growth. So I think in terms of your question, you were more geared towards the growth. So let me just give you a couple of comments. We do feel pretty well positioned. I think if you look this quarter, OptumHealth was up about 19%. OptumInsight up about 15%, with OptumInsight's backlog being up about 19%. But if you look at growth, where we see it coming from in the future as part of our plan, it'll be the PBM, it'll be care delivery, the retail/consumer and provider. So we feel pretty good about the overall plan. We feel pretty good about the execution in 2012 and looking forward to some results in the future.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So overall, I'd say pretty positive.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "The question is about cost trend, both around utilization as well as unit cost. So can you give me some color first around the reserve development, which is very favorable compared to some of your peers in recent quarters by segment, Medicare/Medicaid, commercial and if utilization is equally weak and well-controlled in all segments? And then on the unit cost side, given that we've got now 40% of docs owned by hospitals, per the recent advisory board data, Sutter, Long Island Jewish, New York Montefiore and many others are beginning to apply for health plan licenses, are you seeing any pressure on your unit cost? And how do you see that evolving in the next 1 to 3 years?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Hi, Ana. This is Dan Schumacher. So let me take the pieces of that. First, with respect to the reserve development. I think it's important to share that our fundamental discipline has not changed. So we have a comprehensive reserve setting process. It's consistent. It's stable. And each month, each quarter, we are trying to sort out our best estimate of the ultimate claims expense. And as a result, we don't have an expectation of future favorable development. And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we'll get it in relation to prior year medical spend and so forth, it's about 1%, so in a relatively reasonable range. In terms of the things that are contributing to the development, I'd say first on the utilization side, as I mentioned, we saw a surge in utilization in the first quarter and some moderation in the second quarter forward. And that's true across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial. And that contributed to our development. We also continue to have improving processing speed, as well as processing quality. That's showing up in the form of reserve development. And then beyond that, our performance around our affordability agenda. So we take a prudent approach as we introduce programs. We wait to see that manifest in actual claims payment. And then that starts to impact our reserve results. And so you're seeing favorable development across kind of those 3 things. As you look at the composition of trend between cost and utilization, utilization is a little bit better than we expected, and I would likewise say that unit cost is a little bit better than expectation. On the commercial side specifically, it remains an area of intense pressure for us, and it represents more than 2/3 of our trend outcome each year, so it is a very meaningful part of our trend equation. But I will tell you that on the unit cost side, we are doing a little bit better than we thought. We think that's in part due to the reconfiguration of our payment, aligning it with performance and quality and value.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So its default being you're turning more to shed savings risk-based contracting, if I may just close that off?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, we're working up the continuum, so starting in fee-for-service and then working towards shared savings and gain sharings, up through bundle in episode relatively sub-capitations and capitations and so forth, working to align the incentives across the continuum. And we rely heavily on our partners in Optum to help to provide those services and support tools for the delivery system to be able to meet us where we want a contract.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Steve, I wanted to clarify a comment that you made in the prepared remarks. You said that you would expect commercial risk business to be down moderately next year, and I wanted to understand better if that was referring to top line or margin because it sounded like you thought the intensity of pricing and competition was continuing and cost would be up next year. So looking at those 2 pieces together, where do we end up from a margin perspective?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure, I think Gail can respond to this.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. What Steve was referring to is that, as you know this year, we're down in enrollment over 25,000 lives on risk-based. And as Jeff said in his comments to the earlier question, we expect to continue to be a competitive environment, and we would expect enrollment to be down.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So the comment was directed at enrollment, not at margins?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "It was at enrollment, yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just want to go back to cost trend. I know you took it down a bit. Maybe can you talk about what you expect on the inpatient and outpatient side of what you're seeing in terms of trend there? And then you mentioned sort of the shift to inpatient outpatient. How much of that is really driving the lower cost, what you're doing to help that push? And if at all, if you can frame sort of the savings in aggregate on a like-for-like basis.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan, you want to cover that again?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. So with respect to the categories, where we're seeing utilization up, we're seeing it up in the outpatient setting, and that is in part due to some of the management programs we have in place. So we focus on converting one day lengths of stay to a more efficient setting to observation status. So they flip from inpatient to outpatient, and that was what I was talking about with respect to our management programs. And then on the inpatient side, we are seeing continuously restrained utilization. Our bed days were actually flat to declining, and each of our benefits businesses and those things extend through from admissions, the length of stay, as well as focused on the readmission rates so that when you leave the hospital, you're able to stay home. And again, that's an example of a partnership with Optum, where their care management teams are working to transition people to the home setting and help them stay there. Those are some of the examples of the things that we're doing that are making a difference inside of our cost trends.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just -- again, on the 5.5%, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense. Does that equate to inpatient being up 4% and outpatient being up 9% or can you help in that regard? Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude when you talk about inpatient and outpatient, given that you lowered the trend?", "Dan Schumacher", "Well, so you when you're talking about the trend, you got to take into account unit cost and utilization. On the utilization side, specifically, inpatient is actually down, outpatient is up. On the unit cost side, most of our unit cost increases come in the inpatient setting. That's where our increases are coming from. So when you blend that all together, as I mentioned before, balanced against our Investor Conference guidance, better in inpatient, better in pharmacy, relatively stable in physician and higher in outpatient.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.", "Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "2012 is definitely a year of investment, not just around your Optum segment, but also in preparation for certain regulatory changes and reform implementation in 2014. Can you just help us think about any incremental investments you may still need to make as we head into 2013, and whether there's any sort of step function change, up or down, in your SG&A as we head into next year?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So let me see if I can understand the question. As we continue to prepare for adopting and embracing the healthcare reform changes and continue the activities in our business, such as in-sourcing our PBM, et cetera, I guess you're asking us where our cost -- you're looking for an increase in cost or something like that, is that...", "Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, sort of just how we think about your SG&A, especially around those types of investments as we move from '12 into '13.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think '12 has actually had a reasonable burden with respect to those kinds of investments, and I think that much of it will carry through into 2013, and probably subside more in the latter stages of it, but I think an area that's most impacted by those kinds of activities is Optum. So maybe I'll ask Larry or John Rex to kind of comment.", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure. If you -- and I think that most people know that we have spent the last couple of years designing the PBM operational platform, as well as the infrastructure to move the UHC business onto our platforms. So 2012 ended up being the strong year for us to invest. That investment should start to wind down at the end of this year, and there'll be some lag into 2013, but we feel pretty good about where we're at with that. It's perfectly on plan. So that's pretty much it. John, I don't know if there's anything else.", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes, so what I would add to that, Larry, is that you're absolutely right, this is Dirk McMahon. In 2012, we had probably our highest SG&A burden associated with investments in the insourcing, but in 2013 we'll also have some expenses associated with training our people as we bring them into deal with the membership that we will ratably bring in throughout 2013.", "Dan Schumacher", "Larry, just to follow-on here, I think in the first half of the year, we made comments in the first 2 quarters about the investments we're making across the broader business in addition to OptumRx. We expect to continue to make those investments, and I think from what you're seeing in this quarter as we're starting to realize some of the benefits that we would expect to continue to make with investments that we work out into 2013 also.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "But nothing -- but basically continuation, nothing...", "Dan Schumacher", "In continuation, that kind of levels it out...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And how about on the UnitedHealthcare side?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "It's Gail Boudreaux. In the UnitedHealthcare side, you'll continue to see there's some investments, stable investments in Reform, so you think about ongoing investments in ICD-10. In addition, we made investments this year in 2012 in helping to standup the TRICARE contract, and we will continue to make those as we prepare to serve that membership in March of 2013, and those investments will -- getting that contract ready to stand up will also flow into 2013.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You guys talked about Optum growing and margins continuing to improve, and then SG&A being perhaps higher in '12 than maybe in '13 or at least similar, but not growing, and talk about building the insurance fee into the commercial risk business. I'm trying to gauge why the pressure on EPS growth making earnings growth -- the consensus numbers challenging for 2013. It comes sort of down to the Medicare business and we look at that, and you clearly have some very good margin in the Medicare business or certainly lower medical loss ratio. Are you sort of expecting a much weaker margin in Medicare for next year sort of getting ready for the MLR minimums in 2014? Is that the way to think about this?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, no, maybe I could reset. I think if you go back to a commentary we have made really over the last couple of years, really it is -- we're responding to an environment that is broadly challenging, and where we have been successful navigating those challenges. Those challenges remain, and the economic environment remains, and the pressure on budgets remain. And the pressure on making sure that we execute flawlessly with respect to -- we just mentioned the TRICARE contract or the PBM in-sourcing, staying on the One Optum plan, those kinds of elements, which we have a lot of respect for the work that goes into executing across those and basically, we remind the market each quarter about those challenges, and we approach things perhaps more cautiously than the marketplace, and I think that's what we are suggesting. We are really not -- you are perhaps overanalyzing if you're trying to focus down on a single product line. We're actually pretty positive about the breadth of our business, very positive about our Medicare and Medicaid outlook and potential. Actually, very positive with respect to commercial. If you take a look at the commercial market broadly, it has been, at best, treading water, or if not, contracting from that perspective. So we're just reminding the marketplace of those challenges in light of very, very strong results. So that really is the goal here, not -- there is no lack of confidence with respect to our competitiveness in the marketplace, our ability to prosper under all the product lines we have right now.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just getting back to the minimum MLRs in Medicare, can you address that a little bit in terms of how well you think you are prepared? I know we don't even know how that's going to be calculated at this point, but in terms of your expectation for how that's going to work going forward, what kind of pressure do see on margins in the Medicare business in 2014, if not sooner?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Actually, we feel pretty good about that. Gail?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Yes, I think -- this is Gail Boudreaux again. I think you said at first, we don't have the exact calculation yet for how the minimum MLR will be applied in Medicare, but it is obviously one of those factors that as we get into 2013 and prepare our bids for 2014, we'll take that into consideration along with a number of other factors but to be more specific, would you expect to be able to manage within it.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And if I would add, one other element to the thinking is the '12 has had a lot of favorable elements to it, and as I said in the prepared remarks, you cannot necessarily assume that those will play into '13 as strongly as they did in '12. We will continue to operate in endeavor to achieve that, but that's an element of caution that we also give. So I wouldn't over read our caution. I would just think that we have to regularly remind ourselves and remind the marketplace of the issues.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to go back to the industry fee pricing commentary. So you guys are starting to price for the industry fee starting next year, but there's no actual fee until 2014. So shouldn't that be a tailwind to 2013 MLRs?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan, review that again.", "Dan Schumacher", "You're right, Kevin, that will provide a little bit of help in 2013 as we collected our premiums, the cost of that tax in 2014 in the commercial space.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, good. Maybe I was misreading it, but it sounded to me like you were saying it gives you a feel there's some sort of headwind that had to be dealt with. It's actually just more on the commercial membership side that you're talking about? And if you believe that it is in some ways a headwind on the commercial membership, does that mean that some of your competitors, I guess, most of the non-profits because the for-profits have kind of indicated a similar pricing dynamic to use. Does it mean that some of the non-profits are not following that strategy?", "Dan Schumacher", "We really can't comment. We don't really know the strategies others are following. This is an element that is part of our rate development. The headwinds we talk about are a fact of the market coming to grips with this element of pricing as it goes into our rate development process. So really, that's what we are talking about. You're right about it being a tailwind in terms of that element, and we really aren't going to comment about how others are going to approach this. Any further things to add?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I just think, Kevin, that the pressure that we're talking about is really the increase in pressure on -- pressure on already strained employer, consumers, federal and state governments. It's really the pressure it adds to the system, as it adds another cost in the environment. And I think just in terms of how this is recovered in 2013, I do want to clarify that it is ratable. So if you're a February 1 effective date, we would be looking to recover the month of January in 2014. So 1/12, 2/12, 3/12 and so forth.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, as the year goes on, that would increasingly be a benefit, but then as you roll into 2014, it's now a net mutual aspect. But I guess as you thought about that, I think it's accounted for that you expected margin compression in your business lines. Is that because the thing with development is not going to re-accrue into net even though you're going to have a pickup and a tailwind at 2013, the fact that you don't assume favorable development, they wash? Or how do we think about that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, the only thing I'll leave there is that we do not assume development going forward. We believe our reserves are set appropriately, and so we don't really have a view of reserve development going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to stick on the industry tax subject, and maybe if you can just talk about what some of the latest feedback that you're getting from CMS and from the states. Is -- if you're guiding anything in terms of how they're planning to build in the tax into the rates for Medicaid and for the Medicare products?", "Dan Schumacher", "So, Scott, good morning. With respect to Medicaid. Again, this will be an element of the cost structure that will go into our rate development. And this, along with all the other factors that go into rate development, will be part of our dialogue with our state partners over the course of 2013, as they start to set rates that flow into 2014. So I would say that conversation is on the horizon in earnest. And then on the Medicare side, it is going to be one of the factors that we consider in our -- developing our bid strategy and bid approach for 2014. So as you think about the first 6 months of next year, we'll be taking into consideration the health insurance tax, as well as all the other changes, and then trying to ultimately preserve the value of the benefits that seniors really enjoy.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So Dan, is it fair to think about for Medicare that we won't actually be seeing when CMS gives us preliminary and final rates for '14, and there won't be an adjustment in the rate? It's more that the industry will need to adjust the benefits and the pricing to accommodate the tax?", "Dan Schumacher", "I won't comment on CMS rate setting. I think our expectation is that as we formulate our bid approach, we'll need to consider this as another element in that approach.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "CMS will have to consider it as well in terms of how they survey the private sector market for Medicare. So these conversations are really just beginning. This is really, just will be getting introduced at this point in time across basically all the elements for rate development, whether it's commercial or whether it's in the government programs.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jason Gurda with Leerink Swann.", "Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "One of your peers recently commented on their expectations for margins in the small group and individual product in 2014 on the exchanges. Can you provide may be a little bit of commentary or perspective on what you're expecting or how you expect the margins or how you expect the changes to impact your margins and maybe your perspective on what your competitor had stated?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure, Gail, you want to touch on this?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Yes, well, why I don't Jeff and I give you a little perspective. I'm not going to make some comments on our competitors\u2019 perspective on the marketplace, but I think we want to put this a bit in context. The small-business market has always been a very competitive and a very transparent market. That's the market we've done very well in. We see it as a robust market, and quite frankly, the focus has always been about on affordable price point, strong consumer engagement, and making sure that you have a cost structure that underlies that strong positioning. So as we think about exchanges going forward, there's a wide range of expectations around the migration to exchanges, and we expect that to be measured as we head into 2014. Part of that is due just to the ability of getting these exchanges up and running. The second one is that employers, as they think about the tax advantage they currently have and then the need to have to make that up in compensation or other things, that's one of the reasons we do think it's going to be measured. But with that, we do expect that there will be pressure in margins over the long term, and again that goes back to underscoring the importance of having affordable plan design, strong network composition, making sure that your cost structure is aligned. But we do also see opportunities for growth, given that opportunity, given the positioning of ourselves in the small-business market, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to comment a little bit about that as well.", "Jeff Alter", "It's Jeff Alter. I agree with Gail's comments about the existing small group market. I'll also just remind that we have been involved in exchanges for quite a long time, certain states, certain industry associations. So some of the lessons learned there, I think are applicable as well for product design, choice around network construct. So there's still a lot to know about the exchanges. Things are being developed right now. We don't have all the rules. But I think as the exchanges become more firm, we will engage with the -- those constructs and apply some of the lessons that we've learned over the years in our small group business and in the participation and the number of exchanges to that marketplace. We don't -- we see it as just as another distribution in another marketplace, and we'll react to that marketplace like we have the deal with all the marketplace.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And the only thing I'd add is that there's really nothing new there. That basically reflects our thinking and our posture probably for the last 2 years or more. So there really isn't anything new. Those pressures have been there, and we expect them to remain.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just wanted to come back to the cost trend real quickly here. Relative to the initial trend guidance, is it fair to say that the new level is down entirely because the utilization, a component of trend is lower than relative to original expectations? And then I guess more importantly going forward, is -- even at when you started this year at up about 1.25% or so, is that sort of the new normal that we should think about is the right level prospectively? Or would you guys assume that, that eventually does reaccelerate?", "Dan Schumacher", "Chris, this is Dan. On the cost trends, the improvement in our guidance, that 50 basis point improvement at the mid-point, that is a blend of improvement both in utilization and a little bit better unit cost. So both are making a contribution to our 2012 cost trend view. As we think about our cost trend into 2013 in the commercial business, we expect the trend to be relatively stable.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple quick questions. Are you assuming in kind of your cautious outlook the potential for the fiscal cliff and other situations not to be resolved favorably enough to have potentially a similar situation to what we saw in '08 with medical trends? And can you highlight your low-income PDP bidding strategy in terms of kind of what you were thinking there?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So to -- I'll have Dirk kind of talk to or the -- who wants to do the Part D, okay? And then are the elements of our fiscal cliff and so forth specific? No, I think they're part of the landscape and what we talk about when we talk about the pressures that are on government and so forth. I don't know how one would actually feather in that in a specific way, but it is clearly a factor in our caution list as we think about 2013. So clearly, we recognize it. Clearly, we're focusing on its impact in terms of potential impact on government programs and so forth, but nothing that we can actually specifically do, but a good reason why we stay more cautious than perhaps the marketplace. And with respect to Part D?", "Jack Larsen", "Jack Larsen. So on the Part D saver plan, I guess as market leader we had a point of view that we need to be serving the broader market. So we set out really to design a plan that appeal to those consumers who are really more, I guess economy minded, more sensitive to the fixed premium rather than some of the other planned features when you compare that to the third plan that we offer today which is, in comparison, relatively more comprehensive. I guess having designed that product for that consumer segment, I guess we're just happy that the plan actually have stayed below the benchmark status, and we get a chance to serve low-income population for calendar 2013.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And your assumption is that the medical trend's stable in 2013, if I hear you correctly, versus '12 not the upticks in commercial?", "John S. Penshorn", "It's John Penshorn. I think Dan was referring to a stable rate of increase as opposed to 0% year-over-year.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Anything further?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "No, the only thing I'd add, Christine, to Jack's comments around Part D is part of the -- I think the value is looking at the marketplace, as he said in assessing it, and then also our partnership with OptumRx, our ability to manage formulary effectively, our retail network, as well as our overall program. We think that adds unique value to us in our ability to play in that marketplace and broadly serve both the low-income, as well as the retail market.", "Operator", "We will go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "First of all, it is a very hard work to do everything that has been accomplished at United and everyone there should be congratulated on the execution in a challenging environment and I want to thank you, Steve, for the appropriateness of the reminder of how challenging it is, and also for the fact that the tone is more cautious, not nearly assessing the stake as it was last year, and so the stock is not having heart failure. But my question is this, we've talked a lot on this call about what happens as reform is implemented? But there is a nontrivial risk at this point that we could have the 3 Rs on the hill and then the White House. And if we've got Romney, Ryan and we've got republicans running the senate, or at least, a split senate, so 51 going to republican and the republican house. Is it possible that reform may change materially, if not go away completely in some way, shape or form. So my question to you is what happens to United in the event that reform doesn't happen? How are you positioned to succeed?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, Sheryl, regardless of what legislation went in place, some of the underlying elements in the marketplace that led to policy initiatives around making the health care system more effective and efficient, modernizing that system, expanding and addressing areas where coverage was not sufficient, access needed to be better channeled, needed to be established, making -- being able to deliver more consistent quality, getting at the underlying cost. All of those elements contributed to kind of this national conversation around health care, and the results are a first policy initiative, which was largely around the expansion of coverage. And I think everybody recognizes there will continue to be work to be done to improve the health care system both from a policy point of view and from an operational point of view. That's what we do. That's really where kind of the mission of this enterprise is. So regardless of what comes forward in terms of policy and what generations follow it, we will respond and operate and work within the system to maximize the potential of this enterprise as commercial enterprise, and to maximize our impact on the health care system in total. So if there is a change in direction with respect to health care, we will maneuver and evolve and adapt to that change. We've talked about our adaptability for years. We don't think the underlying issue has changed. Fact of the matter is, coverage needs to be better considered. Costs need to be addressed more effectively. The system needs to operate more efficiently. Resources need to be accessed in a fair way and gone further, and the consistency of the processes and so forth need to advance. All those elements are things that basically work to our competencies and the strength of our businesses. So we will just adapt, if you will, to those kinds of changes. And I think as an organizational capability, we have very, very strong adaptability skills. So that would be the response. We really -- we'll never comment in terms of the political persuasion one way or another. We will respond with what the market -- how the market begins to evolve, and we'll adapt to serve it.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "And just to follow-up. So in terms of the contingency plan, is it fair to say the entire company strategy is the contingency plan?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think the whole nature of this organization has been to adapt to that and to adapt to it, the market challenges. So the whole construct, modular development of the business built around competencies, the fact that we deploy and redeploy kind of almost on a nonstop basis is really how we approach serving the marketplace. And if there are changes, we obviously have thought through the kind of changes that could occur. We think we can respond to them very effectively.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from David Windley with Jefferies.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So, Steve, as I think about adjusting my outlook, our outlook relative to the cautionary comments that you've made on the call, I'm interested in kind of thinking about whether that is pulling back a little bit on Optum and UnitedHealthcare, or if it's more heavily weighted toward one side or the other. And thinking about Optum, you've got the UHC business coming in, preparatory costs winding off, margins in all 3 segments there seem to be progressing pretty nicely, and so it would certainly seem to point toward lower expectations on the UHC side of the business. I think most of your comments point toward that on the call. I just want to make sure I confirm and understand that being the case and in particular, that it would be in the commercial risk business that you would point to as being the -- maybe the area of greatest weakness, for a lack of a better word.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Actually, our goal is really not to provide that kind of specific guidance for you today. Really, it is really more of messaging that we take perhaps a more respectful and cautious view of the market in total. We also recognize 2012 has been a strong year and has benefited from a number of positive things which we hope we'll continue, but we can't be sure of. We're certainly confident in our Optum business, but we're also very confident in our United health care business and businesses. The commentary around the commercial marketplace is almost identical to last year. I mean, we were saying the same things last year about moderation in terms of growth in the commercial risk segment, and we're saying it again this year. We are down about 200,000 in commercial risk, and we consider that to be a moderate level. So we are not trying to signal alarm in any particular area. We are really just suggesting that 2012 has been a very strong year. We expect 2013 to grow in both revenue and earnings. But as we sit in October of 2012 and assess the challenges ahead, we hope to continue the strength of this performance. We're actually in a good or better position than we were at this time last year, but we think we are being cautious and we think the market should be cautious as well, and that's all I can offer you until we discuss this at the Investor Conference in more detail, which is just a little bit more than a month.", "So as we wind it up, I think UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver a solid performance in the third quarter. We remain cautious about the challenges ahead, and we certainly have discussed that well. Perhaps most critical, though, in terms of the challenges we're continuing to work to really improve the quality of the health care system to control the rising cost of care, and to really work to serve the people that we serve across the enterprise. So as we said today, we're very optimistic that we have the people of this company. We'll rise to the challenges across-the-board, and we look forward to seeing you at the Investor Conference in just a little over a month. So thank you very much for joining us this morning.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 17, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the conference over to President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our strong 2012 growth and earnings performance, affirm our outlook for 2013 and discuss in broad terms how and why we see 2014 and beyond as a period of continued growth and opportunity.", "Full year 2012 revenues grew 9% to $110.6 billion and net earnings were $5.28 per share. 2012 per share earnings increased 12% year-over-year, attributable to both broad-based growth and intense management of medical and operating costs.", "Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum exceeded their fourth quarter revenue and earnings outlooks from our November investor conference. Cash flows from operations of $7.2 billion were again 1.3x net income. Fourth quarter cash flows were $1.7 billion or 1.4x net income for the quarter. And we ended the year with $1.1 billion in nonregulated cash. We raised our dividend by 30% earlier this year and repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares.", "Before reviewing these results in more detail, I would like to discuss a couple of recent topics we believe have been prominent in the minds of investors. The first topic is exchanges. There is significant interest in the impact exchanges may have on the sector in total and on UnitedHealthcare specifically. We can share our thinking about exchanges only in broad terms at this point, recognizing, one, there's still many significant unknowns with respect to how exchanges will begin and actually work. And as you know, details in this sector count. So we are holding back on making specific decisions in many cases until greater clarity can be established. And secondly, the way we think about exchange markets and how we may position ourselves state-by-state with respect to exchanges, we see to be proprietary competitive insights.", "So to begin, we are advocates of efforts to expand coverage to as many Americans as possible, but we would never have drawn the line at exchanges alone. If you want to expand coverage, then use every channel possible, make it easy, convenient, ubiquitous. We advocate that exchanges be a level playing field and fairly regulated. The more complex exchanges become, the greater the potential for unintended market distortions and therefore, the greater reluctance to use them.", "Health care at its core is local. Theoretically, there will be as many as 100 very local market exchanges, 50 for individual coverage and 50 for small group, and that's just the beginning. You can expect each will operate somewhat differently. So there is a great deal to evaluate before pursuing any of these exchange markets, similarly to what we do today for Medicare and Medicaid.", "The level of interest in exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market, how the exchange and its rules are set up state-by-state and our market position relative to others in the market, as we see it today and as we evaluate it going forward. And that equation will evolve and change over time as exchanges mature. So going in positions on exchanges will be just that. We are not tied to them in one direction or another. Broadly, we would expect to participate in a number of exchanges. We're not going to offer a precise number but a broad range, perhaps from 10 to 25 or more with absolutely no firm commitment to that range.", "We will only participate in exchanges that we assess to be fair, commercially sustainable and provide a reasonable return on the capital they will require. And like Medicaid, if we are in a situation or market dynamic that we do not see as sustainable, we will either not participate in the first instance or ultimately withdraw. Similarly, we will continually evaluate state-based exchanges that may not have been attractive when initially introduced. So as they mature and evolve, if we see them as both fair and sustainable, we would look to participate. And in a perfect world, we would participate in them all.", "Exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on ultimate member migration patterns for each market, the pace of that migration and its impact on our established membership. We do not expect these impacts to be dramatic or necessarily negative to us.", "Today, our individual and 2- to 50-member risk-based health benefit businesses contribute approximately 10% to our total earnings. Their margins are consistent with our overall commercial insurance results. And the feedback we receive from this community is that they remain committed to offering health benefits to their employees. So while these earnings are still meaningful, we are diversified to the point where we do not feel compelled to engage in any markets where conditions leave us uncertain as to long-term viability.", "There has been speculation as to how exchanges will happen by September 30, 2013, and what their impact on 2014 will be. And the simple answer is we don't know. The idea that robust exchanges, whether state-based or federal, will be enrolling large numbers of individuals or groups by September seems challenging. And our sense is the initial consumer and small-business response may be modest. But we are committed to being ready. We believe we have strong product offerings that are valuable to the market in terms of quality, access, affordability, innovative design and service excellence. And these characteristics and features are compelling in or out of an exchange channel.", "In the long term, we are expecting and preparing for an exchange category of coverage to become established as a new benefit category between Medicaid and the traditional commercial benefits markets. We anticipate this category will have meaningful participation that we will serve in the majority of those markets. That it will be a rational product category with sustainable margins and that our businesses and our earnings will grow as exchanges become more established.", "Moving to pricing and medical cost trends. There has been no shortage of commentary about the 2013 commercial pricing environment across the commercial benefits industry. The positioning of the ACA insurance fee and rate review and approval process is across states and against the backdrop of 2013 commercial medical cost trend outlooks. We can only comment on our experience. We've just seen the commercial pricing environment strengthen from that in 2012 in general. We have nearly 70% of our 2013 business priced and the markets have been rational in our view, competitive but better than 2012 for us. We have been very steady in our pricing disciplines year-to-year, consistently adhering to and aligning to our forward view of costs, and we take measured membership losses and instances where we cannot get our price, as we did in the commercial risk markets in 2012, and expect to again in 2013, as we discussed at our investor conference.", "We have a broad and diverse portfolio of innovative product offerings that align to buyer values, so we are able to hit a broad range of price points. Accordingly, our membership losses have been relatively muted, particularly when considering the ongoing impact of funding conversions. We have included the ACA insurance tax and other ACA cost factors in our 2013 rate filings. We are working effectively with our state partners through the rate approval process. As always, some had been more challenging than others. At the end of the day, we must price to our costs. And if we conclude that a state's posture on commercial insurance pricing is not economically sustainable, we will have no choice but to withdraw from that market. We have not been put in that position to date.", "Our medical cost management capabilities have steadily strengthened year-by-year and our networks are very cost-competitive. We have a market-leading spectrum of pay-for-performance arrangements, now exceed $20 billion in annual medical spend. Our 2012 all-in commercial medical cost trends were effectively managed to under 5.5%. And we are constantly refining and intensifying our health care affordability efforts. We remain comfortable with our 2013 medical cost trend outlook range of 5% to 6%. We are confident in our pricing disciplines, the yields we are achieving and our resulting 2013 commercial care ratio outlook, which remains unchanged at 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Now turning back to 2012. Both business platforms produced strong results, well above our expectations as we entered 2012. UnitedHealthcare grew by nearly 2 million people in the U.S. and added 4.4 million in Brazil late in the year. And revenue grew by 8% year-over-year. 2012 operating earnings was $7.8 billion, exceeded our most recent outlook. And our fourth quarter operating margin of 6.1% was stronger than we expected. We expect that ever-improving alignment of benefit designs, consumer engagements, clinical management and care delivery relationships to deliver quality healthcare for consumers, along with competitive cost performance in 2013 and beyond.", "Optum grew earnings from operations by 14% in 2012. Optum's disciplined simplification and integration agenda is advancing at the same time its revenue growth is accelerating and expanding its margins. In the fourth quarter, all Optum segments grew both earnings and operating margins year-over-year, driven by business growth and the benefits of investments made in the first half of the year. As 2013 begins, we remain optimistic. Both Optum and UnitedHealthcare are solidly on plan as we move into the year. Our businesses are executing well for customers and we continue to grow market share.", "The initial OptumRx customer transitions and new business installations across OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare have been virtually seamless, including our new Medicaid assignment in Kansas. UnitedHealthcare's preparations to serve TRICARE, which will begin in April of this year, are going well. And we have been awarded the opportunity to serve an estimated 20,000 people in the Florida state Long-term Care Program beginning in August, 2013. UnitedHealthcare is also beginning on an exclusive basis to market to the Medicare beneficiaries residing in The Villages in Florida, the largest retirement community in the U.S. We continue to feel positive about our Medicare growth across all product categories.", "UnitedHealthcare is experiencing strong January medical membership growth, in excess of 600,000 people, led by Public and Senior sector growth and positive results for our Employer & Individual. Strong fee-based commercial growth should more than offset the expected decline in risk-based products caused by the weak employment market and UnitedHealthcare pricing disciplines.", "We're also experiencing strong growth in Part D. UnitedHealthcare created a new, affordable basic plan for consumers nationally and elevated its large 4 million member plan to an enhanced plan status. The change to enhanced status changes the seasonal patterns of earning recognition, shifting more of the profits to later in the year with no impact on full year profitability.", "For Optum, we expect 2013 to show a strong growth, with operating earnings advancing in a range of approximately 35% to over 40% above 2012 levels, as we previously communicated. The Optum businesses are seasonal in their progression of earnings, and we expect the first half and second half contributions to be proportionately similar to 2012, say, 40% in the first half and 60% in the second.", "Our annual outlook for 2013 remains unchanged with the revenues forecasted in a range of 500 -- of $123 billion to $124 billion of net earnings and net earnings in a range of $5.25 to $5.50 per share. The rest of the 2013 financial coordinates we shared with you at our November 27 conference remain consistent as well.", "Perhaps I can offer a few comments on consensus earnings estimates for 2013. In total for the year, we are in the same general zone as the Street, which is typically oriented to the top side of our $5.25 to $5.50 per share range. We see quarterly progressions somewhat differently with our progressions more oriented to the second half of the year due to such things as the dynamics of growing seasonality, the mechanics of the Part D program and the like. And we should mention again that last year's first quarter had more than $0.30 per share in prior year net reserve and rebate development, which we do not forecast.", "So the takeaway is on an annual basis, the upper end of our guidance is in the general zone with consensus. The quarterly progressions we see for 2013 favor the back half of the year more than the current consensus numbers would suggest, something on the order of a 3% to 4% shift from the first half to the second half with most of it coming from the first quarter.", "Our capital disciplines remain focused and consistent. 2012 was an unusually active year in terms of acquisitions and business development. We expect 2013 to be more moderate. We continue to forecast operating cash flows to range from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion with capital expenditures to stay within a range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. As we have said, we will look to continue to advance and mature our dividend in 2013, a process our board will address in our midyear session. And we expect to repurchase shares near to the $3 billion end of the range provided at our investor conference.", "Despite the fact that we are only 16 days into 2013, there is an unusual level of focus on 2014, given the anticipated ACA changes. Our foregoing comments clearly indicate that we do not have any unique insights or precision around the 2014 performance outlook. And as always, there are other potential factors impacting both the broad marketplace, as well as our specific industry sectors, that may influence 2014 performance aside from ACA-driven market changes. What we can say is that based on our view of what is known at this point and for our overall mix of business, we do not view 2014 in a negative light relative to our expected 2013 earnings per share outlook and that 2014, 2015 and beyond hold the potential to be periods of positive growth and opportunity for our businesses.", "Factors that play into that perspective include a belief that the federal administrations, charged with ACA implementation, are interested in smooth implementation and sustainable adoption, interest shared by critical policymakers and legislators. A meaningful number of ACA market changes have already been introduced to the market: minimal MLR rules, benefit and coverage expansions, et cetera, with limited disruption. Administrative and regulatory guidance to date has been rational, predicable and  reasonably collaborative, given the nature of the ACA legislation. There is certainly a great deal more to work through and significant unknowns. But so far, it has been manageable. In the end, the ACA expands an enormous national healthcare market that will be served by the private sector.", "As we have said from the beginning, the ACA will reshape some market rules but will not change the basic nature of the market needs for high quality healthcare at affordable costs and for a higher-performing overall healthcare system. The ACA will not determine who will respond to be the ultimate long-term winners or losers in serving those market needs. The ACA actually intensifies the demand for the core competencies we deliver through our businesses. They are knowledged to optimize care resources and capability to manage, both high quality clinical care and costs, information to inform and align healthcare for optimal performance on both individual and overall system levels and enabling technology to make it all work in modern and efficient ways.", "Over the last several years, we have shaped our enterprise as a uniquely adaptable construct of market-facing businesses that serve the critical market that the ACA is expanding. Today, our businesses are performing at more consistent and higher quality levels than ever before. We have simplified our businesses to be well focused and coordinated. We are more integrated and scaled with steadily increasing productivity. We've been driving market innovations at higher levels than at any time in our history. We have invested in brands and have steadily elevated our market visibility and reputation. We have strong and deep leadership and have been investing in our people and our culture.  We have maintained an appropriate balance in our capital stewardship, steadily returning more capital to investors while building, expanding and diversifying our businesses for long-term growth.", "While working this change agenda, we have continued to execute consistently on the fundamentals. Since 2009, UnitedHealthcare has consistently taken market share, having grown to serve 4.5 million more people in the U.S., while positioning to serve another 4.5 million people in Brazil. Optum has been formed, aligned, rebaselined and on its way to doubling its 2011 earnings over a 4-year period, significantly increasing its relative contribution to our overall earnings.", "At the UnitedHealth Group level, our financial performance has been distinctive in a recessionary environment. Since 2009, revenues have increased $23.5 billion or 27%, operating earnings are up by nearly $3 billion or 46% and net earnings have grown by more than $2 per share from a base of $3.24 per share, an 18% compound growth rate. We have generated cumulative cash flows from operations of more than $20 billion over those past 3 years. We dedicated a portion of this amount to repurchase nearly 200 million shares at an average price of about $43.50 per share, reducing our weighted average shares outstanding by more than 11%.", "This is a different company than it was a decade ago, different than just 3 years ago, and it will be predictably different 3 or more years from now. We will remain disciplined in preparing for change in growth. We're established in our markets, growing market share and producing strong and dependable results for shareholders. We expect to continue to serve healthcare providers, governments and consumers, to grow and deliver positive results for investors this year, in 2014 and in the years to come.", "So the takeaways this morning in our mind are: strong 2012 performance across the board, 2012 commercial cost trends favorable to forecast, 2013 commercial pricing competitive but better than 2012 for us. We're focused on 2013 growth with outlook in line with our previous guidance. We are working effectively with states, care providers, regulators, the broad group of participants in the healthcare market. And we are preparing for 2014, including the introduction of exchanges in the market.", "So thank you for your time this morning. I hope we've been helpful in answering a few questions. But we'd like to hear your areas of interest today. So could we ask the moderator to take this over? And we'll begin to respond to questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the side of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My question is on the outlook for Medicare Advantage. And just hearing your comments about the pragmatism of the implementation so far, when you look at all of the provisions that are impacting Medicare Advantage in 2014 and '15 in the interest of \"parity\" that seemingly without regard to the supplemental coverage that you're providing for low and moderate income seniors, do you think those provisions, as it stands today, are manageable? Or do you think that they will need to be revised as you move through the next 3 years?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I would say if you're basically saying as it exists today, we would always have an appetite for things that would offer, let's say, more flexibility and more responsiveness in the marketplace for Medicare Advantage. And we would also hold a view that Medicare, in total, would benefit from themes of what I would might call modernization of the program. And we see those things most effectively in the private sector today. So our posture on Medicare Advantage is that we would be advocates of continued change and kind of proactive change around themes of modernization. As it relates to kind of the specifics of the regulations and the elements that are affecting rates and so forth, I think we would prefer things to be somewhat -- to otherwise, but I think that it is manageable as it exists today. We probably don't have -- we think that if -- for things that move further, would really start to impact beneficiaries, affect quality of care, that there would be significant pushback if there were greater activities going forward, as you deal with elements like the fiscal cliff and things like that. I don't know if, Gail, you want to comment or Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "I think Steve said it right. The only thing that perhaps I might point out, Matt, we certainly always would have a fairly short list of things we perhaps might suggest modification, more modernization of anything. But a lot of the provisions with healthcare reform are things that we are doing more broadly across our business. So for example, a focus on payment for success and outcomes and the like that are embedded in Stars Rating. Those are things that are really good and should be preserved. Would we might have a different point of view on the individual elements? Of course. But I think the bigger things that are in play are things that will ultimately be good for Medicare Advantage and certainly Medicare broadly.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, it seems like you were comfortable in saying that you see no real reason why you wouldn't be able to grow earnings in 2014. Does that relate -- hearing that correctly?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, from this distance and given the opportunities in front of us, yes.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. So outside of the exchange uncertainty, which I think we all understand, can you walk us through your main business segments and let us know anything that you believe would take you off the typical growth path? I know you have a 13% to 16% target. Matt just mentioned Medicare Advantage. Anything you could tell -- anything further you could tell us there, Medicaid, some of the other segments that might be different than what we typically see year-to-year?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I'm not sure I fully understand the question. But if you're asking what -- again, what gives us a sense of why '14 could represent continued growth and opportunity is that if you look at across the expanse of our businesses over the last several years, as a lot of these elements have been formulating and coming into the marketplace, we have been growing market share, growing in our commercial businesses, growing in Medicare. States have been responding in terms of Medicaid and expanding. The military business is coming online. Our Optum businesses are getting -- really establishing some very positive momentum as they mature. At the same time, their growth opportunities seem to be taking off because of the pressure in the healthcare system in total. And then there is the opportunity to do this all over again in Brazil off a platform that is already market-leading. And that's a pretty good hand to be holding at the moment in particularly in a nation that's looking for positive change and higher performance out of its healthcare system and a population that continues to value high-quality benefits, modernization and innovation that comes to those benefits and costs. So costs matter, and we are all over costs in terms of the focus of our clinical programs, strategies with our networks and so forth. So -- and I think that we are executionally trying to take this enterprise to a next level of performance. So those factors suggest to me that we have as good a chance as anyone of growing and performing in the marketplace.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Do you expect to grow EBIT next year? Or are you talking about EPS?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'm talking about growing earnings. And I have no interest in giving guidance on '14 at this distance. So you ask me what themes, that's what we responded.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Appreciated some of the comments on the exchanges. And just interested if you can give us some early thoughts on the 3 Rs now that those have come out and whether you think they will be successful in helping to mitigate adverse selection in the exchanges.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So Gail, Dan, you want to...", "Daniel Schumacher", "Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I think that the guidance that came out was generally in line with our expectations. With respect to risk adjustment, the only modest changes that when you start sharing, it happens a little later than what I think people were generally thinking. But we do you think it is some level of protection in the new market.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "And the only thing I would add, this is Gail Boudreaux, in terms these comment on exchanges overall, while the 3 Rs are important, the fundamental economics and structure of the exchange is equally important. So as we think about that, the discipline of that analysis, I think, around the exchanges and where you participate makes a lot of -- is very important to us.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick one, just to sort out some of the one-timers that were in the market more for the fourth quarter. Just any insights on sort of the impact of Hurricane Sandy and on utilization in the New York Metro area, and then sort of impact on the flu, if you saw any.", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure, Scott. This is Dan again. With respect to the flu, yes, we did see an elevated flu over what we would consider to be normal in the fourth quarter. As we look at that, it added about $50 million of incremental expense beyond what a typical flu is. We did have some moderation with respect to Storm Sandy as well. And we would put all of those things together as well as look at our flu experience through the first 3 weeks of January, we feel comfortable with our trend outlook for 2013.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter medical cost side. It looks, on a consolidated basis, MLR is up 80 basis points but commercial is flat. I think this is the first quarter in a while where there's sort of a deviation between trends on the government side versus the commercial side. Can you provide any color there? Was there anything in Medicare and Medicaid that's worth sort of highlighting?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Chris, this is Dan again. No, I don't think there's anything to highlight underneath there. The fundamental change in the group loss ratio came down to the change in favorable development year-over-year. And as we look at each of our businesses in the commercial and in government programs, we did have favorable development. However, it was stronger in the commercial business, and that's why you see that difference and the relative change.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then I just want to try to slip one more in here. Earlier in the call, Steve, you talked about fair in the exchanges. I guess, could you just help us understand what would be something unfair in an exchange? Just any kind of detail there would be helpful. I'll leave at that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I'm not going to talk about unfair elements. I'll have Gail Boudreaux respond to this. But I think she was sitting on this before in terms of how they really work, kind of the states' postures, the federal posture with respect to making them viable and what we said sustainable markets. Gail?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Steve had sort of 3 things in his comments. One, fair, commercially sustainable and providing us a reasonable return. And as we think about exchanges just a couple of points, I guess, I'd like to start with. One is we see it as a market, not the market. So there will be robust markets inside and outside of the exchange wheel. So expect these -- the rollout to be more measured so that January of '14 is just the beginning. But in terms of your specific question, what makes it more attractive is flexibility. And flexibility around product design, clinical models, network configuration, as well as an ability earn -- to be priced essentially for the risk and earn a fair return. So as we establish and look at exchanges and the viability of those, those are the kinds of factors that are important in assessing those marketplaces.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Optum is a huge part of the growth story over the next couple of years. And it looks like each of your Optum divisions did a bit better than expected exiting the year. Can you talk about some of the major factors that are resulting in Optum divisions doing better than expected? So maybe what's going really well and ahead of expectations entering 2013?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think leadership has a lot to do with it. So Larry, do you want to...", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure, I'd be happy to. Christine, it's Larry Renfro. If you go back to last year, I think we laid out a few goals. We talked about, number one, that we were going to have a 15% ROIC by 2015. We were going to have our operating margin at 6% by 2015 and we would double earnings of 2011. As part of that 3-year plan, we dubbed that internally as One Optum. And we had 4 main areas of focus during the year, with financial discipline, reengineering simplification, portfolio management and growth with 5 main drivers: business alignment, business integration, that's one; cost management; organic growth; PBM in-sourcing; and strengthening leadership. I can say that we solidly, from our standpoint, executed and we did it in a simple fashion. So we feel pretty good about 2013. We are pivoting to growth in 2013. But I guess, it just comes down to execution. And again, Christine, we feel pretty good about where we're at today.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, one follow-up. At your Investor Day, you guys said that you see financial services companies, pharmacy retailers, consumer products companies seeking to enter the health insurance market. How should we be thinking about that? We haven't seen new entrants in a while?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I've seen elements of that. I don't know if I could really comment because I don't know what enter the market really means. If they're looking to be a distribution channel, that may be fine. I think that this is an extraordinarily complex space and sometimes the complexity of it is not as apparent to you until you actually get into it. It is also an extraordinarily locally oriented environment. So there -- it is quite a challenge to be effective broadly on a kind of a national scale in healthcare and still be really executing at the Street level. So it's a challenging environment. I think there are actually a lot of competitive barriers-to-entry. And we will see how other nontraditional participants may come into it. I take your point that there has not really been a nontraditional participant enter this marketplace that I can actually think of at least in the time that I've been studying it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Steve, just want to follow up on the comments you made around the pricing environment. It sounded like you characterized 2013 as a stronger environment. You guys haven't talked about a stronger pricing environment in a long time. So I'm curious, what are the drivers of that? Is that there's less rebate experience that needs to get incorporated? Is it the industry fee or new cost for reform? I'm just curious what exactly stronger pricing environment means and any colors to what's driving that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Gail?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. In terms of your question on a stronger pricing environment, I think, first of all, we see it as a stronger pricing environment because we're achieving the yields that we set out and we are able to feel good about our benefit-cost ratio at 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In terms of the overall environment, Steve said in his comments, it's still competitive. There are a multitude of different drivers in states, and we've talked about that in these calls over the last several quarters. But we think we've got a really strong mix of affordable products in the marketplace that gives us a very broad portfolio to offer to our competitors. And we see that as a driver of giving people options in the marketplace. And I think our cost structure helps us do that. So from that perspective, we've been able to achieve what we set out at Investor Day around the yields that we talked to you about.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe just a follow-up on that, Gail. So I would look at the MLRs that you guys have recorded maybe even specifically in the commercial segment in the last year. And it certainly looks like you were achieving your pricing yields. Or is it more use of extraordinary cost moderation that was not anticipated and this year, you think you're -- I mean, I'm just trying to pare out. Are you actually seeing stronger yields relative to expectations? Is that kind of what we're seeing?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "We're seeing our yields in line with the expectations that we outlined to you at Investor Day and there's also a mix component as you look from '12 to '13. We've put a significant amount of affordable products in the marketplace, and we're seeing strong uptake on those. We saw that in 2012, and that continues into '13. And maybe I'll ask Jeff Alter, who leads our commercial business, to provide some comments as well.", "Jeff Alter", "I think with Steve's remarks, when we say we see the market, the pricing environment, we're talking predominantly about ourselves. So we still believe the market hasn't changed over the long -- we'll call it the last few quarters. It's competitive. It's rational. We measure, I guess, weakness versus a strongness on our ability to grow and retain membership. And during this season, we've been able to perform better around growth and retention of existing accounts.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So it may be as much around execution as anything else. Maybe we are just executing better this year than we did last. But we seem to be operating in a more rational way with respect to pricing dynamics and we are getting the margins that we are targeting. So I think it's no more complicated than that. And it is profoundly local. Jeff will school me on this regularly that when we talk about these things in generalities, they really come down to market-by-market dynamics.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just want to talk a little bit about the industry tax in 2014. Maybe if you could talk about sort of your initial conversations with employers and maybe even states for sort of pricing of the tax. And in Medicare maybe specifically, your plans to sort of offset that. And if you think that will have any impact on sort of the attractiveness of your product versus fee-for-service Medicare.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I don't know how -- I mean, we're not interested in revealing kind of the inner workings of some of these conversations. Generally speaking, it is a cost and we price to cost. And cost is something that is universally recognized in terms of the elements of these products and in the rate review process. So do you want to -- I think the consensus here is that that's pretty much the issue. It's basically a cost element. All the pieces of the ACA really represent elements of costs that as they're introduced are introduced into the rate approval process and are being discussed, and we think discussed in rational ways in the settings that we are in and regulators who are also trying to achieve their objectives in their respective markets. And for us, so far, those conversations continue to be constructive, professional and we will see where they lead.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then is the -- I'm assuming -- I know it's a small portion, but I'm assuming the industry tax in terms of the timing, some of it is going to be in 2013. I'm assuming that's in the guidance range for '13. Again, I know it's a small number. But any help in helping us sort of figure out what that amount is and/or what percentage of the tax that would represent to you?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think we're feathering it in as it goes through for the year. I don't know if we can actually quantify that for you in a venue like this today. But rest assured that we are -- basically, that is going in on a month-by-month basis as that legislation basically is designed.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "And nice job against a lot of headwinds, and also the commentary on the call has been very helpful. I want to focus on something that Gail said at the Investor Day and I think I heard reiterated today. $20 billion of your benefit expense now is pay-for-performance based. And then I think I heard you say that your goal was to get to $50 billion. I have 2 questions about that. It seems that that's a key to success across all of the product offerings, like many of your other activities, not just on the exchanges. But I'm curious about what has to happen differently, either internally or externally, to get to that goal, the timing of that goal. And also what -- how can we quantify or think about the impact on your performance, on your earnings performance, if you get there? Or I should say when.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think that is a great question. We have been at this. Actually, we think much longer than others. We've been in the different names. But the bottom line is it's been the same fundamental theme. We have a lot of elements structurally already in place along these lines, kind of built into our processes. So Gail, do you want to respond?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. So just to reiterate what you said. We are currently at $20 billion of spend in pay-for-performance as part of our accountable care platform. And I think that we shared that at Investor Day how we think about that, which is a broad spectrum of working with physicians, as well as integrated delivery systems around a continuum to meet them where they are, whether that's moving from just straight fee-for-service in the primary care side to including incentives, all the way up through accountable care through integrated pay for delivery full capitation. Our goal is to get to $50 billion by 2017, which is a pretty aggressive goal. We've made significant progress year in and year out. In terms of how we get there, I think it's a concerted effort across UnitedHealthcare, as well as in partnership with Optum. Optum is clearly helping to enable the delivery system with their tools and what they're doing in the marketplace. And on the UnitedHealthcare side, we're working to really change the relationship that we have working with the delivery system. And that's actually happening in each of our local markets. We're embedding it into the core components of what we do. And it's not only on the alignment of the network contracts but it's also our clinical program. We've talked a little bit about our Healthier Lives model at the investor conference, that's an integral part of getting there and what has to change in how we work with the delivery system to managed care, and then on our benefit design and our consumer engagement tool. So I think about all of those, those 4 categories together and how we get there because paying the delivery system differently without changing our internal product design and structure and our internal processes isn't going to get us there. So we look at it in a comprehensive way. So that's how we see it, and how it translates for us, I think, is into the medical cost structure we can offer our clients, the cost of products we put in the marketplace and as you see in '13, the strong, strong growth that we've got in the market. And as I think about even 2013, the strong growth we're seeing across our commercial and Medicare book is indicative of the progress we've already made in some of those fronts.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "So said differently, it enables you to price at a value of the entire package, not just the premium per months but also the value you're getting and the benefit and the access to care that actually makes you well. That, that enables you to gain market share while maintaining your discipline on margins in part.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Yes. I think that's very articulately said.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But it also gets to the issue of reducing utilization. So if I could ask a follow-up that's only somewhat related, I'll admit. There was a lot of worry and chatter going into the call this morning. What is United going to say about utilization and the utilization trends that you're seeing? And you've addressed that obliquely, I think, in telling us that your cost trend was somewhat below the mid-point of the range or the 5.5% rather, to be precise. But can you give us some commentary on what you're seeing in terms of utilization pattern? And I'm also curious as to whether utilization patterns in the quarter before we go into reform on 2014 might change at all as perhaps benefits change and how you think about that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Okay. Dan, you want to touch on that?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Sheryl, you faded out at the end. But with respect to utilization, our view fundamentally hasn't changed, which is to say that, yes, we did see an increase in utilization in 2012 over 2011. And as we've talked about the categories on past calls, outpatient is higher, physician is pretty stable and inpatient has actually been more restrained. As we look at the full year now, this is the fourth year in a row across all of our benefits businesses we've been able to reduce our bed days per thousand. So we're actually driving out utilization through our programs and through our focus. And so we're very pleased with that result. And with respect to the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit better utilization than we thought, as well as a little bit better unit cost. And it gives us comfort in our forward outlook as we look at our 2013 trend in the 5% to 6% range.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Back into the fourth quarter, looking at the performance of the commercial business versus the consolidated business, it's clear that there's something that happened in the Medicare and the Medicaid business that seems like it got a little worse beyond just the base business. I guess, I'm curious, was there unfavorable TPD in the Medicare and the Medicaid business in this quarter?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Peter, this is Dan. No, we had favorable development in both commercial, as well as our government programs in the fourth quarter.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Then the current business, did something deteriorate there in those 2 businesses?", "Daniel Schumacher", "No, it's really -- when you look at the mix of development across the businesses year-over-year, it's that change that's driving that dynamic. From a fundamental standpoint, our performance continues to be strong in both Medicare and Medicaid, despite challenging headwinds with respect to both state and federal pricing.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Would Amil have had a favorable impact on the MLR this quarter?", "Daniel Schumacher", "It's negligible. When you look at it 2 months on the quarter, not even [ph]. No, it would not.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then just last, just as a follow-up to that. Any commentary about Amil overall and what you think you'll spend there in Brazil over the course of this year for acquisitions and capital spend?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, we wouldn't even talk about that, whether it was in Brazil or the United States. But we can give you some sense of kind of how things are settling out in Amil.", "David S. Wichmann", "Yes, Peter, it's Dave Wichmann. Thanks for the question. I'll try to give you some information. It's very early stages, as you well know. We did close a transaction, the first part of the transaction at the very end of October. We also -- you probably heard that we're in market doing some open market purchases of the public stock to the extent that it was below the BRL 30.75 offer price that we had offered. So we were successful at doing some of that during -- in the November time frame. We're preparing for the tender right now for the remaining public shares, and we expect to complete that tender still in the first half of 2013. That is on track, as we have laid out both in the call around Amil as well as in the investor conference. And just as a reminder, we'll be financing that with debt. It's about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion to complete that transaction. And just generally, I mean, Amil's results are good. They have posted about $1 billion in revenues. So for the 2 months in '12, was solidly ahead on both medical and dental enrollment for the quarter, which we are pleased with. And as you'd expect, the earnings, a net of minority interests are very insignificant to the quarter. And that's what we expected, given both the -- what we expected from the business as well as the purchase accounting applications to that as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "To follow on the exchange comments, with your view now of the fundamentals and the 3 Rs, how are you thinking about the mix of small group versus individual markets that you may participate in for the 10 to 25 that you had mentioned earlier? And I'm assuming that excludes private exchanges. And then for the larger states, like California and New York, how likely are those to be broken up into MSAs as opposed to statewide exchanges? And last question on that topic, as I appreciate the breakout of the 10% individual and small group exposure, but I wanted to look at exchange exposure a different way. There's several reports suggesting employers of low-wage, low-skill employees like retail or restaurants are more likely to dump into the exchanges. So what is the exposure across your commercial risk book to those types of employers of low-wage, low-skill workers?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well. So I'll offer a couple of responses. A lot of those that you just mentioned in the latter part aren't covering benefits at all today. So those would be the ones that most of the marketplace look to be added to the exchanges. I would also offer that kind of the gravitational pull of our whole enterprise is towards the small group side. We have never been large players in the individual marketplace. I don't know if you want to comment.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Yes. The only other thing I'd add to Steve's comment -- this is Gail Boudreaux, is specifically to is this just public or private exchanges, we will participate broadly in public exchanges. We already -- or private exchanges, I'm sorry. We already do. And we see that as another distribution channel. We've been very effective over a number of years doing that. And our subsidiary, Optum, also has some significant opportunities in the private exchange marketplace. So that's a nice growth opportunity for us going forward.", "John S. Penshorn", "This is John Penshorn, Sarah. We did not count the private exchanges in those broad range totals that Steve offered as a starting point.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And the part on whether or not you think larger states like California and New York might break up the exchanges into something smaller than statewide, is that something that you're looking into?", "Jeff Alter", "Sarah, it's Jeff Alter. It's tough to comment only on what we know publicly. New York has already indicated that there will be multiple geographic-based exchanges there. And so we at least know one state is thinking more than just a single exchange.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on the exchange commentary. I guess, two points here. First, in the context of provider rates that you're negotiating. I guess, what percentage of contracts do you have signed yet? And what rates are you kind of zeroing in on? You mentioned that this product serves the partition between Medicaid and commercial. Are you seeing pricing kind of skew towards one of those ranges? And then also, as far as the commentary with the states goes, I appreciate you're looking for more clarity. It makes a lot of sense. Is there a sense for the timing around when that clarity may come into view? And as far as the federal exchange, is there a sense that, that will be a very uniform exchange? Or will they allow for flexibility to account for state variances?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me address your multiple questions, hopefully in order. First, around the pricing issue. As we said a couple of times, the exchanges we see very much as a local market dynamic. So from a pricing perspective, we see that going anywhere from commercial rates to something less. And our goal is to match our underlying economics to each of the exchanges. So we're in the process of doing that. As you know, we already offer multiple products with multiple networks constructs, and we've been doing that for a number of years. And we've aligned our payment and our network construct to the product offerings in those markets. So we're going to leverage that history. That's our experience in building networks broadly across the United States, to match the markets. And as you think about it, remember that we have to acknowledge that our products inside the exchange will also be available outside of the exchange. So that expertise will be important in building our overall network construct and offering it in the exchange. In terms of your other 2 questions, I don't know that we have great visibility or speculation on the timing of when those regulations will come out. We're obviously working really closely with our states. We have a dedicated team in place that meets with each of our markets, and we're preparing our own business to be able to support what does come out. So I don't have any great visibility into the timing of the other 2 questions at this stage.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And that's 50 different timetables. So very -- again, these are very local dynamics. We have maybe time for 2 more questions.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to get a perspective on your margin outlook for 2013 in the Medicare business. When you had the Investor Day, you had the rates for 2013, you had your own Star scores and what the margin expectations would be based on that. But since then, you've seen your enrollment and disenrollment data and your mix of business possibly relative to your competition and then one more quarter of utilization. Do you see it being flat year-over-year on an MLR basis? Is it likely to get worse or better?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, we really don't provide margin insight with respect to Medicare other than the most general themes. So Jack, do you want to comment at that level?", "Jack Larsen", "Ana, Jack Larsen. As Steve said, we don't comment specifically on margin trends in Medicare. But what I can tell you is that based on the enrollment season that we're just finishing up here effective January 1, the mix of new members that we're seeing is very much in keeping with the mix that we had anticipated in terms of individuals already in Medicare versus new to Medicare. We're really not seeing anything surprising or what we had anticipated. So on that one, I'd say we feel very good about the guidance that we offered back in November.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "In terms of the age cohorts, are you seeing more of the 65 to 67 type, the younger age mix, enrolling directly into Medicare Advantage and any mix shift likely on the 75 plus?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. That has historically been the pattern. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Yes. So exactly right. I think we are very aware of the cohort mix. And as I said, we're seeing what we had anticipated with really nothing remarkable to offer.", "Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then on the Part D side, with your new product, can you comment on your margin expectations relative to what you had even directionally in 2012? And then from a seasonality perspective, as you're guiding us to a quarterly progression, would there likely be any change?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, we don't comment on the margins with respect to that as well. We're very comfortable with where we put our bids. We have got nice market response. The switch to an enhanced plan to open up a new basic plan was a very good move. But it just moves the recognition of earnings under those programs to the back half of the year. And that's -- the geography of when the earnings come in is really the biggest change in there. Other than that, we've had a very good Part D season and put forward our bids in what we think is a very rational fashion. And I think we will be very comfortable of that. And then on the downstream impact is that it should drive a script volume to OptumRx, and that will be a positive for us as well. So that's I think all we could comment on it.", "Operator", "And we'll go last to the side of David Windley with Jefferies.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I'm focused on Optum. Your margins have had really nice improvements sequentially for the last few quarters. End of the year, above where your guidance range is for next year. I was hoping if you could comment on perhaps what other than maybe seasonality might be the reasons that, that will be lower than where you ended the fourth quarter. Second, could you comment on any early, say, operational feedback on the internalization of the Medco business? And finally, give us a sense of how quickly you can get Optum services into the Amil market and customer base?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Well, that will be our last 3 questions then. And Larry, maybe you want to start off?", "Larry C. Renfro", "Yes. Okay. David, what was the first question? I got the last 2.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Basically, the margins at Optum, that whether the fourth quarter is seasonally driven, et cetera.", "Larry C. Renfro", "I think in Steve's opening remarks, he talked about that we do have seasonality at Optum. So obviously, the first quarter, second quarter, the first half of the year, I think we gave an estimate that, that would be about 40%, 60% in the latter part of the year. That was a trend in 2012. We believe that will be -- will remain the trend in 2013. So what we're trying to do, David, is balance investments and growth with financial discipline. So we're comfortable with our plan. We're comfortable with the 3-year plan and how this all fits. But I think you're going to see that seasonality over the year. If I move into the second area, and I'll ask Dirk to comment on this as well, when it comes to the PBM in-sourcing, I think you know that was a very large undertaking over the past couple of years. And I'm going to address that on 2 fronts. The first front will be the technology, the operating platforms, the infrastructure. And I can tell you that as we progress through the year last year, we met our targets. We delivered on that. And Dirk will talk about the conversion that's gone seamless in the first quarter. The second part of the PBM, as we were getting into the commercial business, was our external sales. And I just want to comment that we kept going with sales as well with, I think, we mentioned at our Investor Day that we have made 50 deals at that point in time, about half of those deals come from the national account side, the UHC, and the other half are independent external sales. And it probably represents about 1 million new members. So maybe Dirk you can comment on your thoughts.", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes. So on the commercial migration. We just completed our first migration wave with 400,000 consumers moved from the ESI/Medco platform to our platform, plus all commercial new business. And that's gone pretty well. We're excited. Actually right now, we sort of shifted gears and are thinking about the next migration wave, which is on 4/1. So the first wave sort of out of the blocks, looking forward to the more conversions. On the sales side, all I would add is that we saw in 2012 extremely strong RFP season. We actually didn't have enough people to answer all the RFPs. We've staffed up in 2013 to be able to handle all that volume.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And Dave, maybe Amil?", "David S. Wichmann", "Sure. If you don't mind, I'm just going to take it up a level because it's very early stage right now. We've just begun our planning for the integration work that were doing with Amil. As you might suspect, most of that planning is really around the growth opportunities that exist in Brazil and possibly more broadly in the South American markets. Areas of focus for us are really in operations and technology. We think we can add a lot to Amil's platform in that respect. Growth, which is again the opportunity that exists in Brazil, and again, more broadly in South America. Clinical areas, and I think that's reciprocal. They are very confident clinically and we're very confident at managing managed care populations at our network. So a nice sharing there. And then really around infrastructure and compliance, as you might suspect as well. Certainly, many of the growth opportunities we see are for Optum. But as I said, we're just beginning to plan those activities now. Certainly, pharmacy is one of those that we are looking at carefully. And broadly, I'd just say we see great opportunity in Brazil and South America also for the benefits business. And having just been there last week, just reaffirms the terrific platform that we acquired. So we're looking forward to the opportunities of the future.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thanks. So thank you for joining us today. To kind of sum up today's discussion, in 2012, the UnitedHealth Group continued the steady growth trajectory, delivered consistently in terms of strong fundamental execution, innovation, adaptability. It is a changing marketplace, and we think we have resources to respond and adapt. While it's still early in the new year, we're well positioned to leverage our capabilities, expand our position in the marketplace. And then from 2013, we are off to a strong start in January. So we look to the -- positively to the future in terms of what we offer the marketplace, as well as what the demands of the Affordable Care Act, the Accountable Care Act will represent in terms of opportunities for '14 and '15. So we thank you for your attention, and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectation. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 17, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and update you on our view of market trends and developments as we approach 2014.", "In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.53 per share on revenues of $30.6 billion. Revenues grew 12% year-over-year, with continued diversification across businesses and product types. Cash flows from operations were strong at $3.4 billion, more than 2x our net earnings for the quarter.", "The consistency of our efforts and results is guided by a focus on serving the distinct needs of all health system participants: those who receive, deliver and who pay for care. No other company is engaged so diversely across health care. Our services all center around the same 3 competencies cultivated for nearly 2 decades: the organization and optimization of health resources at the local market level, the application of data and the enabling use of advanced technology.", "Over the long term, this approach continues to produce distinguishing results: record growth from those who have experienced our products and services, well-controlled medical and operating cost trends and improved affordability and access to health care. The emergence of public exchanges, private exchanges, Medicaid expansions, growing dual eligible and long-term care need, accountable care experimentation, rising consumerism and the confluence of these elements have the potential to create new opportunities for us to grow and serve in new ways. We continue to adapt to the market's changing need. We offer consumers and customers an unparalleled array of health products, services and capabilities, and we are steadily advancing along themes of consumer responsiveness, simplicity and affordability.", "Turning to the quarter. Our 12% revenue growth, solid earnings results and steady operating disciplines grow strong cash flows of $3.4 billion, bringing year-to-date cash flow to nearly $6 billion. As expected, the third quarter operating margin of 8.6% decreased from last year, primarily due to government underfunding of the Medicare Advantage program and nearly 40 basis points of impact from lower reserve development. These were partially offset by strong margin expansion in Health Services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.", "Operating costs were well controlled at 15.9% of revenue. Our percentage operating costs are 20 basis points higher than the third quarter 2012 despite year-over-year services growth of 25% or more than twice the growth rate of health premiums. That said, we have intense efforts underway to continue to increase the overall level of productivity and realize cost savings across our businesses.", "Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was comfortably under 35% at September 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in available cash. Year-to-date shareholder dividend payment increased nearly 30% to $777 million. We have purchased about 37 million shares so far in 2013 at an average price just under $64 per share, bringing our pure share count now under 1 billion shares.", "Turning to business level results. UnitedHealthcare earned $2 billion on revenues of $28.4 billion in the third quarter. UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues as the fastest-growing health benefits company in the market. It increased the number of people served by 24%, nearly 9 million individuals, over the past year. This includes more than 2.9 million people in TRICARE and another 4.8 million people in Brazil, both new markets for us.", "Within our traditional domestic markets, growth has also remained strong. Over the last year, we have grown to serve 1 million more people today in the employers, individuals, senior and public markets. This growth is varied and diverse across geographies, products and market segment. UnitedHealthcare is achieving consistent results by aligning modern benefit design with strong consumer engagement, empowerment, tools, programs and incentives. These are further aligned to targeted clinical management and wellness programs that channel care delivery through a focused set of networks with proven performance capability and with progressively higher levels of care provider financial incentives for quality outcomes and patient satisfaction.", "For many years, we have used our commitment to and insight into local market communities to shape our capabilities to fit each unique market as a provider of health benefits. These same local market insights and relationships play out in our accountable care strategy, which continues to differentiate UnitedHealthcare.", "We closed the quarter with more than $25 billion in annual medical spending, driving a spectrum of first-generation care provider performance incentives. Today, the health care experience of more than 2 million people we serve are directly aligned, end-to-end, through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk and bundled episodic care payment approaches.", "We entered into several new ACO partnerships in the quarter, including our first multi-entity ACO with Quality Health Solutions, a collaborative of 4 hospital systems and the Medical College of Wisconsin, all in the southeast corner of that state. More importantly, we are making significant gain-sharing payments to several of our ACO partners based on the actual outcomes they are achieving to improve quality and care effectiveness and efficiency for patients. This includes Optum's care delivery network earning payments for its work to improve performance for both UnitedHealthcare and organizations outside UnitedHealth Group.", "In the third quarter, UnitedHealthcare growth was, again, led by senior market performance. We added 100,000 seniors with Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement benefits and sold 95,000 additional Medicare Part D drug plans. We expect to finish 2013 with market-leading growth momentum coming through these Medicare offerings. We have already grown by 670,000 people in Part D through the first 9 months of the year.", "While our overall Medicare star ratings for 2015 have advanced year-over-year, we believe we can and must execute much better than these ratings reflect. We are intensely focused on steady and significant improvement in this critical performance area.", "In Medicaid, UnitedHealthcare grew by 15,000 people in the quarter and was honored to be selected for new awards serving Florida and rural Texas, which will begin over the course of 2014. The number of consumers served through UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual grew by 30,000 in the quarter despite expected in-group attrition. 2013 will be the fourth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare grows commercial membership organically. And UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans membership in TRICARE was well served, but this transitional issue is now well in hand.", "UnitedHealthcare International has added almost 400,000 people so far this year, with particular strength in the large group market. Our UnitedHealthcare International medical assistance and clinics business continues to grow and advance, recently receiving new contracts to serve the global oil and gas industry in the Middle East, Africa and now in the North Atlantic.", "Optum's technology-enabled services, again, grew strongly in a market sized at over $500 billion. Our growth potential is particularly compelling as we continue to develop broader, more integrated long-term relationships with larger clients who are pursuing new approaches to the market.", "Earlier this week, we announced the formation of the Optum360 business with our partner, Dignity Health. Working collaboratively and applying advanced Optum technologies, we expect to improve revenue cycle performance end-to-end, from the perspectives of both patients and care providers, across Dignity's 39 hospitals and 300 care centers in 21 states.", "Through the Optum360 business, we are together creating the next-generation performance organization dedicated to bringing these resources to serve a broad base of large health care systems across the U.S. To that end, we are engaged with other care provider systems and believe Optum360 will develop into a sizable and impactful business.", "Earlier this week, we announced a multiyear extension and expansion through 2020 of our new 15-year relationship with AARP. Through this extension, we will continue to advance the overall missions of AARP with the broadest offering of senior products and services around health and wellbeing.", "Also this week, consulting firm Mercer announced it was using both the Optum multi-carrier private exchange platform called myCustomHealth and UnitedHealthcare's dedicated exchange platform to serve benefit choice needs of retirees and larger employers.", "And earlier this year, we created Optum Labs to combine and analyze both clinical and administrative data from large patient populations. Insights from Optum Labs' research will advance knowledge and understanding of every aspect of care delivery, from care protocols to therapeutic agent performance and more. We expect these research efforts to lead to new and better products and services and improved overall system performance.", "The Mayo Clinic Health System is a founding partner of Optum Labs, as is AARP. And other important national relationships are also in various levels of engagement. With these, Optum Labs has the potential to effectively become the national research platform for health care data analytics.", "These initiatives, combined with several other important business relationships and awards this year, are the results of our efforts to align Optum around 3 major growth drivers: modernizing health system infrastructure, aligning and enabling the highest quality of both effective and efficient care delivery and engaging the consumer. These drivers define the broad business opportunities emerging as health care evolves and support our optimism and confidence in Optum's sustained double-digit growth. And Optum's operating performance was strong again this quarter. Each business repeated double-digit revenue gain. Overall, revenues rose 33% year-over -- over last year to $9.6 billion, led by the 41% increase at OptumRx.", "Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 6.6%, despite the increasing mix of comparatively lower-margin pharmacy revenues. As of today, our OptumRx pharmacy migration is 96% complete. More than 11 million consumers have transitioned and are now served by OptumRx. Our team has successfully executed the largest-scale and most complex membership transition in the health care industry.", "Optum's strong revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, has driven exceptional earnings performance. Optum's earnings grew 54% year-over-year this quarter and 69% year-to-date. Optum is now contributing nearly 1/4 of UnitedHealth Group's operating earnings, up from 16% 1 year ago. We believe Optum will achieve our 2015 margin target of 6% in 2013, 2 years earlier than originally planned.", "The combined and complementary performances of Optum and UnitedHealthcare produced very solid third quarter results, as we discussed at the outset, with quarterly revenues up $3.3 billion over last year, driven by increasing diversification, producing earnings of $1.53 per share with cash flows of $3.4 billion. We're achieving our full year results against headwinds ranging from intense government reimbursement pressures, including an unplanned $0.15 per share sequestration impact and $0.17 per share in lower reserve development as compared to the strong reserve development levels of last year. And we're getting there while continuing to make significant investments in our businesses, including the increased level of fourth quarter investment in OptumInsight.", "All in, we are tightening our outlook for 2013 net earnings to a range of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. At the raised midpoint of $5.45, this would translate to a strong 15% year-over-year earnings growth targeted for the fourth quarter this year.", "Our balance sheet strength continues to differentiate UnitedHealth Group. In the past week, both S&P and Moody's affirmed our corporate debt ratings and upgraded their outlook. We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and expect to return $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend.", "Looking forward, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook to be impacted by overall Medicare Advantage funding levels, as well as the effects of a nondeductible insurer fee on Medicare, as we indicated in our last earnings call. The significant and continued level of underfunding cannot be fully offset in 2014 from the performance effects we expect from the balance of our health benefits market, and we see limited potential for dramatic further improvement in overall medical cost trends, recognizing how well medical costs have been controlled over 2012 and 2013.", "We fully expect Optum to again grow and perform strongly, and we are well along in far-reaching efforts to improve productivity and control operating costs across the entire enterprise. And we will, as always, endeavor to use capital judiciously.", "Given that overall landscape, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook, which we will introduce and discuss in detail at our December 3 investor conference, will once again begin the year with a broad earnings range that will likely straddle, to the upside and to the downside, our current year performance outlook of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. We will, of course, be focused on performing to the highest possible level. 2014 and 2015 represent periods we have long described as challenging in the near term, followed by the potential for several years of growth and advancement once these markets changes are digested. The history of market changes in the health care sector over the past 50 years bears that out. Our own historical performance provides some context. It is worth noting that today, we generate more than $1.5 billion in operating earnings from businesses we were not even in at the start of 2006. We have grown earnings per share at a 14% annual rate since the end of 2009, accompanied by strong cash flow growth, while going through the most prolonged economic and employment downturn in nearly a century.", "Over the last 10 years, we quadrupled our market share and health benefits from a starting point of 3%, yet today, we are only 13% penetrated into the overall U.S. population. While we have the largest enterprise serving the Health Care Services market, we estimate our penetration into that $0.5 trillion market at just 6%. Today, our businesses serving Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries are approaching parity with our 30-year-old commercial health benefit businesses.", "Optum is ahead of our \"15 by '15\" commitment and moving rapidly to our goal of representing well more than 30% of our overall income contribution and growing at a strong and accelerating pace. We are committed to thoughtful growth pursuing the international market, where emerging economies and fully developed nations both recognize the need to meet the growing health care needs of their people and are looking to the private sector to play a key role.", "And here in the U.S., we have recently taken important steps for the adjacent primary care market focused on serving populations whose needs are high, where we can make a positive difference to them and to their benefit sponsors, one of the most fragmented yet influential of all sectors across the health care landscape. We can only be certain of one thing, that UnitedHealth Group will look meaningfully different 10 years from today. We are committed to being a differentiating factor in a better health care system and to grow and productively use capital in the process.", "We look forward to your questions today, so we turn to the moderator. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question. Just a follow-up on your 2014 commentary, Steve. I just want to make sure I was clear on that. So it sounds like the UHC business will be down in earnings year-over-year, with Medicare Advantage driving down. Any color on how the commercial and Medicaid businesses will look?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes. Well, we're going to kind of try to keep our -- this call is not the time when we get into the details of this. We provide guidance at the investor conference, and I really don't want to front run that process. So I will leave it kind of in the context that we put it, that when you look at the businesses in total, pressure that's on the Medicare Advantage program from the funding pressures that we have talked about for some time, and then look at the performance of the balance of the businesses, each of whom have their challenges and their opportunities both, we come out in a range that, as I said, straddles with both upside to where we are today, as well as probably a downside starting point. And that's largely where we think we'll probably position 2014 as we go in. And we're going to try not to provide a great deal more detail than that other than the portfolio has that potential within it and that we are focused on a number of things that we think will drive towards the upper end of that performance. But that execution remains to be done, and so we will kind of keep it in that kind of context this morning, and then we'll talk about it in much more detail when we get to the investor conference.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a question on Optum. Can you give us some color on the Optum360 revenue opportunity post the Dignity announcement? And also, on the PBM, can you give us an update on the Medco integrations and how you're positioned heading into the '15 selling season?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I'll let Larry kick that off.", "Larry C. Renfro", "So Justin, it's Larry. I'm assuming you read the announcement about our arrangement with Dignity Health. As we said earlier in the year, we were going to try to establish what I would call a larger, deeper, more complex relationship with our clients, and I would say that Optum360 is an example of that. We won't go into the detail of contracts, or we won't go into the detailed numbers, but what I would say about that is that it is a multiyear, multi-billion dollar contract, and it is a next-generation RCM that we are starting with them that will -- candidly, will simplify patient billing and -- as well as modernize health care administration. So a nice win, nice venture that we put together, and more to come on that. And I'll ask Dirk to handle the PBM.", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes, thanks, Larry. I guess what I would say is the PBM migration and the success has given the market confidence that we can compete. It's given us a lot of scale to be able to purchase more effectively. And I think, candidly, our synchronization, as well as specialty value propositions, are resonating well in the marketplace. So my commentary on '15 is that ultimately, we've -- not a lot has moved, but what business has moved, we've won more than our fair share. So I think we're really well positioned for '15.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question, please? And we'll try to keep it to one per. That was a nice portfolio of questions on that one, but we'll try to keep it to one each.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe I'll just ask you to flesh out a little more on your comments about the Medicare Advantage outlook. Obviously, you've now got some competitive information available. Can you give us your assessment of the landscape moving into next year, prospects for overall enrollment growth in that segment and maybe for the market overall, if you have any thoughts on that? And anything you could say on the margin outlook on that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I'll have Jack comment on that. But I think, as we look at the benefits, we see that and our position as pretty positive. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "Thanks, A.J. Good morning. So in 2014, once again, we are looking at a market opportunity that expands upwards of 3 million seniors or so, many of whom who we think will be well positioned to select Medicare Advantage. And I think in our planning this year, we started where we start every year, and that is with identifying the benefits that seniors value most while keeping the year-over-year total cost ranges to them as low as possible. This year was obviously made far more difficult than prior years given the reductions in the effective rates that we received versus the expected medical cost trend. So you have, I'm sure, no doubt seen some of the competitive plan offerings. And while it's still very early in OEP, I think today is the third day of selling, I'd have to say that we're pleased. We're pleased with where we positioned ourselves competitively in our key markets. And we're pleased with some of the things that we are seeing in terms of the leading indicators coming from our field sales teams, our web portals and the busyness of our call centers. Now in terms of growth, I think, as Steve shared in his opening comments, we had industry-leading growth in 2013, something we're very happy with. I would say at this distance, though, when we come to you at the investor conference, we will be positioning our growth as moderating off of the sort of blistering rate we've had this year. And keep in mind that we're approaching 2014 with almost 150,000 people impacted by our plan withdrawal. So I'm sure we'll have lots more to say about that at the investor conference in the next few weeks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.", "David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. I had just a question on the private exchange, and if you could talk a little bit more about your strategy there, how you guys are approaching it and what sort of success you're having this year, as well as the enrollment cycle that's going forward so far?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Gail, do you want to start it off?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. First of all, in terms of the overall exchange market, we see -- we're very positive about it. We see it as a significant opportunity both for UnitedHealthcare and for Optum. And I think one of the things to remember, the private exchange market isn't brand new. While it's certainly seeing some acceleration going into 2014, we have had offerings, strong product offerings and feel very well positioned in a number of those markets. Thinking about the private exchange market, I think you have to think about 2 subsectors of it. One is the retiree exchange, and that retiree exchange has had a very consistent movement over the last few years of employers moving into either group Medicare or into private exchange offerings. Again, our product offerings there have continued to grow and are very strong. We also offer, through Optum, an opportunity to do a multiemployer exchange, which has seen increased enrollment and we expect to see solid enrollment going forward. The active space is really getting a lot of recent press. You heard, in Steve's comments, our offering. We participate pretty broadly, actually, and again, feel that we have a very strong product offering in the private active exchange, and we expect to continue to see growth. From our perspective, there's a number of different types. Certainly, the movement from a self-funded offering to a fully insured offering is a positive for us. But overall, we're pretty optimistic and positive, and we see them as an expanding distribution channel going forward. And maybe I'll ask Mike Weissel to comment a little bit about the Optum opportunity because we work mostly with Optum as well and see their opportunity.", "Mike Weissel", "Thanks, Gail. David, this is Mike Weissel, Executive Vice President at Optum. And from our perspective, we really see 2 major opportunities for us in the exchange marketplace. The first is just acting as an enablement platform using our myCustomHealth platform to work with payers, providers, states, employers; really, anyone who needs that platform for doing an exchange. But maybe the greater opportunity and the more exciting opportunity for us is how we utilize all the Optum products to assist our client. So any company moving to a private exchange often has a greater need for incentives, wellness, care-management capabilities to create a consistent experience across their membership. And we just see a strong market for ourselves over time in really using our services to meet that need.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So for us, basically, exchanges have 2 dimensions. It is a great new channel for us, and we'll participate in that channel. And then for our Optum business, it is not -- we can not only be a channel as that, but also enable others. So we really see exchanges as having 2 business dimensions for us. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I'd like to zoom in a little bit on the cost trend commentary, about it not being a helper going forward. And also, combine that with the fact that payroll PPD went from sort of a helper by $100 million last quarter to a headwind of $100 million this quarter. Can you contrast that with your commentary and talk about whatever you see going on with the medical cost trend?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. I'll have Dan talk to medical cost trends. But we've had very strong performance in those over the last 2 years. And I think our only signaling was there's only so much you can expect to achieve out of that, so I think that was really the nexus of it. I don't think we're really planning on offering any new or enlightening views about where trends will be. Dan?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Peter. Dan Schumacher. With respect to our medical cost performance, as Steve said, we're very pleased with it over the course of the year thus far. But obviously, this is a space where our work is never [indiscernible]. As you look underneath it, I would tell you that inpatient is an area that continues to be very distinguished for us. So as you look at each of the 3 quarters this year, in each of our 3 businesses, we have lowered our bed days. And that's been true for the last 4 years. So doing well on the inpatient side. As you look at the commercial space, in particular, we've had, against our expectations, some improvement in the outpatient as well as we continue to focus our program around out-of-network spend, around the appropriate site of service and things like that. When you put it together at the commercial market level, we have a trend expectation that we provided was 5% to 6%, and we now expect to be at the other lower end of that range. As you think about the development, I wouldn't read into the variation of that quarter-to-quarter or business-to-business. Some of the factors that influence that, obviously, is our operating performance stability. But also, those programs that I was talking about, in outpatient as an example. As we introduce those programs and they begin to come into -- in full effect, we start to realize those in our actuarial process. So there is differences in timing quarter-to-quarter and business-to-business.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And last year, we did have exceptional levels of reserve development, and that fits into the narrative of the contrast between the third quarters -- third year [ph] of '12 versus '13.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Christian Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just wanted to touch a little on the Medicaid business and the industry fee there. I know we're getting kind of late into 2013 now. Any sense for whether you expect some margin leakage there because of the tax? Do you think you're generally going to be made whole in most states? Any color would be helpful.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Steve Nelson, want to take that?", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. Good morning, Chris. It's Steve Nelson. We actually have made a lot of progress in that area since last quarter. We have a twisted [ph] kind of level, so we have a very robust and consistent rate advocacy process where we're consistently engaged with our states around rates in general, and the insurer fee and the tax impact of that is a part of that ongoing conversation. And I'll tell you, at this point, we have about 1/4 of our states that have formally committed to including both the fee and the tax impact in the rate. And while we have a lot more work to do, the conversations we've had so far have been very productive and positive. I would say, very much in line with our expectations.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. I appreciate your -- the fact that you're probably not going to have an ability to put a fine point to this at all yet at this point, but just the commentary around the headwinds to MA for 2014 just kind of beg the question about what the implications are for 2015 because, as we look at 2015, we already know we have the health care reform cuts to the rates. We have the clearing adjustment. We have the industry fee increasing. We have -- you mentioned the stars maybe didn't improve as much as you would want them to. So there's a number of headwinds in 2015, which may argue that the rate situation in '15 might not be dramatically better than 2014. So I just wanted to understand if there's any good reason to think that the headwinds in '15 would be any better a starting point for thinking about what 2015 looks like as to kind of how you think about how 2014 is going to shape up.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I think you have a good list of the headwinds that we all see and have talked about, so you have been attentive to our calls over the last couple of quarters. Those are the things that concern us about, basically, the funding approaches that have taken into the Medicare Advantage program because it does serve 1/4 of the U.S. seniors and is the fastest-growing and, by far, the most popular of the programs. So that's why we have been vocal about it in that context. So those headwinds are real. Now we are clearly pushing back against those in terms of how we're approaching the business. And I'll let Jack speak to some of the actions that we're taking along those lines. And our star performance clearly has to improve. We are not pleased with our execution there, and that is something that we have to address. But we are positioning that business, and that business has grown very nicely. And we want to kind of balance the position of that business and continue to grow it because long term, Medicare Advantage and whatever other products come forward in the private sector as Medicare are going to be important because the pressures that you're seeing in the funding from these programs are the pressures that are felt in the program in total, and the private sector is the best outlet for that. I'll let Jack...", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just before you can get the clarification...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll let Jack respond. Sorry.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was just going to say that -- yes, I'd love to hear Jack's perspective. But just to clarify, do you feel that 2015 headwinds are the same or worse or better than what you're seeing for 2014?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We don't know. I would certainly hope that funding actions are stronger than they were -- have been in the last couple of years. And then unique to us, I think that we need to improve our star performance, and that's going to affect us in '15. That's the thing I would say would be unique to us. Jack?", "Jack Larsen", "So hey, good morning, Kevin. Jack Larsen. So I guess, maybe, first things first. You've articulated all the headwinds that we're seeing. And we certainly, early on, recognized that the shifting of all of the legislative and regulatory prompted rate reductions, recalibrations, insurers' taxes, channeling them through benefit design changes to seniors would have been absolutely crushing, both to them individually as well as, I think, to the sustainability of the program itself. We also recognize that, notwithstanding that point of view on overall reimbursements, that we have a responsibility to ensure that we are doing all that we can to make sure that we make the basic product as affordable and as accessible as possible. The kind of work we're doing is making sure that we have the highly performing, best-in-class networks that are aligned not only with us and the physicians, but with the members as well. We are doubling down on efficiency of our clinical programs. And then, of course, the never-ending battle we wage on operating cost. All of that sort of goes in to make the MA program sustainable in individual market. And so I think with the work we did in 2014 puts us in a good position to take on those challenging headwinds in 2015. Let me spend a moment on stars since that, I think, was embedded in part of your question. I would say, overall that we're pleased with the progress we've made. We have almost 2.5x more of our members in 4-star or better plans for 2014 that will impact the 2015 payment year. And you need to keep in mind that, that star rating represents the activities that we did in 2012. So while that's a nice percentage gain overall, I'd have to say that we're admittedly starting off from a relatively low level. And we have, as Steve said, much more work to do to get to the point where we're making the progress we should. I can tell you that we have an intense level of focus all around the company, starting with Steve on down to the UnitedHealthcare organization. Also, within our Optum colleagues. Who are really a significant part of our overall success.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We are focused on this sector, for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So I guess I want to talk a little bit about MA in the context of the overall UnitedHealth Group. And I think you guys historically have talked about the sort of 13% to 16% earnings per share growth. Obviously, we're not going to get too close to that this year. And then it sounds like -- I don't know what straddling means exactly, but it sounds like the midpoint should be something relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. So it would imply -- and if the overall business is growing even just low teens, then MA is going to be down by 1/3 in terms of profitability next year. And so I look at your market actions, and I understand there's been some product exits, but you guys are entering 4 new states -- or counties in 4 different states, new counties altogether. And so I guess I'm just a little bit confused as to what the actual magnitude in terms of the headwind on MA. Are we really looking at a business that's going to lose 1/3 of its profitability in 1 year?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Now so, again, let's go back to the first question. We'll talk about 2014 in more specific terms at the investor conference, and we will go through each of the business lines along those lines. The pressure on MA is not a new subject. We have been talking about this through the course of the year. We have a lot of opportunities to improve the performance of that business, but we have to take a look realistically at the funding levels that have been imposed there. And the other businesses also have their individual pressures. So we're going to talk about them on a line-by-line basis at the investor conference and then as a total portfolio. But if I go back to the range, we are clearly focused on growing earnings in 2014. And the range that we're beginning with encompasses that upside potential. And I don't know, I think it's appropriate for us to be very direct with you all about the headwinds that are in the marketplace, and we have done that with you each year, and to position ourselves appropriately in a range because there are a range of performance outcomes that could occur as a result of those headwinds, not all of which are fully predictable. But we are putting forward, I think, an appropriate and, I would say, positive context when thinking about '14, that we are discussing a range that has upside performance above the upper range of our current year performance. So I think I would walk away from that, to my view, in a positive context. There is a lot of work we will have to do to perform that upper end, but we are clearly focused on that.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So I think, Steve, I think I understand the context in which your range will encompass potential upside relative to this year. I guess I'm still trying to figure out and quantify what the actual impact from MA, as you guys have talked about the funding challenges as you...", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Josh, I know you're trying to quantify that, but we are not going to get into quantifying...", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "December 3.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "MA or commercial or Optum or any of the other businesses this morning. Otherwise, there will be not much left to talk about at the investor conference.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'll also show up on December 3.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could help us think about how pricing is shaping up in the market for commercial and individual and small group, both on and off the exchanges? And then, without getting into too much detail, maybe if you can help us think directionally about how you're thinking about enrollment for commercial large group and national accounts for next year.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So maybe Gail to start out, and then Jeff to comment.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Good morning. A couple of questions there. Let me start with the pricing question. First, on the commercial pricing environment, we've talked about this on, I think, every call I've been on. It remains a competitive environment. What -- this year is a little different in that every year, we see -- I call them different themes that play out in each of our local markets. And some of those themes this year are around what I'll call very selective disruption. It's not broad, but there are some of that playing out, as well as some of the early renewals that are occurring in the market. I think what's important to know about our approach is we haven't changed our pricing approach. It's staying very consistent, our controls and discipline are staying consistent, and our focus really is around the value-based products that we put in the market over the last couple of years and feel that those will resonate very well. In terms of -- I think your second question was on national account enrollment. I'm going to ask Jeff to comment on what's happening there. But before I go, actually, you had asked about pricing in the public exchanges. And our comments on that -- as you know, we have taken a very modest position in the public exchanges. And unlike any other new entry into a market, these are structurally different market-to-market, very similar to our existing portfolio, so you have to look at those. Again, our approach in those markets is very consistent, and we look at things that are basically 2 functions when we set our price. One is the expected cost of the product and network configuration is an important part of that, and then the expected cost of the people to enroll. And that discipline has stayed very consistent. As we look at the pricing across the public exchanges, you would expect to see a broader range because of it being a new market and, quite frankly, the network product configurations that are in the marketplace today. So I don't think that's unexpected, but that's essentially what we are seeing. And I'll ask Jeff to comment on the national account marketplace.", "Jeff Alter", "Thanks. Scott, it's Jeff Alter. Now just to wrap up with Gail, so on pricing because, obviously, pricing and our enrollment outlook are tied together. So again, we remain unchanged in our discipline in our pricing to flow with cost. And sometimes, as you know, over our history, in doing that, it can tend to cause us to give share back within the short term. So as we think about our enrollment in '14, keeping it at high level, obviously, sitting in the middle of October, there are a lot of things still to play out. But we do expect our enrollment to be down next year. And as Steve said in his comments, we've come off a string of very successful years, but we expect that down to happen primarily in a couple of areas. One, we've mentioned that the national account season, early on, had a structural change in that the pipeline for new business and existing accounts was the lowest we had seen in a number of years. And probably based upon all the changes at the national level in the health care system, many of our national account clients sat still. We've mentioned it before in this morning about the impact of private exchanges, which we think are going to be positive overall financially. But as we do transition some of our businesses and some of our clients that are total replacement into an open exchange model, it would be prudent to believe we're not going to continue to have the total population back. But financially, it's still a very good trade. And then we've got our individual business, which I'll start right out by saying is not a large contributor to our financial performance, but we do have about 900,000 individuals who will be impacted. So that's -- those are those tranches. And then I think we've talked about this, and the world knows about this, the largest driver of our outlook for down for next year is the loss of that large public sector account, which we are protesting but, at this point, believe it's appropriate to say that's a loss. So those are the -- that's where we're looking at our outlook. Obviously, we'll have a lot more detail in December for you.", "Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And if I could just clarify on that. So are you saying that when you say expect to be down, is that overall commercial membership, or is that both overall commercial membership and national accounts membership? I just want to make sure that we have that clear.", "Jeff Alter", "Both.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to go back to public exchanges. And I know you guys provided some commentary already, and obviously, you guys have taken a more cautious stance, at least initially. I guess, again, now that you've seen the pricing, are you surprised at some of those levels and maybe some of the strategies some have taken? And then any concern of sort of spillover effect onto the commercial pricing environment over time because of that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Gail, you want to...", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "So I'll go back to -- again, there's a few embedded questions in there. The pricing environment in the public exchanges, again, ours is a pretty modest footprint. And there, I think it's hard to draw conclusions at this stage from what we see in the pricing from that market because it is based on a whole group of factors that are not necessarily in the broader small group market. So I think that's the first thing. And it does really rely on the estimate of the product configuration, the network that was chosen, as well as the expectation of what the population of enrollment is in that network. So from that perspective, again, while I can't comment on others, we did expect to see some diversity. And we think over the long term that as people get experience and understand what's happening in that market, we will see that come into a tighter range would be our expectation. And then in terms of our pricing philosophy, I keep going back to we've been very consistent. We're keeping that same consistent methodology. The one change that's happening in the marketplace, as you know, is the market is going to adjust to community ratings. So that is a change in the marketplace, but it's something we're well prepared for, and a large part of our business is already in that model given the states we work in.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Steve, I'm very intrigued by your commentary, more qualitative, obviously, than quantitative, about 2014 because my sense is the early perception of the initial straddle guidance, in loose terms, was negative. And yet when you clarified it, which was very helpful, you suggested that we walk away from it positive. And I think it was negative because it was seen initially, early e-mail contact, as being a reversal of your prior commentary, which, on the second quarter call, I think you said that you're intensely focused on, if not committed to, achieving -- finding ways to achieve growth in 2014 despite the headwinds. So let me just clarify, if I may. So you said you'd walk away from this positively. Stock is down. Obviously, the street's walking away from it negatively. This seems to me to be a continuation of what you said before, except represented in a range around current year guidance. That's question #1.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That's exactly right. So I don't know how many questions you'll have, but that one, if -- go back to our commentary, and we do pay attention to what we said in the prior teleconferences, we see today's commentary to be completely consistent with that. We would always put them out in a range, and what we are really signaling is that, that range will have an upper end, and we are basically confirming that today.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Right, okay. So that is good news because obviously, with all the headwinds, it could have been negative. So the real question, if you can give me some qualitative sense, are the things that would have to go right to get to an upper end of that range versus a lower end of that range in very broad terms, the positive influences that you see, because we've heard a lot about the negatives. But I'm interested in the opportunity to achieve that upper end, which, again, would temper the negatives for today or decide maybe it's inappropriate to temper that negative.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll do my best. But basically, we laid some of the trends out in the teleconference. We expect our performance on our services businesses, our Optum businesses and the services business in United to continue to grow and perform strongly. We said that in the teleconference. We must execute at very high levels along things that are hard to do because the medical cost trends have been so well managed. We have to continue to not only manage them well, but manage them better than we have. We have to execute on strategies we discussed before on Medicare, around -- focused on specific targeted markets, narrowing networks, ever effective -- there are areas where we could make progress in terms of effective care management on the ground level. It would be in the Medicare book of business. Those kinds of elements, managing and taking our productivity and operating cost disciplines to a next-level performance, which I think we are very capable of doing, are all areas that we see as opportunities. And kind of even to just the last area of discussion, as I think you all well know that sometimes, to improve performance and improve it on the long term, you have to do things in the short term that don't -- that have a longer-term logic to them. So you have to really hold the pricing discipline. Sometimes, you will have to give back some memberships to the marketplace to perform more strongly in the current year and going forward. So all of those elements that you would imagine, we have to do and we have to execute well on. And as we do, we will position ourselves for an even stronger performance position for 2015 because all those things we talked about are structural in nature. And then beyond that, we see growth opportunities that come on to a much higher, a much more rigorous platform. That is, in essence, the elements of the plan. We will be laying those kinds of things out in the investor conference. And to the first part of your question is we put out a range that has a -- acknowledges an upside to where we are today, as well as a downside, because I think we have a responsibility to acknowledge the headwinds that are in the marketplace. The notion that we are putting out a range that has an upside to it, we think, is completely aligned and consistent with the conversation we had last quarter. We are focused on growing earnings of this enterprise. It will be difficult in 2014. We've said that before. But beyond that, we think the things that we're going to do are going to improve and strengthen our business going forward. And we have very strong businesses and growth opportunities in Optum, and we haven't even touched on international. So that's why I think we do take a positive attitude about where we are.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one question on the Medicaid business. You touched on the headwind from the industry fee there. I think, though, when we had visited you guys a couple of months ago, Jack, you, in particular, had highlighted that, unless I misunderstood, that the Medicaid businesses, on an overall basis, you expected earnings to grow in 2014. I'm just -- I'm trying to match that up with the size of the headwind that you might be facing. And maybe some of it is just going to be timing because the rates will catch up, but how do you get there with the industry fee not reflected in many of the rates?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I think we can go back to Steve Nelson's comments, but I think what he was offering in his discussion about overall rate advocacy is whether you can pinpoint that element in the rate response from the states. We are getting rates that would suggest that we have opportunity for growth in 2014. So I would have said that, to me, was one of the more positive elements in terms of his commentary. So I think we are getting that kind of overall rate relief. Steve, is that correct?", "Steve Nelson", "Absolutely. There's not only, within that, a positive view and the opportunity to grow earnings, but tremendous membership growth as well. And that will come from a lot of sources, but our geographic footprint is really strong. We're in states that we've developed great partnerships with, and we're bringing innovations and capability and have demonstrated competitiveness with recent wins. And so I think there's a lot of opportunity. We feel pretty positive about the -- in that business.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. That was an important clarification.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.", "Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So a question on the mix shift that you're highlighting with the sizable fee-based growth this quarter, as well as last quarter, I believe, you commented on it. But looking year-over-year at the change in your operating cost number, as well as your cost of products sold number, those 2 things together are up about $700 million year-over-year. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of that increase is attributable to the fee-based growth, and should we think about kind of a higher level of operating cost going forward?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Maybe Dave Wichmann would be best to cover this. But when we talk about operating cost relative to that, we're talking about services. So we're talking about the difference between insurance premiums versus services. There are some services in UnitedHealthcare, but the big pieces of services are Optum. Virtually all of Optum's businesses fall into that category. And a significant portion of Amil, as well, because Amil has those significant care delivery services. All of those elements contribute to that. So those are the elements that are growing very rapidly and are outgrowing our premium-based arrangements and creating the higher proportion of operating cost versus medical cost because medical costs only come through on risk-based products. Dave?", "David S. Wichmann", "Yes, so a couple of things. First, I think, specifically to the lines you're looking at, if you look at our services growth year-over-year, it's 25%. And if you look at our products growth year-over-year, it's 19%. And those 2 things are disproportionally pushing our operating costs up, which are up about 14% year-over-year, and our cost of products sold, which are up about 17%. So you can see, just by the very nature of those few line items, that there is a significant influence there. But maybe in the context of the operating cost ratio being up 20 basis points quarter-to-quarter, I could demonstrate this more fully. The single largest driver of that increase has been and in this quarter, it's no exception, continues to be mixed business exchanges. And most are the things that Steve just laid out. We had a large funding conversion this year, as you recall, in the first quarter. That, of course, reduces our revenue side. We have Amil included, and Amil has a higher operating cost ratio in the business. We brought on TRICARE, which is a significant fee-based arrangement. And of course, the results at Optum are eye-popping in terms of the growth, and that's largely services-based business. That, again, is the dominant component of that. But in addition to that, we have been implementing ICD-10, PPACA, implementing TRICARE and reimplementing it, unfortunately, this year as well, but also this PBM migration as well. So again, a large contributor to the operating cost ratio this year. I'll tell you, these are significantly offset by the productivity advances of this team, very significantly offset. I'd say our productivity is not only at the upper end of the range we typically have given you, but it's an additional 50% more. So very, very strong results this year in terms of the way we've managed that. So in general, we're very pleased with our operating cost results and the progress we've made in containing them, and that's something that we're committed to doing into the future as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Can you speak to how you're thinking about public exchange accounting? Specifically, can you reasonably accrue for these 3 Rs? And there has been some talk of a plan-initiated data share program to aid on understanding market average risk scores if CMS doesn't provide it until '15. So is this something that United is considering participating in? And how valid is the insight from this group, meaning how much of the exchange market may be participating in the data share?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Dan, do you want to take care of that?", "Daniel Schumacher", "With respect to risk adjustment, I think it's important to recognize that it's not something that's unfamiliar to us. We've got a couple of our large states and very successful states where we have modified forms of risk adjustment today. And also, we operate in Medicare Advantage, which, as you know, has a big risk adjustment to it as well. To your point, we have absolutely participated with a third party to gather industry information and get some feedback on where we sit. And based on that information, as well as our past experience, we feel very comfortable with our ability to estimate the results as we get into 2014. And the other thing that I think is important is our size and geographic diversity is another thing that plays in our favor with respect to risk adjustment.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "It sounded like you have already participated with this third party on sharing information. So is there enough out there to kind of tell what the average health of the exchange is? Is that more costly or sick?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Yes, we've participated in 2 cycles of that right now. And we will again, in the first quarter, participate in another cycle of that. And they're endeavoring to get 75% of the market participants at a local level, segmented by small group and individual. So we'll be able to -- based on that information, we think we've got a good sense of it. And also, again, our size and geographic diversity are things that will be important to us.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Is there any comparison you can offer to your traditional commercial book, how much more sick these people are?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So I think we might be getting a little muddled in this because I think you might be asking about does this give us insight into what we think the public exchange mix looks like. And I don't really think we're going to get -- we really don't have an experience with that, and I don't think it is our place to comment on that. I think Dan was commenting that the size, diversity and geographic spread of our book gives us a perspective of being kind of very average across the nation. We're a good proxy for a national platform. Is that right, Dan?", "Daniel Schumacher", "That's right. And Sarah, this obviously relates to both on and off exchanges business in small group and individual. It's really -- that's the reference around our size and scale, not our exchange participation, which, as we've said before, is modest initially.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Okay. So I'm sure we'll be talking and touching more about that at the investor conference as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to focus on the OptumHealth business earnings, up roughly 90% this year, and that's come mainly from margins running 300 basis points above your expectations. So just the 2 related questions there. What's driving the margin expansion within OptumHealth? And do you think a 10% margin is sustainable, or should we look, going forward, for that margin to return to more historical levels?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Larry and John, do you want to touch that?", "John S. Penshorn", "Before we start, Carl, can you clarify, are you asking about OptumHealth? Sorry, this is John Penshorn. Are you asking about OptumHealth or Optum overall? I don't follow your question.", "Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "OptumHealth, specifically.", "Larry C. Renfro", "So Carl, it's Larry Renfro. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to ask John Rex to jump in on this. When we look at Optum, we look at the 3, what I'll call, the 3 organizations, and we have a margin range of each one of them. And OptumHealth is 8% to 10%, and OptumInsight is 15% to 19%, and OptumRx is 3% to 4%. And we try to manage this throughout the year. And I realize that we had a very good quarter in the third quarter. But I would say that over the 12-month period, based on mix, seasonality and investments that we're making, that we still believe that, that range in Optum -- in OptumHealth is going to be in that 8% to 10% range. So we don't see anything that's changing that. I think Steve commented that overall, and I'll just say this, that we believe that this year, we'll finish at 6%, which was one of the goals that we have set for 2015 for Optum overall. But maybe I'll ask John to comment on this in more detail.", "John Rex", "Yes. So if we look at, in particular -- so first of all, I'd comment that when I look at OptumHealth and the performance 9 months to date, and actually I'd kind of broaden it a little bit and talk about Insight and Rx also within that context, that when I look at the 9 months, we're within the range of those long-term guidance ranges we gave you. So 9 months to date, within OptumHealth and OptumInsight, we're running at the high end of those ranges. And within OptumRx, we're running just about in the middle of that range. And that would be our expectation going forward. I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, we see impacts from mix, seasonality and investments that we'll be making in the businesses. So that's why we stick with those long-term ranges that we've set out. If I would think about OptumHealth particular in terms of the 3Q and some of the highlights, I'd say the entire portfolio of businesses within OptumHealth were performing well, but I'd maybe point out local care delivery, our population health and our health-related financial services businesses as all strong contributors. But again, very much speaking with that long-term range that we've laid out for these business, as we will continue to invest.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And I think in total, if you look at Optum as an emerging enterprise, that there's scale opportunities there that are meaningful. And I think when we talk about things like One Optum and so forth, that's what we're really talking about is that we have opportunities to, we think, continue to improve the performance and yield of that business.", "Operator", "We go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Following up on Optum. I'm hearing a couple of things I just wanted to clarify. I'm hearing that we're within the long-term range of margins that we expect, which suggests that margins will be -- probably not move much next year relative to this year. But I'm also hearing it's an emerging enterprise with scale opportunities. Scale opportunities suggests to me kind of margin improvement opportunities. So can Optum grow earnings at the same pace in '14 as they did in '13? How do I think about that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So let's go back to the very first question of the call. This is, again, more triangulation around '14 that we would really prefer to save for the investor conference and can then actually present those things in a coherent and kind of fulsome basis, see all of the offerings across the enterprise, their relative challenges and their relative opportunities. There are clearly opportunities in Optum. We are clearly looking to improve its performance, grow its earnings, improve its margins, but we're not going to comment specifically on '14 until the investor conference.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Well, then, taking a different question, then. If we look at Amil, can you talk to how that's performing? And is this an investment year? How do I think about this year's Amil performance relative to kind of future opportunity?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Well, I think we have great growth aspirations for Amil, and I think it's performing on or above its plan. But Dave, do you want to talk...", "David S. Wichmann", "Yes, Christine, Dave Wichmann. For the first 9 months of this year, Amil is ahead of its financial plan, both in terms of growth and profitability. So obviously, we're quite pleased. I think the economy in Brazil is shaping up to our expectations, so it provides a nice platform, if you will, for growth. We are seeing that growth in the business, both in terms of our membership growth on medical lives, which are up about 365,000 since we started, and then also in the general marketplace as well, which are up about 400,000 lives since we commenced just under a year ago. I think that growth is really the great assessment of the strength of Amil's offerings and the value of its -- what I'll call semi-integrated delivery model and its ability to offer higher-quality, as well as cost-effective, products in the marketplace. This quarter, we're experiencing winter, so it's kind of counter-seasonal for what we see here in the United States. So as expected, earnings are off related to seasonality relative to our overall expectation. Just on the integration front, it's going very well. I'd just point out 2 things. One is we're really working with Amil to, I'd say, bring a more modern technology and operating infrastructure to that marketplace, which, I think, is a great opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves in the market around service, quality and whatnot in addition to the clinical quality aspects of the model that they offer. And likewise, we are -- they are, in turn, helping us with ideas around clinical care delivery and how that integrates in local markets and drives the peer performance on behalf of the consumers we serve. So overall, you should take away from all that, that we're quite pleased to date with our Amil relationship.", "Operator", "We'll go to Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on OptumRx. Given the fact that you're at the tail end of the Medco integration here, I was wondering if there are any plans to differentiate your specialty pharmacy management offering, given your unique positioning in the marketplace.", "Jack Larsen", "Yes, sure. Well, we have a couple of philosophies on specialty. And the first one is we really focus on adherence because adherence for these very sick patients provides lower medical cost for our customers. The second thing is we want to eliminate drug waste, so we do a lot of work with respect to making sure that we take lab values and the like, make sure the treatments are working. And the last thing I think we're doing from a specialty standpoint is we have great visibility into the medical benefits, so we can see and manage about half the spend that resides there.", "Operator", "And we'll go last to Steve Halper [ph] with FBR.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just looking at Insight, OptumInsight. Over the last few years, you've been focused on Optum One and focusing on certain business lines. How is that progressing in terms of achieving the overall efficiencies, as well as what were the stronger performers within Insight during the quarter?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Larry, you want to kick that off, and then Bill?", "Larry C. Renfro", "Yes, and I'll kick it over to Bill. The overall One Optum plan, and I think you said this, had in it for 2013 that we were pivoting to growth. And pivoting to growth, what we had talked about doing was really being able to position ourselves to attract what I -- and I said this earlier, a larger, deeper and more complex relationship. And the Optum360, the Dignity deal, is a good example. That is part of OptumInsight, and Bill can talk a little bit about that. I can tell you that, as we go down the road here, the pipeline is very strong. We think we're well positioned in the marketplace. And I think that you're going to see more and more of these larger organizations that are going to be part of what I'll call planned investments that we have to put in place as we still have to -- we really have to develop and innovate as we become more of a potent solutions-oriented organization. So we're positioning, for the future, a lot in the OptumInsight area. So, Bill?", "Bill Miller", "Yes, I think we continue to see, specifically, our compliance offerings expand. A lot of the work that we're doing with payers around payment integrity and, to Larry's point, our provider businesses, as we continue to create depth with them and, really, the One Optum strategy coming together to really give more end-to-end oriented solutions is being, I think, very warmly received by the industry. The latest example of that is the Optum360 relationship with Dignity. And I think we're seeing a continued demand for us to be more end-to-end in our approaches, and that has been the intent of the One Optum thought and our product integration and our business integrations. And I think we're reaping the rewards for that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So I think that's it. Let me just briefly finish by thanking you again for joining us this morning, your interest and participation. I think we had a very solid third quarter in the context of a very strong 2013. We think we have meaningful performance opportunities in front of us. We are focused on optimizing the performance of this enterprise and addressing the headwinds of 2014. We will look forward to sharing more detail with you and insight at the investor conference on December 3. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here's some important introductory information.", "This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2014, which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website.", "[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given that we provided a comprehensive review at our investor conference just over a month ago and that our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results were generally in line or ahead of that discussion, we'll keep our formal comments brief this morning and spend more time on to your questions and topics of interest.", "We see 5 takeaways from this morning's discussion. 2013 was a very strong year, as we meaningfully advance the enterprise's capabilities, our growth and growth potential, diversification profile and market momentum. There are certainly near-term 2014 pressures, particularly from ACA implementation and Medicare funding actions that will divert more than $1.50 per share in earnings from us in 2014. But we have plans and actions in place to offset these reductions and to grow revenue to a range of $128 billion to $129 billion and produce earnings in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion.", "In 2013, we deepened our capabilities and market relationships and successfully moved beyond significant undertakings, such as the OptumRx in-sourcing, the implementation of the large, long-term TRICARE contract and extensive ACA readiness and compliance efforts. We move into 2014 with operational readiness and performance levels stronger than ever before.", "As Medicare Advantage underfunding is hurting seniors' benefits and causing disruptions to beneficiaries, our focus will remain on advocating for fair and consistent government funding to this program that now serves some 30% of this country's Medicare beneficiaries. In continuing to innovate, shape and improve our Medicare Advantage products and services to sustain these benefits can bring the best resources and service experience for American seniors.", "We will continue to focus on delivering earnings per share growth in 2015 with our ultimate performance, dependent in part on the results of the Medicare Advantage rate-setting processes for 2015. And finally, while we will work intensively through the near-term pressures just discussed and covered comprehensively at our investor conference, we believe even more firmly that long-term, no organization has greater ability to serve and enable a more effective, modern healthcare system and respond to a national imperative to improve the performance at health care and reduce its cost from consumer benefits and well-being to care delivery and enabling technology.", "UnitedHealth Group's long-term growth and earnings potential in this undertaking has never been more compelling than it is today.", "To briefly review 2013. Full year revenues grew nearly $12 billion or 10.7% to $122.5 billion and net earnings grew 4% to $5.50 per share. Earnings were at the top end of the range we provided more than 1 year ago despite the subsequent imposition in sequestration, which cost approximately $250 million in operating earnings or $0.15 per share in 2013.", "Cash flows from operations is $7 billion or more than 1.2x net income. Fourth quarter cash flows were $1.1 billion and we ended the year with more than $1 billion in non-regulated cash. We raised our dividend by 30% once again in 2013. It is now at a $1.12 per share annual rate. And we purchased nearly $3.2 billion of UnitedHealth Group shares in 2013. Return in equity for the year approached 18%.", "UnitedHealthcare continued its extraordinary growth in 2013. We came to serve 4.5 million more people this past year entirely through organic growth, including more than 900,000 people in public and senior market benefit programs and nearly 400,000 people internationally. Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has grown by a remarkable 14 million people over just the past 4 years. Our benefit businesses are distinctively diversified locally, regionally and by product and customer type.", "UnitedHealthcare earned $7.3 billion in 2013. UnitedHealthcare's operating cost were well-managed in 2013, as were medical costs, with commercial trends in the area of 5%. Hospital usage per capita was lower for the fifth consecutive year in 2013 and was lower across all our major benefit businesses.", "UnitedHealthcare's results were negatively impacted by funding pressures and government-sponsored benefits, 3 calendar quarters of sequestration in Medicare and reduced levels of overall reserve development. Despite these pressures, UnitedHealth Care Group fourth quarter earnings 9% year-over-year to $1.8 billion.", "UnitedHealthcare ended the year more aligned than ever, with key care provider partners. We have $28 billion in annual medical spending and 8 million members served under fee for value contract, including more than 2 million people under the most progressive of these performance arrangements.", "We are intensely focused on expanding our integrated and accountable care leadership throughout 2014 and we have set an aggressive target of having more than $65 billion in value-based contracts with care providers by 2018.", "Turning to Optum, our Health Services platform. Our focus on growth, simplification, integration and building larger and deeper relationships produced record revenues and operating earnings in 2013. Revenues grew 26% to $37 billion. Every reporting segment produced double-digit percentage revenue growth. As just one example of Optum's performance, our local care delivery business in OptumHealth increased both the number of payer partners and increased the number of people it served by 6% and it expanded operating margins more than 2 percentage points in 2013. Medical cost performance and patient satisfaction levels were excellent, with the overall trend held flat and our physician groups participating in health plan contracts with quality Star ratings ranging from no less than 3.5 up to 4.5 stars.", "During the fourth quarter, Optum, QSSI was honored to be engaged and serve CMS in their efforts to enroll million of Americans to the federal and state exchanges. Great progress was made over the past 90 days and we are pleased to be a part of that effort. And we will stay involved in the senior advisory capacity as this project moves to its next phase of development.", "For the year, Optum's operating earnings of $2.3 billion grew 61%, or $875 million over 2012, and are now up 84% over our 2011 baseline year. Fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings increased 43%. Optum reached its 6% operating margin target 2 years early in 2013 and now has established a new target called 8 by '16, which means an 8% operating margin by 2016.", "As we enter 2014 with our company in a very positive position, we will continue to closely study the development of the individual public exchanges in 2014 and will be selective in our approaches for 2015. However, we expect to realize strong growth by serving several ways: as established Medicaid programs grow through the ACA expansion; as eligible Medicaid prospects were identified to the federal and state exchange market; and as the inevitable dual eligible MME initiatives begin to form in our implement.", "The recent Tennessee Medicaid award for 2015, in which we earned the highest score among 7 qualified bidders, our 2015 renewal in Hawaii and the Michigan MME award, all reflect our strong capabilities and established relationships in the rapidly growing Medicaid market.", "We have won 30 new RFPs or contract renewals in the past 4 years and we have grown organically by more than 1 million people served through our UnitedHealthcare community and state business over that period.", "Continuing on 2014. Our initial Medicare growth is within our estimate, with balanced new membership growth and large employer wins during the year, offset by our exit from plans covering 150,000 people and the loss of over 90,000 seniors in 1 state account. Our Part D and Medicare Supplement offerings continue to grow well in the marketplace.", "We continue to expect commercial group risk membership to be stable in 2014, with our commercial individual insured membership declining over the course of the year. And the number of consumers served in fee-based arrangements declining due to the loss of that large state account, as well as some migration to private exchanges for both retirees and active employees.", "Our 2014 plan includes the collection of insurance fees and related taxes from state Medicaid customers. We have strong oral commitment from our customers that these were paid and we will record these revenues as written contract amendments are finalized over the course of the year. The timing of these final commitments could affect quarterly earnings progression.", "UnitedHealthcare's earnings in the first quarter will also see year-over-year variances related to reserve development, capital gains and the effect of sequestration, which did not take effect until April 1, 2013.", "Optum continues to build out its businesses around the themes of engaging consumers, aligning and optimizing care delivery, modernizing the health systems infrastructure and using data and analytics to make the health system more informed, aligned and effective. Optum expects strong top and bottom line growth in 2014, with operating earnings in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion and $45 billion to $46 billion in revenue. This performance will put earnings growth in the area of 25% and that growth rate includes, in both years, the earnings contributions from realigning our IT and global services businesses into Optum in 2014. This natural alignment will help us create and capture growth opportunities in business process outsourcing for health care and in healthcare IT assignments similar to our efforts in service to CMS.", "Optum's earnings are expected to be strong in the second half of 2014, due to growth investments early in the year, such as fully implementing Optum360, as well as more traditional seasonal earnings pattern.", "In the fourth quarter of this past year, both S&P and Moody's confirmed our corporate debt rating and upgraded their outlook. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in available cash and a ratio of debt to total capital below 35%. We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in 2014 and expect to return well more than $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend.", "Standing back from the numbers, UnitedHealth Group is in a very strong position. We have posted consistent growth for several years, as measured by people served, revenues, contract backlog, cash flows, operating earnings, dollars under value-based contract and so on. We have leading positions in our market, but our market share is much lower than leaders typically have in more mature industries. We serve large and growing markets, so we have considerable organic growth opportunities for the future.", "Our scale benefits the consumers, clients and customers we serve through innovation, cost advantages, efficient service and so on and this naturally engenders further growth. That model is expanding in care provider services and care delivery, with government agencies and national employers and with consumers and in Brazil, in Europe and beyond. Very large and sophisticated customers are seeking an enterprise-level partner, one with proven capabilities and the financial strength to help them navigate the changes that both consumers and government regulations are driving throughout the market, a partner like UnitedHealth Group.", "In closing, I would simply once more shorthand each takeaways. 2013 was a very strong year in growth, achievement and capabilities and putting some big operational tasks behind us. 2014 will feel the impact of the ACA taxes and Medicare funding pressures, but we believe we can produce revenue growth and earnings in the $5.40 to $5.60 per share range. We suggest the quarterly earnings progressions need to better accommodate the first quarter and first half factors we discussed this morning.", "And finally, in the longer term, we believe our prospects to grow and produce positive change across the health system for the benefit of all the system participants and our shareholders remain exceptional.", "So thank you for your time this morning and we now would like to address your questions, discuss areas of interest to you today. So can we ask the moderator to take over and we'll respond to questions. Again, 1 per analyst, please, out of respect for the others in line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sarah James with Wedbush.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "You touched on Medicare headwinds for '15 in the prepared remarks and I wanted to better understand if that's a headwind compared to '14, so an incremental headwind in '15?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't think we were really suggesting anything other than we had said at the investor conference, that, obviously, there were rate actions taken related to 2014 that we believe significantly underfunded the program. And we had indicated there that we are -- continue to be watchful about the funding posture on the Medicare Advantage program. And we will continue to be watchful of that and continue to advocate strongly for consistence, reasoned funding of these program and continued commitment to American seniors who participate in them. I think we didn't really mean anything more than that.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "As I think about items to watch, there was that update in December of the 200-basis-point change in fee-for-service cost trend assumptions, so that kind of got us to a starting point of down 6% to 7%. And I think about some offsets to that. United has been very successful in medical cost savings through ACOs and risk-sharing contact with providers. So could you quantify what kind of trend vendor these efforts could create across the entire Medicare book?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I don't think we can. At kind of that distance, we think these programs are extremely effective and they're effective in terms of their cumulative effect. And we are intensely engaged on them across, basically, all of our benefit businesses, but certainly as they relate to government programs. In terms of the discussions that were held in December, we are not going to speculate, really, on what ultimate funding may come forward or change our position on that. We are going to be intensely engaged as that process goes forward. And as I've said before, we're going to continue to advocate strongly for strong and responsible funding to these programs. And I think we really can't speculate on a process that is really just not even really formally begun.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, you highlighted some seasonality issues, both in Optum, investing in Optum360 and then some seasonality issues there, as well as some timing issues potentially with the health insurance fee. Could you help us think about some of these timing issues within both Optum and UnitedHealthcare and how they might impact progression of earnings relative to what we've seen historically? I know you talked about first quarter, those 3 factors. But any help you could give us would be appreciated.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, I think -- well, I think the general theme is to be -- I'm going to hand these off because they do really touch different parts of our business. And I'll probably ask John Rex to speak to some of the front end on Optum and then in terms of the Medicaid activities, Steve and Dan. But I think the -- we're obviously suggesting that you relook at the progressions in terms of, again, I'll say the first half versus the second half of the year, given the timing of when these Medicaid contracts will actually fall in informal terms and the patterns of the Optum business, both in its new business and its traditional seasonality. But John, you want to start up?", "John Rex", "Yes. So when I think about Optum in 2014, so we'd expect a pattern, first half, second half pattern of roughly 40%, 60% in terms of earnings progression for the year. Now if you think about 2013, we're roughly 40%, 45% in the first half. So the impact there, you're seeing some of the impact of the investments we're making in these larger, more comprehensive relationship that we've talked about and that would be an impact that you'd see, particularly as you look across the Insight and the OptumHealth businesses.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Things like Optum360.", "John Rex", "And Optum360, in particular. The one that we talk about most.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "And then, Steve, you want to talk about Medicaid?", "Steve Nelson", "Christine, it's Steve Nelson. We have -- as you've heard me say before, we have a year-round process we're engaging based on rates and we call this rate advocacy and especially from the competency of our business. But the fees and tax impact has been a part of that. We consider a part of our cost. As we sit here today, the states have over -- or I'd say, overwhelming majority of our states have agreed to reimburse us for both the fee and the tax impact. Actually, those fees have technically said no to us. We are continuing to be engaged with them in a productive and, I think, thoughtful discussion. So it's more work to do, but the progress is really significant and our outlook is positive. In terms of how we recognize the revenue, Dan, do you want to comment on that?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Christine, on the revenue recognition side, as Steve mentioned, the overwhelming majority, we've got commitments. With respect to revenue recognition, we'll be relying on written commitments. We have a very good share in hand today, but still have some more to get and will make progress over the course of the first quarter and throughout the year and that will influence the timing of the revenue recognition.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can you elaborate on what portion, maybe you're not comfortable but if you are, what portion you have written commitments on the health insurance fee to get all of it recovered? And are they filling in efficiency adjustments below the line by telling you that you're getting the health insurance fee, but then saying you're going to get all these new memberships so maybe we don't need to you as much? Or are they recognizing the pent-up demand?", "Daniel Schumacher", "You fit a couple in there. With respect to the insurance fee specifically, the majority of our states are looking to do a lump sum true-up once the fee is actually known. So we'd expect to get it in the September timeframe from a reimbursement standpoint. And in terms of how many we have in hand from a written commitment, we have less than half but more than 1/3. So we're making strong progress and we've got -- we expect in the next week and the coming weeks to be more of that, as well as for the second quarter. Your other question around pent-up demand, that was more, I think, aimed at the expansion population in the newest health members into those markets. We do have an expectation of higher views related to those new members and we have, in the vast majority of our states, a separate rate sell that does account for and reflect a higher initial use pattern. We'd expect that, obviously, to moderate over time as our clinical programs take hold.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage. It sounded like you said you're seeing membership on track versus your expectations. Wondering if we can get a little bit more color here in terms of what you're seeing in open enrollments, specifically maybe talking through some of the impact from changes to your physician network and on member attrition. Because of this, maybe are you seeing any selection issues happening here in terms of bigger members leading more significantly than others, et cetera?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll have Jack respond to this. And I'm sure he will hit this point, too. But we would remind you that we start out the year 250,000 or so down, given the market exits we took and the single contract that we lost. So Jack, do you want to pick up on that?", "Jack Larsen", "Sure, Justin. Jack Larsen. Maybe before I tackle the multipart question here on the 2014, let me go back and remind you about 2013 and the very strong growth year we had there, almost 1 million members, with something around 425,000 in Medicare Advantage alone. With respect to the 2014 AEP performance, let me take the growth part first. I'd say we were on our plan in all of our major product lines, Med Stop, Part D, MMA. I think for individual Medicare Advantage, we took a little bit of a different approach this year and really aimed at preserving and, in fact, growing our share in markets that we would consider to be long-term, financially stable, viable markets for us. And in these particular markets, we have really strong growth and we have retention, member retention, that was actually improved over what we had seen in prior years. And I would say in some other markets, we made a decision that we were going to seed some share to others. And in those markets, where we pay some benefit decisions, we saw retention slightly less than historical levels, as well as the rate of production and new business. And I think, as Steve referred to, you hit it right out. We started with about 150,000 people affected by market withdrawals. Now on the group side, we, I think, chatted at the investor conference about the loss of a large state-based contract of about 90,000 people, effective 1/1. And you're seeing those numbers in the recently posted CMS result. That will be offset effective February 1 through the win of a large state account in, roughly, the 90,000 member range. So all-in, I'd say, we're right where we thought we would be this AEP and feel pretty good about our plus or minus 50,000 member growth that we shared with you at the investor conference. In terms of mix, it's just way too early. I don't think we're seeing anything that surprises us. But we're doing that analysis now. We need to see a little more information on our inbound members from CMS. And I think we'll have a better point of view the next time we speak in the [indiscernible].", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jack, maybe just in terms of any comments on the impact due to enrollment of some of these physician -- from the physician network changes? And maybe talk a little about what benefit that's going to give you in terms of quality improvements and cost going into 2015? And then, just lastly, on those markets that you did decide to take a step back on, would it be fair to say -- should we think that the market should be concerned that you put -- that the members that are being put back into the market or that you're exiting are significantly different in terms of morbidity or risk versus those in the existing book and then maybe there could be some selection issues in the market broader?", "Jack Larsen", "Yes. So as I said earlier, we did see levels of attrition a little higher in those markets that we chose to seed some shares. Some of those markets are aware we are taking our network optimization, network restructuring kind of work. And it's also -- it's geography, but it's also products as well. So we differentiated between HMO products and PPO products. I think in terms of just what we are trying to accomplish in our network activities, there's just a ton of pressure all over the system. Steve referred to it and we talked about it at the investor conference. And I think that rate pricing pressures probably most defeat Medicare. The system's fragmented. Clearly, it has rising cost. And I think everyone agrees it's got the opportunity for demonstrably better outcomes. I think what we're -- the themes we see and really what the Affordable Care Act is telling us is law and CMS is suggesting us through regulations, is that the industry has to change and we have to change. We have to be more integrated. We need to be more aligned. We need to have a provider network that is aligned with us better, both in terms of data and financially. And we need to do all of that with far less resources. And I think these are the themes that we're responding to. This is what you are seeing us and others do in the marketplace with respect to reaching out and making affirmative changes in our network. So we're really evolving to meet the requirements of a Medicare program that's going to be successful in the future. So while it's going to be a little noisy and a little turbulent, we acknowledge that. I think we're conforming our business in the right way to be successful in the Medicare program in the future.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Gail, do you want to comment?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Justin, it's Gail Boudreaux. In addition to what Jack just said about network, I think it's important to think about that this activity across network is going on across all the benefits space. And Jack referenced some of just the incredible pressure in the system around rising costs, connectivity and, quite frankly, getting better outcome. But in addition to just the shaping of the network to meet the unique populations in Medicare, we're also very focused, as you know, on increasing our pay-for-performance across Medicare. We talked about that a little bit at our investor conference, moving that up dramatically over the next few years. Greater clinical integration. And it's all to drive better outcomes. And again, those who respond to CMS' desire to have greater primary care centric networks and better outcome, that's happening across all of the benefits businesses and it's really important about -- as we think about modernizing the health care system. So what we're trying to do there, I think, is evident in Medicare, but it's also evident in our other business. And our support is provide better data and allow these physicians to better and more effectively manage these patients.", "Operator", "We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I think I just might switch gears and ask you about the Optum and the experience with QSSI. Obviously, in the last 2 months, you guys have gotten a lot of kudos for how that's worked out. Can you comment on maybe your thoughts on the business implications of the way that's played out? Has that opened up other contracting opportunities with the federal government, outside the federal government and beyond? And give us some flavor for that, if you would.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. Obviously, I think as you're suggesting, that it's had a very positive reputational effect. But Larry, if you're on the line, do you want to start this and then maybe Andy Slavitt comment as well?", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure. A.J., I think you probably know this, so let me give you a little history here. When we started the project prior to October 26 -- and I'll just use that date -- we were a contractor that built the data services hub, as well as the registration process, something called the IDN. And then we controlled all the testing. When we got brought in on October 26 to work on fixing the site, we got, obviously, to work with CMS and HHS. And they did a great job of kind of outlining everything to us so that we kind of understood where we were at. And that's why we became the general contractor. And coming to general contractor, we were operating under, what I would call an urgent timeframe for about 60 days to get things accomplished. And then we were able to get through that, learn a lot and it's now in, what I'll call a more normalized environment. And we -- we have just become, as I'm sure you read, a senior adviser. And I'll have Andy talk about that in a second. But what I would say is we obviously learned a lot in terms of working with the federal government and being a part of the whole process. I would tell you that we are also working with a lot of the state. And I think that when we were at our investor conference, we talked about we were moving over on the UHG IT side, what we do with our technology infrastructure and so forth. So we believe that's going to tie in nicely to what we did for the government to be able to offer candidly around the industry. So it's going to expand what we do. So we appreciate what we were able to accomplish and what we've learned, but we believe we're just kind of starting. Andy, you got anything else?", "Andrew M. Slavitt", "Yes, just had a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, this is -- some of this is repetitive of what Steve and Larry covered. Clearly, this was a job done principally by CMS with the help of a lot of contractors. We were glad to be and continue to be glad to be involved. I think in terms of implications, I'll just point the 3 things. First is we try to build our reputation on big complex problems that we can solve for clients in health care and, hopefully, more clients will have an opportunity to see Optum in action and that's a good thing. Second, as Steve mentioned in his opening remarks and Larry just hit on it, we can bring technology outsourcing to this industry in a way that we think is unique to health care. And so we think there's opportunity both in and out of the government for us to do that. And the third, there are situations very much like this around the country and state-based exchanges, where some level of business problem-solving, prioritization and leadership will be called for. And we're happy we were able to jump into those situations as well.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'll just finish by reinforcing the fact that we were pleased to be part of that. That was a broad team effort. There were significant efforts and progress made in terms of the participation from CMS, their leadership and their staff. And all of the partners, the outside suppliers around that, everybody pulled together in an extraordinary way to do that, the only way that could have been accomplished. And so, really, the credit really should be spread broadly.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just wanted to come back to Medicaid quickly. Understand the comments about the lump sum true-up and that most states or all states have, essentially, verbally agreed to maybe the true-up for the fee. But from a GAAP earnings perspective, does -- can you just help us understand whether you can, on a GAAP basis, just assume you're going to get it in the first quarter and second quarter, if you haven't actually received anything in writing? Or just generally, how the fee might impact EPS on a quarterly basis?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Chris, it's Dan Schumacher again. With respect to recognition, obviously, the expense associated with the tax will be incurred in each month across the year. On the revenue recognition, we will rely on written communication. And where we have those, we'll be booking revenue in each of the respective quarters. And where we don't, we'll be weighting what we do. Even though you mentioned lump sum, they may pay in lump sum, but you will recognize appropriate matching once you get a contract.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Correct.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "But so, in theory, this could create a -- if you don't have something inked, at least early in the year, it could create a bit of a headwind in the first, second quarters of '14, is that correct?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "That's why we mentioned it. It's exactly why we mentioned it.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I want to go back to the commentary around 2015. Obviously, appreciate that it's a little bit early to be talking about it. But with all indications that the 2015 MA rate may be as bad, if not worse, than the 2014 we've seen proposed, can you just give us a sense of what within your business might be doing better in 2015 than 2014? I mean, I just try to -- struggle with the concept. I think you started off by saying you expect growth in 2015 but the impact will really be determined by the final MA rate. So I just want to see if the rate is as bad in 2015 as it is in 2014, what operational levers within MA or outside of MA can you see at this point that might help you show a growth rate better than what you're showing in 2014?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, again, we're not going to speculate on where the funding activity will ultimately play out. We have a very broad and diverse business. We are intensely focused on improving our performance across the board. As you can see, the performance that has been achieved in -- broadly in several areas across UnitedHealthcare. The sense of growth in Medicaid to the very strong performance that we had in the commercial business this past year and the opportunities internationally. And then the opportunities for Optum, I think, are impressive and they have established a track record of performance. And we are intensely focused on our cost and the continued improvement of our businesses. So I would think that they would be all the traditional kinds of things that one would be pursuing. And we are pursuing them, I think, with significant intensity. I just think that in January, off of the strength of a phone call conversation in December with CMS, that we should necessarily take undue direction from that and that we will see how this process proceeds. And as I've said before, I think that there is a broader sense of responsibility to American seniors than to have underfunded the program, by our measures, about 6.7% last year. And if there is speculation that there would be underfunding at that level again in this year, that would be almost a 13% pullback on Medicare Advantage over the course of 2 years. And we would think that, that would be extraordinarily disruptive. It remains to be seen.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I appreciate the commentary about the underfunding, it does seem to be a significant cutover a couple of years. But and also, it's very difficult to propose -- or to forecast what's going to come out of CMS at any point of time. But when the rate hits, we have to interpret that the day it happens. And everything that you've outlined to me sounds like things, to your point, that you've been working on for 2014 and you're seeing benefits from them in 2014. I guess the question is, if we see something similar from MA in 2015, if you'd do the same things to offset it in 2015. There is a reason for acceleration outside of the MA business -- or is there, I guess, is my question.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Well, I think that we have probably more areas to accelerate and to grow and build on than perhaps anyone else in the space. And then we would take the steps necessary with respect to benefit adjustments, market considerations, network actions, premium actions, cost and distribution cost. So there's a broad repertoire of actions that we are taking and the question really comes down to the intensity of those.

But just given the timeline of bids due just in the next kind of few months. I guess, what are your thoughts on playing in the exchange in 2015? Should we expect a similar approach and maybe more limited activity? Or have you seen enough where we should start to expect you to be a sort of a more active participant? And then maybe just how much, if at all, is the '15 MA outlook just sort of influential on that decision or not? Or is that sort of something that's kind of mutually exclusive?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. So Gail and Jeff, do you want to start?", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Sure. Well, Ralph, first of all, in terms of the public exchanges, I think you know that we've got a very modest footprint. And as I shared at Investor Day, our decisions around 2015, our participation will really be very much reliant on how this market matures. So at this stage, we're really not projecting our participation. We will be looking at sort of the -- how robust the enrollment is, what the risks in those markets are and the consumers participating and, quite frankly, the cost structure is on those markets. So at this stage, I don't know that we have any additional guidance to give you from what we shared at the investor conference, but that's our outlook.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Would you expect to have that, though, just in the next kind of few months? I mean, I'm sure there'll be some level of incremental.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Again, it's a maturing marketplace. It's really early. It's just rolled out. We'll be looking at a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to give guidance around our participation at this stage, but we're going to watch the markets mature. And we'll get more information and we'll be sharing that with you as it becomes known to us. In terms of your second question on Medicare and does that influence our exchange participation, I would say, no, it doesn't. We're going to look at -- we look at each of our markets very specifically and look at the dynamics in those markets. So we will take a very focused look at exchanges. And as you heard from Steve, we'll also look market-to-market in Medicaid -- Medicare just as we did this year.", "Jeff Alter", "Generally, our view on '15 is that we are not dependent on exchanges.", "Gail Koziara Boudreaux", "Right.", "Jeff Alter", "I mean, we will take this in a measured way.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Now my question, though, I'm sensing some sensitivity among investors and, indeed, some of this is on my end. Perhaps I don't understand exactly what kind of pricing decisions you made for 2014 with respect to your estimates of cost trend and a recoupment of the fees through higher premiums where possible. There's a sense out there that, that trend is kind of tied to premium right now and that perhaps, if the fees are 100 to 200 basis points, there's only 80 basis points or so of wiggle room. That was one statistics suggested to me. So I'm wondering if you can comment on that and give us some comfort or some indication of what's happening there, especially with respect to a trigger here, that's the medical cost ratios have been a tad high in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering if that's anything that might be indicative of the pricing versus cost trend in '13 and then in '14, anything in the conversation as we speak.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So we'll have Jeff kind of speak to that pricing discussion. And if we have not get fully your question, then we'd clarify it on the end. So Jeff, do you want to start?", "Jeff Alter", "Sheryl, it's Jeff Alter. So I think the market test and their surveys are correct. Our pricing in 2014 is stronger than it was in 2013. And you mentioned it, a part of the reason that it's stronger is because of the ACA fees, taxes, as well as the essential health benefits across all markets. And then when you look at small group and individual, the move to community rating, depending on which part of that marketplace you're looking at, you could see some much stronger pricing. Your suggestion around cost trend versus pricing, just a couple of things to think of. One, we have not changed the discipline of pricing that has gotten us -- has been successful for us for a very long time. We look at our forward cost, which now include, as I mentioned, some impacts due to the ACA. But we're certainly as focused on medical trends as we had ever been in the prediction of medical trend. The medical trend for pricing was about a point higher in '14 than it was for '13 and we match our premium to that. Again, I know it's been a few years, but we'll go back to the MLR. We manage this across hundreds of intersections, so that we try to stay as close to that rebate line as possible. So depending on which market you're looking at or studying, we may have rebates that are still to be paid in that marketplace. And we're continuing a long how to adjust to that very tight band around that MLR. And in other markets, we have the ability to price a little bit stronger. So that is all in that calculus that creates our forward pricing as we move forward. And now, more than ever, impacts for the ACA are also included in there.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good discipline, well-aligned with medical cost trends and, really, not particularly significant changes in the marketplace. We're competitive, but we think we are pricing well.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Right. And the MLR performance in the fourth quarter, were you comfortable with that?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes.", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sheryl, this is Dan. From a fourth quarter standpoint, as we look at that, medical costs were well controlled. If we look at the implications on both loss ratio and trend, they were very much in keeping with our expectation from Investor Day and set the stage for the right jumping off point into 2014.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to just ask on the commercial enrollment and what you're seeing from employers as sort of 2-part question. Number one, are you seeing anything significant in terms of employee uptake of coverage now that there's this broad awareness of the individual mandates? Some employers, evidently, are seeing that in some cases, I gather, as significant. And somewhat related to that, just curious on comments on the commercial risk enrollment results for the fourth quarter. Just those were stronger than we expected. I just wonder if you could remind us if there was a special factor there.", "Jeff Alter", "Sure, Matt, it's Jeff Alter. I guess, on your first question, it's sort of hard to tell. I think that would probably most happen in our largest clients. And it takes a little bit past 1/1 to make sure that all those enrollment files are correct. And so we usually feel better about commenting on sort of the National Account growth or growth in existing accounts by the time we get to February, it's a little too early to talk about that. We do see interest for some employers to create a different benefit construct that could allow for growth. But we haven't seen those results come through yet in our 1/1 enrollment. Talking about our fourth quarter '13, I think there were a few things that were driving that. There was a fairly large push in our individual business to sign up as many enrollees as possible early so that we can give that advantage of an additional year without the ACA impact. And that program was an aggressive program and it was very successful. And then we had mentioned probably throughout '13 that there was interest in our small group clients for alternative plan years for them to be able to keep their benefits for that additional year even prior to the president's announcement. So that did drive some, I'll call it one-time growth in the fourth quarter of '13.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just so I could understand, because I'm a little confused about it. I would think that those dynamics would make you feel more secure about retention at the small group and individual level but not necessarily explain growth if you're doing early renewals with your current account base. Was there an element to this that also drove some growth?", "Jeff Alter", "Yes. So in some markets, the value proposition that we put into the market was not matched by some competitors. And so we were able to take some share. And then you're right, it did help attrition. It also helped the sort of retention of groups that might have left anyway. So when you think of a small group attrition rate of somewhere in that 15% to 20%, those groups that were renewing in that fourth quarter, there was a higher attrition rate -- a better retention rate.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And sorry, just last thing on this. Wouldn't this make you maybe feel a little bit better about the guidance on individual, not that it necessarily moves the needle much, but given what you saw towards year-end?", "Jeff Alter", "We're not -- at this point, we're not changing our guidance for '14.

But also I want to understand how the rule changes that came out on preferred networks will impact you, whether there's integration savings -- integration expenses that you'll save, that you won't have to do next year. And then, from the early marketing window, what are you seeing in terms of how it's starting to look for 2015 and then the potential for your specialty trend to help you win business?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Okay, 3. Okay, so let's start with growth. I think we had a nice momentum coming out of 2013. Our value prop continues to resonate in the marketplace. If you look at '14 sort of excluding our last wave of the migration, we'll probably grow north of 1.5 million next year. Based on what we sold on 1/1, we'd be confident in that number. As it relates to CMS, I'd like to comment more broadly, I think. What we'd like to see from the CMS proposal, any CMS proposal, is -- and the rule-making is the ability to continue to incent the efficient mail channel and manage preferred networks consistent with historical practices. We believe both those things are really good for the beneficiary and good for the Medicare program. Last thing, specialty trend, I would say a couple of things. I think we continue to have a good advantage with our ability to manage not only the specialty benefit but then -- the specialty spend within the medical benefit but also in our formulary. I think that's a good thing that we've historically done and our trend has reflected that over time. I think that got all your question, does it not?", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just integration expenses and then you bringing in the cost from doing the big integration that you've done this year or bringing that PBM in house, is there some substantial savings that we should be expecting going forward?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, we did recognize that savings. As I talked about at the Investor Day, there's -- we're not changing our guidance for next year. The avoidance of those expenses in 2014 compared to '13 definitely provided us with earnings lift in 2014.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And nothing incremental for 2015?", "Stephen J.

So we're not going to get into that level of detail in a call like this. I would say the -- just to comment around small group pricing, this is a transitional year for many markets.

And Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I would just add that, obviously, in small group, there's a lot more variability than there is in large group because small group's going through the transition to adjust to community rating.

Or is there something else going on there? And maybe, I know you guys have talked specifically around a pipeline, per se, for M&A.

Wichmann", "Josh, I think I'd just also remind you that we were coming off of the -- at least for us, we were coming off of the Amil acquisition, which was quite substantive the fourth quarter of last year. And what shows up more as a financing activity as opposed to an investing activity is the tender that we did for Amil's public shares, that's about 1.5 billion as well. So it was roughly about 1.8 billion or so allocated to M&A type activity. And lastly, I'll just say, to reiterate the thing at our investor conference, we are clearly a -- an M&A company and our interests in M&A continue. Our agenda is virtually the same, which is really around building these capabilities, geographic market presence. But possibly, a slight bias more towards Optum in the international markets, which we think are fast-growing and expansive markets. But we'd also look to -- for opportunities to leverage our scale broadly in our business.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.", "Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just thinking about Medicaid. Clearly, you don't break out Medicaid MCRs. But at a high level, how should we think about the cost for the business, maybe excluding the industry fee, reflecting kind of the growth and mix that you'll be staying including long-term care duals, the expansion of re-procurement. How big an impact mix had on MCR? And would any changes be temporary once you get these people into your care management programs, or should there be a long shift upward in the MCRs for that product?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We don't comment -- maybe Steve can make a few comments on this. But in general, we really don't get into margin discussions at that level of depth. We have historically suggested that the range of margin for those businesses in the 3% to 5%, 3% to 6% level, depending upon the performance of the business in a particular year. And that mix, ultimately, even if one offering were to be particularly strong, it tends to generally, ultimately come down into that general range of 3% to 5% for that kind of business. And we're really not changing our perspective on that. And I think that's well aligned with the marketplace. That said, Steve, do you have anything to offer?", "Steve Nelson", "Stephen, I think those are good comments. I would just say generally, they -- the opportunities to grow in Medicaid are robust and they include a variety of populations. For example, more complex populations, the expansion population has different utilization characteristics, at least the first, as Dan mentioned. And as we engage with them and are -- both the complex population and expansion population, engage with them our distinctive clinical models and our pride of capabilities that we have, I think, a really strong track record, we'll be able to bring a lot of value to our state partners and good outcomes to these populations. So it's part of our business. It's part of the growth opportunity. And we're actually -- really like our position and our opportunities in the space. And just to expand on Steve's earlier comments in the beginning, really strong track record in competing successfully for this business with that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Yes, it's a very localized business, local programs. So these margins run their range from year-to-year across that -- those geographies. And given our scale, we aspire to the higher ends of those margins. But we will run the range of those margins across our markets over time. So it is a business with a great deal of variation market to market.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.", "David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "On specialty drugs, I'm hoping to get the sense of magnitude. Do the hep C drugs have the potential to make a meaningful impact on the trend in specialty? And from a rate advocacy standpoint, are you having discussions with the states, as I understand, a lot of this may hit Medicaid, are you having discussions with the states about them potentially backstopping you in some way on the cost of drug life stability?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So Dirk, do you want to comment in general. And then I think that sounds to me more like a Medicaid question than a drug question. But maybe you want to talk about the specialty additions.", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes, well, just hep C in general, I think -- we know that new therapies have recently been launched. The competition is valuable for our strategy at state. Like any other drugs, we compare the efficacy versus the cost of these drugs. And when we look at those, we'll decide where to place them from a tier perspective. We would, of course, steer utilization from a tier strategy standpoint to those that produce the most effective and most efficient outcome. So we're really about trying to manage the overall drug/medical spend as we sort of take our approach to pharmacy management, I think hep C is similar. And as far as where they are in the trend, I'll turn it back to Steve.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. So from -- we do expect higher utilization of these drugs in 2014. We did see that in 2012 as well when we had the new introductions that came in mid 2011. But that's obviously something that's part of our forward outlook. It's contemplated in our pricing. In terms of the implications on our trend, we are talking basis point, not points, and it's fully reflected in our forward outlook. With respect to Medicaid specifically, just as the insurers' fee and other elements are components of cost, it is an element that goes into our build-up. It's an active part of our dialogue to the extent that we're covering pharmacy benefits in a state and it will be part of our beta process that Steve Nelson talked about.", "So thank you. I would say that, that will conclude our comments today. We remain intensely focused on the challenges and the opportunities of 2014 and 2015. And we thank you for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in our enterprise. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

I'll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here's some important introductory information.", "This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 17, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review the first quarter results in the context of our full year objectives for 2014. Objectives that include continuing to diversify our services and product offering, continuing to develop and expand our capabilities and relationships and further strengthened and consistent fundamental execution and services to customers and consumers.", "And we are working towards all these while new national healthcare policies begin to come into the place and new baselines for market behaviors and new market dynamics become realities. We plan to deliver revenues in a range of $128 billion to $129 billion for the year produce earnings in the range $5.40 to $5.60 per share and generate cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion.", "UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and Optum performed largely as we expected in the first quarter. We remained in our plans for 2014 and as usual continue to work through more challenges and benefits for the moment.", "Longer term, we continue to more clearly see evidence for the growth opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum as we knew beyond the more negative immediate term impacts of the ACA and its implementation. This is was really the first quarter a full scale operation under the ACA.", "Everything else in the past three years has been more of a preamble. The ACA's impacts on 2014 had been immediate and significant as we described at our Investor's conference. Nondeductible insurance taxes, ACA prescribed Medicare Advantage funding pull backs, commercial underwriting changes and various other provisions cumulatively reduced our per share, net earnings by nearly $0.30 for this quarter and sequestration cut an additional $0.05 in this quarter.", "On a full year basis 2014 Medicare funding actions will cut roughly $0.45 per share beyond that. This makes a grand total of about $1.50 per share and externally driven year-over-year pressure fully consistent with our view at our Investors conference in December.", "The ACA impacts every major line item of our consolidated results and distorts comparisons virtually all performance ratio. This will continue as the year's progresses, a new regulatory and tax baselines are established and settled in, but we think some very important early observations can be made about the ACA's first quarter introduction.", "First consumers and benefits sponsors are showing by their actions the clear value they see in private sector, managed care products and services.", "The capabilities of the private sector healthcare community are significant and have proven to be highly adaptable to serving the needs and demands of consumers in all stages and situations of life as well as government and private benefit sponsors and the broader health system.", "And ultimately there should be advances access to care and the healthcare system as a whole will become more effective and efficient and consistent overtime. Early evidence of these is visible and will produce long-term growth opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.", "Let's review, how this played out in the first quarter for UnitedHealth Group starting with UnitedHealthcare, whose revenues grew $1 billion or 3.6% year-over-year to $29.3 billion led by membership growth in Medicaid. Over the past 12 months alone, UnitedHealthcare has implemented six new or renewed Medicaid contracts and grown to serve 395,000 new members.", "In this past quarter, we grew by 255,000 people driven by the expanded eligibility offered in and about half the States, where we serve Medicaid beneficiaries as well as new membership in traditional categories.", "We expect growth throughout the year and could well exceed the upper end of our outlook of $350,000 to $450,000 additional people served this year. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted 12 million people will obtain coverage through Medicaid by the end of 2016 and we will endeavor to gain market share serving the needs of these beneficiaries and their State's sponsors.", "Nationally managed Medicaid, is also broadening to serve new patients with greater clinical needs like dual eligible. We believe our integrated and in the market clinical model gives us distinct advantages in serving these higher growth; more complex areas. Our model integrates behavioral, pharmaceutical, medical and social services with the focus on the 5% of the population that drives well over 50% of the total medical cost in the typical Medicaid program.", "In Medicare, we began the year with growth of 360,000 across all Medicare product categories. As Part D sales were strong and Medicare Supplement also grew nicely. Participation in our Medicare Advantage program was essentially flat down 5,000 people sequentially and well within the range we expected, despite significant market exists and products network adjustments made in response to the 2014 Medicare Advantage rate cuts of more than 6%.", "We continue to manage our Medicare Advantage products and cost structure with the local market level and we will stay focused on that task all this year and next; given the continued adverse funding climate for Medicare Advantage.", "Commercial membership also began the year generally in line with our expectation with a sharp decrease in people served through fee-based relationship as well as some expected declined in risk-based business. As expect our individual policy business declined this quarter as we decrease by 90,000 with the advent of the ACA.", "In the commercial market, we experienced a strong competitive period over early renewals for Legacy benefits, where many small group customers renewed early to avoid community rating and ACA price increases. These decisions were rational, driving healthier groups to renew early. While other groups took advantage of the community rating or that was the best course of action.", "Over the last quarter, we have seen intensified pricing in several markets including small group in New York, a large market for us. We believe several carriers there including new entrants our pricing well below cost and what we would view as unsustainable pricing levels.", "If this climate continues, we could see some further pressure on risk based membership beyond the ranges, we anticipated this year. And at Amil, we are beginning to see clear signs of response and recovery from surgeon utilization caused by aggressive access standards imposed nationally by the Regulatory Authorities in mid-2013.", "We continued to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. First quarter usage benefited slightly from intense winter conditions across the mid-western and northeastern areas of the country.", "Offsetting this item was the rapid launch of an effective and very expensive new hepatitis C therapy. The aggressive US pricing practices on this has been well publicized and continues to be quite controversial. We are working diligently to ensure this medication is applied under clinically appropriate standards.", "Patients were treated across the Medicaid commercial and Medicare Part D categories that cost to more than $100 million to us in the quarter. The Federal Government will bear significant expense in the Part D program because the high cost of this treatment causes the patient to quickly move through the donut hole into the 80% CMS reinsurance quarter.", "Meanwhile, State Medicaid Directors are at varying stages of concluding whether to include the medication on their approved state pharmacy list and if so, how to pay for it.", "Stepping back from these first quarter trends are full year commercial care ratio will see pressure caused by a combination of the revenue impact from stronger than expected early renewal activity in December at pre-ACA rates.", "The under pricing dynamic in New York at higher than expected utilization and cost related hepatitis. The size and diversity and United Health Group tends to mute the effect of the commercial variance on the consolidated care ratio, but we expect this ratio could lean toward the higher end of the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range, we provided last December.", "Before I turn to Optum, I want to recognize some of our colleagues with us today who have taken on new roles at UnitedHealth Group. All in keeping with our long standing philosophy of moving talented executives across the enterprise to broaden their experience and management depth.", "Jack Larsen has moved from the Medicare business to head up our rapidly growing Optum Collaborative Care, which includes our Care Delivery businesses, a perfect transition given his background in Medicare and extensive M&A background.", "Steve Nelson has shifted from his role leading our local market oriented Medicaid business to heading our Medicare and Retirement operation, where we are putting intense focus on market-by-market strategies around clinical care, network alignment and quality [stars].", "And Austin Pittman takes over at our Community & State Medicaid business coming from his most recent assignment leading our overall UnitedHealthcare network and local commercial market leadership before that.", "Turning now to Optum, it is becoming more evident the capabilities we have collectively built in our services, platform are increasingly recognized in the marketplace. Optum continues to grow and mature quarter-by-quarter. We continue to evolve to meet the needs of the market further integrate offerings, strengthen and grow relationships and align our efforts to the most valuable and sustainable opportunities to make the healthcare system perform better.", "More participants recognized Optum is in position to help customers engage their toughest healthcare challenges. Our work assisting the healthcare.gov website in the last quarter of 2013 has led to new relationships, new pipelines of potential work and new contracts with the spectrum of customers for 2014. We expect further growth in government services this year continuing this first quarter's trend.", "Our efforts to help our customers improve their end-to-end performance and their structural cost to move ahead with the launch of our Optum360 revenue management business with Dignity Health.", "We are developing a pipeline of additional health systems and expect to add business to Optum360 as the year progresses. Optum is seeing positive market response to its broad business process outsourcing capabilities as well. Optum Health is aligned around five key growth areas; prevention, intervention, financial services, distribution and care delivery.", "Broad capabilities meeting market needs, matched with an efficient, agile, customer focused organizational structure. The relationships we are building, leveraging these critical capabilities and they will be instrumental in Optum's future revenue and earnings growth as the consumer becomes a more significant buyer and decision-maker in healthcare.", "OptumRx is working a strong prospect pipeline in pharmacy services. Our distinctive focus on managing total cost by synchronizing information and care process across the medical, lab and pharmaceutical continuum is driving significant interest. We are only able to generate this interest as a result of the meaningful investments; we have made in OptumRx over the past couple of years.", "And similarly, we are making targeted investments in OptumHealth and OptumInsight to seek opportunities in areas such as consumer engagement, consumer distribution services, next generation analytics that combine administrative and clinical data at the scale 60 million people or more and next generation medical care review and compliance analytics.", "We will also invest startup cost in the assimilation of each new Optum360 relationship. This quarter earnings bear $60 million of these investments, which will continue over the course of the year, but somewhat more waited in the first half. All of these resonate with one theme; new and sustained areas for growth by helping the system to perform better for everyone.", "Turning to Optum performance for the quarter revenues grew 29% to $11.2 billion and earnings from operations grew 20% year-over-year to $650 million. Operating margins decline slightly due to the exceptional growth of the lower margin OptumRx business as well as the planned investment we just discussed.", "OptumRx led this quarters reported results with revenues up 43.5%. Earnings from operations up 114.2% and operating margins expanding a full percentage point to 3.2%. We filled 140 million adjusted scripts this quarter up 38% year-over-year.", "OptumInsight had strong growth in government and sponsored services in the quarter. At the same time, they slowdown and hospital clinical compliance services pressured revenues and operating earnings year-over-year and sequentially. As the Federal Government deliberated over medical necessity processes for Medicare, it's so called Two-Midnight Rule.", "At the same time, our newly introduced compliance offering serving hospitals needs for clean medical necessity documentation for privately insured patients have seen accelerated growth in sales in and pipeline.", "We expect OptumHealth and OptumInsight to increase in profitability as the year progresses accelerating into the second half. All in Optum delivered a strong first quarter with improved earnings and capital returns as compared to last year and remains on pace to produce $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion in operating earnings this year.", "As well as roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's cash flow from operations. All, while investing in the future growth in its business. As a whole, we have a solid start to the year, against the increasing headwinds, we described at our investors conference.", "UnitedHealth Group's first quarter revenues grew nearly $1.4 billion or 4.5% to $31.7 billion and net earnings were at $1.10 per share fully in line with our expectation. Cash flows from operations were strong at $1.4 billion up 34% year-over-year and a good start toward our full-year projection.", "The biggest challenges in 2014 are the combination of nondeductible healthcare taxes and ACA mandated Medicare rate cuts. On top of sequestration and the government's continued systematic under funding of Medicare Advantage. Including the 2014 Medicare funding issue and other ACA provisions, these impacted our first quarter results by well more than $0.35 per share and will pressure our full year net earnings by about $1.50 per share.", "We expect second quarter earnings per share will growth this past quarter's results, but as planned will come in below last year's reported second quarter, which benefited from strong reserve development. It did not bear some of the competitive commercial market pressures, UnitedHealthcare faces today and like this quarter, we will have substantial ACA effects.", "Items we are watching including hepatitis C treatment cost, the full recovery State Medicaid fees, commercial risk-based membership, New York and the overall performance of our Medicare business. And we are always respectful of medical cost trend even though they are basically inline in the quarter.", "As always, we will strive to deliver the best possible result in both the short and longer term. We expect our 2014 net earnings to land in the existing range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share and we mean that as a range. The items we discussed this morning, might serve temper ones thinking within that range.", "Standing back from the number, UnitedHealth Group faces an expansive long-term growth opportunity. In the US alone, there is the opportunity to approach and serve the more than 700, the Fortune 1,000 companies not yet our customers. Today we serve, more than 85 million people leaving more than 230 million Americans, we do not touch.", "There is a growing number of people in government sponsored programs, who are yet to benefit from Managed Care. There is significant upside potential in our PBM market share and there are multibillion dollar, multi-year opportunities that links services, technology and insight to fundamentally health-to-health system perform better for everyone.", "Beyond the US, we see the same growing opportunities. As the challenges other national health system space around access, control, affordability and affected decision making are in fact the same ones, we have here in the US even as these systems differ. The level of a longer term success, we achieve will depend on two things.", "First an adaptive and innovative approach to applying our three long standing core competencies of clinical care, organization and delivery. Health information analysis insight and advanced enabling technology. And second the effectiveness of our leaders in our organizational culture.", "We serve in the sensitive social services arena in the early stage of important market changes and we believe success will come to those, who can build trust, serve with compassion and control costs; while driving higher quality outcomes.", "We thank you for your time, this morning and look forward to your questions. So we will give you a second to get organized and we will pick up your question. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions at this time. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Yes, hi good morning. Could you talk about the outlook for Medicare Advantage for 2015? I realized we have to get through this year firs but, in light of the various changes that were made in finalization of the rate. I know one of your competitors has put out a point estimate for the all in rate impact and was wondering, if there was a range that you could offer on a similar basis?", "Steve Hemsley", "Yes, sure I think in terms of a range. First of all, we would comment that the final rate notice did mitigate some of the originally proposed cuts for 2015, but in fact when that results is that rates were once again taken down somewhere in the order of maybe slightly over 3% and that really comes on the heels of overall funding decline of over 6% in the prior year and that's against arising overall medical cost trend.", "So we would bracket that around, let's say the 3.5% kind of range and honestly, if that is somewhat disappointing, we were hoping for and we are positive all in response and so we will be focused on working through and trying to mitigate that as we approach 2015, but I would bracket it in let's say 3% to 3.5% range.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "If I could just ask for one clarification on that? Is that inclusive of the because it's not a rate factor the impact of the increase in the industry fee, at least under the ACA provisions to-date?", "Steve Hemsley", "Yes, that is an all in kind of what we see funding deficiency to Medicare for 2015.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the comments around 14 commercial MLR specifically, if those coming toward the higher-end of the range? Can you tell us whether, you think that would likely drive ETF to the lower end of what, being your full year guidance or if you think there are other businesses that could were to offset that and what they might and then just quickly on the MLR side.", "You mentioned the $100 million of hep C cost in the quarter. Can you tell us what your original expectations were for hep C in Q1 and how you're currently expecting this cost to trend for the rest of the year, thanks?", "Steve Hemsley", "It was a little gobbled on that second one. Your second question is a $100 million related to what?", "Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I'm sorry, $100 million of hep C cost, I think you mentioned up on them.", "Steve Hemsley", "I got it, okay.", "Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co", "For the quarter, how your expectations were for the end of the year for that versus $100 million and how you expect the trend for the rest of the year?", "Steve Hemsley", "I got it. Well, maybe the way to frame the care ratio and I will let Gail to drill and Dan Schumacher address this in more specifics but, we saw pressure in the first quarter. It is the first quarter those pressures are coming from a variety of sources. We will endeavor and try to mitigate against that over the course of the year, but we think it's appropriate to alert you to the fact that care ratio will feel pressure because of these factors.", "And as you point out, we have a very diverse business not only within the UnitedHealthcare platform but in the Optum platform and we have a number of ways to fight back against those pressures and we are endeavoring to do that is early in the year and so we are staying largely within the ranges and kind of giving you a color around, where we see the pressure points.", "And then in terms of hepatitis C, Gail, Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, good morning. Justin. On hepatitis C as Steve mentioned. We saw $100 million of cost in the first quarter little more than that and that was across all of our benefits business. So Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial and I think what we are seeing in not in consistent with what folks are seeing across the industry, which is higher pent up demand, as there was more patients that were warehoused leading up to the launch hepatitis C vaccines.", "And so we would expect that there would be some moderation and new patient volume as that initial pent up demand starts to wear off, but I would tell you that obviously these are 12 week and 24 week treatment regimen. So those folks that were introduced in the first quarter, will carry forward into the second.", "In terms of its relation to our expectation. I won't say that's specifically other than to say that it's a multiple of what we had expected.", "Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thanks for the color.", "Steve Hemsley", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Yes, I would like to understand a little bit more about what you expect to do about the rising cost of hep C going forward, as you mentioned moderating but you know when it becomes perhaps all [oral] towards to the end of the year. You would to expect to reaccelerate again and in particular for next year. So how you're going to price that into your businesses for next year, do you expect States to reimburse this year or carve it out?", "So can you build on that a little bit and the other cost item, that you talked about was in New York, can you tell us? How you're going to respond in New York to the pricing pressure there?", "Steve Hemsley", "Sure, as you point out. How hep C is addressed really does vary across the businesses based upon the segment of business that we are in, so we will try to respond to several of those and maybe we will start out with Gail.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure, good morning. Let me first address the hep C, then we will talk about the issue in New York. I think as you mentioned first the hep C therapies as you know are very effective and one of the things that we are doing is working to ensure that appropriate clinical protocols and standards are in place, but as noted the price is exceptionally high and as Steve said in his opening comments that controversial and it's putting a lot of pressure on States, CMS and in terms of our day as well as our employer sponsor, so the cost has to be addressed.", "As we think about actions. In the Medicaid space particularly. First and foremost, we are working with each of our states to ensure that we are aligned with their expectations on their PDL and how they want to handle that and also giving them ideas on risk mitigation from a cost perspective, what we are paying for the Medicaid it is the cost to the program that wasn't priced in.", "So we are working with our States to figure out that funding gap. We do expect it as a cost of delivering service in that space and would expect that will be reimbursed but the timing is what is uncertain now because accelerated very quickly and as Dan said, in his opening remarks about this because warehousing and the rapid launch, this is something everyone's dealing with across the States right now.", "In terms of the issue on New York. Let me open up a few comments, I'll just Jeff Alter, our CEO of our Commercial Business to comment. I think Steve highlighted in New York, we have a somewhat I think unique situation in the small group market in particular, where there are new entrants as well as existing competitors pricing below what we believe is the sustainable cost structure and pricing below, what we believe our cost.", "We've always maintained pricing discipline. We're a market share leader in New York, we've had a long history of several decades of consistent performance in that market, but we do think that there is a market correction needed. We are going to stay very disciplined in our pricing but again because of the dynamic that's going on there. It's something that, Steve and we highlighted in our opening comments.", "Jeff Alter", "Hi, Peter. Good morning, it's Jeff Alter. Just add a little color to that. As most people are probably aware, we've served that market place successfully for couple of decades. We know that marketplace really well. We've got leading economics, we understand the pricing and we really believe at this point that market has got to come back to a more sustainable level.", "We are comfortable with our pricing in that marketplace. It's just that others, I'm chosen to well below our pricing and that's going to create an issue in that market place. We will talk to the regulator about it. But in the short run, we are going to maintain our disciple like we have on that discipline that serve just well on that market place, but it will put pressure as we think about '14 as we pace into the other quarters in '14.", "It will put some pressure on risk-based, our membership.", "Steve Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to shift over to Optum. Curious how you see, your margins progressing in Optum through the year. You mentioned ramping Optum360 making investments there. I know, you clearly need to see a pretty substantial ramp up over the course of the year to get to that margin guidance range. So interested in progression there please.", "Steve Hemsley", "We do expect that, Optum is performing exceptionally well and doing it while balancing investments and the assimilation of new business. So it's impressive performance John, Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "John, can start and then I'll [indiscernible].", "John Rex", "Yes, so just Dave to lead off, I'd say both overall Optum in the individual segment results were in line with the expectations. I think kind of part of what you're alluding to that Dave, is within OptumHealth and OptumInsight earnings were down year-over-year about 4%, 5% respectively here.", "And what we are doing here is really investing for the future. I would say it's centerpiece of one Optum chapter two. It's all about investing for our future growth. Well I can, draw the parallels to OptumRx and what we did there over couple last few years investing several hundred million dollars into that business and you can now see the results as we are kicking off into 2014.", "As we look at '14 for ourselves here in OptumInsight and OptumHealth. We'd be looking to invest over $200 million in those businesses this year. All about next generation clinical, administrative, data analytics, collaborative care. Our Optum360 business. We are consistent with kind of look we provided at Investor Day and back to your direct question on progression looking for 40-60 split in terms of earnings progression first half, second half. So get direct to that.", "Larry Renfro", "So Dave, it's Larry Renfro but let me make a couple of comments. As John said, Steve said we are investing obviously in future growth. This is all part of the one Optum plan that we put in place three years ago. Where we are continuing to balance growth, investments and cost management. I won't go back over what John was talking about in terms of the some of the examples, but I will mention the PBM because that is the perfect example of something we invested in for a couple of years and we are now starting to see the pay off of that.", "I'd also tell you, that you could refer to healthcare.gov and the way that we've been working the Federal Government as well as the State as we are starting to partner that's part of one of our disciplines of larger and deeper relationship and we believe that's going to pan out, but the most important thing probably is that $60 million of expense in the first quarter was a planned expense.", "We haven't [DDA] from our plan and we will reset at this point in time. I think you can look at both business segments and see that the revenues are up. I would tell you that OI or the OptumInsight backlog is up 18% to $7.2 billion and I can also tell you that OptumHealth and OptumInsight's pipeline is 58%.", "So all this is planned, we are pretty comfortable where we are set with a solid start to the year and believe that will be strong for the rest of the year.", "Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sarah James from Wedbush. Your line is open.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc", "Thank you. I wanted to follow-up here on [ZUBSOLV]. First if you could kind of frame it, so the $100 million is about 1,200 cases. Could you split that between the three segments then to follow-up on pricing? Is it currently priced into your commercial product for this year? How does factoring it into Part D work and then Gail said that, she expected [ZUBSOLV] to be reimbursed for Medicaid does that retracted to the drug launch or more going forward?", "Steve Hemsley", "I think we will respond kind of in more general terms. We are certainly not going to get into case specific across segments. So absent that, I think we can give you a response.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Sarah. Dan Schumacher again, with respect to the new patient volume that we're seeing. We are seeing the highest volume on a percentage basis in Medicaid lock as you would expect as well as in Medicare and then follow-up by commercial, but when you translate that through to the impact obviously Medicare is lower because of the reinsurance aspects of Part D.", "So that gives you a sense of where the volume is coming from, with regard to the reimbursement. I'd ask Austin Pittman to provide some perspective.", "Austin Pittman", "Sure. Thanks Dan. So again as Gail mentioned, we are working diligently with all of our States first to get in alignment with their coverage decisions. Second on risk mitigations strategies, where we are covering again. We do expect it to that is a funding gap that will be solved certain issue of timing and we would expect that to be solved for the contract period.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc", "Does that mean retroactive?", "Austin Pittman", "Yes.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc", "Yes, okay. Thank you.", "John Penshorn", "Sarah, it's John Penshorn. Just I ought for caution on estimating number of people because as Steve mentioned the Federal Government is also covering some of this cost through their funding for the Part D program catastrophic coverage.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc", "Got it. Thank you.", "Steve Hemsley", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC", "Hi, there. At your Investor Day you mentioned that you were targeting 10 or more really large customer relationships by 2016 within Optum and I hear you about the backlog and the pipeline. Could you talk about, where you see those large relationships progressing in and when we might see some of those?", "Steve Hemsley", "Sure. We will respond in general terms obviously it's sensitive in terms of these things are active in the market today. So we don't comment ever on specific clients or opportunities but in broader terms. Larry, do you want to?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure, I will start and I might ask Dirk and I might ask Andy and [Bill Miller] all three to comment on this. We obviously are talking a lot about what we are doing with Optum360 and that marketplace that is a growth market place for us. The pipeline as Steve said, we from competitive standpoint would not really want to talk about right now.", "Especially what we are doing on the revenue cycle management side. So I will ask Bill in a second to talk about that. I would tell you on the PBM side. We continue to grow, we continue to see a large number of our RSP's that we are participating in and I ask Dirk to speak to that and on the government side.", "Obviously what we were doing with the States, what we were doing with the Federal Government and some of the programs that we are involved in, our deals. But also, we are concentrating in the, what I call our collaborative care area that's our care delivery organization. We are going to beat that up bit, so I might ask Jack Larsen to start with that and just give a little feel for what we are doing there.", "Jack Larsen", "Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Christine. Jack Larsen. We would view the opportunity to investing our line with some of the better performing primary care physician oriented physician groups and other specialty groups around the country as really central to Optum taking on the mission of some of the toughest challenges of the healthcare system.", "For example today, in our local care delivery organization. We shouldn't think about as our broadly speaking our physician groups. We serve in 19 markets today and we serve just a little over 1 million people as patients. I would expect this to continue to grow, through some of those larger more comprehensive relationships that your questions sort of pointing at as well as grow it organically and at the continued use of M&A which I think, we're pretty good at there.", "Steve Hemsley", "Well, maybe Andy you could talk about the government.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure, hi Christine. Very quickly, we've been pleased to have the opportunity to serve both Federal and State Government. I think what they've seen is something that's [indiscernible] of the answer to your question is, they've hopefully seen the technology the general healthcare and the execution capability that an organization like Optum can provide.", "I think that, we will build relationships both at the State level as well as take our technology out commercially in a bigger and bigger way really substantial relationship where we become a more embedded part of our clients.", "Steve Hemsley", "So maybe Dirk on the PBM?", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes on the PBM, hi Christine. Our pipeline's up a big year-over-year and this really on top of a nice strong sales showing last year. If you look at final [spinings], we've attended. We are certainly getting our ad backs with a big customers.", "For example this year, I've already attended two final [spinings] where opportunities where in the 0.5 million member range. We are certainly getting our opportunities. We are excited about our pipeline, although I will tell you we are really still early in the season at lot [TBD].", "Larry Renfro", "Two more areas, I'll ask Mike [indiscernible] and this goes back to Steven's comment in his opening remark about the 700 organizations that we do not do business with today. Obviously on our consumer solution side, we are starting to really target. So Mike, maybe you might want to comment on those?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure, this is Mike [indiscernible]. So from a employer perspective there's 700 of the Fortune 1,000 that Optum doesn't serve in any way today. We think there is a large opportunity out there for us to take a lot of our consumer solutions directly to those and wrap those services around them.", "So we are in ramping up the sales force. We are in conversations, starting those conversations with the number of these large employers. We are also starting conversations with a number of associations and other places to try to get to consumers with product and services that we think will really empower them to take ownership at their healthcare in new ways.", "Larry Renfro", "So I'll end with [Bill Miller]. Bill, could you talk a little bit about our hospital market.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes, so Christine. Thanks a lot. There's three things that I'll touch on and where these big relationships will continue to grow and foster and our three basic areas as we mentioned. Optum360 and we are in several negotiations with the next phase of clients, we obviously aren't going to expose those right now, but I'd also remind you that business platform is adding clients every day.", "They may not be the big large multi-year arrangements and many of their if you look at our backlog going 18% to $7.2 billion that's a function of those tools that we have out in the marketplace of subsets of a full blown and the [NDL] being absorbed by many, many clients on a quarterly basis.", "And those set the stage for large arrangements down the line and some of those are measured in the $10 million to $15 million arrangements over the course of three years to five years, but we will see other very large ones added over the year and then I think we are doing far more work on the ACO side helping hospitals, reengineer themselves to become ready for fee-for-value.", "So we've had several large transactions in that space and we will continue to see those through the year and then finally, the other area emphasis for us both in our payer, provider. Andy touched on it in the government market is our continue ability to impact the market place from a BPO standpoint.", "With our technology scale, with our state-of-the-art technology and ready to go technology along with our consulting services. We are finding acceptance in the marketplace whether it be amongst payers or providers to slide in the positions, where we are really managing large chunks of there, if you will core business so that they can focus on taking care of their members.", "And with our backgrounds both on the payer and provider side. We end up being a pretty suitable partner in those really game changing decisions that governments, payers and providers are making and more consistent basis as margin pressures and talent pressures continue to mount the market place.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Steve Hemsley", "So I might complete that very comprehensive response, by saying if you listen Optum's challenges are out more around abundance. There are significant opportunities getting those relationships started right, recognizing. They're going to be substantially larger than the relationships we've had in the past that they're going to engage a broader spectrum of services and that they're much longer term.", "We are trying to be thoughtful about these approaches in each of our businesses there as well as continuing to make sure that we are investing. So that we are delivering ever better value. So they're navigating in that those kind of waters right now which are really great waters to be in at the moment.", "So next question.", "Operator", "Your next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Thanks a lot everybody. I guess I was thinking, you hadn't really said much about your views about, with how the whole public exchange for share process played out and now that. We are done with the open enrollment. You got to think fairly quickly about what you're going to do with respect to 2015, give us any updated thoughts and assessments of how it played out and what your posture will be for next year?", "Steve Hemsley", "Sure. I'll have Gail and others to respond principally to that. We were involved from the Optum side, so we do have some perspectives from that. it is still very, very early in the life of the exchanges and second year in terms of how they will evolve, will be effectively somewhat by what I call, a lot of spontaneous change over the course of the first year implementation, which we understand that does require some consideration and calibration as we go, but Gail do you want to start?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure. Good morning. As you know, we had a very modest footprint in 2014 and as we've said and still believe, we do have buyers to increase that participation in 2015. There's a lot happening in that, we are in the process of doing our evaluation. Obviously, we are looking at how the markets and products are regulated. The networks that we would put in place, but there are some things that we did learn in the first part of the market for us that the size of the overall market is positive and that the configuration of products around sober, is also positive for the market and that there is now some experience and a desire to be, to keep the exchanges stable.", "So we don't know much about second year pricing. We do enough first year pricing still again, at this stage just reiterate that our [bias] is to increase our participation to '15 and we will share more with you as those decisions are made over the coming months.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay and great thanks.", "Steve Hemsley", "You know, I'd also observe that while we will, if we engaged in readiness. You really don't have to commit until September I think. So we have time to see how this plays out a bit.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay.", "Steve Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the comments on intensified pricing. I guess ones, where I make sure is it just in New York or you're seeing it. Your startup in other markets and then second did you say that, in New York it was coming from new entrants and existing competitors and then just the last piece. You're just trying to sort of tying in on how related it is to, the public exchanges plans, maybe pricing that would encourage dumping or is it or are you saying it's just sort of head-to-head off exchange sort of land grab. Thanks.", "Steve Hemsley", "I think that Gail and Jeff are perfectly prepared for this.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Good morning, Ralph. A couple of things because there is number of questions embedded in there. Let me start first with your questions around exchanges in early renewals. One of the first things, is that we've had a very successful early renewals of our small group customers in the fourth quarter that clearly is a big positive for us going forward.", "In terms of the New York issue, I'm going to let Jeff specifically address it. We talked about it, but it is a unique to New York issue and yes it is both existing competitors well as new entrants, but there is some unique dynamics in that market.", "You brought a question around what's happening in the competitiveness of the overall market. As Steve said in his opening comments, we have seen in the first quarter again after very successful early renewals of small groups and intensified pricing in some slack markets that is having an impact on our fully insured risk because we have stayed very disciplined in our pricing.", "So that's really the dynamic that's going on it is select market. And there is dynamic of the early renewal that occurred that having impact on that. New York has some unique characteristics and we wanted to point that up because of those in your characteristics and I'll ask Jeff again to comment on that.", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Ralph. Yes actually, when you think of that New York market place it was probably one of the least affected by the ACA as it is been community rated. Some fairly stable from '13 going into '14 but there were some new entrants into that market place that in our opinion clearly are underpriced what the cost structure is in New York, not only our cost structure but certainly their cost structure.", "And then over the last few years, we've had competitors that have left the New York market place that chose to reenter the market place in January '14 and we see those competitors also under priced for what the economics would call for it.", "Steve Hemsley", "So next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, I know it's clearly very early here but just wanted to get your thoughts on expectations for the 2016 MA rates, just sort of thinking about some of the factors that benefited the 2015 rates at CMS, said that they may revisit for example freezing the move to the risk adjustment model, then also delaying their proposal one on the HRA proposals.", "You know I there was hope and expectations at the 2016 MA rates, we can see the sky sort of clear there, but given some of those factors that I mentioned, just interested in your thoughts here on, 2016 MA rates?", "Steve Hemsley", "You know, I'm not sure that we offer kind of public perspective on future rate settings that we don't really have any control over. We are aware of the factors and many others that go into thinking in terms of rate setting. We are still digesting 2015 and I really am not going to comment about that rate setting process.", "If you look back, our [batting] average on that would be pretty poor. So I don't think we are going to set into that, I would just speculate that there is been pretty steady funding pressure in terms of the Medicare Advantage program that it is been hit severely by the insurance taxes. It's been effected by the funding posture in various ways that CMS develops the rates each year and this is now been several years against a moderate but still rising overall cost trend.", "So we will be very watchful and careful with respect to continuing to advocate for fair funding to the Medicare Advantage segment. It's a segment that serves 15 million seniors, it continues to grow. It continues to perform exceptionally well particularly in comparison to the fee-for-service program.", "So we would be advocates of thinking that programs really should be more the future of Medicare and funded appropriately for that purpose and that it affects seniors. Our posture there hasn't really changed and it won't change in '16 and we will be hopeful that, to you know the funding perspectives take that into consideration going forward. Beyond that, I really can't really respond to your question.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Christian Rigg from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just want to make sure, I understand the messaging on the Hep C sorry to come back to that, but you know Dan I know you said percentage wise you're seeing the most volume in the government segments. But in the press release, the only area where you're specifically highlighted is in the commercial side.", "So is it fair to assume that, sort of the greatest area of surprise has occurred in commercial or there is been across the board. Thanks.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Chris. It's Dan. We've been surprised on the volume, the pent up demand across all three businesses and maybe I'll step through the Commercial Care ratio and how that goes into the consolidated and how you think about Medicare and Medicaid to put it into context around the pieces.", "So from, as you look at the Commercial Care ratio it was higher this quarter than we had expected and there's really two pieces two it. One obviously Hep C and the other element is the early renewals. So we saw greater volume of early renewals and so customers choosing to stay with their existing plan typically healthier and younger and that led to less premium.", "So those are two factors that were really influencing the commercial outcome and then when you blend that together with Medicare and Medicaid which had pressure from Hep C but overall are performing well in line with our expectations that meets the impact at a consolidated level. So hopefully that provides greater color on the implications inside each for the businesses.", "Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Understood. Thanks.", "Steve Hemsley", "And I wouldn't take any undue significance to the order. We just merely talked about commercial first and got it in there first, there was no intent there. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group. Your line is open.", "Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC", "Good morning. I have to say to put this in context $0.35 worth of earnings pressure to come up with this decent quarter with hard work on a big organization and it's appreciated and I respect it very much. The question I have to get away from the important detail of Hep C and some of the other items is, to step back and perhaps take a look at the bigger picture of the company for a second.", "I noticed that for example you spent $345 million, if my numbers are correct this quarter on acquisition. You're spending another $200 million on investments in the two Optum businesses Health and Insight in order to create platforms in structure and opportunity for further growth, but what I'm really I'm trying to get at it is, what else can you tell us or share with us about your thoughts on capital deployment.", "Whether it be acquisitions or investment in the business or indeed dividend policy and share repurchase that we should be looking for as not so much offset but positioning the company for growth this year as well as in the out years.", "Steve Hemsley", "I offer a response that probably won't be very surprising and then ask Dave, if he has any comments. I would \u2013 our capital postures have been changed and in the broadest sense and they're all oriented towards balance of building for the future in continuing to grow and diversify and enterprise in a thoughtful and logical way and then making sure that we are returning capital to shareholders in a efficient as well as balanced way.", "So we will continue to invest organically actually first and foremost and you can see those investments play out in our Optum business and there are also investments in the UnitedHealthcare business and I would also offer that a lot of our internal capital spending as you set in the financials are particularly related to technology in continuing to advance in a refine, a better and more modern health system that we can propagate across the country.", "We continue to balance that with external growth and we continue to maintain a disciplined appetite to continue to grow and expand our business, where we see opportunities to either expand or position a market share that we are looking to pursue market position or secondly cultivate a capability and much of our investment is around bringing capabilities into [bear] and adding them to our portfolio.", "Optum is a great example of this and our technology is its wealth. And then lastly to return capital by way of a balance between dividends which we have been advancing strongly and will continue to take an orientation to make sure that we are advancing them to a market pay out position and share buyback.", "Those have served us well and they've been very consistently applied and it provides a nice balance in terms of being able to continue to advance, expand and diversify the business and capture that growth, which is really the sustaining longer term growth and opportunity as well as maintaining a discipline over capital efficiency and maintain appropriate and hopefully accretive capital returns and earning returns.", "Dave Wichmann", "Having that be, virtually impossible to say anything in addition to our shareholders. Dave Wichmann [indiscernible] for a couple of additional comments. First probably as you've seen in this quarter. We had a nice cash flow in the quarter particularly compared to last year and we are managing cash flows and our returns on invested capital very hard and in very disciplined way.", "The increase in cash flows for this year to the $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion level be invested as Steve discussed. I think you've seen that, we had a very strong repurchase period in the first quarter here. Set 3 billion and 3.5 billion in shares repurchase through 2014 but clearly we are on track towards the upper end of that range at this stage.", "In the spirit of continuing to return capital to shareholders. As you know, each of the last three years we've increased our dividend by 30% or more that is something that we are committed to reevaluate in periodically. We really look at the outlook of our business, the capital requirements of our business and then also what our peer benchmarks are I don't think it's news to anybody that we have some room to improve there.", "On the M&A front, you notice there's a relatively modest investments but I think strategically important because they're aligned to, what we said at our investor day. They're really oriented more towards our Optum businesses where we see a stronger growth prospects turn these growth prospects and in that case.", "We think, we've acquired the leading consumer digital health platform in the country, but in addition to that. We continue to extend our reach internationally with relatively modest but strategically important investments particularly in South America, where we think there's a wonderful opportunity long-term to grow.", "So with that, I'll end. Thank you.", "Steve Hemsley", "Thank you for the question. Next question, please", "Operator", "Our next question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi, thanks appreciate you guys taking the question here at the end. So I really just want to drill in to this commercial MLR ratio and make sure we are not overreacting to New York and a couple of things.", "The good guys in the quarter to me would be the ACA fee. So it would be helpful if you could tell what the actual ACA fee was and maybe by segment that would be particularly helpful and then the impact of whether, it looks as though with your payables up four times as much as your premium sequentially. You're probably just assuming that utilization comes back and we will figure that out, when we get to see March, April claims.", "And then on the bad side, hep C is $100 million of 36 basis points. Obviously not all of that is commercial and so I'm assuming maybe that's 10 basis points. So that certainly is not getting above your range and New York State I calculated you know about 7% your overall premium. So you know every 100 basis points there is seven bip.", "So I'm struggling to figure out, what's going to drive you above the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range in Commercial and really want to just make sure that New York is not bigger than sort of 7% impact or something that I'm calculating.", "Well, we'll respond I think more in general terms and I agree there shouldn't be an overreaction and I would also agree that it is a portfolio of issues and pressures and we are kind of alerting you to that portfolio. So that is kind of context. Dan, do you want to respond?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Josh. It's Dan. You add a lot a pieces to that. First I want to clarify, you talked about the commercial loss ratio. The commercial loss ratio guidance is 79.2% plus or minus 50 basis point. The consolidated loss ratio guidance is 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "And so as we look inside the Commercial business. We have two principal pressures, the bigger of which is the early renewal impact and having less premium. Good long-term thing, it impacts our premium in near term and then the second in the order of impact is, the Hepatitis C impact and when you put that together that gets muted on the Medicare and Medicaid side because they don't have those other dimensions we are talking about other than the Hep C.", "And our consolidated basis, that might suggest that a loss ratio may lean towards the higher end of the range. That's about, also I think ACA fees. Our fees in the quarter, we're in the range of about $450 million on an expense basis and then obviously from a reimbursement standpoint, we have reimbursement in the commercial business, which is higher because it has insurer fees and the reinsurer's fees.", "We have less in Medicaid because it's just the insurer's fee and then there isn't a mechanism in Medicare in premium to recover that. So hopefully that gives you some more context around the pieces.", "Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, so you didn't even mention as a pressure in commercial overall now. Is that because it's not big enough in terms of magnitude.", "Dan Schumacher", "That's more of an impact on the enrollment. So you look at a risk based enrollment and some of the pressure we are seeing there and potential forward, that's more a commentary on the enrollment and less on the loss ratio.", "Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. So I guess I'm still struggling to understand the commercial ratios 79.2% plus or minus 50 basis point seeing impact of more than 50 basis points. Again I know hep C is small of the early renewals, I assume have to be a huge impact then much bigger than you guys were expecting.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "It's a very meaningful impact on the early renewal side, we saw more than two times the volume, we had expected.", "Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay.", "Steve Hemsley", "But again, also a good thing in terms of it positions us and how it sustains that members and does it for a good period. So I think, while there is resulting pressure. The reality is, I think a very good business decision and a good outcome for us. Right.", "Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right and no impact from weather then because that wasn't mentioned.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I would tell you, as we look at weather in the quarter. It was a very smallish impact. As you look which days were the heaviest in relation to what we see a normal patterns as you look at where our densities are from a population perspective. It wasn't particularly meaningful.", "Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Thanks.", "Steve Hemsley", "But you've a very good list, Josh. You were listening very attentively and but I think we will conclude our Q&A session for this morning as always. There an opportunity for you to talk to John and Beth and so forth through the course of the day. I just might sum up by saying UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are tracking to the plans, we shared with you.", "As we told you in December. We fully expect the challenging conditions throughout 2014 and we are working through the headwinds of ACA implementations, the Medicare cuts, comparative market dynamics etc. we would have had an underlying growth rate of more than 20% absent the impact of ACA taxes in the regulatory provision.", "We believe we have the right plans and plays to deliver on our commitments and we know the people of this company have the talent, the experience, the innovation and the drive and are determined to succeed. So we thank you again for joining us. We will see you next quarter and this concludes this morning's call. Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes today's program.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 17, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review our first half 2014 performance within the context of the goals we set for this year and the opportunities we see going forward. We see the next 18 months as important given that by January 2016 the ACA will largely be in place and we will be entering an election cycle that will set the stage for shaping the next phases of health reforms.", "For decades, the trend has been for greater private sector engagement in meeting ever increasing national healthcare needs. These include the foundation of what is today Medicare Advantage, the launch of Medicare Part D drug benefits, the formation of accountable care organizations, steady migration of Medicaid to managed care, the expansion of benefit coverage to the uninsured under ACA exchanges and expanded Medicaid programs and the improvements to the healthcare.gov and many state based exchanges.", "UnitedHealth Group businesses have participated strongly in each of these developments and we remain focused on making these efforts successful and sustainable as they continue to evolve and settle into the fabric of our national healthcare system. We continue to execute steadily on that change agenda and we believe an improving environment in 2016 and beyond will support acceleration on our earnings growth rate.", "This morning, we are raising our 2014 revenue outlook to $130 billion from the previous forecasts of $128 billion to $129 billion. We are strengthening our 2014 earnings projection to a tighter range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share. The increasing earnings momentum we expect in the second half of 2014 should position us to grow both revenues and earnings per share in 2015. Advancing our performance in this 18 month timeframe will remain challenging but achievable, anchored by strong Medicaid growth, steadily strengthening Medicare and international performance, deeper entry into new, more established public exchange markets and continuing strong growth and earnings momentum at Optum.", "These elements are visible as well in second quarter results reported today. In the second half of 2014, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues 7% to $32.6 billion and earned $1.42 per share. Optum contributed nearly 30% of our enterprise operating earnings this quarter. Solid cash flows from operations of $1 billion for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the first half of the year were approximately one times net income, in line with our 2013 patterns. As our strongest cash flows come in the back half of the year, we continue to project a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in cash flows for full year 2014.", "Reviewing our results in more detail, starting with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $30.1 billion. The quarter featured earnings from operations of $1.8 billion, driven by a strong operating margin of 6.1% even with the growing mix of public and senior sector businesses. UnitedHealthcare is seeing significant and accelerating growth in Medicaid. 380,000 more people in the quarter and 635,000 through the first half of the year. Coming from expanded access to Medicaid in about half the states we serve, the launch of Florida's planned Medicaid expansion, and core program growth from already established markets and programs.", "In Medicare, we grew to serve more than 400,000 more people across all products in the first half of 2014. A very solid and balanced performance considering the market actions we needed to take last year in response to reduced Medicare program funding from CMS. In the core senior medical products of Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental benefits, we have grown the number of seniors we serve each year for than a decade and this year should be no exception.", "There is no question the private sector provides significant value to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare has been and will continue to be a growth business at UnitedHealthcare. We are privileged to serve one out of every five American seniors. Today we serve 3 million people in Medicare Advantage plans and 12 million across all product types. We expect to deliver overall Medicare growth for years to come, driven by favorable demographic trends and our strong local market cost and value positions, supported by deeply integrated Optum resources in pharmacy services, primary care delivery, health calls, data analytics and compliance.", "Our Medicare Advantage business works with senior focused care providers under rising levels of well designed shared risk and performance based payment arrangements to deliver more effective clinical management in concert with well-targeted and executed home visits. From the seniors' perspective, we offer market leading access to quality care across a broad spectrum of venues combined with the attractive benefits under strong brands with convenient broad-based distribution.", "Commercial membership continued to track with recent trends. Pulling back in risk-based products as we remain focused on pricing discipline and endeavoring to strike the right balance in protecting margin and giving back some past growth. In self-funded products, our momentum is steadily strengthening. We are winning national account business and retaining key customers we are privileged to serve. We are pleased to return to serve as a core benefit option in the State of Georgia in 2015. Customers are still announcing final decisions and our pipeline is much stronger than this time last year. We feel positive about our January 2015 position at this early stage.", "In the individual market, we plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many two dozen state exchanges. This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016 as these markets become more established. By participating moderately this year and then watching closely and listening, we have learned about pricing, networks, regulatory structures, distribution and the consumers mindset regarding public exchanges. These data points help and form our positioning for 2015 which should be a better risk vintage for the public exchanges.", "We believe public exchange markets must be sustainable on their own, so our participation will not overly rely on risk corridors or assumptions under risk sharing provisions. The Congressional budget office estimates that more than 75% of the exchange market is yet to develop. And we believe there will likely be meaningful membership activity in the market after the initial experience of this year and as second year pricing is presented. So we plan to grow steadily from this point forward, advancing our participation in a measured manner in public exchanges in 2015, 2016 and beyond.", "Bringing together this year's developments across these various product categories, our original forecast for U.S. consumers served is proving fairly accurate in total with greater incremental losses in full risk commercial benefits which we discussed last quarter, offset by exceptional growth in Medicaid which should come in well in excess of 800,000 people this year.", "Turning to Brazil. Amil has seen clear signs of steady recovery from a surge in utilization beginning in the last half of 2013 in response to aggressive, new government mandated access standards. Our premium rates are improving and are catching up to the increased levels of medical services. We are deploying capital to continue building out Amil's franchises in to Rio, Sao Paulo in northeastern Brazilian market, which nicely benefitted our membership numbers this quarter with 110,000 net growth. In our view, Brazil remains the most fertile market for health benefits and services outside the U.S. and we expect our focus and efforts in this large, high potential market will reward our shareholders for years to come.", "At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend, plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. Our medical costs remain inline with our plan and remain moderate. The consolidated medical care ratio for the second quarter was 81.6%, 10 basis points higher than last year despite less reserve development and a shift in the mix of our business towards government programs resulting in upward pressure in the ratio year-over-year. These factors were mostly offset by 100 basis point reduction from the implementation of billing of the ACA fees and taxes.", "Second quarter results were led by the public and senior sector where revenues from federal and state based programs continued to develop positively. Public and senior sector earnings are running slightly favorable to our original 2014 outlook. We are constructively supporting innovative ways to universally improve the quality and affordability of healthcare for consumers. In one example, we and several other healthcare companies are collaborating with the not-for-profit Healthcare Cost Institute to develop and provide free access to online healthcare transparency tools that offer consumers the most comprehensive and accurate information about the price and quality of healthcare services so individuals can make more informed decisions about their health and healthcare.", "HCCI's transparency tool will be available in January 2015 and HCCI plans to advance more free services for consumers and other key healthcare stakeholders in the quarters and years to come.", "Last fall we took a more intense focus on improving our Medicare stars performance for Medicare Advantage. We made changes in people, organizational alignment, business processes and funding and resource allocation which we believe are yielding positive results. We project our stars performance for 2015 payment year will be better than expected and will steadily improve in 2016 over 2015 and even more meaningfully in 2017 and '18, creating a steady, multiyear upwards progression. Our commitment is to maintain a baseline of no fewer than 80% of our seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans rated four stars or higher every year.", "At Optum, we are tracking to deliver record revenues and profits again this year, driven by market demand for our broad portfolio of capabilities and solutions. Second quarter results are on plan with Optum's margins on course to strengthen again in 2014. We expect margins will reach approximately 7% this year even as our pharmacy services business grows at an accelerated pace. These advances are consistent with our original forecast last fall and Optum's 8% by 2016 commitment. We remain focused on building a scalable, end-to-end services platform. Healthcare system participants are beset with more complex challenges then they have ever faced. Their needs have grown well beyond the standalone product offerings that are characteristic of this fragmented market.", "Optum has integrated services and capabilities to better meet and anticipate the emerging needs of the market, whether around advanced analytics and population health, deeply integrating pharmacy and medical management for more effectively delivering and documenting clinical care. These markets each represent multibillion dollar growth opportunities unified for customers in a flexible, modern comprehensive and fully scaled services platform. The growth in revenue, backlog and pipeline and the increasing number of larger, deeper and more sophisticated Optum relationships demonstrates steady progress in converting these opportunities into revenues and provides visibility and near-term growth and an indication of strong long-term future we see for this business.", "At the same time, Optum continues to have opportunities to improve its basic operating performance. We continue to better integrate and align internally, focusing on delivering higher value products and services with greater efficiency, better leveraging resources and competencies and information analytics, technology and clinical care, and improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. These efforts are equally important to achieving our long-term earnings goals.", "Continued investment remains central to Optum's long-term growth. The quarter carried $80 million in investment costs as we deepened capabilities in areas such as consumer engagement tools and distribution services, next generation analytics that uniquely combine administrative and clinical data at scale, next generation medical care review and compliance analytics and services and international versions of product and services that have become established here in the U.S.", "We will be investing startup costs in major Optum360 relationships and Optum technology outsourcing arrangements and moving forward on services focused to the needs of targeted international markets. These investments continue throughout the year but should have less noticeable effects on results in the fourth quarter of 2014 as Optum's overall growth and performance accelerates and we benefit from the impact of the more seasonal businesses.", "In the second quarter, Optum's revenues grew 28% to $11.7 billion. Earnings from operations grew 23% year-over-year to $728 million. Operating margins declined slightly to 6.2% due to the planned investments just discussed and the exceptional growth of the OptumRx business. OptumRx again led this quarter's performance. Revenues grew 42%. Earnings from operations doubled while operating margins expanded a full percentage point to 3.6%. We process more than 150 million adjusted scripts this quarter, up 30% year-over-year. Our cost to fill a mail order script decreased 30% over the past year and we expect to drive increased consumer value through higher volumes of mail order business.", "We had exceeded our goal of 1 million new consumers served from business awards a spectrum of customers in 2014 and have some early awards in hands for 2015 with good a prospect pipeline. This growth is additive to the natural organic growth led by the in-sourcing of UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy business over the past two years.", "OptumInsight's growth was again led by strong performance in government sponsored services. OptumInsight is providing services to five separate state exchanges in addition to its continuing role with the federal exchange. By the midyear point, computer-assisted coding offerings from our Optum360 Revenue Management Organization were installed in more than 50 customers who operate more than 220 facilities. And the pipeline continues to grow.", "On the downside, the regulatory pullback in hospital, clinical compliance services continues and has pressures revenues and earnings for that product offering. And at OptumHealth, we are continuing to build out our local care delivery organization. Today our physicians and clinical professionals touch 2 million consumes with high levels of clinical quality to our local clinics, which are prominent leaders in their market. All in, Optum delivered an exceptional second quarter and first half with improved earnings and capital returns compared to a very strong prior year. We expect Optum's earnings to accelerate in the second half of 2014, especially in the fourth quarter as they have in the past years. Driven by strong revenue growth, achieving performance incentives from customers, the accumulating benefits of operational efficiencies and structural cost efforts, and favorable seasonal patterns at OptumInsight and OptumHealth.", "Optum remains on page to contribute roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing in future growth of this business. To summarize, the first half of the year was strong with revenues growing by $3.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. First half earnings of $2.52 per share position us positively for the full year growth. With a strong second half growth performance from Optum and seasonal strength in UnitedHealthcare's second half operating margins, expected to help accelerate our earnings and bring us to a strong close.", "We see 2014 revenues at about $130 billion and net earnings in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion. We are intensely focused on continuing to execute evermore sharply on the details and fundamentals in every aspect of our businesses and in everything we do for the people we serve. We will provide a full view of our 2015 expectations at our annual investors conference in New York City on Tuesday, December 2nd.", "So thank you for your time this morning and we will now take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan", "Questions on medical cost trends. I know you indicated trends inline overall, but given the recent data points out there, I was hoping you might have some color to share in terms of real time Rx trends, hospital discharge planners etcetera. And then just a quick follow up on your Medicare Advantage comments in the prepared remarks. Is it reasonable to expect you are in a position to grow membership here for 2015. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. So Dan Schumacher, you want to comment. I don\u2019t know if we can get into that level of detail but I think we can add some color.", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Dan. With respect to the costs, obviously in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance. And as Steve mentioned, our underlying cost trends remain very well controlled. We continue to make improvements in our medical cost management and a lot of that, honestly, is in strong partnership with Optum. Whether it be payment integrity, local care delivery, our partnership with OptumRx and so forth. And so as Steve mentioned, on the full year we still expect our cost trend to be in the 6% plus or minus 50 basis range. We would like to expect that to be closer to the lower end of that range.", "With regards to what's happening in the quarter and our early data, nothing would suggest that we are seeing any kind of surge. So as we look at daily hospital census data, as we look at prior authorization for outpatient and inpatient procedures, pharmacy fulfillment, all of those things wouldn\u2019t point to any sort of surge in the quarter.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Gail, (indiscernible) now if you want to talk about MA.", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of your question on Medicare Advantage. First of all, we really alike our position around Medicare and feel that the work that we have done over the past year has put us in a good position. So overall we are looking to grow. We will provide you a lot more detail obviously at our investor conference but we do feel that the work around network product positioning value has put us in a good place and I feel positive about Medicare.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Do you want to add anything?", "Unidentified Participant", "I think you said it well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I was hoping maybe you could talk about the -- what you are seeing in the pricing environment as an update from last quarter in the traditional commercial risk business and maybe not relative to the 280,000 commercial risk lives that lapsed during the quarter.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Matt. It's Jeff Alter. Really nothing has changed in the pricing environment that we discussed in the first quarter. The pressure remains in mainly New York and a couple of other small group markets. You know I would just remind you that a part of that, or a large part of that 280,000 member loss which related to our individual footprint. We had mentioned in our investor conference that we were going to lose individual business throughout the year because of our pullback in a lot of markets. And I think we are beginning to see changes and some good momentum in other parts of our business, other than those few pressured markets. And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, really encouraged by the national account season and then our win back of the State of Georgia and couple of other larger public sector accounts.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Has your view changed at all with respect to -- you are looking at 2015 being a quiet year for contract changes?", "John Rex", "Matt, could you clarify what type, I am not following. It's John Rex.", "Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Well, I think that the question earlier in the year had been, with 2015 are you going to see significant carrier switching, particularly for the large accounts that renew on a calendar year basis. And I think you had said, you thought it was going to be a relatively quiet year for that. Now with your backlog increasing, has that view changed at all?", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail. In terms of your question, a couple of things. Steve mentioned in the comments and I think Jeff reiterated, in the large case market we feel pretty positive about what we are seeing in that marketplace and the momentum we have. You saw we just won the State of Georgia back, which I think is another positive. In terms of in-year switching, we are very pleased with the pieces that we locked in as part of last year and that provides us a nice long-term run rate. So overall, and we see there are some positive emerging dynamics, but again, we are early into this cycle right now so I don\u2019t want to comment for next year but I think it's pretty consistent with what we have said on the last call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.", "Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Your guidance for commercial loss ratio back in December was 79.2, plus or minus 50 bps. You noted on the first quarter call that the pressure from SOVALDI and the New York pricing market was pressuring the overall consolidated loss ratio towards the higher end of the 80.5, plus or minus 50 bps, but never, I think, specifically noted what the impact was on the commercial loss ratio. So it's hard to tell right now whether the commercial loss ratio is trending about where you expected it to be or is it more worse than you expected it to be. Especially since it looks like there is some gains from favorable revenue adjustments on the government business. Can you talk to sort of the puts and takes relative to the Medicare business -Medicaid business, and the commercial loss ratio relative to your expectations?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I will have Dan answer that, but that\u2019s quite a question so we will kind of do it in a summarized form", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Thanks, Peter. So obviously in the first quarter we talked about both our consolidated loss ratio and the implications underneath that our commercial loss ratio would be near the higher end of the range that we had provided at investor day. And as we look at the second quarter in light of that revised expectation, we see things tracking well. So our commercial business is tracking in line with those expectations coming out of the first quarter and we are doing a little bit better in the government business on the care ratio.", "Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And can you specifically say what the revenue impacts were from the favorable true-ups in the revenue development in the government business?", "Daniel Schumacher", "I am not going to share specifically the revenue developments but just to provide a little bit more color on the revenue developments. They are not something that -- they are not uncommon for us, particularly in the second quarter. And so what you are seeing is a combination of finalization of our 2013 Medicare revenue that has pulled through to our 2014 estimates and we also have true-ups in our state based programs. So we have got true-ups obviously related to the industry fee as we get that, as well as normal retroactive rate adjustments. So all of those things are representatives out there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays", "Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "So just getting back on Medicare Advantage. I appreciate the comments that Gail made around, you guys will look to grow in 2015 and you look your positioning. So is that indicative, I guess it's sort of a two parter so I will admit I am cheating upfront. Are you done with provider renegotiations and network work? And then I guess more importantly, is Medicare Advantage a growth business from an operating earnings perspective next year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Steve Nelson, why don\u2019t you respond to that?", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. First in terms of just overall positioning. Our Medicare Advantage business as Gail mentioned, we really like the performance so far and we have made quite an investment in stars, in our clinical programs and network. And these things have to work together in order for this to continue to be a growth business for us. And so in terms of network specifically, we have done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of shaping our network and concentrating our numbers with high quality and highly engaged providers. That work will continue but I would say in kind of a, more of a different format. We are going to be working more with providers inside our network to further concentrate that membership and expand our ACO footprint, engage more heavily in capitation and other kinds of value based contracting within our existing network, as opposed to actually reducing the number of providers. So it's a little bit of shift towards working with providers already on our network but working closely with our network and shaping it and focusing it in this way as it's going to part of an ongoing process and really important as we continue to improve our stars, our clinical performance and our member satisfaction.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think we are very positive on this. We have taken the steps that were necessary and they were the most disruptive and I think at this point forward we are now positioning this business in a way for good long-term sustainable growth, star compliance. And so while we have continued to be working on this, we are very positive about where this base will go.", "Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "So to recap, you are not making -- so all of the heavy lifting and the big changes around providers and things that really impact the member, that\u2019s kind of behind us. The rest of it's going to be kind of behind the scenes, more capitation the better. So I know that\u2019s what gives you comfort on the member side but is it also fair to say that, okay, from that perspective it sounds like you are getting a more efficient network and that earnings growth should be and you sort of reset margins over the last couple of years that it's more conceivable to see earnings contributions from that segment as well?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I think you're fine on all those levels. I do think that we have to be attentive to Medicare Advantage funding levels because that has been a pressure point and so forth. But in terms of the things that would be disruptive to the business, Steve, I think those have run the course....", "Steve Nelson", "Yes, I think you summarized it well. And we think the earnings range for the government business we have talked about for us, between 3% and 5%. And we are in that range this year and we will continue to be in that range. That\u2019s our view and I am obviously not giving specific guidance for next year but more to come. But that\u2019s how we think about it. Really great performance and I am excited about the competitive positioning looking forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "I was hoping you could provide some color on utilization levels of the newly insured? And it would be really helpful if you could break that out to the newly insured on the Medicaid side, so would work or expansion members versus the commercial side, the exchange members that were previously uninsured?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We will. And now keep in mind we have a very low profile in exchange, but Gail and team, you want to respond?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Sure, good morning, Sarah. Steve -- first let me reiterate what Steve said around the public exchange membership. We have got a very modest footprint there so I wouldn't draw any conclusions from our early experience in that sector. On the Medicaid side as you've seen we've gotten tremendous growth. We're really pleased with it. We did expect to see increases in utilization and we also got higher rate sales for that and it's tracking very much in line with the expectations we had. So overall, I think very much in line and we're, again, extremely pleased by the growth that we are seeing not just across the expansion but new states wins as well as expansion of our current existing membership footprint.", "Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "And can you just clarify, I think you guys mentioned you're not relying on three R's for 2015. Does that also mean your guidance assumes no receivables for 2014 for the three R's?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sarah, it's Dan. On the three R's, we have nothing on corridors and risk adjustment and we have very modest reinsurance that\u2019s assumed recovery, that's immaterial.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America", "One quick clarification before I get in to main question. Did you say Steve that you have expected 2015 stars to be better than expected? I didn\u2019t quite understand that comment.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. We are expecting to track progress in 2015 and build progress from that in '16, '17, '18. So we are committed and see forward progress in stars.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America", "You don\u2019t mean what we know of already. You don\u2019t mean the '14 data for '15, you mean '15 for '16 to be better than expected?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Gail, you want to respond to it?", "Gail Boudreaux", "Yes. When the stars were published last year, we had a sense of where our membership was. We have made significant improvements in our group business which will help improve our actual '15 results.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America", "Okay. All right. So it's a membership growth within the high star rating plans?", "Stephen Hemsley", "That\u2019s right.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America", "Okay. And then just, so the main question is on the exchanges. You mentioned that your year one was about kind of watching and learning and then year two is more about growth. Can you just give us a sense of some of the things that you have learned? Because you are making a really big move. You are going to do a couple dozen states. You have really moved in. What's given you the comfort and the confidence that this business, since you are still relatively new around the claims development, that it is going to be stable into next year and that this is the year to move in rather than waiting another year to get even more information.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I will also have the -- so this will be a team response. But, again, this was consistent with how we positioned this right from the beginning that we would observe the first year for the most part and then endeavor to participate. And we will see how we ultimately participate as we go through the balance of this year and get ready for the next year selling season. But the size of the and response of the exchange, we expected growth in it and so forth plays into that thinking and recognition this is going to be an established sector in the healthcare benefits marketplace and that we have to chose to participate at some point of time. It kind of wanted to make sure that we don\u2019t go in too late. So I think, we are thinking this is about the right time.", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail Boudreaux again. The only thing I would add is, getting back to Steve's comments, we have felt it was a good long-term market. What we have been able to observe and learn over the course of the market as we know the existing pricing, we know the network constructs, we know the consumer behavior on what they picked in these different markets. We have a better understanding of the regulatory structure and the distribution cadence. So from those factors, we are looking at the market as an opportunity. And again more than 75% of that market is going to emerge, we feel that those markets that we are looking at now are much established. So that\u2019s the background around our thinking on exchanges but again we have always thought it was part of our strategy and plan, that this is a good long term market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.", "Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley", "Moving over to the operating costs, they were actually meaningfully below our expectations and down year-over-year I think once you accounted for the charitable donation despite the pressures from the industry fee. Could you perhaps discuss the level of investments in the quarter and what other savings may have drove down that ratio?", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. We are quite pleased, Andy, with the operating cost ratio for the quarter. Obviously it's got a lot of pressure because of the implementation of the insurers fee in the second quarter which of course, it wasn\u2019t in place last year. We are really seeing the advances in our contributions from our PBM business, which is benefitting not only from scale efficiencies but also significant productivity advances, both around just regular process management as well as the implementation of technology. So Dirk and team have done an excellent job there. Otherwise, as we indicated in the investor conference, we were pursuing somewhere around 70 to 80 basis points of annual productivity improvements and we in fact achieved those in this quarter. So really what you are seeing is just raw productivity and scale advantages coming through our businesses as we project it.", "In terms of investments, I think we outlined those in the script with respect to the types of things that Optum is investing in. It's really investing in growth and I think that growth is really manifesting in terms of its pipeline expansion year-over-year. Kind of very nice job there and as indicated those investments were about $80 million in the quarter. On top of that as you might suspect, there are significant investments going in across the business so to respond to the implementation of the ACA provisions as well as growth -- more broadly -- are preparing for growth more broadly both in the exchange marketplace as well as in Medicaid.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna", "Just wanted to come back to hepatitis C. Obviously it hasn\u2019t been talked about nearly as much on this call but can you give us a sense for how the expenditures sort of tracked from Q1 to Q2 and sort of the pace of expenditures you are expecting in the back half of the year given the potential for some new drugs coming to the market. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Dan?", "Daniel Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Chris. Our Q2 spend for hepatitis C was in line with our revised expectations coming out of the first quarter. We will tell you that in the first quarter, our new patient volume peaked in all of our benefits businesses and I think we have got strong controls over the appropriate use. So as we think about the cost related to hepatitis C and its treatment, we have that accounted for and accommodated within our full year trend outlook as well as in our care ratio guidance.", "Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay. And then if I could, how are discussions going with the state Medicaid partners with regard to the drug. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Austin?", "Austin Pittman", "Sure. This is Austin Pittman. First of all, again, this is the cost of the program we expected to be fully reimbursed. We are very pleased and making strong progress in our discussions with our state partners in securing that reimbursement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Maybe a two part thing on Optum. First of all, I know you have talked around the investment spending and said it was $80 million in the second quarter but that by the fourth quarter it should have less impact. Is that because that $80 million run rate goes down or is that because of the leverage of spending. And then more broadly, just on OptumRx. You mentioned some positive related to the 2015 selling season. I wondered if you can expand more on, is Optum out there actively pursuing business across the board. Do you have your integrated model fully in place now or you can talk to people about total cost, or is that still something that will come in future selling seasons.", "Stephen Hemsley", "We will be anxious to answer that question. Larry, you want to take it?", "Larry Renfro", "A.J., it's Larry Renfro. I will start with the question on the planned investments and then I start to take up the PBM question in terms of the sales. So when we began the year and had our plan put together, we expected to spend about $200 million in what I will call planned investments for the future. It's a very very similar model to what we have actually done with the PBM and I think you know over the past few years we spent some dollars in order to get the platforms up to speed and we are kind of using that same playbook. So for the year it's $200 million. We have spent year-to-date about $140. So obviously we are overweight in the first half of the year and we will start to see that go down as we head into the fourth quarter.", "So financial targets and so forth, this is all planned. There is nothing out of the ordinary. So we are online or inline with everything that we are doing. So again, let me say that again, it's $140 million year-to-date that was planned year-to-date out of a total of $200 million. Dirk?", "Dirk McMahon", "Yes. So A.J., thanks. A couple of things first. Steve mentioned that we had a nice year in 2014 with respect to our growth. As we look at our pipeline for 2015, our pipeline is up double-digits compared to the same time last year. It's not a ton of business changing hands. If you look at what we have closed this year versus the same time last year, we are certainly ahead. We do feel that our synchronization message is resonating in the market as we go in and we talk to our prospects. It's all about bringing together the medical, the lab, the pharmacy data. Try to optimize outcomes and lower cost. We think we also have a good service offering and I think we do a pretty good job managing specialties. So all of those are contributing to our success.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just wondering given the broader entry into the public exchanges in 2015, what your strategy is for surmounting the auto enrollment policy that would seem to give an advantage to incumbents? Is it more that you just expect so much more growth in the exchange market that that's not really an issue? And just wondering whether you think that that policy is a bit anti-competitive for new market entrants or that it just benefits the market in terms of reducing likely the overall amount of churn in the market?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Scott, it's Jeff Alter. On the first part, there is going to be, as Gail and Steve mentioned earlier, still a large amount of the population that we expect to be in those exchanges, we will call at the end of the cycle and we expect to take a large part of that new business. But just on the existing population. You know there is a lot of leverage around the subsidy and price changes, so as competitors change prices, it does tend to move the subsidy dollars around pretty strongly. So we believe there will some, there will also be shopping even though people don\u2019t have to shop. I think just the natural consumer play at an exchange is going to cause a shopping experience and we feel we could get some part of that membership shift as it goes along. We are obviously not going to comment on the anti-competitive part of anything.", "Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And just as you see some of the initial rate filings now coming out for the exchanges in the individual market when, how would you say that those are coming out so far relative to your expectations in terms of the competitor filings.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think they are within our range of expectations. You are seeing competitors you might have relied a little bit on the three R protection and as that protection goes away, they have to adjust their pricing. And we are seeing that. So nothing that we have seen to date surprises us or changes the approach that we have taken with our own pricing. We are very comfortable with our pricing and just keep in mind that that pricing is driven not only by our forward view of cost but also, as we have mentioned, we have observed the marketplace. In 2014, we are bringing different products to market in some of these exchanges than we would have traditionally brought. Some more HMO. Much tighter alignment with Optum and some of their programs to help us manage the diseases the health of those members and creating a different -- in some cases a different dynamic with the network.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Could you paint us a picture around Optum360? What kind of investments are you making specifically there this year versus next year? What's the potential? What does this look like a couple of years from now? I am having a hard time visualizing the benefit of the financials and precisely what the model looks like?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, Larry, you want to start?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. Christine, I am going to hand this off to Bill Miller who is the executive that runs the OptumInsight and where Optum360 sits. And we will not specifically talk about our customers. Maybe I can frame some of the size of our potential accounts and where we are headed and I will let Bill then to talk specifically about Optum360. I think you know that when we set priorities for 2014, we talked about, really one of the priorities going after, and Steve mentioned it earlier, for the larger, deeper relationships and more complex relationships. And last year we aligned with an organization on the west coast to build revenue cycle management and we are starting to build that.", "So I am going to give you four, four areas that I would say that will kind of depict what we are trying to do and the size of that. Our external backlog right now is up 20% and that\u2019s up to $7.5 billion. Our pipeline is up 122% and continuing to grow. I will say that the government business is in that and if you look to that as a standalone, that's about $1 billion. Probably about $6.6 billion in that total pipeline. If you looked at our top 25 accounts and the revenues that we have had over the past since 2011, our revenues are up 2.5 times. And our accounts that had values of over $100 million are also up 20% year-over-year in the number of accounts that we have.", "Obviously Optum360, we have a strategy that we are not going to get into detail about because it is an extremely competitive strategy that we are deploying. That's why the amount of investment that we are actually putting in in the first quarter and we will start to see in the fourth quarter, I should say the first half of the year. And we will start to see the benefits of that in the fourth quarter as we talked a few minutes ago with A.J. Also be able to note that we are overweighed in our spend during the first six months of the year. So let me let Bill talk specifically about Optum360 and some of the things going on there.", "Bill Miller", "Yes, Christine, good question and thank you. So as far as painting that picture, I think the picture is, that\u2019s a very big market, a fragmented market. And we see ourselves I think very well positioned to drive a lot of efficiencies for health systems that are struggling with that fragmentation. We also bring I think a very strong attitude not only from a technology standpoint which we have served the market with for years, but all the services and processes needed to take out cost and operate a revenue cycle with far more efficiency that\u2019s going to be required in an environment where hospitals are continually pressured on their margins.", "And I think the other thing that we keep top of mind in terms of that vision of the future is we feel uniquely positioned to help drive out the friction between payers and providers, and we also do understand that in the future the role of the consumer and the patient experience associated with their care, their billing is something that\u2019s very critical and I think it's part of the mission of Optum360. And the investments associated with that are, I think being able to strengthen our technology portfolio along with on-boarding our largest clients and as Larry said, these relationships are growing in size and we really like the trajectory and the backlog that we have built and the pipeline growth that we have seen. Particularly over the last, I would say seven, eight months. John, you want...?", "John Rex", "No, I think -- just to add, Christine, you talked about -- less obviously you talked about the scope of those investments that\u2019s clearly encompassed in the $200 million that Larry has been talking about for full year.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And a lot of it is basically implementation on a much more comprehensive revenue cycle, population health, analytics paradigm to change the dynamics in large systems.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I want to go back to the MLR point. Can you maybe talk about seasonality in the business, sort of your thoughts there with sort of the continuation of and high penetration of high-deductible plans? Whether there is a potential that that sort of magnifies the cost picture, I guess in the second half of the year. And then along those lines, MLR guidance I guess is still close to that 81% level. You did 82% in the first half. Obviously it implies 80% in the second half. Is that kind of still a fair way to think about it? Thanks.", "Daniel Schumacher", "Hi, Ralph. This is Dan Schumacher. On the seasonality related to high deductible, we continue to make inroads in high deductible offerings. I mean it\u2019s an offering within our portfolio. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is any dramatic shift. I think the normal seasonal progression is what you should expect with regard to commercial and how deductibles play out. With regard to the consolidated loss ratio, our full year guidance was 80.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points and we suggest that that could be near the high-end of the range. And I think that\u2019s exactly how you should think about it.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So no change there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink.", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann", "I wanted to get some color on the [uplift] (ph) for the small group market in 2015. Now that there is proof of concept for public exchanges, might your competitors and you be more incented to price down because you would still make a margin higher than your potentially public exchange start to trip there offerings of benefits to their workers?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I am not sure that we got clear on the last part of your question. You want to refine that Ana?", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann", "Yes. So I guess what I am trying to understand is, I am hearing generally the buzz is that small group employers are more likely to dump or reduce their offerings for '15. So would that potentially put more pressure on the pricing as well as the size of the market for '15?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay. Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. We continue to believe that the employer dumping will be somewhat moderated, it was moderate this year. We are not sure next year is any year that would be much different than this year as these exchanges establish. And I would say, as you are seeing some of the pricing normalize which might take another year or so for that to happen. Just on the pricing interplay between the two markets. They are different markets and we look at them around the population that we are serving in each one of those. When we think about pricing there is no, right now in our thinking there is an arbitrage between those two marketplaces. They are different. There are different consumers served in those marketplaces. And our pricing for small groups is solely predicated on what we believe that risk looks like, what that membership looks like and then our responses to that risk. And that would be the same for the exchanges as well.", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann", "And does it include your self-insured competition as well. Is that propensity continuing to self-insured? Continuing as there is (indiscernible)?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Ana, I don\u2019t know what kind of phone you are on but it's not coming through clearly at all. So you want to try that one more time?", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann", "I was just asking if that is also consistent on the self-insured small and mid-market competition. Is there more movement to self-insured that could create pricing pressure again in fully-insured?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I don\u2019t think any difference in what has been going on steadily for maybe the last decade but, Jeff, Gail, any response?", "Gail Boudreaux", "This is Gail. No, we haven't seen any acceleration. There is no, as Steve said, a historical trend to self-insured. There was some early discussion around that moving down market but we haven't seen an acceleration in that?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "So question on your Medicaid performance. You are showing very strong results. So I wonder if you could remind us just kind of what you expect into next year. I mean do you expect outsized enrollment growth to continue into 2015 and additionally, where do you expect pretax margins in this business to settle out given a larger population driven by the Affordable Care Act, as well as new groups like dual eligibles?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Austin?", "Austin Pittman", "Sure. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the growth as well. It's been an outstanding year as Steve highlighted in his opening comments. We now expect that growth to be over 800,000 on the year. And I will tell you that the thing that is great about it, is if you look at this quarter's growth, the 380,000 that we grew this year, it's really evenly split between expansion populations as well as what I call core growth. So that\u2019s winning procurement, executing those procurements, implementing new programs within states that we are already in that state and have a relationship, and good strong organic growth. I think as far as the prospects for continued growth, we feel very strong about this business. Particularly if you look at the combined strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, our ability to really address state partners needs to deliver value in complex population. So I think the outlook is strong.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "And margins?", "Austin Pittman", "As we have talked about before, we expect this business to continue to perform at 3% to 5% range.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And that the scale will pull you to the stronger side of that?", "Austin Pittman", "Absolutely.", "Stephen Hemsley", "But that\u2019s do different than where he have been for the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies.", "Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies", "Wanted to get a little more framing around your SG&A expectations as the year progresses. There has been a fair amount of conversation about investments. Your first half is well below, I think your full year guidance. I guess I am trying at, could we expect that the full year will trend towards the lower end of that based on where you are looking so far this year or are there discreet investments that are layering on there in a fairly significant way to drive that up. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes. I guess a couple of things come to mind, is that we are clearly focused on continuing to be focused an efficient in this. And then there is the selling season in the second half of the year, is a big factor. But, Dave?", "Dave Wichmann", "Yeah, David it's Dave Wichmann again. As Steve outlined, it's both the selling season in the back half of the year which effects Q3. Kind of the preparatory work in advance of OEP and then in the Q4 the actual payment of commissions and otherwise associated with that business. But also the significant work we do to prepare for January 1st and the incremental volumes form growth in our business. So we always see the back half of any given year as having a higher operating cost ratio then the first half of the year. With respect to where we are at on overall guidance, we said it would be 16.7% plus or minus 30. We are still squarely within that range for the full year.", "Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies", "Are there, perhaps around exchange, your significant increase in participation in exchange that you anticipate for '15? Is that in line with what you would have anticipated when you gave guidance originally or is there perhaps more investment to prepare for that for 2015?", "Stephen Hemsley", "David, it's in line with what we had planned all along. So we always anticipated a more modest participation this year and then ramping in the 2015-2016 time period and that\u2019s exactly how this is playing out.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee.", "Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee", "Could you tell us how much of the sequential revenue growth at Optum this quarter was internal versus -- OptumRx was internal versus external?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I don\u2019t know if we can but obviously just given the size of UnitedHealthcare that it's a meaningful and the in-sourcing. It's a meaningful element there. Dirk, maybe you could comment generally on your balance for the year. I think you may have that available.", "Dirk McMahon", "Well, I guess what I would say is, we continue to have a pretty good year as we sit and look at it. Some of the efficiencies that Dave pointed out, we will continue to leverage those as well additional purchasing efficiencies that we have specifically in the generic area should continue to make us expand margins a little bit as we proceed through the year.", "Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee", "Yes, if I could follow up on EPS progression. Does the commentary about the acceleration in Optum in the fourth quarter and then getting the Medicare Advantage true-ups in second quarter versus third quarter, does that change the back half seasonality versus more recent years like last year?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, I think in general the pattern is consistent year to year. So the relative, kind of 40:60 in terms of the first half through the second half and then the fourth quarter should be stronger than the third. So that pattern holds up.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.", "Carl McDonald - Citigroup", "Six months ago you talked about growing earnings in 2015 but not at the long-term target rate. The earnings growth you talked about this morning, is that still the right context to think about? And related to that if there's any major shift in the moving pieces that you've highlighted previously in terms of another year of reforming from the patient Medicare rate cuts, that would also be interesting.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I am not sure I got the second half of that but, no, we would expect that our targeted growth rate which is kind of 13%-16%, that 15% would be in that zone, just given the continued adjustments. But then moving 16%-17% beyond, we clearly are focused on getting back to that zone and see a path to that. But the timing in terms of stepping through '15-'16, that\u2019s what we are navigating right now.", "Carl McDonald - Citigroup", "I'm sorry, the second half of the question was just if there was any change to some of the bigger moving pieces you talked about previously for 2015 in terms of Medicare rate cuts as well as another year of reform implementation being the biggest headwinds to getting to that long-term growth rate?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say there are new headwinds, which is a very positive thing to be. And I actually think that we are making real progress on the -- I think this quarter's performance and kind of our outlook. We are making steady progress on the challenges that are in the marketplace for us and everyone else. So I don\u2019t think there are any dynamic elements of that. If I go back to the things that I have parsed through in thinking about that, I would say the Medicaid performance and growth is a nice upside. I think our positioning on Medicare, I see us having made a nice adjustment here and are focused on making sure that we are attuned to kind of the next era of Medicare Advantage and Medicare product progression. We see a nice potential in terms of the international market place and good work that has been done in Amil.", "We are going to keep a positive posture towards the exchange market place and see that in the kind of same margin range as our, let's say our Medicaid business, at a 3% to 5% range. When you look at Optum and its potential and the opportunity for the collaborative care, local care delivery businesses, the potential of the major relationships. Kind of anchoring relationships for OptumInsight and 360 and the ability to kind of diversify and take a new, maybe broader more progressive approach on the PBM. That really does start to tie in medical costs, diagnostic testing and specialty pharma and so forth. I think that to provides a lot of potential to work with, kind of against the challenges that the ACA set in front of all of us and that we are working through right now. So that what gives us a view that we have a lot of work to do but there is lot to work with.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So with that we appreciate very much your attention today at UnitedHealth Group. Optum, and UnitedHealthcare delivered, I think a very solid second quarter. Growing both revenues and earnings per share. We remain focused on consistent, fundamental execution, innovation, service. We believe we are positively positioned for the full year and a strong close in '14 as well as continuing growth in '15 and beyond. So thank you and we will see you next quarter?", "Operator", "This does conclude today's UnitedHealth Group's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 21, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's Web site.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We entered 2015 with momentum from a strong 2014 finish and with more growth opportunity and fewer impediments than we've encountered over the last few years. We expect the strength of our performance capacities to become more visible in 2015 and even more so in 2016 and beyond, as we begin to perform more consistently to the full potential of this enterprise.", "In 2014 both top and bottom-line results exceeded the upper range of our original forecasts for the year. 2014 revenues grew 6.5% to exceed $130 billion and earnings grew to $5.70 per share despite material and well documented burdens from the ACA. UnitedHealth Group's performance in 2014 was highlighted by diversified growth, strong operating and medical cost management and continuing advances in service, innovation and enabling technology, positioning UnitedHealth Group to better serve more people and better respond to the demands of our evolving healthcare system in the coming years.", "Cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $8 billion or 1.4 times net earnings, with fourth quarter cash flows more than $2.4 billion a strong 1.6 times net earnings reflecting the core strength and quality of our business and earnings. In 2014 we raised our dividend by 34% to an annual rate of $1.50 per share. We repurchased $4 billion in UnitedHealth Group shares and return on equity once again exceeded 17%.", "As we take a more detailed look at 2014 results, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 5.3% to $120 billion. This past year, we experienced outstanding growth in Medicaid and better than expected performance across our Medicare portfolio, balanced off by challenges in the commercial and international markets as we entered the year.", "Beginning with Medicaid, organic growth of more than 2 million people over the last five years, including an exceptional 1 million new members in 2014, reflects a decade of strategic and operational decisions that have prepared us well to serve this ever expanding population in the states that entrust us to administer these programs. The Medicaid market was the first created by and aligned for society's desire to expand care for the uninsured. We have tuned our medical management and consumer engagement techniques to address the needs and experiences of these consumers. Leveraging the in-market personal care approach we use today with dedicated on-the-ground resources embedded within the communities we serve.", "Our footprint in the Medicaid market continues to grow. Now reaching states where nearly 60% of the Medicaid community resides. We combine a strong benefit value with deep trusting relationships serving the states and the people who rely on these programs and benefits. Today our community and state business is well balanced, serving people in more than 100 separate state programs, from children with young families, to duly eligible citizens with the most complex medical conditions. We continue to steadily grow serving Medicaid with about 60% of our 2014 growth from market expansion and approximately 40% from traditional sources. With year-over-year market share gains in existing programs and participation in new program launches. We expect to continue this pattern of broad-based growth in 2015 with revenues expected to grow 15% to 17% this year.", "In the senior and retiree market, strong execution drove meaningful growth for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, which added 295,000 seniors in Medicare supplement products and 215,000 people in standalone Part D. In Medicare Advantage, seniors continued to value and choose the modern benefits and support services they receive from managed care. And as you know, sustained government funding shortfalls for Medicare Advantage have hurt seniors, cutting back their benefits and causing disruptions, as products and markets were withdrawn across the industry in 2014, including more than 150,000 seniors impacted by our 2014 market and product exits.", "Despite this pressure, we grew to serve a net 15,000 more seniors in 2014, a small but hard won achievement. We\u2019ll be back to much stronger growth in 2015 as Medicare Advantage is expected to grow by 200,000 to 300,000 individuals. With Medicare Supplement continuing its long standing growth pattern adding another 250,000 to 300,000 people. As we will continue to serve seniors with our leading market position in Part D, we see an overall Medicare revenue growth rate of 6% to 8% in 2015. As expected, commercial and international markets were more challenging for us over the past year, but we believe this is beginning to turn as well.", "In Brazil, we grew revenues by just under 9% in 2014, with revenue lift provided by pricing changes and efforts to expand our geographic presence. Price increases clearly pressured membership levels, but are consistent with realigning our products for a sustainable marketplace going forward and we expect stronger market conditions in 2015. At the same time, Amil care delivery system of more than 30 strategically positioned acute care hospital facilities and over 50 clinical practices continues to grow and perform strongly. We are advancing more modern analytics, services and technologies across Amil\u2019s unique integrated benefits in care delivery platform to better analyze and manage costs, strengthen fundamental pricing and improve operational cost structures. Amil has exceptional brand equity. People recognize the quality of Amil\u2019s hospitals and care facilities and consistent value its medical and general benefits offer. Overall we expect revenues at UnitedHealthcare\u2019s global businesses to grow 5% to 8% in 2015.", "UnitedHealthcare commercial revenues retreated 4% in 2014. In 2015, they will increase and the year is off to a strong start. Consistent with the strategy, we shared with you over a year ago we participated modestly in the individual exchange market in 2014 with the expectation of more significant participation as the market matured. This year we are offering products in 23 state exchanges that are home to 54% of the U.S. exchange market population. This includes eight of the 10 largest exchange market states and 15 states, where we also offer complementary Medicaid plans.", "We\u2019ve enrolled more than 400,000 individuals through individual public exchanges, with four weeks of marketing still to go. We are ahead of schedule reflecting the brand value and trust in the UnitedHealthcare name. Growth in UnitedHealthcare\u2019s small group and middle market group health business, benefit businesses is also better than we had anticipated in a competitive but generally rational market landscape. The self-funded Employer business is positioned for stronger growth and sales performance in 2015 as well, as we continue to consistently deliver the combination of excellent service and innovation, low medical cost trends and flexible customized approaches, valued by the sophisticated large multi-market customer.", "Looking at the broader picture, UnitedHealthcare has consistently grown by offering differentiated value, service and execution to its markets. We\u2019ve grown organically by more than 8 million people in the past five years. We should grow to serve over a million more people in 2015, continuing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s track-record as the fastest growing health benefit company in the nation. We are confident UnitedHealthcare is positioned for continued growth including revenue growth of 6% to 7% in 2015.", "UnitedHealthcare delivered strong operating and medical cost performance during the last year. UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated medical care ratio continues to be the best overall metric describing medical cost performance across UnitedHealthcare\u2019s diverse benefits businesses. That consolidated care ratio of 80.9% improved 60 basis points in 2014, and we expect it to remain stable in a range of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2015. Medical cost trends in the commercial business were in the 5.5% zone for the year, with great consistency and execution on medical cost performance across the UnitedHealthcare businesses. Hospital usage per capita was lower overall again in 2014 and was lower across each of the UnitedHealthcare benefit businesses.", "Moving to Healthcare Services, Optum had a remarkable year in 2014 and is positioned to continue to perform strongly in 2015. Revenues grew by 25%, operating margins expanded to 6.9% and earnings grew by 32%, once again above the upper-end of our expectations for the year. Optum surpassed all of its initial 15-by-15 target, return on invested capital, margins and earnings all well ahead of schedule. In 2015, earnings are on pace to triple, since we embarked on the one Optum growth initiative a few short years ago.", "The fourth quarter was exceptionally strong with earnings growth of 53%. It was also something of a milestone surpassing $1 billion in operating earnings in a single quarter for the first time. Throughout 2014, Optum increased the quality and depth of its strategic relationships in collaboration with clients and partners. It combined good solutions with good execution for the complex problems faced by large sophisticated customers. This included Optum\u2019s assistance for the continued advancement at healthcare.gov and several state exchanges during the year.

OptumHealth businesses are gaining momentum in the wake of investments made over the last several years. We expect strong growth in earnings performance in the year ahead. OptumHealth revenues increased by 11.9% and operating earnings grew by 15% in 2014, all while growing the numbers our practices operated and patients and payors served in the care delivery business. Today Optum servers over 2 million consumers through owned and affiliated physician practices. On the consumer side, Optum is aggressively deploying better approaches and new technologies for consumer engagement, health enrollment and personalized consumer service and support.", "At OptumInsight, 2014 revenues grew 10.9%. Operating earnings grew by 21%. And the external contract backlog rose nearly 20%. OptumInsight\u2019s $8.6 billion backlog provides a clear indication of the future revenue performance and services. A prime example here is the unique Optum One analytics platform, which brings together a clinical, plain demographic and care management data to provide both backward and forward looking views of patient populations, which are ripped with a rich and distinctive clinical encountered data set of over 55 million lives and expanding rapidly. We expect to increasingly drive positive impact for care providers and the consumers they serve.", "OptumRx grew revenues by nearly $8 billion or 33.2% and operating earnings grew by 67% in 2014 as benefits were realized from the transition of the UnitedHealthcare commercial pharmacy business. OptumRx won external business awards to serve well more than 1 million people in 2014 and is tracking to a similar level of growth in 2015. The secular trends toward more complex and expensive specialty medications play directly to Optum\u2019s strength in synchronizing and integrating medical and pharmacy benefits, providing uniquely personalized service. Optum is advancing this approach with UnitedHealthcare commercial customers in 2015 and expects to see further market interest in its capabilities in 2016.", "Looking forward to 2015, our expectations remain consistent with those we shared with you at our investor conference in early December. We are off to a strong start with Optum pursuing large strategic relationships and the UnitedHealthcare\u2019s domestic medical membership, some 250,000 people ahead of our Investor Conference outlook as we close 2014 and with continued strength into early 2015 as we discussed earlier in our remarks.", "For UnitedHealth Group, we are projecting high single-digit percentage revenue growth in 2015, with earnings growth potentially reaching the double-digits at the upper-end of our earnings range.

From there we expect the second quarter to rise sequentially and quarters three and four to have smoother progression than in 2014.", "We expect performance to further improve in 2015 in a number of key areas. And let\u2019s spend a minute on those areas of focus. We expect to grow at a very solid pace, capitalizing on market opportunities and commercial benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the continuing momentum of Optum. Amil\u2019s performance will strengthen in 2015, led by balanced pricing to address medical cost trends and the use of new approaches, analytics and technologies to improve the total performance of both benefits in the care delivery businesses.

The key focal point within this area is our commitment to achieving four star or better performance for at least 80% of our Medicare Advantage customers by 2018 and 2015 is the year this work gets finished for 2018. We expect to perform well on medical cost for our customers, we deliver to our customers and members a valuable package of cost-effective network options and simple, useful information about quality and treatment choices supported by consumer outreach and effective medical management.

Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) And we can take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Justin Lake", "My questions are on the commercial risk market, it certainly looked like membership stabilized in the fourth quarter here and Steve you talked about being ahead of plan early in the year. Can you expand on what is driving that change in membership trajectory and give us an update on the pricing environment in general? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, I think this morning I am going to ask Dave to kind of take point on the UnitedHealthcare elements of questions. So, Dave you want to take that and then engage the team?", "Dave Wichmann", "I\u2019ll just maybe just make a couple remarks then I\u2019ll quickly turn it to Jeff. Thanks for noticing the progress we have made in the commercial risk market in the fourth quarter that carried over into Q1 as well and as you look at it, it is both on and off exchange and I think you\u2019ll hear from Jeff that we have very disciplined pricing as part of that as well, so Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, we had a really nice quarter in '14 and a really nice start to '15, primarily driven by our new products we have put into the marketplace in reaction to the beginning of 2014 in some of our challenges around price points. So, we worked really hard, tried to create products that were tied to network design and benefit plans that saw a different value proposition to many of our markets. We first began to see a churn in on membership profile around much better improved persistency of existing accounts, then we saw some of our value around affordability, helping our experience rated accounts and then as we moved into '15 I think our exchange expansion also helps create some additional products portfolio advancements off exchange that have been selling really well.", "Your question around pricing, as Dave mentioned our pricing remains consistent and stable. I think that is also helping us as others are -- our pricing maybe a little bit to fix the shortfall in there, past pricing efforts and I think the market remains as stable as we have talked about, competitive and no real change to that portfolio of pricing across the various markets that we serve.", "Operator", "We can take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes, maybe if I could ask you there to build on that and stay in the commercial market territory and maybe you can just tell us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the evolution of the small group market, how much erosion if any you\u2019re seeing with coverage whether that\u2019s going to be exchanges or not? And then perhaps more broadly in commercial what you\u2019re seeing within group retention with the economy strengthening?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "We, again '14 we were minor players in the exchange so we don\u2019t have a lot of information. I will tell you that I think it\u2019s well within that range that we have talked about over the last couple of years a few percent of that small group market eroding into the exchanges at least at this point. I think the growth in the exchanges both in '14 and in '15 are really driven by the uninsured and that expansion through the subsidy. So we have not seen a significant erosion of our small group business, just a reminder over the years that business has gotten to the point where roughly maybe 50% or 55% of those employers cover that\u2019s down from maybe 60%-65% in the 90s so this is going to continued erosion of that market over the years. I think you had a second question around our pricing environment?", "Matthew Borsch", "Well, it was really around the -- whether you\u2019re seeing some in group iteration, whether you\u2019re seeing trends stabilize and to what extent perhaps as a result of the strengthening economy?", "Jeff Alter", "Our in-group attrition has flattened that is probably due to the economy and then earlier in the year we did have some in-group attrition that was related to the ACA that has leveled off.", "Matthew Borsch", "Alright, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "We\u2019re really seeing growth on the exchange off the exchange and in the self-funded marketplace too.", "Matthew Borsch", "Correct.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So we\u2019re really seeing pretty broad-based response to the offerings you\u2019re putting out in this point of time.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "David Windley", "Thanks. I was going to shift to Optum, Optum and in particular Insight had a really good fourth quarter margin. I wondered if you could elaborate on that for us and the sustainability of that. And then speaking about the Optum margin progression over the next few years toward the 8% goal?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "So Dave it\u2019s Larry Renfro, I\u2019m going to ask Bill Miller to participate in this question as well. So I think you probably recall that we had gone through our business plan this year from the start talking about how the fourth quarter would end with a couple of things going on. We had a great fourth quarter with the $1 billion in earnings that Dave talked about, but we were positioned for that quarter to have seasonality that\u2019s our 40-60 split on our business for the year and the planned investments we expected to kick-in and to start to pay-off and OptumInsight would be a part of that and that\u2019s Optum360. And then we had a third area of simplification and integration on our products and my comment on that is that everything worked as planned. We exceeded slightly the expectations we gave you at our December Conference. So we\u2019re off to a very strong fourth quarter and a great start. I would also say that the question on the 8-by-15 we were on target, we feel good about that. The momentum going into 2015 is very strong obviously for us, but it\u2019s also very strong for our number one customer being UHC. So we\u2019re still firm and the ways that we\u2019re good with the 8-by-15. Bill any comments on Insight?", "Bill Miller", "Yes, obviously it was a very strong quarter and I think it sets us up very well for '15 and beyond at backlog growth I think there is clearly a recognition that a few of the key things that we\u2019re bringing to the marketplace and have invested in are maturing, there is acceptance for example of the 360 side of our business which we talked a lot about which is our revenue management platform. We\u2019re well on our way to the customer acquisition that we target, but more importantly and what\u2019s exciting is the results that we\u2019re generating for our clients are starting to come through in terms of their financial and operational performance. We\u2019ve made investments in data and strengthened our hand particularly from a clinical data standpoint that has clearly differentiated us. We had a record quarter and expect another record year with sales, new client acquisitions and revenue from our data differentiation both in the provider marketplace and in the life sciences arena as well.", "Clearly we\u2019ve added critical clients on the government side, working with several states on exchanges. And then finally I would say we\u2019re really happy with our entry into the physician management business, where we\u2019re going into practices, health systems, helping them turnaround and help drive better performance quality in their physician practices. We entered that market last year. We\u2019re very confident that that is going to be a strong contributor for the future of OptumInsight. And so all of those things combined together I think show a lot of diversity in what we do, a lot of areas to grow and feel pretty confident not only about 2015 but beyond.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Peter Costa", "You put forth on the Investor Day a view of cost trend rising 50 basis points faster than it did last year, some of your competitors have put forth views of trend that's a little bit ahead of that. Why should we not be concerned of perhaps some of the improving view and membership on the commercial business, is it because you have perhaps underpriced that business? And specific to that in terms of cost trend can you talk about how your view on specialty pharma in particular Hepatitis C drugs, is evolving this year relative to last year?", "David Wichmann", "Okay, Peter it\u2019s David and you\u2019ve got a lot in there. I am going to have Dan respond to you, I will just maybe comment globally on our ability to manage medical cost and trend. I think it's no surprise that we have been able to create distinction there, vis-\u00e0-vis our competition for some time. We do a very good job of controlling utilization and an excellent job as well in terms of taking a full review of our cost structures and putting it into our pricing which is the discipline we've applied for years now and I think it's consistently produced good results. So Dan I\u2019ll ask you to comment further.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Peter, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. So, let me handle first the medical cost sides, talk quickly about pricing and then a little bit on Hep C I think those are the three elements you are interested in.", "Peter Costa", "Yes.", "Dan Schumacher", "From a medical cost standpoint just kind of looking at 2014 broadly, we\u2019re very pleased with our medical cost performance. And in the fourth quarter in particular we again came in a little bit better than what we had expected and that's true in our commercial business, as well as in our government businesses. As we look at the utilization under that more specifically, that continues to be very well controlled, Steve did mention that again this year we were able to drive an absolute reduction in our hospital usage per capita, we did that in each business and that was the sixth consecutive year we've been able to drive an absolute reduction in hospital in patient usage per capita. So when we put that all together from a commercial standpoint our cost trend for 2014 came in actually a little bit better than the 5.5% that we had guided to at the end of -- at the beginning of December as well as the low-end of the range we guided to a year ago.", "As we think about our trend into the future, we have assumed that we're going to see a moderate increase in utilization in each of our benefits businesses and that outlook is what informed our pricing, as well as our benefit planning. And I'll tell you with December behind us and the majority of January behind us as well, we're not seeing any indication or evidence of an increase in utilization. So we feel very comfortable with our forward outlook, commercial cost trend for 2015 is 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Sitting here today, we have 75% of our revenue for 2015 locked-in and the vast majority of that revenue comes from retained accounts those are customers that we have experience with and we understand their performance, so we feel very comfortable with not only our cost trend outlook, but also in relation to where we're positioned from a revenue standpoint in our commercial business.", "Lastly you asked about Hep C. Obviously that's a category of significant focus for a lot of people as of late. In 2014 obviously we revised our expectations for cost coming out of the first quarter and I would tell you that we tracked very much in line with that over the balance of 2014. As we look to 2015 we do expect an increase in those costs in each of our businesses, we've reflected that and captured it in our outlook. So, we feel comfortable with where we are positioned.", "Peter Costa", "Can you give us some specifics on how much cost increase you expect in 2015 and precisely what you are doing regarding negotiating between the various drugs in Hep C?", "Dan Schumacher", "What I\u2019d tell you Peter is that we're constantly working to manage cost and drive greater value. In this space we're pleased to see competition. As we look at new product launches particularly in very high cost categories we have a very rigorous process, it's a process that evaluates the clinical equivalency of the drugs. We look at the effectiveness of each drug. We design clinical programs to ensure appropriate use. And then we obviously are looking at the PDL and formulary implications and then we're negotiating relationships that really drive the best value for our members and our customers. So, we don't talk specifically in this form about manufacturer relationships, but rest assured we're all over this.", "Peter Costa", "Thank you much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, Peter just to maybe to close that out, just to be clear and taking Jeff's comments earlier and Dan's comments now I think it's really our product positioning exercise that and possibly some firming of the market that's caused us to advance our business. The other thing I\u2019d -- so I think you can conclude that we're not under pricing the business. The other thing you can look at is our relative MTTR performance for the fourth quarter versus the full year. And if you look at that you will see that that we're performing better in Q4 than we did for the full year we have performed very well for the full year, but you can see some acceleration in performance as well. So hopefully that closes out that issue we\u2019re not surprising.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Andy Schenker", "So if I\u2019m doing my math here correctly let\u2019s say you guys are forecasting about 19% to 20% growth in value-based care or care delivery on your value-based contract, maybe if you could talk about a little bit how that\u2019s split between commercial Medicare and Medicaid? And also how those value-based contracts are impacting both your enrollment, are you seeing outsiders enrollment in those products and then also around your expectations around cost trends? Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay I\u2019ll have Dan comment on this obviously it\u2019s a key area of focus for us to align incentives with delivery system really anchored on advancing quality of healthcare first but also improving the affordability of it, Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "So your math is right. Yes we are expecting about a 20% increase in the concentration of value-based reimbursement. And going from -- we ended the year at about $36 billion of spend in value-based arrangements and we\u2019re looking to drive that north of $43 billion in 2015. And in terms of the underlying businesses, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in all three of our businesses, so I wouldn\u2019t highlight anyone individually. We\u2019re looking to make progress across the spectrum and across the benefits landscape. And we\u2019re seeing contributions to enrollment as a result of those relationships where we partner more distinctly with certain delivery system partners. And on the cost side, we\u2019re also seeing the outcomes there. We talked at the Investor Day, I know we had a breakout seminar to talk about driving 1% to 6% aggregate savings from our value-based reimbursement approaches, and then within that obviously the numbers can be significant based on how they\u2019re designed and as well as how tightly they are aligned around quality and performance and outcome. So we\u2019re very pleased with our progress there. We\u2019re focused on it in 2015 and we\u2019ll be in '16 and beyond.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it\u2019s important to note the orientation of the quality. And the fact that the structure actually drives volume towards the better providers that enter into these performance contracts and that we\u2019re progressing these contracts into more sophisticated forms where they\u2019re actually taking on even greater performance responsibility overtime.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Tom Carroll", "It sounds like a very confident 2015 outlook. I wonder if you could share with us a bit more commentary on your operating cost ratio. Fourth quarter\u2019s result was relatively high, driven by the obvious, but do you think you see that improving in 2015 much like the rest of your business? And where should it go over the next three years? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Hey Dave do you want to address that?", "Dave Wichmann", "Tom, Dave Wichmann. So a couple of things, first our operating care cost ratio for the quarter was a little bit elevated at 125 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you know this is mainly influenced by the insurers fee which amps up that ratio by about 120 of the basis points, but what has been pretty persistent in our business is the mix has shifted more towards services. And when you see that mix shift, it tends to put a lot of pressure on this ratio. And so then that increases it even further and then our productivity efforts bring it back down and we\u2019ve seen productivity well managed across our business not only offsetting those impacts, but also inflation broadly. As we look to 2015, the same dynamics play out. We have a little bit of an uptick in the insurers fee, which further presses this ratio, but we also see continued growth in Optum and in our fee-based business overall which tends to press this forward as well. And then we continue to offset that with productivity improvements year-over-year. And we do expect the ratio to be somewhere around 17% plus or minus 30 basis points for next year. And we believe our running physicians supports that.", "Tom Carroll", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next please, next question. Moderator, do you have another, we have answered all the questions this morning? So we may be having some technical difficulties we\u2019re going to. Hello?", "Operator", "One moment please, we\u2019re having technical difficulties.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, UnitedHealth Group is still here, I don\u2019t know about the rest of the world at this moment.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Christine Arnold", "Optum360 and particularly for OptumInsight seems to be tracking kind of ahead of even what you were expecting last month. Is there any change to your Optum expectations relative to what we saw at your Investor Day? And then also what are you expecting in terms of margins on your individual memberships on the public exchanges? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well that\u2019s an interesting combination question Christine. So I\u2019ll have Larry take the Optum side and then we\u2019ll respond to the margins on the public exchange business.", "Larry Renfro", "Christine I believe that we are right on target with where we planned to be right now with Optum360 from what I\u2019ll call the planned investment side, as well as the implementation operation. I think you know we have Dignity Health and NovaSure as two of our prime customers here. And nothing has really changed from the investor conference. We were positioning everything to happen in the fourth quarter just as it came through. I don\u2019t know Bill if you have any comments?", "Bill Miller", "No, I think much has changed. I think our business will depending on what happens with the ICD-10 changes this year, they didn\u2019t happen last year we overcame that, if they don\u2019t happen this year we are prepared one way or another, but I think we are optimistic and see certainly a pipeline that would lead us to believe that not only are we on target but we have got a chance to work ahead but I\u2019d say nothing has changed since the investors conference. And I would say just in terms of customer acquisition, we have always said kind of across our business that we were looking for these eight to 10 rich and deep relationships and I think if you look across all of the customers that we have acquired not only in 360 but beyond, we are halfway to that goal, and we feel very good about achieving that and certainly we don\u2019t see anything in '15 slowing us down to achieve that.", "Larry Renfro", "Christine, maybe I could it\u2019s Larry again, let me talk about the 10 relationships that Bill mentioned. We have named two, as we go forward some of our customers they do not like to be identified because of competition, and so some of the visible ways of looking at that half that we have right now would be to look at Optum360 it would be to look at our business in the government solutions area, and you could look at Optum One our data analytics area and you could look at Optum Lab. So there is some other metrics that I think are going to be important to look at from this customer acquisition standpoint. And I am going to ask John Rex maybe hit some of those metrics as well.", "John Rex", "Good morning Christine, John Rex here. So a few other things that we\u2019d looked at in terms of helping illustrate how we are progressing towards that goal of, be it larger relationships. The average, if we look at since the last couple of years average deal size within OptumHealth is up 80%. Revenue from our top-25 customers within Optum is up 2.4 times. The number of customers with over 100 million in annual revenue has doubled. We\u2019d point to external backlog going up nearly 20% and a pipeline that about doubled over the last year. So those are other metrics we look to, to help illustrate the impact that we are having and gaining these types of relationships.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I\u2019ll let Jeff respond to public exchange question.", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning Christine, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. On in build exchange we built for our initial years to margin of 1% and 2% without any reliance on the risk orders, but we believe longer-term it\u2019s 3% to 5% business and like everything else well endeavored to be in the top-end of that range, as we go forward.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Just staying on the public exchanges, can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on how enrollment is tracking? I think you talked about it being in excess of 400,000, so just wondering if you\u2019d expect to sort of exceed the 400,000 to 500,000 range. Maybe if there is any disproportion in enrollment in any state that you are in? And then lastly recently in California, it sounds like you tried to get in statewide for 2016 but were denied, is the plan just to kind of revisit that in 2017 or are there alternatives you are seeking to still get into that market before that? Thanks.", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning Ralph, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. So let\u2019s start with, yes we have had about over the 400,000 level in signups. We still feel comfortable within that range that we gave in at the investor conference between 400 and 500 by at this point I might think more around the 500 and depending on how the next week or so plays out, we could be that, but right now we feel comfortable within that range. The good news for us is we are growing where we said we would grow, which is growing a little bit more in some of those markets than we thought. So at investor conference we talked about some of the bigger markets where we thought we could grow and do well and that\u2019s where we are growing and doing well. So along with our plan that is where the growth is coming in.", "Now obviously in California we are disappointed, we wanted to bring more choice and options to the residents, to California, we believe competition is good for them, unfortunately we were not able to get agreement from that Board to be in all markets, we did get granted a few markets where there are and as many carriers as they would like, we will -- we are reviewing that now so we might be in California in '16, but in a small handful of markets and we will go back in '17, we believe choices and competition are good for all markets including California.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "And you anticipate that you\u2019ll expand your portfolio markets in the next year?", "Jeff Alter", "Yes, outside of California we are working now to expand our footprint into the other markets that we happen to -- we didn\u2019t serve in '15.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "But you\u2019ll do that in measured ways, it's not all those\u2026", "Jeff Alter", "Yes we are reviewing those markets now we\u2019ll make some final decisions and let you know.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "The other thing that\u2019s nice is not only just selling right in the markets that you wanted, but you also sold the products that you thought would sell, right?", "Jeff Alter", "Correct.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A.J. Rice", "Maybe just ask about the Medicare Advantage obviously you're looking forward acceleration growth I think 200,000 to 300,000 enrollment though was the target at the Investor Day it looks like in January with some of the open enrollment season in Europe 165,000 adds please comment on what you're seeing so far in the open enrollment season and whether that\u2019s really ahead of your expectations inline and any sort of qualitative comment about the market environment and then any early thoughts on the 2016 rate notice?", "Dave Wichmann", "It's Dave, I think we\u2019ve -- the team has done a nice job of really reestablishing growth in the Medicare Advantage individual aligned but -- and we have continued our very nice growth on the group MA front as well, but I\u2019ll ask Steve Nelson to comment overall on your questions.", "Steve Nelson", "Good morning A.J., it's Steve Nelson. Yes we are very pleased with not only how we ended the year but how we performed in AP. As Dave indicated, we drove really strong growth in our group Medicare Advantage business and I would say market leading growth actually, so really pleased with that. But we expect full year growth in our individual membership as well and that\u2019s particularly -- we\u2019re particularly excited about that because of the work we\u2019ve done with reshaping our network and you're seeing premiums broadly into our portfolio, and we are able to grow in the markets that were key to us such as Florida, New York and Texas and Southern California. So really off to a nice start and I would say also we\u2019ve saw some really good results and nice start to Medicare stuff as well. And across those two products really again off to a good start, good place to be, in fact maybe a little bit ahead of what we were thinking and so we feel really good about the ranges that we offered in last December and still get about those ranges.", "In terms of the 2016 rates, there is a lot of variables that go into the final rate as you know and so you don\u2019t really speculate on that, but I will offer that our position has been -- that it\u2019s just a very successful and valuable program to seniors and it\u2019s had great results in medical costs and improving outcomes. Member satisfaction is up and the program is growing. So, we remain strong advocates for our seniors and their healthcare and we hope and expect that the rates when they are finally published will be fair and appropriate. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the positioning of our Medicare business and how we\u2019re heading into 2015.", "Stephen Hemsley", "We may have time for about two more questions. So, we could take a look at that, maybe two more questions. So next please.", "Operator", "Yes. We can take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Maybe just two on the MA side of things, can you talk a little bit about the stars and how your analysis of what stars has meant for enrollment in 2015, are you seeing better enrollment in the places where you have four stars, are you seeing real issues and competitors have really moved up on the stars in the individual side in 2015? And then also and obviously you\u2019ve grown group very significantly for 2015, do stars matter as much when we think about the group business or is that something that overtime you think that it will impact how group perceives the product as well?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Maybe I\u2019ll start on this I\u2019d like to make it clear that we believe stars matters and that we\u2019re focused on improving our performance in stars and I think we have been very consistent on that theme. It's not clear that, that has had really an impact with respect to how the product is marketed or acquired in markets, but we do believe that it is important -- overtime obviously important from a financial point of view, important in terms of our relationship with CMS who basically established those performance guideline. So, I want to make it clear that we are committed to stars performance but it\u2019s not clear and I maybe see Nelson to comment that that has had really a particular impact in terms of market response to product offerings right?", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. No, hi, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. You\u2019re right Steve stars obviously is a factor but it\u2019s one of many and it\u2019s very -- the benefit of planning processes is one that has a lot of factors in it and we take all those things into account as we look at the results that we\u2019ve achieved in AP that is very much in line with our expectations and stars doesn\u2019t particularly spike out as the core driver to any of those results again it\u2019s across so many factors and a lot of including your brand positioning, your brand strength, strength of the distribution, the engagement you have with providers and again that is how you design the product. So there is a lot of factors in there, on the group side stars is important it allows you to price competitively and our group membership has enforced our plans and so that adds to our ability to grow that membership and thus contribute it to that.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Well I guess the question is, if 2018 feels like a long way away in many respects so do you think that you\u2019ll be able to go nicely even until you get to that target you don\u2019t need to get four stars to continue to go in the MA business in the meantime?", "Steve Nelson", "No, we don\u2019t. And one thing that really hasn\u2019t been mentioned this morning is that, we are clearly in the zone of our growth expectations for MA and we\u2019ve actually advanced premiums in a significant way and to basically to be able to go through that right Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Right and so advantage is pretty impressive.", "Steve Nelson", "And I think bodes well because I think the large portion of establishing premium products in markets a lot of that work got done this year.", "Operator", "Okay. We can take our last question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Raskin", "I want to get back to the commercial business and I guess the question is just sort of about the landscape of employers, commercial employer contracts, basically what are they looking for in terms of products and then have you guys quantified the Optum impact whether there is a cross-sell of Optum products, or you mentioned Rally and Advocate For Me and a couple of these others, you\u2019ve measured this in new wins or higher retention levels and just broadly what\u2019s changing in that landscape where United is now seeing sort of that inflection point on commercial growth?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I\u2019ll have Jeff respond to that, I do think that the content of the Optum product in the UnitedHealthcare offering clearly in the way in which supply clearly makes a distinctive difference, but has a lot to do with the way in which it\u2019s applied in the offering, but Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning Josh, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. So I think again from most, everyone of our clients and employers in general this is a very important benefit for them to believe so they look for the value that can be provided, but it\u2019s also one of their more expensive items so they look for a partner who can work with them over the long-term to keep affordability in mind, but also deliver great products, service and innovation and that\u2019s when if you think about the combination of UnitedHealthcare and Optum together working in partnership with the clients and their consulting and their brokerage create that plan that works for that employer across sort of a very long time stamp. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver anything at any point for that client as their business changes and their dynamics change. We\u2019re able to bring in consumer products that Optum builds, obviously our close tie to OptumRx now that specialty medicine is becoming a cross-factor having the close relationship that we have with OptumRx to embed that inside the medical benefit is vitally important for the value proposition that the employer is looking for.", "And then across the spectrum into OptumHealth our disease management wellness programs, our consumer engagements, employers have spent considerable amounts of money to have disease management wellness programs and are looking for more engagements and the work that Rally and OptumHealth does to go beyond just by creating an offering but actually get that engagement and get that uptake to keep people healthier and engaged in their wellness is vitally important. So I think what we\u2019ve seen is the marketplace has stabilized over the last year or so is that that view from employers looking for a longer term partner who can work with them to create an even more valuable benefit plan an offering for their employees but also be mindful of the cost factors that are involved in it.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, something to really match the breadth of their offerings and the innovation dynamic and the reliability of continues innovation, continues focus on technology, so that you are building value year-after-year-after-year which plays a lot to the retention rates you have too. So good question and great response, so thank you very much for joining us this morning kind of to sum up 2014. UnitedHealth Group had a clearly a very strong year in '14 and momentum of the business grew throughout the course of the year, so that we ended the year perhaps, our strongest point and have brought that strength into the beginning of 2015 and through consistent execution and consistent focus on performance, serving customers, the people that we serve continuing to drive innovation, matched with a strong financial disciplines we expect our growth to accelerate in 2015 and beyond. We thank you very much for joining us this morning and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s program, thanks for your participation.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we are going to continue in our efforts to keep our formal remarks brief, allowing more time to respond to your questions. We are also going to freshen things up a little and share portion of today's formal commentary between Dave Wichmann, our President; and Larry Renfro, our Vice Chairman. I'll start out with the recap of the quarter.", "Net earnings in the quarter grew 33% to $1.46 per share on revenues of $35.8 billion. What is important is what lies inside these results. Higher revenue growth, more consistent performance in operating discipline, and margins strength across UnitedHealth Group's broad , strategically diversified set of businesses.", "Operating cash flows were $2.3 billion for the quarter, 1.6x net income. Revenue and earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare were the biggest contributors to better than expected first quarter cash flow.", "This quarter builds on the second half 2014 momentum we discussed with you before. We expect that momentum to continue with second quarter earnings per share growing nicely from this past quarter's results and being modestly above current consensus estimates.", "At this range, we see second and third quarter earnings being more even stronger in the second quarter and lighter in the third and current consensus would suggest this pattern would better fit our current business trends and outlook.", "We are advancing our 2015 full year outlook taking revenues to $143 billion, a $2 billion increase and a nearly 10% year-over-year growth pace. Net per share earnings advanced to a new tighter range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share, and an 11% year-over-year gain at the upper end, despite absorbing $0.10 per share and attributed to Catamaran transaction cost and the impact of reducing our level of share repurchase going forward. The increase in revenue and earnings modestly improves our outlook for cash flow from operations by $200 million on the lower end of the new range of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion.", "Now, I'll ask Larry to review Optum. Then ask Dave to pickup with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group better price items. Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Thanks Dave. Optum's revenues grew 14.7% to $12.8 billion in the quarter, with operating margins stable year-over-year at 5.8% despite more than 30 basis points of acquisition costs.", "Optum's earnings from operations grew 14% to $742 million in the quarter with every reporting unit producing double-digit percentage earnings growth. Catamaran acquisition costs reduced Optum's year-over-year earnings growth by seven percentage points in the quarter. Setting aside these transactions costs, Optum would have produced 21% earnings growth for the quarter.", "We expect Optum to post strong earnings growth in 2015 and after fully absorbing Catamaran acquisition costs, we continue to forecast operating earnings within the range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.", "This will be growth of at least 50% over two years from a base of less than $2.5 billion in 2013. We continue to build our capabilities in important ways this quarter, particularly our relationships starting with Catamaran.", "The proposed Catamaran combination brings obvious benefits to the markets and customers we serve. It will create a competitively scaled channel-agnostic PBM focused on growing and serving all prescription market segments.", "It will advance the next generation\u2019s synchronized PBM where all clinical data points are connected and drug considerations are fully integrated with clinical care processes to produce better outcomes and better overall cost trends.", "This will be important as the age of specialty pharma emerges along with inevitable biosimilar counterparts. People will be served better, benefit and program sponsors will benefit from both the more progressive synchronized care offering as well as from sharing the meaningful savings achieved from combining these two enterprises.", "Integration disruption can be avoided, since the two companies already share a common technology. We believe this can quickly becomes the next generation, clinically-informed, clinically-anchored PBM.", "Looking forward, our Optum team is driving meaningful growth in customer pipeline for all Optum business segments. Optum's external revenue backlog grew 24% in the quarter to drive overall backlog to over $9 billion.", "Optum continues to develop broader relationships with more sophisticated clients who need end-to-end solutions to the complex challenges they face. For example, Optum 360 has added sizeable and distinguished new partners, most notably North Shore-LIJ Health System and the Mayo Clinic.", "And in the U.K., Optum International became one of the very few organizations to be accredited to serve under the NHS lead provider framework as the NHS procures an expected $1 billion of commissioning support annually.", "Optum labs recently added Yale University as a partner and research from the lab has now been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the British Medical Journal.", "Finally this quarter, we launched an important new brand campaign for Optum to help further build understanding of our services and innovation.", "Now let me turn it over to Dave.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. Turning first to UnitedHealthcare, first quarter revenues grew 11.5% to $32.6 billion, net operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 5.8% reflecting strong performances in all businesses commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, and global.", "Each of the first quarter care ratios improved year-over-year and were better than our plans for the quarter. The combination of strong growth across of all diversified benefits business and even more effective medical and operating cost performance produced a 35% increase in UnitedHealthcare's quarterly earnings from operations to $1.9 billion.", "The headline for UnitedHealthcare in the quarter is growth, growing organically to serve 1 million more people in the United States in the first quarter alone and 1.6 million more people year-over-year with notable strength this quarter in the seniors and commercial businesses.", "We are increasing our projections for organic growth and domestic medical benefits by about 600,000 people from our investor conference outlook to approximately 1.4 million people in 2015. The increased outlook is driven by stronger market response to our expanding commercial benefits product portfolio.", "In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare's commercial business grew nicely serving 680,000 more people. Growth included 570,000 public exchange consumers well ahead of our expectations. In our earnings outlook and as we have said before, we do not expect meaningful financial contributions from these customers in 2015.", "On the international side, UnitedHealthcare is underwriting and pricing to create both sustainable customer value and sustainable margins and is scaling to deliver results. Amil our Brazilian Healthcare Company produced improved financial results on a better mix of business with revenues growing 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis.", "Medicaid membership exceeded plan even with the expected decreases in Tennessee where the state introduced a third plan into the market. UnitedHealthcare grew its Medicare businesses in the first quarter by another 380,000 people split pretty evenly between Medicare Advantage and supplemental benefits.", "Two weeks ago CMS issued its final Medicare Advantage rate notice for 2016, while these rates will help provide some needed stability for seniors who continue to enroll in Medicare Advantage in record numbers, the rates simply did not keep up the pace of medical cost increases. We will continue to make the case on behalf of the millions of seniors we served for sound and stable approaches to Medicare Advantage funding in the future.", "Before we sum up, let me run through a short punch list of non-financial highlights for the quarter for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the quarter we invested in brands and reputation broadly across UnitedHealth Group including the brand campaign Larry mentioned for Optum and the successful introduction of UnitedHealthcare's own fresh branding effort. Both have generated favorable responses and we will build on these throughout the year.", "We are getting scaled market traction on several innovation efforts, Rally our digital consumer health platform now reaches nearly 9 million Americans across the broad spectrum of employers, health plans and associations, and as improving consumer engagement we plan to expand to nearly 30 million people by this time next year including consumers in Brazil.", "Link, the secured cloud based workspace for care providers now reaches nearly 425,000 care providers and expect to reach 600,000 or more by this time next year. We continue to advance higher quality, lower cost care with our delivery system partners on behalf of those we serve. Medical spending under value based arrangements grew nearly 30% year-over-year to nearly $40 billion annual run rate. This was an active quarter in terms of acquisition and capital deployment, we will fund these efforts from internal resources and debt and we had maintained our credit ratings.", "And lastly the UnitedHealth Foundation continues to engage in a focused manner with communities in need. As example, the foundation recently announced substantial support for an innovative community care program in Maricopa County Arizona, pioneering medical education and services in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and a technology initiative in Tennessee that connects patients with care professionals through community health centers via telemedicine.", "And OptumRx crossed the $10 million milestone in prescription drugs donated to Community Health clinics in Kansas. Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks, David. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and disciplined set of initiatives. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and discipline set of initiatives in our consumer capabilities, brand and reputation for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum payment reform and progressive services to better support care providers, innovation and its more meaningful larger scale market deployment, strategic M&A, large, far-reaching next-generation strategic relationships, information driven research in social and philanthropic efforts aligned to the communities we serve.", "And all these funds and more we intend to pick up our pace with thoughtful urgency and improve performance and consistency. So as we grow we become a more effective enabler of a better healthcare system and serve more people with better outcomes to the prudent use of society\u2019s healthcare resources.", "And now to recap, our 2015 outlook for $143 billion in revenues accelerates our revenue growth rate to nearly 10% this year, with improvements coming from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our earnings outlook of $6.15 to $6.30 per share includes $0.03 per share of transaction cost this quarter from Catamaran and an additional $0.07 per share of pressure over the balance of this year principally due to repurchasing less than half of the UnitedHealth Group shares we had targeted before this combination.", "For 2016 we continue to project core earnings growth and that the Catamaran combination will be $0.30 per share accretive to those earnings, even while carrying $0.20 per share in amortization expenses. Savings and accretion are expected to grow further in 2017 and 2018 improving value for customers and earnings visibility for shareholders for a multi year period.", "Today, we continue to have strong access to capital in both the equity and debt markets. We believe we can continue to participate positively and fully as both the health benefits and health services markets continue to evolve both domestically and internationally. And we remained focused on developing and expanding our capabilities and businesses both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum as market opportunities present themselves.", "We expect to maintain our approach to advancing our dividend to more market based levels exactly as we have discussed this area of capital allocation with you previously, no changes are contemplated in that respect.", "With that, I thank you and we will now open up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Scott Fidel", "Thanks, good morning. Just interested if you could give us some perspectives on what you are seeing in terms of PMPM Healthcare utilization in the quarter, which seemed with MLRs improving across the segment that it remains well controlled, but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been some conflicting data points out there showing that there maybe has been some broader market increases to utilization, HCA pre-announcing yesterday for example with strong admission volumes.", "So, just interested in your perspectives on what you are seeing with utilization and how to sync across some of those different data points we're seeing?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure Scott. I think Dan Schumacher can best respond to that.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning Scott, thanks for the question. I guess I wouldn't comment specifically on PMPMs, but I would say that in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance.", "As we talked about at the Investor Conference, as we formulated our forward trend outlook and we thought about how we priced and positioned our benefits for 2015, we assume that we thought it made sense to assume a moderate increase in underlying utilization.", "And I\u2019ll tell you in the first quarter there has not been any acceleration in underlying utilization. I think we've done well as an organization through our focused medical cost management initiatives, and also I think we're seeing benefits from greater consumer responsibility as well as, as we continue to drive greater concentrations as Dave mentioned in value based reimbursements.", "So as we look at the balance of the year, we expect our full year commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, and I would orient you towards the lower half of that range.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And I think we have pretty good visibility on that, we have daily census, so I think maybe some of things that are coming forward might have something to do with fact that 18 more million people have coverage and are using the system in a more structured way than the past, and I think that maybe a factor in what you\u2019re seeing Scott. Next question please?", "Operator", "And we can take the next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Michael Baker", "Yes thanks a lot. Given the pending purchase of Catamaran, I was wondering if you could give us a better sense or more color around your approach to differentiate on specialty pharmacy management and then any willingness by the PBM consultant community to change their approach to scoring vendors given the change from pharmacy benefit management to drug benefit management?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure I think that's a great question, and I will have Larry pick it up, but particularly the strength of OptumRx\u2019s synchronization efforts to really able to connect data, target individuals, engage them particularly as specialty pharma emerges, it really is a tremendous opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves, and the cost of that category is such that it would be hard for us to believe that the customer community as well as the consultant community will not be sensitized to that category of cost. Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Hi Mike, it's Larry Renfro, and I'm going to start and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tim Wicks, who is currently the CEO of OptumRx soon to be the President of the new OptumRx, and I will have him comment on specialty, but maybe I can start by giving you a little bit of our thought process as we put the two companies together.", "We really looked at I know where the value was going to be and we really had five categories, number one would be scale, number two would be enhanced technology, three would be distinctive capability such as specialty and synchronization and we\u2019ll comment on specialty as you ask.", "Number four would be our - we end up with a well-rounded management team from both a - what I'll call relationship sales as well as operations, customer service, and then the complementary businesses that kind of line up all together.", "So that\u2019s kind of how we went at this . Obviously specialty is a very, very important aspect of going forward in the future as we talked about earlier in the script. So I\u2019m going to hand this off to Tim now and he will give you some thoughts.", "Timothy Wicks", "Great, thank you. Thank you, Larry. Michael first of all we welcome scoring related to drug costs as opposed to simply straight up pharmacy discount rates, and what differentiates us in the specialty pharmacy area and why we\u2019re competitive first of all relates to trend management and work that we do around trend management and it really gets to all of the levers around synchronization and what we do to integrate medical, clinical, and lab data with pharmacy data and to be able to bring that to bear to surround the consumer with all of those capabilities that help them make better decisions, help them be adherent to their drug regimen, and to be able to engage and program to help them improve their health.", "We also think that the approach that we take to site of care and being agnostic as to whether the specialty drug is managed in the medical benefit or the pharmacy benefit is very important and then we also take advantage of site-of-care management so that we are agnostic to that as well and we drive it to the best place of care for the consumer.", "Michael Baker", "Thanks for the update.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "David Windley", "Hi, maybe a follow-up on the Catamaran thought process, so Larry your 8% margin goal for next year, there is I think you and John have talked about there maybe some variance in how you progress towards that goal depending on the mix of business, obviously Catamaran brings in a pretty significant shift in the mix of that business. Could you talk about how that affects your thoughts and your trajectory toward that 8% margin goal?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure that's good point. I\u2019m going to ask John to speak to this as well. We had this goal of 8/16 and there were some various factors or components that we needed to really make as part of that overall goal.", "First thing was what you are coming on is 8% by 2016. We also said that we would double 2013 earnings of $2.5 billion by 2018, we said we would have 8 to 10 large more complex relationships and that we would have double-digit top and bottom line growth through 2016.", "So I\u2019m going to define that as kind of core business, kind of pre-Catamaran and I would tell you that everything from a financial standpoint is in line or ahead of expectations. So we\u2019re going to continue to track our core business that way as far as the 8/16 goal that we set now.", "As you know the blend has changed with what we\u2019ve done in this transaction, so we\u2019re going to be handling a lot more pharmaceutical business, so that\u2019s going to change the mix and I\u2019m going to let John talk about that.", "John Rex", "David this is John. So as Larry stated our 2015 performance to-date which show us solidly tracking to that 8/16 goal and we are very much committed to that 8/16 goal we put up as we think about our base businesses and how that configures.", "When we plan as an organization, we plan for organic growth and that is how we got to configure our objectives and how we point the organization.", "So clearly that 8/16 is very much focused on our core businesses organic growth, we are tracking to that and we are still completely committed to that.", "Certainly your point is well taken adding an excess of $20 billion of pharmacy care services revenue changes the mix and I would expect that to change the mix as we think about kind of a 16 and where that lands.", "But we as an organization are completely committed to 8/16 on the core businesses and that's where we will be tracking on the core base ex the impact of the additional pharmacy care services revenue.", "And then the merger will dilute that down but you will stay on track for your core commitments on the core business.", "David Windley", "Okay great.", "Larry Renfro", "So thanks for that question, next one please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. I was impressed with the guidance particularly after observing the Catamaran cost and I think it's the first time United boosted guidance early in the year since 2012, can you talk about the level of confidence you have heading into the year as it is maybe greater or there is less unknowns than the last few years that led you to in earlier guidance boost and any headwinds or tailwinds that you could light up for us that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Larry Renfro", "I\u2019m so more confused, I don\u2019t think we are doing anything differently in terms of this, we - I think kind of update our outlook every quarter, we have seen enough strength and growth in the businesses across the board to improve that guidance slightly and to absorb the costs associated with Catamaran and the adjustment to our share repurchase given that transaction.", "So we thought that that was appropriate to include in the update and beyond that I don\u2019t think we are changing anything else along those lines.", "We typically if we see that consensus estimates don't necessarily line up with exactly with way we are seeing our quarter-by-quarter roll out, we typically comment on that and if again done that this quarter. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything differently this quarter along those lines.", "So, and if we did - if you're picking up anything we didn\u2019t intend anything behalf of what we said. So can you help me with what you think has changed.", "Sarah James", "I just saw the EPS increase was bigger this year than first quarter of the last few years, but maybe if you could just spike out the headwinds and tailwinds as we see them for 2015?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well I think that in terms of our business I think our outlook is actually pretty positive I think that we\u2019re seeing growth across our businesses, I think we had nice momentum as we came out of 2014 and of kind of carry that into 2015.", "When we take a look at strength of the businesses, I think our Medicare offerings are stronger this year. And we've had I think what we expected to be in terms of first quarter growth there.", "The Medicaid business continues to be very strong maybe a little stronger than what we have thought in the beginning we knew we were going to lose portion of the state of tendency but our other growth kind of pulled that to virtually even strong growth in the commercial business.", "So we had nice growth across UnitedHealthcare and we\u2019ve had continued strong growth across Optum Amil as showing some initial signs of strengthening and recovering, they've done a nice job down there and they have really done I think an exceptional job of embracing some of the best breed of what both the organizations do.", "So, along those lines I think we have mostly a positives. We continue to - we had hoped for stronger MA rates and funding I think that will be a consistent thing. We continue to work on our improving our business and our business disciplines, but I do think we\u2019re making very good progress on medical cost management, operating cost.", "So across the Board as I go through the inventory, I think we're - I believe in a stronger place than we have been in sometime and the first quarter results pulled that through and so we\u2019ve updated an outlook and I wouldn\u2019t suggest it\u2019s anything more than that. Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Andy Schenker", "Thanks, good morning. So you clearly saw a good success and exchange enrollment beyond your initial expectations. Maybe you could just discuss the factors around pricing and product design in your minds that led the enrollment success. And also maybe any early reads on those exchange lines versus your expectations. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure it's still early, but I have Jeff Alter, maybe comment on that. Thanks.", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning Andy, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. As we kind took you through our plans starting back in 2013 of how we were going to view the exchanges and look at 2014 as the year of learning and build kind of quickly rapidly as the market developed, I think the results that we saw in that in our initial enrollment year of 2015, one of result of kind of that longer term strategic plan and we - as we mentioned during our Investor Conference really looked hard at how people bought what they were buying, what was successful and designs, product and networks that could create price points that were sustainable over the long-term.", "And I think as you look at where we got our membership, it tie very nicely to where we said we thought we would get on membership and maybe we just got slightly more in those markets.", "So I think it was result of long-term strategic plan around this emerging market and the results of a lot of hard work to create the product and the networks that could support price points that people were looking to buy at.", "So that's something that drove first quarter. I'd also say that what also drove our first quarter results were stronger performance in our key account block particularly around persistency or retaining existing clients as we went through our fourth quarter and into our first quarter.", "We retained more clients than we had in the past and then we've also expanded our product portfolio around some of the work that we did for exchanges, we also did stretch that into newer well priced product offerings for our small business and some of our 51 to 99 business.", "And we saw those results begin to emerge in the fourth quarter of 2014 and strengthen into 2015.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, I think the balance performance overall and in the exchange right products in the right market is pretty much as we expected and we knew back in January that the market was responding positively so it's played out nicely. Next question please.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Josh Raskin", "Thanks, good morning, I appreciate the call. Could you guys talk a little about $0.20 of guidance was sort of exclude the $0.10 of cost that you guys were absorbing, but the $0.20 of core earnings.", "And what the drivers are of that increase how much of that is the benefits business versus Optum and I guess within that how much of that is commercial versus government. And I guess further within that how much of that is MLR related and what you guys were seeing in both segment?", "Dave Wichmann", "Hi Josh, it\u2019s Dave. Thank you for your questions and it's very good one. So we\u2019ve increased our guidance by 10% on average and then we\u2019re including an additional $0.10 of cost associated with the transaction with Catamaran and then also the impacted, reduced share repurchase.", "I'd say the number one contributor to our performance improvement expectations here is growth and I think it shows through pretty strongly across all of the benefits businesses with the particular emphasis on the over performance in commercial.", "But what you probably don\u2019t see in that is you see the lived on the insurance exchange what you probably don\u2019t see is the over performance on the off exchange business, which has been very strong as well.", "Jeff and his team has done a very nice job there. So I kind of edge that more towards a commercial. And then in terms of other profit contributors would be our performance on MLR and we expected to improve our MLR during this year as we said forth both in both the Investor Conference as well as on the fourth quarter call.", "But we have clearly outperformed that this year as well. And I\u2019d say that that\u2019s due to the strength of the performance on several fronts mark clinical engagement strategies and our ability to manage medical cost the trend components that Dan, referred earlier as well with respect to our performing on impatient management overall is a I think was a key factor as well.", "And then you can also see in Larry\u2019s prepared remarks that Optum prepares to or expects to over perform as well absorbing the cost of the Catamaran transaction and still hitting the expected range of performance that laid out in the conference as well in the fourth quarter call.", "So, I think overall you\u2019re seeing a strong performance and it\u2019s coming from multiple different front supporting the 20%, the $0.20 improvement in our overall guidance.", "Josh Raskin", "Is it fair to say then Dave, maybe two-thirds of the improvement is the benefits business and then the third is Optum?", "Dave Wichmann", "Yeah, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s some it\u2019s there plus or minus overall, but yeah I think that\u2019s fair.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Two-third 64 we couldn\u2019t calibrate it, but what\u2019s great is it is balanced then I think that\u2019s the strength of the kind of the diversified model, but so all the businesses are contributing to that advance.", "And if we continue to execute appropriately we\u2019re hoping to do better so. Next question please. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Good morning. Congratulations to everybody by my count this has been right rather an extraordinary quarter with double-digit revenue growth and strong operating income growth across all of the business units.", "But we\u2019ve been kind of talking about them separately with really key important factors that I\u2019d like to focus on being the retention the cost management, and that you have mentioned and you have talked about.", "As well as the synergies of synchronization of the business the opportunity do that on the Optum side and what I\u2019m getting at is that there was the change in the company back in November there\u2019s been change building over the last several years.", "Now we\u2019re seeing results I don\u2019t think that was an accident I think those things are to very clearly related issues. I\u2019m sensing you are at scale, I\u2019m sensing the business is transforming, and my question therefore is can you talk about what changed in the way you manage this business to get all of these many parts and pieces that are so strong to work together now better perhaps and also in the future and does that means that this sort of performance should be more sustainable.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I'll start and so my colleagues can join in on this but I would kind of say dramatically that we have been endeavoring to perform at these levels and interest level of consistency for sometime.", "It is not just a factor of internal average efforts, I think there are market, external market factors that putting pressures to bear as well. So, we bear some of the responsibility for - if we so optimize our performance and some of it is due to kind of external market dynamics and pressures.", "But I think that for the last couple years, we have been endeavoring to really make the business work together on a more optimal level across the enterprise. It has been the function of trying to drive a better culture, it has been a function of trying to achieve a strong chemistry among senior managements and kind of effort where we are working together and, helping each other with both their challenges and opportunities.", "And I do think this is a very strong group of people who are committed to working together and to optimizing the performance that are really focused on serving customers, consumers, care providers really focused outside and making sure that we are delivering on the promise of enabling the better healthcare system and really helping people live healthy alive and get access and services to facilitate that.", "And I just think that has come together and it is an effort so it is not sustaining as making sure that we keep doing this. And I do think that there is a stronger chemistry among the teem today and emerging, maturing leadership group across the board and I say its board based, I would say its not three or four people, I would say its 75 or 100 people across the Board.", "And I think that - I think people make a difference and I think that\u2019s been part of it. I think we\u2019ve also been focused on that culture to make sure that we are collaborating effectively and focusing on serving the markets. So I think those things have played into it and we'll look around \u2013 Dirk McMahon would like to try add to this.", "Dirk McMahon", "So Sheryl, its Dirk, how\u2019re you doing. A good example is the advocate for me call model, that was a joint effort plus Optum and UHC with Optum handling the clinical pieces. If you look at what we are doing with our service offerings making sure our digital offerings get consistent, making sure all of our customer communications are clear and cognized and simple, those things coordinate across the enterprise \u2013 that's a good example in the case we\u2019re managing across.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And I think the decisions, the way we go about making decisions and how we choose leaders in the organization are really built on more focused on collaborating and being ambitious to make sure the enterprise performs for those who we serve and so I take a lot of factors that are may be intangible to have contributed to that and I think you just have seen some of the effort start to emerge and I think we can do better.", "So I\u2019m hoping this is the - you\u2019re seeing that the beginning of what we can do going forward but we have to keep working on it. Thanks for the question. Next please?", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A.J. Rice", "Hello everybody. I'm going to follow up with another Catamaran consolidation question. I guess the $0.30 an EPS accretion that we\u2019re looking for next year, I assume that\u2019s after as plowing back some of the opportunity for the underlying customer base, so assume that the overall opportunity from putting the two together is more than what we've reflected in the $0.30.", "Can you give us some flavor of what might be ploughed back to combine entities clients. And then one of the issues that\u2019s been raised and I want you just have you comment on it, is the Catamaran has a lot of health plan members or clients and I know in Optum like OptumInsight has a lot of business with other health plans, you just comment on how that relationship works, I know there seems to be some concern that people may view as competitor but how has your experience been in Optum working with other health plans?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, well there is several in there, I might, it is premature for us to get specific about elements related to transaction that is still really subject to approval and so forth but kind of somatically I would offer that the accretion is really more a function of the transaction itself.", "The capital we deployed relative to the cost of that capital against the earnings stream of Catamaran as it is, we are clearly focused on driving the overwhelming majority of the benefits and synergies that arise from this back to customers, improving the value proposition, improving and progressing a PBM model that is distinctive in the marketplace.", "And we are really focused on the customers benefiting principally from that of which UnitedHealthcare is a customer as well but also as you point out very important customers that are other payors in the marketplace, very, very good companies and those relationships are clearly important and vital to this model going forward.", "And we are committed delivering on all commitments related to that and really developing and delivering a supporting capability to their PBM strategies so that we produce for them, a distinctive capability and advantage into the marketplace and to meet their specifications as they see it and become a very trusted partner in this category. ", "I think we are a trusted partner in this category - for a variety of payors and care providers across the spectrum in Optum and our business has continued to grow and evolve there and Larry, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that.", "Larry Renfro", "Hi, A.J, it\u2019s Larry. So good point that you made and good question and we live this everyday and I will kind of reiterate almost everything Steve just said but obviously, I have spoken to quite a few of the customers but may be what you want to think back a little bit is frame what we do today. ", "If you look at OptumHealth and you look at OptumInsight you would plan that if we have internal and external customers that\u2019s pretty balanced between the internal and external breakdown.", "If you look at what\u2019s really happening with the Catamaran transaction, it will get very close to being balanced as well but some of the things that we heard as we talked to the existing clients and so forth that this is what Steve said is that, the reason we bought and entered into this combination with Catamaran was because we needed to scale. ", "We needed enhanced technology, we needed specialty and synchronization programs, we needed well grounded management team and as a result complementary business that same reasons that people want to do business with us, they have those same interest and that\u2019s why we believe we really marry up really, really well with this new model.", "Now some of the things that we\u2019re going to have to do is we\u2019re going to have to execute. We\u2019re going to have to execute day one as we get involved with new customers. ", "We\u2019re going to have to live up to commitments that have been made and we know that and we\u2019re pretty good at that. This going to have to be total transparency, today we do business with 300 health plans, we do business with 4,500 hospitals.", "So we\u2019re used to really working with a lot of people and having to have transparency and this is just going to be another aspect of it.", "Obviously privacy and security around information and data and we\u2019re going to have to come up with the way that we believe this is going to be pretty easy with no disruption because we are on the same technology platform and we\u2019ve been on that platform for about 10 years. ", "So overall we feel pretty good about this transaction but I think if you went back and you looked at what we do in OptumHealth, you would find that lot of these clients already clients of ours and they already work with us in various intervention and prevention and wellness programs.", "You would find the same with OptumInsight. So overall, we kind of know this model and I would say as long as we execute and as long as we execute and as long as we execute we should be fine.", "A.J. Rice", "All right, great thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Great, may be if I can ask similar question in a little bit different way, when we think about the accretion of $0.30, my understanding is that it\u2019s versus not deploying the capital else but you\u2019ve already kind of talked about a $0.07 headwind so far this year from cutting back on share repurchase and I guess that you can do that again next year to bring leverage back down.", "How do you think about kind of the net accretion versus, if you had continued your previous capital deployment plan in 2016 and then I understand the concept of returning the overwhelming majority of the benefits back to the customers but usually we don\u2019t think of year one as being the high watermark from an accretion perspective, I mean where does that $0.30 number go to in year two and year three?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, first of all we\u2019re not providing that level of guidance in particularly at this early stage but we think that, this deployment of capital is compelling relative to the market opportunities.", "And I think the capabilities we can bring to the marketplace, so we think that this business will continue to grow, we think that will become a more effective serving customers and it will become more affected as a business and particularly in the market dynamics that we see ahead as specialty pharma continues to emerge in the marketplace whether it\u2019s going to require greater information, greater clinical engagement.", "So we think this is a very good use of capital that will be a important business broadly for the marketplace, serving all sectors of the markets that where prescriptions are engaged.", "And we expect this to grow, so we don\u2019t expect this accretion to flatten out or trend, we expect the business to actually improve year-by-year and so we would expect that contribution to grow and would grow we think much more than would be a share buyback if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using it as an example.", "Our orientation to deploying capital is to find growth opportunities aligned with our strategic capabilities and that is our priority in terms of deploying capital, paying dividends and share buyback is really, when we really have excess capital if you will to bear. So we are very pleased with this and we can - we\u2019ll continue to look for investment opportunities not only in this area but in our other Optum services and in our benefits businesses where we think there would may be opportunities down the road. I don\u2019t know if that gets to your Larry.", "Larry Renfro", "Sure, Kevin I\u2019ll get little more granular and may be this is not were, you were going but I\u2019m can\u2019t been held responsible here for that $0.30 in 2016 and the way that I look at it, you\u2019ve got some factors that we have to pay attention to very, very carefully right now such as client retention, such as sales, such as our operating leverage, our customer service and our management.", "All of these things that we really have control of inside of Optum and how we manage the business and with the combination of Catamaran, who has the strong management team, who has strong experience, strong relationships, this is a very, very strong management team and so we feel confident on lot of levers that we can use and pull to go towards that $0.30.", "Now I\u2019m not even talking about network discounts and I\u2019m not talking about drugs \u2013 at this point of time because as we talked about some of these categories will go back to others and our clients as we work with them.", "So we\u2019re confident from what I call operating plan standpoint, what we have to do by 2016.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks for the question and next question please.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Christine Arnold", "Hi. At your Investor Day you indicated you expect to achieve your long-term earnings growth target of 13% to 16% in 2016 recognizing now that the 2015 EPS is going to be higher than your expected. Is that objective still on track and as you look into 2016, you mentioned that rates are keeping up with cost trends in Medicare, could you comment on your other lines of business how you see headwinds, tailwinds? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. The other lines of business I\u2019ll ask Jeff, Austin, and Steve maybe to respond in terms of our overall, we are not changing our outlook with respect to our long-term growth trends or with no intention of suggesting that.", "We still feel confident that in the long-term our businesses are capable of producing growth in that range and we are hopefully seeing our performance start to recover back into that range.", "So as it relates to the individual businesses maybe I\u2019ll start with Steve Nelson.", "Steve Nelson", "Thanks Steve. Hi Christine, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. With respect to the Medicare business, it\u2019s really well positioned for 2000 now and will even increasingly improve for 2016 to serve more seniors which is really our objective provide not just better benefits but great health outcomes and a better healthcare experience.", "And I\u2019ll just tell you how kind of we think about that as we are in - as you know in the midst of our 2016 benefit planning period. We have now shaped our networks in a really meaningful way, we have added premiums under half of our total membership as premium which was an important transition and something that we needed to do and executed that this year making great progress on starts, we have really strong clinical programs and customer service innovations and improvement that not only as I said provide benefits but create a better healthcare experience for our members.", "And we have great market share and brand position, so when you couple this with the growth of the population and increased propensity to choose Medicare advantage over fee-for-service it is really strong position and very positive outlook. Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning Christine, it's Jeff Alter. I think the commercial business shares very positive view of the future, we've been through a tough couple of years with lot of headwinds, lot of disruptions from the ACA which tend to - I think our ability to manage trend better than some others.", "And I think as we go into 2015, 2016 and beyond kind of the combined power of Optum healthcare working together to keep trends lower, keep our pricing lower. I think you should expect the growth that we\u2019ve had over the last six months or so to really be what distinguishes us going forward and that\u2019s delivering more and more value to the marketplace through different product designs but more important over the long run better management of cost and delivering that better management back through lower pricing and growth to the marketplace.", "Austin Pittman", "Good morning, this is Austin. Strong momentum continues in our Medicaid business, we are very honored to continue to see strong growth, we look for that growth to continue throughout the year and into the future.", "Really built on very strong relationships with our state partners, strong clinical programs focused on getting better outcomes, high quality outcomes for the constituents and overall I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate over time and partnership with those states value.", "And that sustained value we think is what really continues to create that momentum moving forward.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I think pretty solid across the board in terms of and the Optum business continues to be strong, the backlog pipeline and Optum continues to grow and revenue backlog continues to grow actually at a faster pace than what we\u2019re actually showing in our reported results, so pretty positive in that regard.", "We\u2019ll take maybe two more questions, so the next one please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ana Gupte", "Yes, thanks good morning. I was wondering on this Optum UHC better together is that strengthened or less strong if you will post to Catamaran transaction. And how would that be informed by your 2016, 2017 selling season and are there any other milestones that might inform one decision versus the other?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I would say just in broadly that kind of coming back to an earlier question that I think the chemistry and the operating dynamics across the businesses continue to mature and get better I think we have a very strong generation of leaders here and they\u2019re working together.", "In terms of this particular transaction, a lot of work done at the corporate level in terms of the actual developing and execution of a transaction of this caliber and then working with the Optum team and the OptumRx team that has been probably the orientation at this point in time.", "So I would say that as it relates to that transaction, I think it was our - I think we\u2019ve really good capabilities at our corporate development, organization are - treasury organization and so forth and then they take the business expertise from the Optum team really where our PBM resides.", "So that is probably in - that flavor was probably played out more in that. But I would tell you that the better together dynamic across our businesses has never play \u2013actually been better and as I said earlier, I think and certainly it\u2019s our intent that this is just the beginning. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take the next question from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Sean Wieland", "Thank you. Long time listener, first time caller, thanks for taking my question. So this week you said the Optum360 and Mayo is getting together. Mayo as you know is also embarking on their implementation of APAC. So that\u2019s a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Can you comment on the value proposition to Mayo given their simultaneous rollout of APAC and how you\u2019re going to manage this? And also can you tell us what the organic growth wise in the OptumHealth business. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well welcome Sean, and maybe Bill Miller can touch on Mayo and John perhaps your last question.", "Bill Miller", "Yes Sean, this is Bill, I\u2019ll answer the implementation work going on down at APAC. It's a very insightful question, because that is a lot of things going on. And it was instrumental and part of the discussion as we arrived at our relationship with Mayo, because what we'll do is working concert with them with respect to their rollout of APAC.", "But if they evaluated that, and they looked at our tools, the combination of our tools working with their existing systems and the systems that they\u2019re going to install, they felt like they wanted to move ahead, because they were independent and the best in the market as they saw them.", "And there were other things that we're going to work on collectively that I think enhance Mayo's position around patient engagement and some other things that they want to sort with from a consumer perspective, which we\u2019re going to work with them particularly in the context of revenue management.", "So, they\u2019re comfortable with the so called cooks in the kitchen. We\u2019ll collaborate in that context and there is not that much overlap and where there is we\u2019ve accounted forward in the project plan. So we feel very comfortable about going forward.", "John Rex", "Yes Sean, this is John Rex. So OptumHealth did have a very good top line growth in the quarter that you noted 27% top line growth. I would say all the businesses contributing if I would have call out certain businesses in terms of where we saw particular strength that I want to note on the call and call at the OptumCare businesses.", "So those are the care delivery businesses certainly one of the big five drivers that we talked about extensively at the Investor Day back in December in terms of where our focus was over the next five years. Driving that growth it was really a growth in patients served in our existing markets. It was also de novo expansion new market expansion really heavily along those areas in terms of driving the vast majority of growth with OptumHealth for the quarter.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So to just to sum up the quarter, the story is really again about growth, growth in revenues, earnings based on more consistent performance for customers, growth in the number of people we partner with and serve across the healthcare system.", "And growth in the scope and diversity of our businesses.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. You may begin, sir.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's second quarter results. Our second quarter and first half are once again strong across our business portfolio continuing the performance consistency and growth momentum that have been advancing since the second half of 2014. The market sees real value in a simpler, more modern and helpful consumer experience, well-informed consumer and physician engagement, access to quality care, practical innovation and fair pricing. With the expected closing of the Catamaran transaction and improved momentum in our base business, we now expect 2015 revenues to be $154 billion, earnings to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share and cash flows from operations to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.", "Second quarter revenues grew 11.3% year-over-year to $36.3 billion. After tax net margins improved 10 basis points and net earnings grew 15% year-over-year to $1.64 per share. Second quarter cash flows from operations also grew 15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and brought first half 2015 operating cash flows to $3.4 billion or 114% of net income and this compares to 97% through the midpoint of last year. Second quarter earnings were driven by both consistent, broad-based growth at UnitedHealthcare and continued strong growth and improving margin performance from Optum. We are positioned well for the second half of 2015 and continue to forecast UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share growth will accelerate in 2016.", "I will ask Larry Renfro to lead off today with a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will pick up with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group enterprise themes. Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Thanks, Steve. Optum is firmly on track to achieve significant growth and performance targets for both 2015 and 2016. Second quarter results were strong across the board and position us well once again for a strong finish in the second half of the year. Optum revenues grew 16% in the second quarter. Optum's overall operating margin of 6.4% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from the first quarter, with all businesses improving their margins sequentially. This higher overall margin on a growing revenue base drove 19% growth in Optum's earnings from operations this quarter. Through the first half of the year, Optum earned 42% of its full year operating earnings target, even while absorbing $42 million in Catamaran merger costs in the first quarter. Given normal seasonality, Optum is well on track to achieve its full year plan.", "As we have shared before, Optum is focused on opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets, clinical care, pharmacy care services, technology solutions and government services, with international versions of these being the fifth opportunity. In pharmacy care services, there is a clear market need for a more integrated patient centered cost sensitive offering. We are committed to creating a next-generation pharmacy care services company. The addition of Catamaran accelerates our efforts significantly. Together, we believe we would better serve people through a comprehensive whole person approach that integrates data, information, analytics and clinical care insight to support care treatments and compliance rather than just filling prescriptions.", "This is doubly true in the coming era of specialty drugs. We will bring better and more consistent overall quality and lower costs for consumers. This approach enhances the differentiated value OptumRx offers customers beyond the benefits of our combined purchasing of over one billion scripts per year. We expect the merger to close within the next two weeks. So we will be advancing this effort over the balance of this year slightly ahead of schedule.", "Turning to the technology solutions market. Care providers are strongly embracing Optum360 offerings. They can leverage our technology infrastructure and full portfolio of solutions for modern, performance-based care delivery across the full range of care settings, including receiving comprehensive revenue management services and accompanying operating analytics computer-assisted coding, clinical documentation, ICD-10 compliance and population health management. These capabilities packaged as a comprehensive solution are designed to optimize the financial and service performance of the care provider customers we serve and help them transition to perform exceptionally well under performance-based and value-based delivery arrangements.", "Optum360 has been one of the contributors to the overall growth in OptumInsight revenues which grew 13% this past quarter and contributed to growth in contract backlog of more than 35% externally reaching a record $9.8 billion in total at June 30. And we are seeing accelerating growth potential going forward, as Optum's overall sales pipeline of potential contract awards has grown to $14 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year in part due to significant proposals in the Optum360 markets.", "OptumCare, our local care delivery business, helped drive 33% growth in Optum health revenues this quarter. We offer physicians a unique, strong and stable professional practice opportunity. We can support and equip them to do what they most clearly want, to practice medicine rather than administer a complex business. We have invested in modern technology with unique analytics and process tools to create service responsiveness for patients well beyond what standalone clinics deliver today and OptumCare offers compelling value to payers through risksharing capabilities that help them offer affordable health benefit products. The stability and growth in our patient base and payer relationships reflect the value our physicians provide. As this business matures, we expect to expand operating margins while delivering strong consistent revenue growth.", "This past quarter, MedExpress joined OptumCare with nearly 150 freestanding neighborhood care centers in 16 local markets. MedExpress can offer as much as 90% of the care typically delivered in a hospital emergency room at about 90% lower cost. We are committed to growing as a leading provider of ambulatory care services, recognizing this capability will be increasingly valuable to the consumer and health care system overall. We offer these few examples to help illustrate Optum's diversity and commitment to delivering remarkable value for patients and customer. In each case, these examples are part of enduring relationships we are building with people who are seeking sophisticated trusted partners to help them address both the pressures and the opportunities across the whole health system. More than selling any one product, serving these client relationships well will be critical as Optum works to achieve its ambitious goals.", "Now let me turn it over to Dave.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. Starting first with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew a strong 10% organically to $33.1 billion, while operating margins were steady at 6.1%. The UnitedHealth Group consolidated medical care ratio improved 20 basis points year-over-year and throughout the first half medical costs were well controlled. The year-over-year decrease in the care ratio occurred despite the growth of about 1.3 million people in Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and public exchanges, all higher care ratio businesses.", "The 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full-year forecast and we continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Steady growth and discipline around care management and operating cost drove 11% operating earnings growth at UnitedHealthcare in the quarter. The core story for UnitedHealthcare continues to be one of distinctive organic gains in overall market share and above market revenue growth, along with continued emphasis on serving local market needs. We project domestic growth of 1.4 million people in 2015, bringing us to organic growth of nearly 10 million more people served in the United States in the past six years.", "While this has been among the strongest organic growth periods we have experienced, we see continued growth potential going forward. We believe there are opportunities to serve substantially higher numbers of people to deliver further value and build equity with consumers and physicians in the benefits market. These opportunities stem from delivering practical innovations at fair price points and executing consistently in their local markets for the millions of people we serve.", "Our newest products increasingly use configured networks that improve care quality and total cost and embeds complementary services to further strengthen value to the consumer. Our combination of informatics and dedicated local market clinical staff help us find people and engage them in the healthcare system to get the care they need at the right location at the right time. Consistently getting all this right, drives consumer trust and growth follows in an expanding market of more than 300 million people in the United States alone.", "Let me flag a few representative examples. We are bridging the direct link between consumer engagement and lower per member cost trend and with employers' help further engaging consumers in their own health and wellness. This includes our product development efforts like Rally in cutting-edge areas like incentives, gamifications, missions and social networks. Engaging people on their own care informs them as real consumers and translates into better care, better care resource use and lower costs.", "In July we released the next evolution of our diabetes prevention and weight management program called Real Appeal, which merges proven science and diabetes prevention with motivational multimedia weight and lifestyle management programs to reduce the onset of diabetes, reduce obesity and improve overall health and metabolic state. Real Appeal is the first digital extension of Rally both of which use life coaches and other motivational methods to achieve superior engagement, quality outcomes and economic results.", "Similarly, we are using technology and data behind the scenes to advance the fundamentals of service. Our approach predicts and prioritizes the needs of inbound inquiries and connects the consumer through whatever communications channel they choose with clinical, wellness or administrative personnel based upon their predicted need making the service experience simpler, better and more complete for them and more efficient for us. We approach Medicaid in the context of the broader array of social services people need and states must address in support of better healthcare. We believe we can increase value for our state customers and our Medicaid members by helping connect people with our growing network of local market social services like transportation, housing and nutrition.", "On the physician side, 465,000 physicians nationwide have signed up to use our secured cloud-based workspace called Link. Link enable doctors and their office staff to transact routine business with multiple payers more efficiently than they could ever do through traditional widely used channels like portals, faxes and phones. We are furthering that offering to support practice performance, risk arrangements and referrals through the deployment of tools for search and price transparency, referrals and online scheduling and we are just getting started. Think of Link as the end-to-end dashboard for managing all critical elements of an ambulatory practice fully integrated with the physicians practice management system.", "Under benefit innovation, we continue to organize our networks around specific local market products expanding value-based purchasing and our medical network and next-generation patient incentives to help them get the right care and make the right decisions. This full alignment from the consumer through the care provider consistently delivers the highest value.", "While modern technology positions us to target and engage people, it is our local people who close the circle. We have nurses who are performing one million clinical visits annually in seniors homes, nurses and case managers in local hospitals working alongside hospital staff, community health workers assisting Medicaid recipients neighborhood-by-neighborhood and physician office staff assistance helping document physician care quality for Medicare. Each one of these professionals puts a human face on UnitedHealthcare with every interaction they have at the local level, improving the quality of health care and reducing its costs. We believe no one else delivers such a total package nationally.", "Looking forward, we continue to develop and more deeply integrate our capabilities. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at market differentiating pace profitably growing share as a direct result of the total value we are delivering and the brand equity we are building.", "Before Steve sums up, let me touch on a couple of items for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the second quarter, we raised our dividend by another 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share. We plan to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders in dividend payments over the next year. As Larry mentioned, we expect to close the Catamaran merger in July after financing of the transaction our projected debt to total capital will be around 48% in the third quarter. We are committed to sustaining our strong financial position and current debt ratings and expect to reduce debt to total capital in short order.", "With the deal expected to close in two weeks, we are incorporating Catamaran into our 2015 outlook. We foresee Catamaran adding around $10 billion in revenues this year, with full year 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenues now growing 18% year-over-year to approximately $154 billion and we now expect cash flows to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion in 2015.", "In addition, we are increasing our outlook for our earnings per share to a range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share. The improvement comes from our core operating performance with Catamaran's impact on earnings over the balance of 2015 offset by interest, amortization and integration costs. We continue to foresee strong revenue, earnings accretion and cash flows from Catamaran in 2016 and increasing level thereafter, but again, Larry described for you the real story, which is the future value creation.", "Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, Dave. Larry and Dave have given you some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value throughout the broad health system and to growth. Let me just comment briefly before we summarize today's report.", "Certainly, we all recognize this market space has been exceptionally active this quarter and beyond that observation we do not believe it is our place to comment on market specific activities or hypothetical implications that we are not involved in. And we are not going to comment on the activities of others or speculate on subsequent processes or market dynamics no one really yet knows. Our focus remains squarely on the continued growth and expand the capability of our enterprise and how we can serve our customers more effectively.", "The markets we serve are changing in positive ways to call upon our competencies we have cultivated for years and accordingly these changes help prospects for years of positive growth in the continued expansion of our products and services. Our capabilities are strengthening and we are expanding into natural market adjacencies. We are intensely focused on these opportunities and committed to driving higher and more consistent performance for customers across our businesses.", "The key elements of our efforts going forward are familiar and fundamental. Truly focusing on serving consumers, care providers and benefit sponsors, creating and adopting simpler, more modern approaches around how healthcare is paid for, around information transparency, consumer engagement and care access and care provider support, developing valuable long-term relationships with strong partners, pricing products and services that deliver real value to the market because our design approach in underlying cost structures are market-leading, executing to serve the key future growth areas for Optum, clinical care, integrated pharmacy care, technology solutions and government services, thoughtfully moving forward at the targeted global menus, using capital to strengthen capabilities and improve and expand our growth potential and cultivating capabilities that will be important to the future more than the past.", "With that, we thank you and operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you limit your question to one per person so that we can get as many questions as possible. And we will take our first question from David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "David Windley", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, acknowledging your comments about market activity, wondering if with Catamaran now near closed, what is United's appetite for further M&A activity? And maybe dovetailing that, what is your current view on provider consolidation and balance of power in local markets as it relates to negotiating your cost position? Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, in terms of the commentary along those lines, we have been building our business and diversifying our businesses across the landscape of our business model for several years and we can expect to continue those approaches, continue to diversify our business as we said in the natural market adjacencies, continue to deploy capital in ways that we think makes sense for us and continue to fill in market positions and to build on capabilities. So I don't think anything has really changed in that domain and I don't think there is any reason to think otherwise.", "Our businesses are well positioned across the expanse of benefits and across services. We are well positioned across virtually all the key markets and think that we can continue to drive very strong cost positions, have plenty of scale across all our business segments. So we are just going to continue to run our business and maintain that approach. So I don't think anything has really changed, David.", "David Windley", "Great. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please", "Operator", "We are going to take our next question from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes. So just hoping you could maybe help us understand how much the impact there was on the medical cost ratio from higher acuity enrollment? I think we can probably do our own math on the growth in the MA Medicaid enrollment relative to commercial. But since you are not giving the commercial MCR anymore, I was just looking for whatever additional insight you could provide on that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Again, I think because it really reflects more the reality and the diversity of our business but I don't know if we can give you something that is so precise but Dan, do you want to take a shot?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Matt. Good morning.", "Matthew Borsch", "Good morning.", "Dan Schumacher", "So in terms of our care ratios and our performance in the quarter, they were very much in line with our expectation. And then underneath that, as Dave mentioned, we continue to drive very low trends which is why we are orienting towards the lower half of our prior guidance. Obviously, there is impacts associated with the 1.3 million lives we have added over the last 12 months in Medicare, Medicaid, as well as in exchanges which have higher relative care ratios. But maybe if you step back and look at it, we have been able to drive a 20 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a little higher pricing for reform fees, which is helping that offset by a little less development. And when you compare that to the prior year quarter, we did have revenue true-ups in there related to our government programs. So when we look at it on a consolidated basis, it's very much in keeping with our expectations and we have strong confidence in our full year outlook of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Matthew Borsch", "If I could just one quick follow-up on that, you mentioned the prior year development or to prior period development, I noticed you didn't breakout between inner year and prior year, or I missed it. Do you have that?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes. It was all current year development.", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Good morning. Thank you very much and a very nice job again. If we can focus on the Catamaran transaction for a moment since that is something that is going forward and new as opposed to looking backwards as I suspect you would like us to shift our focus, a couple of questions around that. First of all, the new model that you are describing and new value proposition for the OptumRx business in conjunction with Catamaran, can you elaborate a little bit, I heard what you said, Larry, and I understand that you basically trying to change the conversation away from a finite, how much more efficiently can we fill prescriptions, to something that is much more clinically focused and much more targeted at helping the ultimate payers to manage the spend and improve the health of the patient. Can you talk a little bit about why you are doing that now with Catamaran and why you couldn't do that before? That's question number one.", "And question number two. Can you set our minds at ease a little bit about how you are thinking about retaining and you have answered this question before, but retaining large-scale customers that Catamaran currently has in the face of the transition to ownership by competing health plan? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I will let Larry handle the bulk of this, but I would say that OptumRx was clearly on a path to a more comprehensive and integrated approach using data and analytics and engaging in the clinical protocol before - the intensity of that has increased. The advent of specialty pharma has clearly been an element of that and allows us to actually engage it even more effectively as you know. And the only other comment I would offer is, is that we are intensely focused on serving all of our customers and serving the expectations of the Catamaran customers for sure and their expectations. There is significant value coming their way from this combination. And we think that, that is going to be compelling and we are looking to build that business not only for current customers but to expand that business as well.", "Larry, would you want to add to that?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. So Sheryl, I will come at it a couple of ways. Steve said this and we are laser focused on our customers right now and that's not only customers that we have at Optum, but also when we have the ability to get to the customers of Catamaran. As you know, we are limited right now as the transaction hasn't been approved, so we haven't had a lot of interaction with them yet. But I think that if I looked at the timing on this and what we are trying to do and why we did the transaction, it fits with why I think this is going to work pretty well.", "Number one, we needed scale and that's what we are going to have now that we have the volumes that Catamaran brings to this. So scale is going to be there. Obviously, we have been on their technology for 10 years. So this makes it an easy integration and we are going to have enhanced technology that's going to benefit both our organizations. But we get into what Steve was talking about is some distinctive capabilities whether that's the specialty drug side or that\u2019s synchronization.", "And if I was looking at that, on the synchronization side, we would be looking at data, modeling, analytics, the things that we do every day, tying that together with our clinical and case management programs and engaging the providers and members. So this is a profound program that we are putting in place at this point around synchronization that Tim Wicks has been working on in OptumRx, that we will now tie in together with Catamaran.", "And then the specialty, obviously drug side, we are focused with synchronization being part of that as well as trend management, case management as well as just the purchasing power that with the scale will bring. ", "I think the fourth area would be a well-rounded management team. Now we are going to have a very, very strong sales organization, as well as service organization. So that works very well and it's good timing on all this and I think everyone knows that this is a very complementary business. With catamaran, had a big focus on retail where we are on the employer side and government. They are strong in their relationships and sales. We are strong in service. Both are strong in technology. So it's just good timing right now. We believe we can move the dial a bit with the organizations together and I can comment more on this after we get this approved.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Great. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And I would say that goes along with the broader theme of the cost of the businesses really taking a fresh looks, using information, approaching the marketplace in a more comprehensive and integrated way, engaging local resources to targeted groups so that we can improve their access to care, their use of resources and change their consumer experience as well. So it plays to us across a whole spectrum of areas in pharmaceuticals and specialty pharma is really just one of those themes. Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Andy Schenker", "Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate some of your earlier comments here on cost trend in MLRs versus your expectations and maybe if you could just provide any additional color on how maybe the components, their utilization and unit costs are really developing across your book and then remind us how that compares to your initial expectations and related to that one of your peer's highlights on how utilization in Medicare book, specifically anything you are seeing there versus commercial and Medicare? Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, do you want to comment?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Andy. This is Dan. I again reiterate that certainly our costs in this quarter were well within our expectation and we continue to drive a low trend, relatively speaking. And I think when you look at the combination of factors that impact it, it starts first with a benefit design that rewards consumers for better choices and then we are aligning it with provider relationships that incentivize more appropriate use of health resources. And then we overlay our medical management on that. And that starts with our people and we have got people in UnitedHealthcare and Optum across facilities, across the country as well as in neighborhoods, as Dave mentioned and in people's home and when we look at the combination of all those things, we have been able to drive a very consistent utilization trend across all our businesses within the UnitedHealthcare portfolio and again, well within our expectations.", "So your comments about what you seeing and others around hospital use and so forth, specifically on that, we have not seen anything outside of normal seasonal variation. So it's all in keeping with our expectation. And I think it's important to remember, as we have talked before, we have got a lot of visibility on the hospital side, who is coming in, who is there, who is leaving, how we are interacting with them, facilitating their just discharge and so forth and this is really a strength of our company and we continue to drive absolute reductions in per capita hospital usage and we been talking about that for the last six years.", "So again, from our perspective, very much in keeping with our expectations in the quarter, nothing that I would highlight by category or by business, frankly.", "Andy Schenker", "Dan, if I could just squeeze a quick follow-up in there. You obviously highlight medical management and benefit design. Do you think United is maybe doing better than the overall market as a result of those? Or do think that they are still generally in line with the broader market on some insurance?", "Dan Schumacher", "I think the combination of the assets that UnitedHealthcare and Optum bring in combination to this marketplace is distinctive.", "Andy Schenker", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Christine Arnold", "Great. Thanks for the question. Your OptumInsight backlog is up significantly. You talked a lot about Optum360. How does the composition of your business change over time? And how might the changing mix of business change earnings growth and seasonality in the future? And then as a second kind of unrelated question, is there anyway to quantify the out of period revenue you experienced a year ago, so we can think about underlying core MLRs? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Maybe I will have John start the themes and then send that down to a couple of business leads.", "John Rex", "Good morning, Christine. John Rex here. So just a few thoughts here on the backlog and how that relates to what we see going on in OptumInsight. So a few things here as we talk about the backlog. One of the things that we been noting here is that it continues to be driven by the external business, commercial business that OptumInsight has been successfully gaining. In particular, in driving those increases are, we go back to the theme of the larger, deeper and more comprehensive relationships that we been pursuing for some time. We thought making considerable investments in OptumInsight a couple of years ago and that impacted some of the progression. We spoke about that and tried to highlight that. In particular it was related to those kind of relationships. As they come on, they typically come on and we need to invest. It takes some while to mature and then they start contributing. It's a part of what you are seeing in OptumInsight this year as some of those investments we made a couple of years ago maturing, starting to starting to come online. But our aspiration is to continue to make those and continue to make those in a way that we can balance both our growth that we are looking forward as well as deliver on those commitments.", "So I am going to ask Bill Miller to make a few comments and give a little bit more detail in terms of exactly where that's occurring.", "Bill Miller", "Yes. I think John did a good job at touching on the 360. If I broaden the spectrum a little bit, I think there is three primary factors why you see this pipeline growing and certainly the backlog growing. One, I just think is a very strong focus on our markets, understanding the pressures that are boiling up there, really getting inside of the trend there. And I think we do a really good job of anticipating those trends, which cascades to the next thing as we spent a lot of time with our clients interpreting how these pressures and trends are going to have to be solved for inside of whether they are provider, payer government, life sciences, businesses and so really building with them in concert with them with their input solutions that really help solve and help them thrive in an environment that is becoming more and more performance-based. And I would say, thematically our portfolio is really shape charged for helping our clients move into more of a performance-based environment. And then finally I would say, we execute and deliver. We have great outcomes on the big large end-to-end contracts that we have undertaken but we execute every day on our software solutions, our more standalone solutions and that track record continues to strengthen and the market is recognizing it.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Wright from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.", "Brian Wright", "Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, on the higher acuities with the Medicaid and Medicare and the exchanges, I just want to make sure that the exchange MLR is within your expectations as well too.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I would ask Jeff or Dan, who do you want?", "Dan Schumacher", "I will have a take, Brian, on the exchanges. Obviously, when we talked about how we are going to approach this market in 2013 and then in 2014 and beyond, our expectation was to get more fully involved this year, which we have done. We have seen some really nice growth. But as we talked about last quarter and we talked coming in, we didn't have an expectation of any meaningful contribution on a margin standpoint. So from a care ratio, it's in keeping with expectations, but obviously higher than what our traditional commercial book would be.", "Stephen Hemsley", "As expected.", "Dan Schumacher", "As expected, yes.", "Brian Wright", "Okay. So nothing out of the ordinary, nothing surprising in what you see?", "Jeff Alter", "Brian, it's Jeff Alter. No, nothing. As we mentioned, as we were preparing for 2015, we were very purposeful in building both product and networks that supported those price points. And as a matter of fact, we grew where we thought we would grow in the markets that we thought with the products that we thought and we were pleased we actually grew a little more than we expected. So we are pleased with where we are at exchanges and it's a growing, emerging, developing market and we are planning for that as we pace forward.", "Brian Wright", "And sorry, just be a second, but the better-than-expected growth isn't coming at the cost of worse-than-expected medical cost in that bucket?", "Jeff Alter", "No, absolutely not. We are growing where we thought we would with the products and the network designs and economics that supported those price points.", "Brian Wright", "Perfect. Thank you so much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Gary Taylor", "Hi. Good morning. I just had one little nit and then my real question. I think it was Larry who said $42 million of Catamaran merger cost in the first quarter. Is there a 2Q number you have for us?", "Larry Renfro", "I think that was Dave.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay.", "Stephen Hemsley", "There is no meaningful Q2 cost. We recorded the costs associated with the Catamaran merger, the transaction cost in the first quarter.", "Gary Taylor", "All in the first quarter. Okay. Thank you. So the question I wanted to ask, I am sure you guys saw the CMS announcement last Friday proposing to bundle roughly 25% of Medicare hips and knees in 2016 into a bundled payment methodology. I just wondered if you can maybe talk just for a couple minutes on conceptually your experience with bundled payments on the commercial side? Are you using bundled payments in your ACOs? Or is that more risksharing agreements in capitation? And do you see this, the CMS announcement, as an opportunity to push for more bundled payments in your commercial book?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Dan, do you want to comment on that?", "Dan Schumacher", "You bet. Good morning, Gary. So as it relates to our value-based reimbursement in a program, we have talked historically about the continuum working from less progressive to more progressive reimbursement methods and sort of sitting in the middle of that are bundled payments. Today, we deploy them in, if you think about our $36 billion of value-based reimbursement at the end of 2014 or the $43 billion we will have at the end of 2015, we have got about 5% stake in that bundled payments category. And from our perspective, it is a good mechanism along the journey towards a more progressive population orientation around outcomes and value and quality. But at the core, it still doesn't specifically address the volume of utilization. So the number of bundles, right. So as we look at progressing, we are looking to get to more comprehensive alignment around total population cost. It is a piece of productive and positive, but it's just part of a broader solution.", "Gary Taylor", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Great. Thanks. I wanted to dig into the two comments you made about guidance. I guess first on 2015, it sounds like all of the revenue number are from Catamaran or the revenue increases are mostly Catamaran, the earnings increase is not. So I just wondered if you could break out what is driving the increase in earnings this year versus your expectations last quarter? And then second, Stephen I think you said that you expect earnings growth to accelerate next year and I just wanted to see if that was due to Catamaran or whether you would make that same comment on a core basis, whether the core United would have grown or growth would have accelerated even without the Catamaran deal?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I will weigh into this and let Dave deal with specifics particularly around the revenue break. But we are not expecting a contribution from Catamaran at the balance of the year. Basically its earnings will be offset by integration cost, interest expense elements such as that. The improving performance is really historic core businesses and actually UnitedHealthcare has a strong period and a big contributor to that. But the beauty of our construct is that it's a broad-based portfolio and really, the vast majority of the businesses are performing very strongly and we see growing momentum. We clearly expect 2016 to be even stronger year. I think we have been basically have held that posture consistently and that would be in the core business not just Catamaran.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "But I guess, just no finer point on the 2015 guidance rate? Is it 50-50? Or is one business causing more of the improvement?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave?", "Dave Wichmann", "Most of the improvement for the guidance for the balance of the year comes from expectations out of UnitedHealthcare. And as for the revenue guidance, you are right, it increased in the quarter but predominantly related to Catamaran. That said, all the businesses improved their revenue forecasts for the balance of the year, just not enough to around up further.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Are you saying United is better but you reaffirm the MLR guidance. So what's is driving the UnitedHealthcare better performance?", "Dave Wichmann", "UnitedHealthcare's performance is predominantly coming from growth. Very strong growth. 1.6 million people year-over-year, 1.4 million for the balance of the year. Very strong growth momentum really commencing about this time last year and actually earlier for Medicaid and for the government programs broadly.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Wasn't the 1.4 million, didn't you put out the same number last year, wasn't that your -- in last quarter, wasn't that your guidance for membership this year, last quarter as well?", "Dave Wichmann", "I think that's right. Yes, that's the same.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "But you are raising guidance on better growth?", "Dave Wichmann", "Yes. We are raising guidance on growth and then we were raising guidance $0.10 at the bottom end of the ranges and $0.05 at the top end of the range. And we are raising that guidance based on better visibility on growth and performance in the business.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay. Great.", "Dave Wichmann", "So translating the slightly stronger revenues on the core businesses and stronger earnings keep earnings efficiencies out of those businesses.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "All right. Great. Thanks.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.", "A.J. Rice", "Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe I will ask a little more broad question about the Medicare advantage. Obviously the bids are now in for next year. You have now a chance to comment in a big forum like this about your thinking about how that will go for next year and opportunity for margin gains, enrollment that type of thing. Any broad color on that, now that the bids are in?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I will ask Steve Nelson comment on that. Pretty positive, but obviously at this stage we are not going to give real much precision around next year, but from a thematic point of view, Steve?", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. Good morning, A.J., it's Steve Nelson. As Steve said, it is obviously too early to be specific. Don't have CMS approval on our benefit submissions yet. But at a high level, we really like how the Medicare Advantage business is positioned for 2016. We are poised to offer stable benefits and distinctive value to both new and existing customers and this is really just at a high-level a result of the work that we have done over the past couple of years to reshape our networks. We introduced premiums more broadly into our membership this year. We have introduced, developed and implemented new and unique customer service model. We call it Advocate4Me. We think it's distinctive. We have more effective clinical models and clinical capabilities in conjunction with our partnership with Optum. And when you couple that with really strong local brand, we really like our position and excited about the growth opportunities in this Medicare Advantage business for 2016.", "A.J. Rice", "All right. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So really stable across the board. We think it's strengthened the business across the board and very positive. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Peter Costa", "Hi. I am hoping you give us some specifics around your MLR this quarter, in particular on three items you have broken out or a couple that you have broken out anyways. The first being the overall mix. What was the actual impact from mix on the MLR this quarter? Second is, what was the impact from the revenue true-ups that you mentioned? And were those favorable or unfavorable true-ups? And I assume some of that relates to the risk adjuster in the New York small group market. And the last question is, your eliminations went up this quarter sequentially, usually they are more flat, except for last year when you were bringing in the PBM revenues, but they were up again this quarter sequentially and I am kind of wondering why they were up and did that have any impact on your MLR this quarter?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I don't think the eliminations had really any impact, but anyone try to address the other two?", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. Peter, we are not going to get into the specifics of spiking out the mix impact on the revenue true-ups. Obviously, if you think about the things influencing the quarter and as you compare to the same quarter last year, on a mix basis, we would have a rising care ratio just based on greater orientation to Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and exchange enrollment. Revenue true-ups I referenced earlier, so in last year's second quarter, we recognize government-based revenue true-ups which were favorable. So as you look at the comps year-over-year, that would be something that we will be working against that comparison on a year-over-year basis.", "And then as you look at the second quarter this year, on the revenue side, we had expected in the commercial business to be receivers on the risk adjustment and we did a little bit better risk adjustment on the commercial business in the second quarter related to 2014. So those are the things that are all coming together, but when you step back from it we have seen a decline in our care ratio on a consolidated basis year-over-year. Our medical costs are in line with our expectations and our trends are trending towards the lower half of the guidance that we have provided previously. So as we look at the second quarter, it is very much in line with what we were thinking before we get into it and as we exit it, we have confidence of balance of the year.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And last year was affected by the true-ups.", "Dave Wichmann", "Yes. It was last year.", "Peter Costa", "Okay. And then, just a follow-up. Why did the eliminations go up sequentially this quarter?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave, you want to take?", "Dave Wichmann", "Peter, they go up as UnitedHealthcare grows, so too does Optum because UnitedHealthcare is obviously a customer of Optum. So when you look at them, you will actually see that Optum's overall growth rate is growing at a faster rate than the eliminations, if you will, which suggests that Optum is going faster externally than they are through the internal business with UnitedHealthcare, which is the case. But they are going to continue to rise as UnitedHealthcare continues to grow at these rates.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Josh Raskin", "Thanks. First, just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification, just you guys don't talk about cash earnings, but I was curious if you could give us what your estimates for cash earnings EPS guidance would be this year? And the $0.30 that you talked about for Catamaran, I just want to make sure that's a GAAP number and I guess, maybe what would be the cash estimate? And then real question just around the national accounts business we are getting for July here, I am curious what you are seeing for 2016? Any changes in the competitive dynamics? Have you guys thought about different strategies for sales in light of what's perceived to be industry [indiscernible]?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I will have Dave do the earnings and Jeff can comment on the national business.", "Dave Wichmann", "Yes. So Josh, we maybe unique in this regard, but we only report numbers on a GAAP basis. So in every case they include the application of the amortization of intangibles which are pretty consistent in our business. If you look at 2015, the effects on EPS would be about $0.34 per share, if you look back to 2014, it would be the same $0.34 per share and yes, the forward view on 2016 accretion for Catamaran was a GAAP base number as well.", "Josh Raskin", "And Dave, so what would the cash accretion be on Catamaran next year?", "Dave Wichmann", "Catamaran will carry about $0.20 of amortization per year.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. Perfect.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. So we had a really strong 2015 national account season and that momentum is continuing. We have been very purposeful in focusing on our customer's needs to deliver a total reduction in cost for them. So the partnership that we been able to create with our existing clients and with bringing Optum resources to the table have resonated in that market. As far as 2016 goes, right now, it's improved over where we were in 2015. We have got a couple of new strategic wins already booked. Some growth in existing clients in slices of business that we didn't have and we have retained today all our key clients that we have to bid. We will give you more clarity as the season wraps up during our next call.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. That's helpful Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Sean Wieland", "Thank you very much. What percent of your members are predominantly inside the United tent? That is, they get their medical benefits from United, their pharmacy benefits from OptumRx, they engage with Optum health services? And can you comment on what the medical cost ratio is of this subset of members versus your average?", "Stephen Hemsley", "We are not going to provide cost ratios with respect to that, but we will give a sense of other.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Hi, Sean. It's Dan Schumacher. Your question, assuming its oriented towards the large customers, right, because if you look into our fully insured offering down market, we have full and total pull through of all Optum care, disease management, pharmacy clinical analytics, data and so forth in managing those population. So looking up market, the UnitedHealthcare national accounts block, we have about a third of them have pharmacy through OptumRx, so two-thirds represent an opportunity for us as an enterprise. As you think about the other services, the vast majority of them have care management, disease management and other engagement routines through Optum. So the only one where we have less penetration is around pharmacy.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Then on the on the last piece of it, Sean, the only thing I might comment is, is that when you take a look at the across the cohort of clients and then take a look at the clients that really embrace the kind of the more maximum of the offerings that we have from both UnitedHealthcare and from Optum, those clients tend to actually have performance levels that are superior. So when a client is progressively lean towards the more modern approaches that we are offering, as Dan and Jeff have described before in terms of designs, engagements of the consumer, the clinical programs to the use of the high performing networks that are incentive-based, incentives on both ends, their performance from a cost trend point of view, from a satisfaction point of view tend to be stronger.", "Next question please.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.", "Ana Gupte", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So one question I had was, there is obviously angst around MLR, but you are reaffirming your guidance. Have you any thoughts or suggestions for the street around how the seasonal variation should be looked at now with exchanges, with MA, any other changes in one small group and so on?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I really don't think so. I really think the question really comes round mix and it is really more the mix of the membership from where the growth does come from and the higher care ratio category. I really think it's as simple as that.", "Ana Gupte", "And then just a follow-up on that question. On the small-group, which is becoming ACA compliant from 50 to 100, how do you see that playing out for 2016? And may be if there is early renewals we had some volatility last year, what are you seeing in the marketplace? Might that actually create more stability or would the risk pool estimation might there be any issues?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Jeff?", "Jeff Alter", "Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. What we are preparing for and expecting is very similar to what happened in the fourth quarter of 2013 when there was transitional relief in some early renewal programs for two to 50 block. We assume that will happen again this year in the 51 to 99 and we are ready for it. We are geared up with products and other offerings to serve what those clients might want to do when transitional relief for early renewal programs are offered.", "Ana Gupte", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So maybe perhaps one more question. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our final question from Tom Carroll from Stifel.", "Tom Carroll", "Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So somewhat related to Josh's question, with all the action, if you will, in the managed care space, do you think that employee benefit consultants and brokers may give United a stronger look into 2016 than they might otherwise? And maybe conversely asking another way, are you guys perhaps being any more proactive with these sales sources and highlighting your focus relative to others into next year? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think I can address that. First of all, as we said, we are not going to comment on market dynamics that are driven by anything other than the prevailing market dynamics. Always looking for more value, always looking for more innovation and so forth. And I really do believe the momentum of our business has been advancing our capabilities, have been advancing and we are engaging the market as productively as we ever have been. And we are continuing to focus on that, serving customers and really responding to them and we are seeing some of that in the results in terms of retention, the response to our offerings, the broader penetration of offerings to customers. We are just going to keep on that. And I think that's the best response. We have been on it. We are going to continue to stay on it. And I think the market has been in flux and looking for value and so we are just going to stay on it.", "So with that, we will conclude. Thank you for your questions this morning. As always, this interaction is helpful in framing or speaking around information we offer you and we do our Investor Conference. That will be coming up again in New York City on December 1. So we would ask you to hold that date on your calendars and we will make sure that that is a substantive engagement for all of you.", "And to wrap up, through the first half of 2015, UnitedHealth Group. Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered an advance in momentum and strong growth in revenues, in earnings, in cash flows and the number of people and customers we serve and we expect this growth to continue and accelerate in 2016 and beyond. As I said, we remain focused on further improving service, cultivating and expanding our capabilities and market positions, introducing practical innovations and the potential to make healthcare work even better. So thank you and we will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's program.

Please go ahead.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's third quarter results. Our business continues to grow as we develop in respond to large and emerging market opportunities across both the healthcare benefits and services sectors. Healthcare markets worldwide continued to evolve with nations and market participants of all types seeking to build better healthcare systems that are more informed and modern, lower cost simpler and more responsive to consumers. Organizations throughout healthcare are searching for ways to improve by leveraging data and information to more effectively deliver quality care that is measurable and delivered with greater precision and consistency in response to ever increasing pressures around costs, access in transparency. We have consciously positioned UnitedHeathcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group to deliver practical innovation and significant value in this environment.", "UnitedHealth Group's third quarter revenues grew 26.6% year-over-year to $41.5 billion, including strong 10% organic revenue growth across our businesses. Consolidated net earnings of $1.65 per share were in line with our expectations as was the net earnings margin which decreased by just over 1% year-over-year reflecting the greater mix of pharmacy care services as well as early stage lower margin individual exchange business, lower levels of reserve development and accelerated investments and improving medicare stars quality principally closing gaps in care for the seniors we serve.", "Year-to-date, we have grown net earnings per share by 14% on revenue growth of 17%. Our return on equity of 19% reflects the balance sheets of capital and organic initiatives to build our business. Quarter end days claims payable increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. And cash flows from operations continued to be strong at more than 170% of net income this quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows of $6.2 billion have grown by 11% and represented a strong 135% of [indiscernible] income for the nine-month period.", "I'll ask Larry Renfro to provide a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and from UnitedHealth Group Enterprise comments. Larry, you want to take?", "Larry Renfro", "Thanks, Steve. Optum continues to innovate, to address rising market needs particularly those of larger more sophisticated organization which have complex health, care service deliver and management challenges. Our businesses are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. ", "Optum's revenues of $19.3 billion, grew 61% year-over-year this quarter. Our results include Catamaran within OptumRx results for the first time and reflect exceptional overall organic revenue growth of 15%. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues by more than $1 billion or 25% year-over-year to more than $5 billion this quarter.", "Third quarter operating margin of 5.9% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues as well as integration in intangible amortization costs related to Catamaran. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight delivered double-digit percentage operating margins in the [indiscernible]. We continue to focus on the opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets. Clinical care, pharmacy care services, information and technology solutions, government services, and international.", "Our one Optum approach means we build strong, strategic and senior enterprise-level relationships that transcend individual product categories and point solutions. We start by listening closely to our clients, so we understand the issues from their perspectives. We then bring deep experience, creativity strategic partnerships in our own differentiated capabilities in healthcare combined with responsive and practical operational solutions. This can lead to working sessions which often lead to pipeline, backlog in revenue and earnings. ", "Optum360 is a good case in point. It has grown to 7500 employees, serving 1600 hospitals, and is helping manage more than $50 billion of their billings. Just last week, customers surveyed by the Black Book a leading research organization ranked Optum360 offerings as the best in the three key product categories for the sector, and we are still in the early stages as hospitals and health systems shift to professionally managed revenue approaches. ", "Domestically and in other nations, we are in discussions with high profile healthcare organizations regarding our wide range of technology and information enabled services. We are exploring significant opportunities to serve the healthcare needs of U.S. Federal Government program and talking with prominent healthcare organizations about innovative technology infrastructure and application services and a comprehensive suite of technology enabled payor services. Any one or more of these has potential to develop into a multiyear multibillion-dollar strategic relationship. Across Optum, this type of proactive approach is driving positive results.", "Third quarter backlog OptumInsight exceeds $10 billion in value and grew 34% year-over-year on an external basis. Our pipeline is continuing to grow at an exceptional rate as well. The median deal size for OptumHealth is doubled over the past three years. We are delivering more care to more people, to the more payors at Optum Care. We now deliver care to more than 7 million people annually through our Optum Care businesses. Market interest in OptumRX continues to grow in response to the value we can drive through more integrated downstream drug benefit and care management efforts, especially around the growing specialty and pharmaceutical segment.", "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has authorized agencies under its purview to conduct innovative healthcare research with Optum Labs, using Optum Labs big data resources. These indicators should help give you a sense of both our continuing progress and the meaningful opportunities we're developing. We will continue to execute on the details for our clients, with a focus on quality and service and further build our growing reputation for being the trusted partner that gets the job done. We are optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. ", "Now let me turn it over to Dave.", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. United healthcare continues to differentiate its products on the foundations of distinctive quality, service, innovation and value. As a result, UnitedHealthcare has grown domestically to serve nearly 300,000 more people in the third quarter, 1.5 million more people this year, and nearly 1.7 million more people over the past 12 months. We'll enter 2016 with even more distinctive products, capabilities and relationships, and we expect to continue to deliver impressive levels of growth next year as well. ", "UnitedHealthcare's third quarter revenues of $32.8 billion grew year-over-year by $2.8 billion or 9.2%, all organic. The UnitedHealthcare operating margin of 5.7% decreased as expected, declining just over 1% year-over-year due to lower levels of reserve development, solid growth in early-stage, lower margin public insurance exchange products, and increased investments in Medicare Stars quality. We continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points likely above the mid-point of that range based on our year-to-date experience.", "The annual care ratio is being modestly affected by the performance of our new public exchange benefit programs which now served nearly 550,000 people. Like others we observe market-wide data this past spring that suggested the risk pool served by public exchanges would require more medical services than original expectations. Rather than wait for our own experience with our new members to fully developed, we increased rates and repositioned certain products market by market for 2016, and we expect improved performance next year. We will expand to 11 new markets in 2016, and we continue to expect exchanges to develop and mature over time into a strong viable growth market for us.", "We've accelerated the uptake of our medical care quality programs to achieve star ratings beyond the strongly improved levels that the CMS recently published for payment year 2017. Our Medicare stars improvement does come with a related increase in medical costs. We are confident. We have implemented the necessary steps to achieve our goal of 80% or more of our members in four-star or greater programs by payment year 2018. Star quality improvements will strengthen our reimbursement rates in 2016, 2017, and 2018, in which are Medicare advantage program's benefit offerings and further our growth and financial position.", "Our 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full year forecast. In total, UnitedHealthcare has maintained nearly 6% operating margin year-to-date in 2015, identical to the year-to-date margin at this point in 2014. [Driven] by year-to-date organic revenue growth of more than $9 billion UnitedHealthcare has advanced earnings from operations by $540 million which is a growth rate of more than 10%. All three of our benefits businesses are producing strong results. ", "Let's turn a review of a couple examples that illustrate how we worked locally and use technology to serve the two most important participants in healthcare, the doctor and the patients. We are increasingly aligned with physicians and hospitals, and we continue on our course to deliver $65 billion or more in care annually by 2018 through value-based care contracts. Today these programs touch as many of 13 million of our consumers delivered in part through more than 650 accountable care arrangements. This includes growth of more than 160 new accountable care arrangements so far this year alone. In many instances, these care providers and UnitedHealthcare bring in Optum to help and manage population risk and improve operational performance on a more systematic organization-wide basis.", "Larry has given you a feel for how this trend positively affects demand for Optum's services. Let me give you a few more examples. Together with Optum, we are also supporting physicians' operational needs with Link which we have discussed before. Link is a cloud based digital platform that provides secure workspace and connectivity between physician offices and health plans, enabling them to efficiently communicate and transact business. By year-end 2015, Link will be serving more than 600,000 physicians nationwide. We offer them connectivity to 75 distinct dedicated applications relevant to their operations. We continue to grow both the installed customer base and the portfolio of applications and capabilities. Our ability to fully serve physicians practices with core transactions and information exchange as well as scheduling referral processes, transparency, and other services.", "On the patient side with Optum, we increasingly focus on the local community and deliver care and services in people's homes. You have heard about our house call program in Medicare, and we have begun using it in targeted commercial and Medicaid patient situations as well. The more than 1 million house calls, our physicians and nurse practitioners will execute this year increases our medical spend upfront. They encourage people to get annual care visits with our physician, appropriate vaccinations, and so on. The benefits are substantial. We have more satisfied consumers with better healthcare quality, and we protect them from potentially higher medical costs down the road. Consumer satisfaction and retention are significantly strengthened by the house calls experience.", "At the community level, we have hundreds of community health workers on the ground, helping address the root causes of healthcare issues for Medicaid members with complex medical conditions. We meet with them in their homes and help them access the health and social services they need to better manage their health. This includes addressing housing, employment, access to healthy food and nutrition as well as transportation and other public support services. Again UnitedHealthcare is improving the quality and consumer satisfaction while helping to reduce exposure to potentially higher costs from untreated or undertreated conditions.", "Our people are also on-site in hospitals, helping with discharge and follow-up care planning. They are in physicians' offices helping address gaps in care and documenting Medicare quality compliance. And they are on the phone and on the web treating every interaction as an opportunity to add value for the consumer by helping them understand the actions they need to take to improve their health.", "You can see the benefit programs in approaches like these in our results. Growth in local commercial markets, where our efforts to be more local are having a positive effect, distinguished and ongoing growth in service to large self-funded employers who are among the most informed and discriminating in assessing service, quality, innovation and total value. Consistent Medicaid awards from States which focused on elements of quality, service, and total value in their valuation process. In just the past few weeks, we have been honored to be selected by the State of Michigan and the State of Texas for program expansions, and we recently finalized our commitments to serve the [state of IOLA] as a culmination of their award process.", "And our Medicare stars quality is sharply higher for 2016 and 2017. Thanks to our employees and the strong performance of the care providers who have worked collaboratively with us to better serve seniors. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace, profitably improving its market share as a direct result of the quality, consumer satisfaction, and total value we deliver.", "Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Considering together both the positives and pressures of the first nine months of this year, we continued to expect our full year 2015 results will fall within the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share, and we would remind you that that range absorbs $0.10 per share for Catamaran and compares favorably with our original outlook of $6 to $6.25 per share. We continue to expect a further lift in the rate of earnings per share growth in 2016. The range of street estimates for the next year it's quite wide and we expect to be within that range, but not surprisingly, we would begin in a more conservative posture or range as we have in prior years. We were the first specific questions on 2016 financial performance to December 1, when we host our Annual Investor Conference in New York.", "Let me turn it back to Steve.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, Dave. So Larry and Dave had given some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value, throughout the broad healthcare system and to grow. You heard some of our touch tones in their comments, relationships, built around for us collaboration and mutual respect for the challenges in delivering healthcare improving it, and making it simpler for the people involved. Innovation, developing products and processes that truly help people solve real problems, and then embedding and driving these ideas to scale quickly to improve the overall system. Quality measured by health consumers, physicians and other customers to find it and feel it. Responsive and compassionate service which goes in hand-in-hand with quality and defines peoples' healthcare experience, our aspiration is to serve others on their terms not ours.", "Satisfaction and value which together capture how well you bring all these elements together to help people in differentiated ways. We believe executing well on these elements at scale with nearly 200,000 dedicated people pulling in the same direction will make a difference for those we serve and drive distinctive sustaining growth across our enterprise.", "Thank you for your interest this morning. And now operator, can we now take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We ask you to limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Peter Costa", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. Can you clarify a couple things, you said about the cost trend, that you said, cost trend would be at the lower end of the guidance range of 5% to 6%, then you said MLR would be above the mid-point of the guidance range. I assume that the difference there is the spend on Medicare star scores, can you talk about how much you're spending on Medicare star scores in the MLR component, and what exactly the impact there is to you guys?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I don't think we're going to get quite that granular, but I think we can respond to that as kind of in themes and maybe between Dave and Dan.", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. Pete, I think you are right that the cost trend commentary around the commercial cost trend to be on the lower end of the 5.5% to 6.5% range. The MLR is expected to be about the mid-point, and you're right it's because of the impact of spending more on Medicare stars, which is substantive in the quarter as well as for the full year. I think you saw the results of some of our earlier efforts in our 2017 funding year, and what we're really focused on right now is, making sure that we continue to improve upon that, so that the 2018 funding year is at that 80% four star or higher level across the board if not higher. We also have -- as you know, we have gone our government services mix quite a bit in our business, and that is across Medicaid, Medicare as we kind of group in the insurance exchange into that as well, and those things have a tendency based upon based mix to biased that MLR up just a bit as well.", "Peter Costa", "And how should we think about that going forward into 2016?", "Dave Wichmann", "Going forward in 2016, we continue to expect strong growth across all components of the UnitedHealthcare business as well as Optum, influencing the MLR, I think we'll see strikingly better performance on the insurance exchange business, not only because of expansion, but also because improvements in the overall MLR and operating cost structure of that program, so it's about both. I think you'll continue to see strong growth in both Medicare and Medicaid which will put some pressure on that as well, but I would expect this to continue to go nicely in those two categories as well.", "Stephen Hemsley ", "But growth in those categories, so growth in government programs, exchanges and so forth, even middle-market tend to come at slightly lower margin, so you're seeing that blend effect in these results.", "Larry Renfro", "And we'll spend more time with you on that at Investor Conference, Peter.", "Peter Costa", "Great. And just, did the underpayment of this quarter's impact this quarter at all?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, they do not.", "Peter Costa", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes, maybe if I can just continue of the discussion on the ACA exchanges. Can you help us understand the elements make you confident that you're going get strikingly better? I think you said, performance on the ACA exchanges next year. I mean -- and maybe there is a good, maybe this is bad, I don't know, but you have these co-ops sailing the largest in the New York market, I assume that. You may take up a lot or you may want to take up a lot of membership from that and you have price increases. But it's unclear what the mix of membership is going to be next year with regard to health status. So can you just talk to that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Okay, I'll let Dan and Jeff kind of comment on it, Dan.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, Matt. Good morning.", "Matthew Borsch", "Good morning.", "Dan Schumacher", "So, with regard to the exchanges and some of the Dave's earlier comments, so in the first half year, this year, we got industry data that suggested that the underlying use of medical services in that population was high and higher than we thought, and the good news is we use that information as the foundation for our 2016 pricing. So we put in strong price increases. Average increases across the country are in the double-digits, and we also took steps to eliminate some products and reposition other products. So as we look at our exchange business for 2016, that really speaks to Dave's comments about why we expect to see very nice improvement year-over-year. As it relates to our 2015 experience and our own block of business and what we're seeing, in the first half of this year, we did not see much in the way of medical use, so we had much less used as members rolled on for the first four months of the year, and they started to connected to coverage and care and so forth, and we've seen an increase in that, and so why we're calling it out, we called it out in the context of mixed in the second quarter, in the third quarter we're calling it out more specifically because on the year we expect the individual exchange business to put pressure on the consolidated care ratio. However as Dave mentioned, we fully expect to perform within the range of the guidance we provided last December at the Investor Conference.", "Matthew Borsch", "Dan, thank you. That was great. I'll get off now, I know you have a lot of people.", "Dan Schumacher", "Thanks, Matt.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Josh Raskin", "Thanks. Just a follow-up on the MA star investments. You know, talking about an overall MLR of this year is going to be above the mid-point. Every 10 basis points, as I know, $130 million, $140 million of investment on the full year, so I don't know, what that implies, but that seems like pretty big investment. So the two questions, one, are these sort of temporary in nature, are they just impacting '15, are we going to see this continue into 2016, i.e. could this be a possible tailwind for next year? And then, how do you think about the ROI? What are you measuring? Are you just measuring simply the bonus? You have the reimbursement improvements and how do we think about sort of the cost versus -- the investment versus the upside from these investments?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. So I guess somewhat globally, I'd offer that the investments are significant and we have made that clear in the past, and our goal to really get 80% or better of our overall Medicare at four stars and above. There is also benefits associated with that because when you're achieving that level you have flexibility with benefits and the reimbursements are better, so there is a -- and we're probably fund any more of the investments and we're getting the benefits at this point in time given the fact we were somewhat coming from behind if you will in terms of the overall star performance. Dan or Steve, do you want to comment further.", "Dan Schumacher", "Josh to your question around, do we expect levels to maintain, yes, we do. We expect to make comfortable investments forward in our stars and quality performance. And as you saw in the '17 payment data, we saw nice progress. In the year, our performance for '15 is improving which will carry forward to improvement in 2018 performance, but beyond the stars outcome, we also have outcomes in terms of quality and performance underneath that, as you look at medical cost and so forth that contribute. So those are some of things living that play in and how we look at the balance between the cost and the return.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And given the look back nature of this market hasn't really seen our best performance in terms stars so we really haven't gotten the benefit part of that yet, Steve.", "Steve Nelson", "Okay. Josh, it's Steve Nelson. Good morning. Hey, just a little more color on the investments, so when people talk about the medical cost, you can think about things like provider incentives, annual care visits, impact of very specific programs like diabetic navigators, and in terms of diabetic programs for that population. In terms of administrative investment, it's around things like that embedded practice support. We have 2,000 clinicians that are focused on closing gaps of care locally, and then we aren't orienting our organization like call centers to facilitate closure of gaps and getting people to the right care. So these are all paying great dividends for our members. We have 1.7 million members that are in improved plans of -- it's a great progress, but as Steve and Dave have both noted, we're not done. With the progress, we're not satisfied and look to improve on that, our 2018 theme here to at least 80% of the members in the four star plans or higher.", "Josh Raskin", "And just a follow-up, does that translate into above market level MA growth rates for you guys? You've been growing sort of -- let's call it in line with market this year. Should we think '16 and maybe more or so in '17 and '18 that you start growing faster than the overall MA market?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think that would our hope. If you sit back and send a return on investment, I think this is a vital program. We think it has great growth potential in terms of the demographics as well as the orientation of Medicare itself to be more towards Medicare advantage, so this gives us opportunities with respect to benefits and I think it should translate to greater growth and that's why we're making those investments here.", "Josh Raskin", "Alright, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. SG&A was a bright point in the quarter came in better than consensus expectation. And now that Catamaran is closed, how should we think about run rate SG&A, I think guidance was pre-Catamaran at 17% plus or minus 30 basis points?", "Larry Renfro", "Well, we are always managing our SG&A as tightly and appropriately as possible, but we're also making investments that are often embedded in SG&A investments in terms of some integration of the businesses as well as things that Dave mentioned such as Link and elements such as [indiscernible]. Do you want to start?", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. Sarah, you're right that the Catamaran was probably the most significant influence on the care ratio in the quarter. We also had to increase productivity impacts on that as well, and then it's offset somewhat by the business mix as you can see from the growth from Optum as well as in our fee base programs, and there is a little bit of an insurer fee offset as well. We do expect Catamaran overall had pulled down that ratio by somewhere around 180 basis points or so in the quarter, so we would expect that kind of a trend to continue as it relates to Catamaran, but we would continue to expect some offset of that related to continued high growth in our services business over time.", "Sarah James", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities U.S.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Thanks very much. And once again nice, very nice job on navigating through the various sundry challenges. One of the things that intrigued me was the commentary about the opportunity being both domestic and international. And if I read your press release correctly, it looks like your healthcare global which we don't focus on all that much has actually a nice year-over-year growth rate. So in the context of great change occurring not only U.S. in terms of payment methods and industry structure, but also overseas in Europe for example. I'm wondering, if we'd likely to see some renewed interest in that given that your [mill] experiment has now got some time under it. And your thoughts on the potential for international to be a new growth area or expanded growth area for United.", "Stephen Hemsley", "It's a great question and we clearly are focused on international and the opportunities to really bring principally services to [bear] there. Larry, do you want to take it?", "Larry Renfro", "Hey, Sheryl. Let me start by saying, if you look to add the way that we're positioning ourselves and -- I think I mentioned this earlier the five, what I'll call future growth area as you'd find international, and you will also find that international pretty much wrap around most of the products that we offer in the state. We obviously are working in Brazil to support a mill, and we have people on the ground, and we're building the Optum presence there, and that's going extremely well. We're starting to really take a look, and I think I can talk about it somewhat at the U.K. We've been there for a while, but at this point time, we're trying to look at some of the things that we've done with Optum360, and how that is working in the States, and a lot of the challenges that are being experienced in the U.K., we seem to be setting a pretty good spot to at least assess and have conversations and try to determine you know if we fit, so it's early innings in terms of these discussions and what we're trying to do, but we do see a future there. And we think that some of the experience we had in healthcare.gov will actually apply, and so we're kind of off and running at this point in time.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it's fair to say that even the best healthcare systems are interested in using information, developing better measures to improve quality and performance in those really are a sweet spot for Optum. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael Baker", "Yes, thanks a lot. Given that we're in unprecedented time on the M&A front, I was wondering, if you could point to any tangible benefits that you've seen so far or what you would expect to see as the process of review continues?", "Stephen Hemsley", "As we kind of intimated in our last teleconference with you, we really are not going to comment on the transactions of others. I would say, they're going through, I'm presenting, a regulatory review process, and so we haven't really seen any real activity in the marketplace that we could offer any commentary on.", "Michael Baker", "Alright, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "And we'll next to David Windley with Jefferies.", "David Windley", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if you would be willing to comment on the client reaction that you have observed or experienced since the Catamaran closure or in and around the Catamaran closure. What has been your retention rate or just kind of sense of retention there? And then secondly, also with Catamaran are you commenting or willing to comment on the reset to your long-term margin goals with the change in mix that Catamaran brings into Optum? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think it's a pretty positive story. Do you want to start, Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. Well, I thought that I'll start and then I'm going to hand it off to Mark too because he is dealing with this on a day-to-day. What I would say is, we believe that -- our message is resonating with our client. Now we do have very sophisticated knowledgeable and successful clients, and that's actually a positive, and as we have really gone out discussed our value proposition, really talking about enhanced services, talking about operational efficiency, purchasing scale as well as synchronization. I think across the board, we're really feeling pretty good and think we have started off with a solid, solid start. So Mark maybe some comments?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah. Thanks Larry. David, good morning. Well, we spent the last 90 days on an airplane. And as Larry and I've visited really all our largest clients as you'd expect, and that includes health plans, employers. We visited the consultant marketplace. And I have to tell you the reaction has been universally positive. I mean our clients like the scale of this combination. They like the fact that we've had a 10-year relationship and that really basically represent no conversion risk in terms of platform conversion. They especially liked the fact that we've got a very expanded service offering with the full suite of Optum services and many of them have been looking at and in fact buying those services along the way anyway, and so I like the fact that we've got a good team and the same teams in place and we continue to take care of them and obviously they are liking our value proposition, so we're feeling pretty good about client reactions. And I'd say overall my early read is things are looking good. I'll just go on to say that, the integration work is off and running, and the first 90 days have been very [crisp], we're off to a good start in bolting these businesses together.", "David Windley", "Very good. Thank you. And does this change your margin, Larry, your margin goal long-term?", "Larry Renfro", "Maybe I could offer a perspective on that. With a portfolio of margins across the expanse of our total business, and so different products and services will actually drive different margins and appropriately. So we have some businesses that are strong double-digits and we have businesses that are low single-digits and we're looking to drive and expand margin, but do it in appropriate ways -- appropriate ways meaning, we're driving value and consistency, we're driving productivity that doesn't really compromise service and so forth. So as these elements come into our total portfolio across UnitedHealth Group, they are certainly going to change the mix of that margin, but in total, we're driving towards appropriately expanding margins, and so as these elements come in they are just going to change the mix, they are not really going to influence the performance of the business.", "David Windley", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next please.", "Operator", "We'll go to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Andy Schenker", "Thanks. So I appreciate you on the first specifics on 2016 financial performance at the Analyst Day, but you've already mentioned several, sounds like to, tailwinds including Medicare and exchanges for next year, so maybe if you could just discuss in summary of these broad headwinds and any tailwinds for 2016. That would be helpful. Thank you.", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. We look at some things that we sit back and -- when you really do the pluses and minuses of it, some of the things that are headwinds now turned to be tailwinds, and new of versions of them appears headwinds. So for example, I think, our year one market -- for our year one markets for exchanges will actually be a positive for next year, but we are moving them to 11 new markets, and so we will have to see how those markets will play out. I think our advances in stars is a positive, but as Steve indicated, we have clear aspirations, ambitions to improve our stars performance, so that we will continue to be working on that level as well.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think OptumRx will have integration benefits, but they will also have integration costs, so I think those kinds of things start to play out. I think our Brazil performance is strengthening, but that markets stability is something we're watching closely. I think there will be some -- we are getting nice growth in List and Medicaid and we have some new successes there, but we are going to have to implement them and just given the total performance, we seeing rate pressures across Medicaid. So we try to take somewhat measured look as we kind of set our outlook for next year that we have a portfolio of these pluses and minuses, but in total we very much like where our business is in the growing capabilities. The deployment across the expanse of the markets tend to even out these pluses and minuses, so we're pretty optimistic about next year, and as Dave indicated, we're looking to accelerate our earnings growth rate.", "Andy Schenker", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Chris Ray with Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Chris Ray", "Hey, good morning. Just wondering, can you give us a sense for how Catamaran impacted the quarter whether it was dilutive, accretive, neutral, and then just some specifics around the integration costs in what the intangible amortization related to the [indiscernible] in the quarter? Thanks.", "Dave Wichmann", "So Catamaran contributed nicely to the quarter to achieve what expectations we had for it and similarly the cost associated with initial integration activities were consistent with what our expectations were as well. Maybe I can give you specifics about how it contributed, the one thing that we did do, is we suspended our share repurchase, so that had a negative effect, and for the full year as we indicated earlier, we expect that would cost us about $0.10 a share all in, but we were able to manage to overcome that and retain -- and continue to advance our guidance as well. In terms of the increased levels of amortization, it's about somewhere around $0.20 a year, think about it in that context, and we're on a base of about a run rate of UnitedHealth Group somewhere around $0.34 a year, so combined, maybe thinking after 2016, our run rate basis around $0.54 of amortization for year.", "Chris Ray", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A.J. Rice", "Yes, thanks. Maybe following up on a little bit on that last question. Two things on the buyback upfront obviously, you'd laid out a plant with Catamaran, is there any update on that plant [indiscernible] related to next year and there is a volatility of the markets sway that in any way you think is better opportunities, so there may be a quick way to come back and buy stock more aggressively, and then just with the comment on the amortization, there will be a bigger disparity with these pending deals complete on the year reporting GAAP, EPS and everyone else reporting cash EPS, any thoughts about that and maybe changing that?", "Dave Wichmann", "Sure. So, Dan, maybe you want to take the first one, I'll take second.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. On the buyback front, what we'd indicated is that that would reduce the level of buybacks for about 18 months or so, and we expect to continue to maintain that reduced level through the end of next year, think about it. And our target is to get somewhere around 40% liquidity ratio, that's not hard and fast, of course, we're going to continue to pursue M&A opportunities and of course if we would need to step up our share repurchase activities because of some kind of market events or otherwise, I think we have the flexibility to do so. So there is nothing kind of hard and fast about the way in which we operate that we manage our capital structure effectively over time.", "Stephen Hemsley", "But we're generally on a course towards a 40% total debt to total cap rate.", "Dan Schumacher", "And then in terms of the kind of supplemental [indiscernible] earnings, I think will address that at the Investor Conference coming up and we'll likely begin to provide the supplemental information with respect to how we would perform on both basis. ", "A.J. Rice", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay. Great, thanks. So I don't know whether I'm just spoiled or what, but you guys mentioned how you beat number and [raise] guidance a few times earlier this year. So I was a little bit surprised that there wasn't more upside in the quarter or around the guidance? And I understand the dynamics around high exchange MLR and stars investment, but these are things that you largely would have anticipated probably at the beginning of the year in a very least, when you reported Q2 results and provided a guidance back then, so I'm just trying to figure out, if there is something that you would point to that didn't quite work out the way that you were thinking heading into Q3 report or some of that, that you're worried about into Q4? I personally keep coming back to trend because you start out with -- I know you guys provided guidance, [I assume] kind of rise back to normal, so you startup providing guidance, then you are at the lower end of the range and now you're reiterating at the lower end of the range, so does that imply that trend is in fact rising, has it gone through the year because that combined with the lack of it into your development makes me wonder if there is something underneath there. So I guess answer that specifically and if I'm embarking up the longer tree, if there is anything else you might highlight as a headwind.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, again I might respond fanatically. First of all, I think if you take a look at our year-to-date performance, it actually is a pretty solid performance, [indiscernible] top line growth and strong translation of that to bottom-line performance. I think we maintain a healthy respect for medical cost trends, and I think as we indicated before, the medical costs within our expectations. Our patient continues to be strong and robust and growing. Specialty pharma continues to be strong. We haven't really talked much about that this morning, but none of those things have gone away, so we remain respectful of medical costs, and also the fact that they have been moderate for quite some time, and I don't know if you can assume, we do not assume for pricing that they will stay that way. I think as Dan indicated, as we got into the exchanges have we were thoughtful about making sure that as we price for next year that we used kind of the broader industry experience as opposed to our own because we really had a pretty favorable experience in the first half of the year in terms of the exchanges and they have matured kind of more in line with the industry. Is that right, Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yes. I think that's fair.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Because you might point to that and you know continuing to be watchful of that. We continue to make investments in -- so Medicare stars is a look back process, so really the results that you're seeing are really the results of prior periods and we have intensified our efforts to make sure that we are really going to be a market leader with respect to stars, that's what we had indicated before, so we continue to make investments there in things like that, and we're going to continue that. Things like that, we mentioned, Medicaid and Medicaid expansions, continued rate pressures there, so I think we have to be respectful of all those elements in and the strong performance we're achieving, and then I think that's why we're kind of measured with respect to keeping our outlook the same and being serious about a range when we do, but also being very optimistic about where we see our business in the fact that we expect to grow even more strongly than we did this year. So I just think it's being measured and trying to be responsible about all the elements that play into our business", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay, so that makes sense. You're being conservative, you're still optimistic. I guess, one, I don't know, way to clarification. So I think last quarter, you talked about, how you thought the United's earnings might accelerate on a core basis. Is that still the message, that you're giving now? You'd mentioned a lot of puts and takes earlier on. I just wasn't sure if they all sum up to the core business is accelerating over the last changed at all?", "Dave Wichmann", "Yeah, we did and we basically very much said that and said that in terms as we're expecting our earnings per share and so forth to grow at a fast rate next year than this year.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Wieland", "Thank you very much. So my question is on ICD10, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the quarter for Optum? And over the past couple weeks, have you seen any changes in denial rates? And then on a go forward basis what is ICD10 doing to your business in Optum?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, Bill, do you want to comment that Bill Miller.", "Bill Miller", "Yeah, Sean. I'll talk to you on behalf for Optum. Particularly where a lot of those services sit in terms of helping health systems, payors go through the changes with respect ICD10 particularly on and understand we're in this for a few weeks here, but already we're seeing a certain uptake in a lot of our services and a lot of our products and a lot of our content as the market is preparing and now acting in response to the changes, and so there is some seasonality in the back half of our business, and it's being enhanced. I think we can see that in the numbers in terms of the uptake of our content in the back half of the year. So overall, from a services perspective, delivering value to the clients, ICD10 has been a lift for Optum across the board.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dirk, do you want to comment on the [indiscernible] question?", "Dirk McMahon", "Yeah, sure. You know from an operational standpoint, overall the implementation is going pretty smoothly, but what I caution is they were only 15 days into that. Having said that, we spend years, getting our systems ready, working them with the provider community to ensure success. The overwhelming majority providers in the marketplace are submitting claims consistent with the ICD10 requirements. Our claim submission rate so far consistent with expectations, and for those limited number of providers we're having difficulty. We're able to identify [them] and get after them quickly, so that they submit consistent with requirements, so far so good.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Sean Wieland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next one would be Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Gary Taylor", "Hey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, just two quick ones. First, would you guys quantify where you health exchange enrolment is today?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "550,000 lives.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay. And the 11 new markets for next year, I guess we don't know what markets those are or the size. Can you give us a sense of magnitude of -- you get the same sort of share, what type of growth that might have on the 550,000?", "Dan Schumacher", "We're not really giving guidance out for next year until our Investor Conference, so I really wouldn't want to kind of shoot from the hip on this. We do expect -- we'll grow and we've taken some of the learning from this year as we have kind of entered those markets, but I think we're going to save guidance with respect to specifics on next year for our Investor Conference.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay, great. One more quick one, if I could. When we look at your statutory filings through the first half and understanding all the vagaries and nuances, we do see a very compelling trend in the commercial business, that I think ties with your comments around the commercial cost trend expecting to be lower end of that trend, but it did look like Medicare and Medicaid MLRs deteriorated somewhat in the 2Q. So I don't know if you'd be willing to offer any specific commentary on the product basis?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, I don't know, if you can comment on it.", "Dan Schumacher", "I would tell you that, there are meaningful differences between our GAAP financials and our statutory financials and now how those get reported and how they flow through over time. So from my perspective, I wouldn't read through anything on statutory statements specifically.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Next will be [Ralph Jacoby with Citi].", "Ralph Jacoby", "Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the stars spending, I guess when did that spending star, was it disproportionate and I guess to the third quarter. And your commentary about it sort of sustaining, I guess, into next year. Is it sort of the level off or could it be lower where the initial spend is higher in this quarter, having more sort of magnified impact. And then I guess, why not quantify this spend in that area to sort of help on kind of understanding more of 'core', and then similar sort of your last answer to the question, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about MLR trends by end market? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, do you want to comment?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, Ralph. On the star spend, I would tell you that we have been making investments. We really started in the 2014 timeframe in the middle of that year, and then we have increased that in 2015. And I would tell you, in the relationship between the second and the third quarter as an example. So we put programs in place and what we had mentioned is that, we've seen an acceleration in the take up, so we had the programs in place, we had an expected outcome for it, and frankly we're having more people that are accepting house calls that are getting annual care business as Steve Nelson mentioned. And part of that's due to our service model, so we've been taking that interaction point and really trying to leverage it and help facilitate connecting people to care, and that's showing up, and also we have member and provider incentives and those burn into the market, we're seeing the take up rates on those increase. So we have spending in '14, we increased it in '15 and we have seen an acceleration in the take up rate as we moved from the first half into the second half of the year.", "In terms of the sizing maybe one way to help orient your thinking around it, as you'd looked at our consolidated medical care ratio on a year-over-year basis. There is a couple of things that contributed to that. You can obviously see the change in development as one element, stars and quality investment is another element, and mix as a third is kind of the three principal drivers. And in terms of the share in contribution to it within a reasonable range on each of those, so that gives you some sense for the kind of sizing on it. And we expect the investments to carry into 2016 and we're seeing nice progress on our performance in 2015 which will lend itself to better star outcomes for 2018 payment year. And on exchange steps your blunt commentary.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "And we'll next to Ana Gupte with Leerink.", "Ana Gupte", "Thanks for taking my question, good morning. I was wondering what the directional trends were for the commercial [launch] ratio this quarter? I know you see utilization [indiscernible] which is great, but when you combine that with the overall pricing environment and then the balancing out with mixture of things small group exchanges and the likes?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan, Jeff?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. As you look at care ratios, Ana, in the quarter, we saw an increase in our care ratios, in our principle health benefits businesses, so our Medicare, Medicaid and commercial, and then offsetting that as we talked about kind of the full year theme in the Investor Conference. We're seeing improvement in international offsetting that sound, so directionally up.", "Ana Gupte", "And then going into 2016, as you say, some of the headwinds [get turned] and become tailwinds. What does this look like from a pricing perspective specifically overall? And then in the New York market, their small group definition is now being changed to only 50 and below, how does that impacted? And also finally with [indiscernible] not being fully reimbursed, [indiscernible], do you see a better pricing environment with plans that could have lost money like the blues or [lots of profit]?", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it's a couple minutes to sort out that four dimensional question, but Jeff, do you want it?", "Jeff Alter", "Hey, Ana, it's Jeff Alter, good morning. I'll try to answer it in a sort of general term. We said last quarter, and I think we see it continuing, the market is firming a little bit on pricing. For our pricing in '16 as Steve said, we are respectful of the slow trend environment, perhaps changing. I think we took very prudent actions in the pricing that we have for our individual exchanges for '16 as Dan mentioned. We have not changed our forward pricing philosophy. We are very discipline about that, but also respectful of trending outpatient, specialty drugs, new drugs coming to market. So our pricing, I think is strong for '16. New York market, kind of your question around 2250 to 299 New York will be a 2299 market as well a couple other states. We have assumed, our thoughts for our growing growth for the rest of this year and for next year that there would be some transitional relief, so that the change last week really isn't much of the surprise to us because we're already preparing for a large part to that market to go through some transitional [relief], so our pricing in '16 is in alignment with the change in the law last week.", "Ana Gupte", "Alright. Thanks so much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please. We'll take maybe two more.", "Operator", "And we'll take the next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Christine Arnold", "Hey there. I'd like to put the focus a little bit to Optum. You said that you were seeing some interest in innovative services by Federal Government, and this seems like a pretty big opportunity as well as in some international markets. It's always struck me that the fee-for-service Medicare program doesn't have a lot and we have care coordination and from the other things that Optum provides, might there be an interest in that in terms of the Optum capabilities, the fee-for-service Medicare population. And if not, I'm thinking about that incorrectly, how should I be thinking about that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Larry, you want to comment?", "Larry Renfro", "Christine, I think you're spot on in terms of what we're trying to do with the Federal Government. And as you know, we've had some involvement with CMS in previous programs and so forth with where Optum has been involved on healthcare.gov. And as we are putting our programs together, we're constantly working with them and talking about the different services, the different data analytics, and it really pretty much everything that Optum has to offer. So your suggestion is a good one, one we know about and one that we're actually working on. You know these are large RFPs as you can imagine. We're pretty much aware of how they work and when they're going to be coming down the road, but I think we're fully engaged and understand what we need to do, and we're better positioned today than we might have been in the past because of the situation that we had with healthcare.gov, we kind of stepped out of that now, and that was one of the reasons that we did it, so we would play in more of the RFPs.", "Stephen Hemsley", "But Medicare would be a department of the Federal Employee Benefit Plan, State Programs, and then Larry commented on kind of the international versions of all of the above. I think all those are going to the areas that are going to try to improve performance, and that Optum is perfectly positioned for that.", "Christine Arnold", "And with respect to timing, should we be thinking about that as something we see in the next year or is this something that takes five years? I just don't have good sense for your workings of the government.", "Dave Wichmann", "I think that some of the areas that Steve just talked about, there is different timing, there is some that's deal within the next, I would six months, but some of them could go out two years, so it's a variety of situations. When the RFPs are [due], but as I would comment on it, I think I kind of said is, we have a lot of people, we don't have an organization, it's dedicated to the government business Dr. Steve said, whether it would be state or federal, and it could also include the VA and what we're doing DoD, so it's not just like a set time that I could give you, but I would say that, if we looked at our qualified pipeline in terms of how we're looking at the business that is somewhere we're staying around $20 billion and a substantial piece of that would fall in the government business.", "Christine Arnold", "Great. Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "One last question please.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Tom Carroll", "Hey guys, good morning. So do you believe that the market and particularly large self-insured employers perhaps will give United a stronger look than usual if there is such a thing in 2016 as your large competitors are involved in some pretty sizable M&A?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I would hope they would give us a look because of the values that we deliver and the quality and consistency of our services and the breadth of the things that we bring. And I would say also the innovative dynamic, we are well-known for being in the forefront of innovation. And we have really compelling cost structures and probably deeper into in more diverse and care management to the commentary this morning. So I would hope that they would be looking at us for those elements, and then good if they're concerned about other dynamics in the marketplace I can't comment on that, but I would hope it is for the former and so I would kind of leave it at that. I do think the marketplace will be strong and robust in the next couple years. Jeff, do you agree?", "Jeff Alter", "Yes, Steve. Just reminder, we already served an overwhelming majority of that marketplace and I think the value that Steve described is seen by those clients today and we hope that that reputation continues to help us grow into the marketplace that we don't currently in.", "Dave Wichmann", "I think we're looking at a strong national outlook for next year.", "Stephen Hemsley", "As we mentioned in the last call, our '16 national account season has progressed very nicely towards the end right now, and we'd see a better '16 season in '15, which was better than '14, so the momentum and trajectory is something that we're very pleased with.", "Tom Carroll", "Great. Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "So thank you. We are pleased to have delivered good performance year-to-date. We'll continue to improve the quality of our products and services as our last commentary. And we remain optimistic about 2016, and look forward to sharing more information with you about the future of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare at our Investor Conference on December 1. So thank you for your attention today.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December Investor Conference with fourth adjusted earnings per share at $1.40 brining full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished with strong fourth quarter growth exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets.", "Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015.", "2015 UnitedHealth Group revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. United Healthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%.", "Excluding the impact of individual exchange compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase again absent those items to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.", "We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business to well more than a 175 billion of it is driving considerably stronger and better position than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth, in financial results and in the quality of our services and net promoter score or NPS performance metrics.", "2016 is off to a strong start considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum\u2019s revenue backlog and pipelines have never been stronger. Medical cost in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected and we are confident, our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016.", "Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I will ask Larry Renfro to review Optum\u2019s performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise live comments. Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "Thanks Steve . 2015 was without question an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth. And then our preparations to setup 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve.", "Optum\u2019s businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the one Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year.", "In 2015, Optum\u2019s revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42%, including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion and even excluding the Catamaran combination posted solid double digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion which is growth of 24% over 2014.", "Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increase mix of pharmacy care services revenues drive by OptumRx organic growth in five months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016.", "In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio which now numbers 10 and we\u2019ve remained focused on developing more of those comprehensive large scale relationships. They leverage Optum\u2019s unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges, customers and prospects are facing in a changing healthcare environment whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers.", "To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health where cash flows have already improved by $1.5 billion and accounts are being settled before eight days faster and where are documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Our consider OptumCare, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve seven million patients to more than a 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers.", "MedExpress operates at the conversions of healthcare and retail measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients receive in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates cost for both payers and consumers while providing high quality convenient care.", "We currently operate over a 160 neighborhood care centers with a goal of operating several multiples of that number five years from now. Today there are OptumCare clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets having recently added pro health in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high performance practice portfolio.", "Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The OptumCare approach, we expect local market norms and expectations and our doctors consistently deliver a high quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around the acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than three quarters of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rates four starts or better and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to workers.", "For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver on average a 50% reduction in overall healthcare cost for medically complex patients with very high patient and family satisfaction. A number of OptumCare\u2019s high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance and council care initiatives including Monarch in Southern California and ProHEALTH in New York metro area.", "And finally, our healthcare services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than one million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016.", "With the market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect OptumCare will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we care other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum\u2019s growing diversification such as our military and veteran\u2019s health services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should say with even more clarity a pattern immerging. The application of data, technology and services to bring better performance helping health systems work better for everyone.", "Today revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quite rubbled over the last three years. In 2015, the average customer awards has doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx, we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Common health organizations continued to enquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these parings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year.", "Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight\u2019s full year projected 2016 revenues. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion which would be growth in the area of 20% and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion.", "Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated operating earnings outlook.", "Now let me turn it over to Dave.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong, sustainable growth.", "UnitedHealthcare new serves 46.4 million medical members and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America.", "Over the past five years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40% well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects the delivery of diversification and consisting competiveness of our offerings globally.", "UnitedHealthcare continued to strength in 2015 growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as they continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margins of 5.1% decreased as expected declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at a low end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost trends reflect a positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals grew value based relationships and improving data collection and application.", "We are equally pleased with immerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement in healthcare. Today 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their healthcare decision making and are more satisfied.", "Today over 23 million consumers have joined our Rally Digital Health applications and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services. Including importantly engagement around selecting primary care physicians better used of urging care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes has been deployed to accounts representing one million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional half million committed for the first half of 2016.", "The initial results are encouraging with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the Nation Institutive Health. Give these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest.", "Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.", "Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we help close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017 as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a four star plan and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more.", "It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors and Medicare Advantage and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth.", "In commercial benefits, we combine cheered networks, our clinical strategies, an innovative product designs in ways to align to a wider rate of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today one third of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That\u2019s double the number from five years ago. And we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next five years aiding to our exceptional growth.", "In Medicaid, over the past two years, we are secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Manage Medicaid continues to immerge as the ultimate long terms sustaining solution for states and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities.", "Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in community and state.", "Turning to exchanges, we expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate.", "As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our Investor Conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. 245 million of that charge addresses 2016\u2019s exchange compliant product exposure. This is an addition to the unreserved losses including in our 2016 outlook combined more than $1.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we are fully captured 2016 exposure, now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extend if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.", "In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Hawaii has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plans which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market.", "As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally UnitedHealthcare is emerging across the spectrum of consumer driven products, service, wellness, transparency and most important care engagement and clinical quality particularly in government programs.", "We have room to improve but we sharp focused on NPS and the quality of the work we do in a cultured centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers are like in the coming years. Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole.", "We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generating and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flow is approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analysts community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment.", "All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year. Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, Dave.

On the customer side, we are committed to further elevating satisfaction for consumers, care providers and all our stakeholders to levels more often seen outside our industries to better meet the increasing expectations people and society have for healthcare.", "When our net promoters scores reflect people being staunch advocates for our products and businesses because of the way we make their simpler and the value we provide as they define and experience it as consumers and customers will be on the path creating truly distinctive and substantial growth and brand equity.", "We believe a differentiated brand and reputation will drive accelerated growth in market share for our businesses for years to come. Our goal for serving you as investors in 2016 is simple. We are committed to delivering clean, strong results this year back by a growing pipeline of opportunities for 2017 and beyond.

And operator, can we take some question this morning. One per analyst, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes, hi, good morning. Could you just talk about what the factors were that caused you take increase your booking for anticipated losses in 2016. I guess maybe, I think it was 45 million higher on the exchange side and 20 million higher on the Medicaid contract, if I got that right?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yes, you do. And it\u2019s really just purely updating and I think Dan Schumacher can take you through that.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matthew Borsch", "Good morning.", "Dan Schumacher", "So, you are right. We did increase our loss expectations for 2016. And when it came to really as we closed out the year, we took - we took a prudent past year on the \u201815 impact and then we carried that through to 2016 outlook and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016, so those are the elements that played into the increase in both the \u201815 impact and the assumed losses for \u201816 in the individual exchange compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid potion, that\u2019s simple, just a function of a higher enrollment expectation as the number of carries was reduced from four down to three. But when you put that all together in total as we close the year, it was about a $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December and -", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay.", "Dan Schumacher", "So our base business, the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out \u201815. And then as we look to \u201816, we\u2019ve incorporated that again fully into our outlook as we reaffirm out guidance for \u201816.", "Matthew Borsch", "And if I could just one related question, in the four quarter on individual enrollment, I think your total book is about 1.2 million, how did that change as a result of the maybe in - at the end of the year and then coming into this year as a result of the coop insolvencies and related instability in the individual market?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, and I think the last time we talked, we talked about our individual exchange compliant being about 700,000 of that 1.2 million you\u2019ve referenced. As we closed out the year, that came in at about 650,000 lines and then we\u2019ll expect that to grow as we step into January and then it will start to shrink again over the course of the year as some of those enrollment, and will these trade out.", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And that we just say is kind of an overarching flats and our goal is in this area is to be careful conservative and to make sure that we really capture all this, so that we really do have the rest \u201816.", "Next question please.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Josh Raskin", "Hi thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little about Medicare Advantage another CMS data is relatively preliminary but certainly seems like you guys are well on page to beat the 400,000 for the full year at the high end. So just curious, you know doesn\u2019t sound you got much star improvement this year, so what made your products more attractive, is it more retention, is it you know more agents or coming from other plans, just any color on where this is - where the growth is coming from?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. It is good growth as Dave indicated, but Steve Nelson can really respond to that and it is a very positive story.", "Steve Nelson", "Thanks Steve. Hi Josh, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. Yes, very positive about the growth that we are seeing coming through the AP and it\u2019s little inside into that growth. First, it\u2019s important to remember that it comes as a result of and after a couple year of really hard work as we repositioned this product to some of that change in Medicare Advantage program introduced premiums, created a more aligned engaged network and relationships with our providers and meaningful improvement in stars as you mentioned. And you know second, we really like where the growth is coming from and so I think Dave mentioned in his comments about 300,000 or so as a result of AP, about third of that comes from Group, so really inside into that pricing in that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to this growth.", "And this is membership that you know we\u2019ve been engaged with and they\u2019ve been involved in our clinical programs. And it\u2019s very evenly spread across geography and products, but the stability of our products, the evolution of our portfolio is really resonating in the market. And so that\u2019s all contributes to the growth and we expect this as a Medicare Advantage product to continue to grow as we look to 2017 and beyond.", "Josh Raskin", "And Steve just a quick follow-up on that, do you have a percentage of how many are coming from previously not in MA whether that\u2019s agents or tradition people service versus how many are coming from other plans competing plans?", "Steve Nelson", "It\u2019s a little early to give that kind of color but I would say in general in terms of how we look at the membership, it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.", "Andy Schenker", "Hey, thanks. Maybe just going back to the exchange enrollment real quickly, just a few on the membership, maybe if you could talk a little bit about how your positioning or membership growth compared to the existing states versus the 11 new states you entered and then relates that obviously still a little over week left in enrollment, just how your - you know what kind of forecast you are expecting for total enrollment, I assume you are trying to - you assume there is a big jump in the last week or two but just how we should think about that you know 700,000 related to expectation last two weeks? Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, good morning, Andy. So on the exchange enrollment specifically, the 700,000 as Dave mentioned beginning January, we ended the year with just about 500,000 so that jumped up to about 700,000 as of one-one. We\u2019d expect that over the balance of the open enrollment period to grow something underneath about - to about 800,000, something a little sound of that. And then we would expect that to where off as you pace through the year as those members trade out.", "In terms of the where it\u2019s coming from, I would tell you that the net growth in coming with a greater orientation toward those new states as well as expansion areas but a little bit of mix of both.", "Andy Schenker", "Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Okay, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Ray with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Chris Ray", "Good morning. Thanks. Just on the last question, I got a little confused with the numbers, Dan just on the 800,000 versus 700,000, 500,000 ending the year and 650ish thousand now, can you just confirm, did you end the year 650,000 or was it 500,000?", "And then my real question with regard to all of this, do you know how many the people that have currently signed up were enrolled with you guys last year versus new membership? Thanks a lot.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. So just to be clear, we ended - we ended the year with 650,000 lives in individual exchange compliant offerings, inside of that 500,000 of them were on exchange. So the balance 150,000 was off exchange. And then as we step into January that exchange component which ended the year about 500 grows to about 700 and then as you move towards the end of the open enrollment period, it grows further up towards 800,000 something sound of that and then works it straight down over the year. The off exchange is more level than what we experience in the on exchange.", "And then to your last question about mix of enrollment, more than half of the enrollment is new to us and a little less than half of the enrollment is existing enrollment base.", "Chris Ray", "Right, thanks a lot.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, next please.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A.J. Rice", "Hi everybody. Just might ask, focus my question on Medicaid, both, do you update your membership with one player dropping out and eye was had enough move the needle, I guess we\u2019ve had some companies comment on concern about profitability in Medicaid year-to-year, can you give us a play over there? And then finally on that the health insure the question for 2017, if you got an clarity from CMS where as it relates to either Medicaid or Medicare and how they are going to treat that, those dates I guess?", "Stephen Hemsley", "That is quite an impressive single question A.J. so we\u2019ll break that up into pieces and we\u2019ll start with Austin on Medicaid.", "Austin Pittman", "Sure. So hey, A.J. this is Austin, how are you?", "A.J. Rice", "Good.", "Austin Pittman", "Right, so first of all, I think you\u2019re asking about Iowa. We did increase our membership outlook and assumptions for Iowa as the state moves from four players to three. As far as the sustainability, the program, I think first of all as we state of four, we are really honored to been selected to serve the people of Iowa. We continued to be - feel good about the relationship that we develop at the state. We\u2019re in very productive conversation with them about really tried in true methods to ensure long term stability. And so we feel good about where that\u2019s headed and it will become a long term and very durable part of our portfolio.", "And with regard to the rates overall, as you know states are always pressured, there is nothing new in that. I think we are very pleased with our business, most pleased with the value that we\u2019ve been able bring the customers into the consumer over the years. We\u2019ve got a very strong management team, very locally deployed, enable to manage these populations and really help people in very vulnerable situations and then deliver value for the long term. So I think we feel good about pressured but stable rate environment and the growth in this market.", "A.J. Rice", "And that\u2019s been really distinctive in terms of the rate environments, the same pressures that exist every year.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Absolutely, yeah. Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. A.J. it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. On the health insurers tax, you know, we miss if I didn\u2019t mention that, from our perspective obviously the tax just increases the underlying cost of healthcare and as a result makes healthcare less affordable. So as we look at the elimination of it for 2017, we are certainly encouraged by that and frankly we\u2019ve been long support, you know that\u2019s permanent repeal. Now with that said, I\u2019ll tell you in terms of the impact, in Medicaid, we expected to be no impact. In the commercial business because that\u2019s prices on a policy year basis and the tax is living on a calendar year basis. There is no impact over three years but there are some differences by year and we expect it actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings. We\u2019ve estimated that impact to be about a $100 million pretax or about $0.06 earnings per share.", "And then lastly the Medicare of business, the tax has not been part of the rate setting process previously, so we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be for 2017 either.", "A.J. Rice", "Okay.", "Stephen Hemsley", "That pressure is covered in our guidance. We basically observe that in our guidance given the strength of the start of the year. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Great, thanks. Just go back to the exchanges. I guess if we shift the premium does it from 2015 as of 2016, are you saying that you expect to lose more money on exchanges in 2016 than either in 2015 and if so why would that be the case I guess you had a chance to price up the core business?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, I\u2019ll have Dan answer this, but I think as a matter of prudence, what we are doing is making sure that we have covered ourselves appropriately in \u201816, so that means we set aside more money between the reserve that have set aside and what we have covered it within our guidance that it\u2019s clearly out purpose. We are really focused on making sure that this item is really covered at \u201816 and so I think that\u2019s what you should read through in terms of our activity. Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So if you move the premium deficiency reserve and reset the years and look at it, you know on the individual exchange compliant plans within \u201815, we launched about $475 million on the \u201815 policy year. And the \u201816 policy year as Dave Wichmann had mentioned, we\u2019ll lose more than $500 million. So, and we\u2019ve got about a 10% increase in the loss assumption balance against about a 25% to 30% growth assumption in the underlying enrollment base. And the reason that we\u2019re able to do that is to the points that you mentioned, obviously we came in with very strong pricing, you know that mid-double-digits. And further we\u2019ve made some strong refinements to our product portfolio, those are the largest contributors. But beyond that, we\u2019re also working every single data, the tuner operating environment as well as focus our clinical interventions in our network orientation around this population.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "I guess you are saying is the loss of be in - and then you mentioned like path that goes to be new states and new geographies, is that - is that why that the losses, is that why have loss is really at all going up or do you think that the core business is actually getting get worse as well?", "Dan Schumacher", "No, I think it\u2019s going up because we got enrollment growth and then balanced against that is our pricing, our product positioning, our clinical interventions, our operating environment and then improvements we\u2019re making there.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And I might point out that, this is what we are providing, we are being careful in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve covered this off. These are not losses that we are sustaining these are but we have protected ourselves against in terms of \u201816.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Costa", "Thanks for the question. Previously you said that you are expecting $0.13 to $0.15 or 200 to 225 million of additional losses from the exchange business in 2016, it seems like that grew a little bit, and you talked about over half a billion now in losses including the $245 million PDR. But my question gets to you know if that\u2019s the right number, the $0.13 to $0.15 and maybe correct me if I am wrong, that would be you know say $0.14 at the midpoint added to your the midpoint of your 760 to 780 guidance, so let\u2019s call that $7.84 of potential earnings, that\u2019s only 12% growth from the $7 number that you have excluding those the individual business item, yet last year you grew 16% to get to that $7 in terms of earnings, which of your core businesses is the one responsible for the slowdown from 16% to 12%?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well you know Peter, those are projected numbers. We would think that we could perform even more strongly. So I think that by just isolating that against a beginning of the year range may not be a fair comparison in comparing your 16 to 12. Actually as we take a look across our spectrum of businesses, we really don\u2019t see any of these businesses in a position that they are actually, I would say they are all stronger than they were as we - compared to this time last year as we entered clearly across the board in Optum. The strength of the portfolio from one end to the other has advanced. And in terms of UnitedHealthcare, I think all those businesses have strengthen the - and I think are positioning on the exchange has strengthen. So I think my view on this is that is a pretty positive outlook.", "Peter Costa", "The 15%, you are telling, the difference between the 16% and the 12% then it\u2019s PPD but perhaps is that what you would say?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No, I am not sure you can, it might be - take that one element and then project against estimated earnings range as we go out, we could be even stronger than that.", "Peter Costa", "Okay.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.", "Gary Taylor", "Hi good morning. This is question for Larry I think. When we look at Optum inside, operating income was up a $200 million sequentially, same case last year was up about a $100 million sequentially in the four quarter. Can you just remind us the source of the seasonality in the operating income for OptumInsight, please?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think we\u2019ll Larry kind of give you some sense of the growth of momentum there and then respond to that specific question.", "Larry Renfro", "Garry, it\u2019s Larry. I think that you\u2019ve seen over the last few years that the fourth quarter is obviously a dominant quarter for us that will stay that way. If I had to break it down, I\u2019ll give you three areas to think about. Lot of time since beginning of the year, we\u2019re making investments and those investments payoff in the fourth quarter and you see a little bit of that happening, we\u2019re also in implementation mode they are in the year and those implementation then installations also come true in the four quarter and that enables us to obviously have a stronger position at that point.", "When you look at the products and services, there are specific products like obviously distribution that goes along with open enrolment but also our pay for performance and incentives will also hit in the fourth quarter. So we don\u2019t see that changing, we see that being the pattern that Optum in general will be experiencing.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold", "Thank you. Impressive increase in backlog for OptumInsight, can you remind us if you gave us some parameters Investor Day, how to translate that into expected revenue overtime? Thanks.", "John Rex", "Sure. Christine, it\u2019s John Rex, good morning. Yeah, when you thing about the backlog $10.4 billion backlog you\u2019ve seen inside some of the guidance points that we provided on that. You should expect about 60% of that to be recognized in the 2016 revenues so that equates about 80% of the full year revenue outlook. Another way to look at that is that the average duration of the backlog runs about 20 months. And these are being fairly consistent numbers and I expect that could be fairly consistent as you look ahead also.", "Larry Renfro", "So Christine, it\u2019s Larry. One think I would add to what John said is that as of now about 90% of our 2016 revenue is locked in, obviously that\u2019s part of the backlog.", "Christine Arnold", "Okay, perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. I just have one quick follow-up here before my question is, so you\u2019d mentioned earlier that there are conversations with States Medicaid rates are tried in true methods that insurance stability, is that mean, I am wondering this is referencing changes in the risk adjustment methodology that can redo some premium get backs or are you talking about our aspects of tried in two methods?", "Austin Pittman", "So, this is Austin. Really I was talking about a whole portfolio of method, so you can think about care coordination, network management, the level of transparency that we address, the rates and immerging experience overtime with States. And so you could narrow it down any one, we get a very long term history of 20 and 30 year relationship, so a lot of success in how we work with States and so that\u2019s what let us to feel so confident and comfortable with where we do with Iowa and really with our whole portfolio States.", "Sarah James", "Got it. And just I know some of your peers are trying to get those risk adjustment seems back, is that was an indication that United where those well but it sounds like based on other aspects that you are negotiating right?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t comment any further in - any further detail about the specifics of any conversation with any State.", "Sarah James", "Got it. Then in the past you\u2019ve talked about opportunities for growth on Medicaid outside RFP cycle like States assigning our PSS or covering in other products, do you still see that as a possibility and is there anything near term?", "Stephen Hemsley", "So, let me comment on the pipeline overall which I think is very strong. You know States continue to move and look to managed care as solutions for their healthcare needs and that movement continues as States have really embraced this. I think that activity, in fact I think we expect to respond to over 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented in \u201816, \u201817 and on into \u201818. So again when I say the pipeline is strong, it\u2019s very strong. That\u2019s heavily weighted towards more complex population, so that\u2019s really what you are talking about when you speak to LTSS and the movement of those complex populations from fee for service and to managed Medicaid, we\u2019ve got one of the largest books business, in that space we\u2019ve got a very long history at dealing with these very vulnerable people and delivering real value to those individual, so - as well as value to the States.", "So I think we feel and Dave mentioned it in the opening comments, I think uniquely positioned between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to really serve these populations and help them live healthier lives year-over-year and deliver value back to the States and the process. So I think our outlook for that continued movement even within States where we\u2019re already providing traditional tenant population managed care to continue grew into those complex populations.", "Sarah James", "Thank you.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho U.S.A.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Thanks so much. First let me step back, I mean against the backdrop of a somewhat challenging situation that exchanges, let me in this stand fall complement everyone from UHC to Optum to senior management the way you performed and handled during 2015. I am impressed by especially the fact that somewhere I sit that privacy made with the cost structure as well as positioning the business. I remember United having a better cost structure, better positioning going into a growth year in a very long time if ever than you\u2019ve go now.", "So let me ask a question about one of those things that interesting to me that you performed well on which is the cash flow. It\u2019s I guess multi, part one, why the strength; two, does this change in anyway your thoughts around share repurchases versus deleveraging versus investments in the business for 2016; and three, you know if you are going to - it seems like 2016 guidance is perhaps a little bit more conservative, it\u2019s not a little modest on the cash flow, and I was just wondering what you think might change?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Dave will touch on beginning of that and then we\u2019ll get into the share buyback, invest, et cetera as part two.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Sheryl. First thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year particularly in the last half of the year to get this cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond.", "Our cash flows were exceptionally strong I think you know from past calls and discussions that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re very, very, very focused on cash flows and in particular managing balance sheet elements of our business and the strength of the cash flows are the departure from what our original expectations where really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying it early. So just better working capital management and really contributed to that.", "As it relates to within what our priorities are for that is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we are going to continue to maintain a very balance posture with respect to those things. Obviously it\u2019s important that we continue to deliver the business as we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is that our expectations that will continue to curtail our share repurchases at least for 2016, you know less extreme circumstances arise but for 2016 to about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash use. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that\u2019s underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor and new capabilities organically in our business but also through quested means.", "As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, it\u2019s certain jumping off about $9.7 billion cash flow year with stronger earnings expectations for 2016, you would expect would achieve higher cash flows. And as a result, we used language of $9.5 to $10 billion in cash flows are now taking closer to $10 billion. And we\u2019ll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether not we can push that number forward. But clearly the business is operating well from the balance sheet management perspective, we\u2019ll do all we can do to move that the cash flow number forward.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Excellent, thank you so much.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.", "Scott Fidel", "Thanks. I just had a one follow-up first on the exchanges. At the Investor Day, I know you talked about assuming around negative a 15% margin in the exchanges, just as you work through sort of the updated math is, is that still how we should be thinking about that or sort of different relative to that number?", "And then just a follow-up question, just interested outside of the exchange just on the membership front, how membership ended up developing for the rest of the commercial risk business for the 2016 enrollment period most notably in the small group segment? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. We\u2019ll let Dan comment on the first on the first and then Jeff also kind of speak to the business in \u201816.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Scott. So where we landed on a policy year basis as we closed our 2014, our policy year losses on the exchanges were in that mid-double-digit rate, mid-teens range that we talked about in the Investor Conference, so 15%, 16%. And if you look at 2016 on a policy year basis, we expect that to moderate some, we\u2019d be into the low-double digits from a margin percentage basis with higher enrollment base, lower percentage margin losses again on those things that I talked about earlier, so the strength of our pricing, the repositioning of our product portfolio and then our management efforts underneath that. So hopefully that provide the sense for what you are looking for and then Jeff on the enrollment.", "Jeff Alter", "Sure. Good morning, Scott. This is Jeff Alter. So we closed out \u201815 with very strong growth across both our fully insured and sub-funded product. I would say driving a good part of that was increase retention of our existing clients in certain markets we saw the market come back to our pricing particularly in small group. We also had the opportunity to win back a very large part of the health republic small group block in New York in our rates. And as you recall, from early \u201814 one of our headwinds was that health republic pricing against our small group block in New York, so we were in position to win that back during the four quarter of \u201815, which is good.", "We also couple with very strong specialty sales, our vision in dental products are selling really well. And I think it plays to sort of our value in the market place, our strong brand, our consisting pricing and the ability for the folks to take advantage of our you know increasing innovation in the market place, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the healthcare system a little simple for our members. So we\u2019re encouraged by the growth that we had over the last 18 months, we see that momentum continuing as we paced into \u201816 and feel good about what that will deliver in \u201816 and \u201816 and beyond for our shareholders and our members.", "Scott Fidel", "Okay, thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Pretty positive and so many we\u2019ll just take two more questions and then as you know John and Brett will available through the course of the day for the - for questions and any other areas of interest. So maybe two more questions, please.", "Operator", "And we can take our first question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi Group. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Jacoby", "Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to cash flow, again seemed even stronger than usual. Are you holding back claims at all with ICD10 implementation and maybe just generally speaking, are you seeing any impact at this point from sort of coding in a QD perspective relative to your expectations? Thanks.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Not at all, but I\u2019ll let Dave handle that and others who want to comment on coding. But that - those are not issues at all. Dave?", "David Wichmann", "I am sure what to add to that. Not at all, those are not issues at all. No, this is just purely really more refined cash flow management principals across the company. The enterprise is doing well and really managing cash flows. Obviously the performance of the business stands, exchanges is strong and then we coupled out with the balance sheet management. We are not holding claims or doing anything other than paying them in accordance with contractual terms, it\u2019s part of the value that comes from more integrated UnitedHealth Group then what we\u2019ve experienced in the past with more fragmented healthcare platforms or claims education platforms as we continue to move towards a common set of technologies, working more closely with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of strong cash flow.", "Stephen Hemsley", "And on in terms of ICD10, maybe we\u2019ll go real quick to UnitedHealthcare as it relates to them and then flip to Optum and talk about more broadly the industry and what we are seeing.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Ralph, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. From an ICD10 standpoint, there is really nothing to update from the Investor Conference and my comments there, the reality is we are paying tens of millions of claims in the ICD10 that code set. And as you look inbound volumes, rejection rates, auto adjudication rates, throughputs, ending inventory all the way through that process stream, I would tell you all of that is in line. And so there is nothing getting hung up, nothing getting slow down. In today\u2019s point really around the cash flow, it really comes down to just managing better to contract terms as well have more of our business on common platforms which allows us to do those kinds of offsets.", "Stephen Hemsley", "In terms of OptumInsight, sure, I always - we believe we have an extremely strong product line that were offering that\u2019s increasing productivity and results and I\u2019ll ask John Prince to comment on that.", "John Prince", "I think Ralph in terms of ICD10, we\u2019ve been backed within that and preparing ICD10 for years. In terms of working for our customers, we\u2019ve actually had great results. One of the products that have the results of that compares to the coding, we\u2019ve actually had a very distinctive product in the market and the customers have used have actually have seen a significant increase in production versus traditional products to the market.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks you, so one last question, please.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "Yes, thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Peter\u2019s question and your response around. What I thought, I heard this was upside to your guidance for 2016 and I am just looking at although the things that have developed we\u2019ve got a week through season, you pull forward even more losses from exchange in Medicaid, pricing looks pretty good, your reason stays stable have gone year-over-year by three days, your star membership rebalancing looks good as well and special enrolment period is maybe a tailwind, are there any headwinds are missing or should we think that there could be a upside to your consolidated carry show in your margins, that\u2019s your projecting to \u201816?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well that is an excellent list, I am not sure I could have done better myself. You know I just think it is the 19th of January, I think we should be careful in terms of how we discussing our results, we have to truly work through the balance of our exchange, we do think we have reserve for it and consider that appropriately into our \u201816 numbers. And as I said it\u2019s the 19th of January and I think that we should you know more forward thoughtfully and prudently in our business. So I think those are the factors.", "In terms of headwinds, I think we said before we have less than before but we clearly have to play out the year and that\u2019s what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the market place to continue advance our business, continue to innovate, you know continue diversify across both the platform of UnitedHealthcare and Optum and kind of that\u2019s our focus. I think we are always endower to try to perform better, but I think our guidance right now is very appropriate range and I am assuming you\u2019ve taken some of the input in terms of how the quarters might play out from our commentary in our teleconference. So", "I think we\u2019ll end up with that. And once again I\u2019ll thank you joining us today and I\u2019ll leave with few closing thoughts kind of as businesses, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we think really advanced their capabilities significantly in 2015 and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased as we talked about over 20% and our dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year as our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically growing virtually in every market that we serve and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%.", "In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this grow trend and carried into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and creating real value for customers and consumers on their terms. We remained committed to delivering clean, strong financial result as I said for our shareholders this year with a growing pipeline of future opportunities.", "So we appreciate your interest today. This concludes our call and as I said John and Brett will be available through the course of the day. We thank you for your attention. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Operator", "Good morning. I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016.", "UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation and steadily rising net promoter scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, a must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance and sustainability in health benefits and health services.", "When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet.", "Turning to the results, we are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior-year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter; the medical days claims payable increased four days year over year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion or 1.4 times net income continued at a strong and reliable pace.", "First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year over year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect it will add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company.", "First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year over year and our full-year revenue and per-share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained our regular public dialog with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable in these markets.", "The smaller overall market size and shorter-term higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care.", "With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group comments. Larry?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "Thanks, Steve.", "Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our Investor Conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business.", "Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the healthcare system.", "Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year over year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion, while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015.", "Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past two quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. As you may know, we identified five drivers for Optum's growth over the next five years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services, and international. Last quarter we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics.", "Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back from 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably most complex business in-sourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery.", "As you know now, it has been a real success. Last year we took another step, our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance of scale and today the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solution for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient centered data analytics, new capabilities in specialty pharma such as home infusion and workplace related resources.", "Since we came together our retention rates have persisted in the high 90%s and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens to which we are creating a 90 day at retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful more collaborative way.", "We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers including $30 billion in specialty drug spending.", "Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits and has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and healthcare overall. The impact OptumRx has on healthcare and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of healthcare, one that provides great visibility into the full healthcare continuum. An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes.", "That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology enabled approach can save in excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit.", "In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health systems.", "Our second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in healthcare data science and analytics. Companies new to the space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will vault healthcare into a new age. For Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on.", "Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data. We can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical and administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail.", "Our health data resources continued to grow securely and responsibly every day. Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers. And ultimately, the millions of consumers they serve translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost.", "Today, we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis, and positive benefits of big data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams.", "Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in healthcare because healthcare is all that we do. Healthcare technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of healthcare transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date useful information that makes the healthcare system more intelligent and enables it to act that way.", "Now, let me turn it over to Dave.", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Larry.", "As we open 2016, UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues. Strong new customer growth and historically high retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation, and integrated clinical and network value.", "People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care provider-friendly mobile technologies.", "Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed competitive cost trends, physician and consumer engagement, and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans that help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions.", "Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year.", "Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small groups, middle-market businesses, and individuals.", "Turning to exchanges, as we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional $125 million in full-year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range. And as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017.", "In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership, and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors.", "Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits, and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate, and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped close 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve. And we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a four-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more.", "We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We've pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership and the new product potential via a modest acquisition in the first quarter. Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December. And we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017.", "Switching to Medicaid, managed care serves as the most effective proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability along with the ability of managed care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs.", "The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral, and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address state's needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in two California counties and across our community and state business the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter.", "Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual.", "Strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion.", "As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased.", "Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates after recognition of our first quarter performance would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year.", "Turning to capital, we closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels and we will see our dividend levels \u2013 we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.", "Steve?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Dave.", "Today we are in a strong position at a unique moment in time. We have the opportunity to considerably elevate our performance around quality and customer satisfaction, delivering greater value and driving unparalleled organic growth across our entire franchise. While remaining as always disciplined on pricing and cost management.", "We are focused on delivering higher quality at every touch point with every customer and consumer, doing this well elevates customer trust and loyalty, loyalty that becomes the foundation for an extended period of growth benefiting consumers, society and shareholders. We're intensely focused on this agenda and expect it will produce strong clean results in 2016 and a positive view of opportunities in 2017 and the decade to come.", "So thank you for your interest today. And operator, could we please open for questions, again one per analyst please this morning. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And we can take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for the question, nice quarter. Can you explain to me a little more about what's going on with the individual exchange business? You've given us a lot of information, but it sounded like you said $125 million added to reserves, so that would be like $0.08 of earnings pressure this quarter, and I think you talked about only $0.15 of earnings pressure for the whole year previously. So I'm trying to understand whether that was all earnings pressure this quarter or was that coming out of the PDR? What's the PDR value today on the balance sheet, maybe would help.", "And finally, how does the withdrawals at the various state levels impact what you're doing with Harken Health?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So let me go with the \u2013 so I'll have Dan respond to the first part of this, I'll just indicate that Harken is a small and interesting innovation that we are considering and we will stay with it, again it's in a very modest pilot position. So it really doesn't affect our review of this in terms of the way we're thinking about our positioning on exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We will be down to, again, a handful of states that we will be actively participating in the exchange. Dan, why don't you just give them the overall baseline in terms of the exchange P&L outlook?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Sure. Good morning, Peter.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So let me \u2013 why don't I recap what we shared with you in our prior conversations and then talk specifically about what we're updating today. So in January we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy year loss was $475 million, and that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point was estimated at $525 million. Today we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials and not surprisingly our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter.", "As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically, and I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse, so we are being appropriately cautious in updating our full year outlook and recognizing that additional $125 million in the first quarter financial results.", "In the month of June, importantly, we will have a first indication of how our risk scores actually compare to the industry and we will look forward to updating you further at that time with regard to our individual ACA business. Thank you.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's really helpful. And then how much is the PDR value exactly now?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "It's bigger.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "What we're trying to convey is that we added $125 million to the quarter and added for the full year. So the PDR has increased. We weren't going to get into the exact amount of the PDR in this morning's. Maybe we can take that off line through the course of the day.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. I was hoping you could help us understand the prior year reserve development figure, how that breaks out? It's obviously a lot larger than what you had a year ago. How do we think about that benefiting or not benefiting the first quarter earnings? And if you can just give us any detail on where that came from?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Dave, you want to handle that?", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Thank you, Matt, for the question. The prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2016 advanced explicitly by about $220 million or so, and that on a comparative quarter basis. That influenced our MLR favorably in the quarter as well as our EPS as well. The development, although I won't get into the specifics of how that's broken out by line of business, it was pretty broad reaching across all of our lines of business, and really is reflective of what we experienced in the fourth quarter as well, which is the delayed realization of affordability efforts and end market initiatives that we pursued in UnitedHealthcare in the back half of 2015. So we're very pleased with how our trends are developing consistent with the forecast that we provided you before and obviously this is a favorable development in the quarter.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And last year's first quarter was actually unusually low. Dan, do you have anything else to respond?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "No, the only thing I'd highlight is just add a little bit more color on some of the things that are contributing. As we look at trying to drive greater value for customers and consumers that we serve, some of the areas not surprisingly we've talked to you about at length in the past, our focus on inpatient management is ever present, 2015 marked our seventh consecutive year of absolute reductions in both admissions and bed days on a per capita basis and that's true across all of our lines of business. But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient because it's one of the bigger drivers of cost and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and likewise looking at out-of-network spend. So there's some context, Matt, on some of the things that we're looking at. And as you look at the contribution to the quarter, I would tell you the change in the development, the majority of that, was P&L impacting to your question.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think if you look over...", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "If you look over the last four years you'd say this quarter was more normal and that last year would be more of a low outlier. Next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Larry, you're very good at boiling things down to bullet point lists. I wondered if, in this data analytics conversation, you could talk about the audiences that are consuming your technology in data analytics and I'm interested in the breadth there, and perhaps where you see the most significant untapped opportunity for monetizing the data and analytics?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "Do you want me to take it?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "Dave, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to ask Bill Miller to comment on this and he'll take you through into some of the specifics of areas that we are talking to and people we are talking to. But in general, across the \u2013 nationally, obviously, we are working with everybody on the provider side as well as we are also working with our own programs internally at UHC. So we've got a good start in terms of how we're using the data, the analytics. it's a key, key component in terms of how we're headed for the future. Bill?", "Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight", "Yeah, I'd say just to follow-up \u2013 and I appreciate the question, Dave. If you look at our history, we've got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers, payers where we're particularly strong, but also government, pharma who we've been servicing for a long time, and now more recently, consumers and employers.", "Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off 131 billion rule-based decisions every month to help close gaps using our tool like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions, and those interventions are additive to the tool and how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks, and what that saves not obviously is good for the patient, but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers.", "So I could go on and provide a lot examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive to clinical performance which really drive better outcomes and lower costs.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So if I could summarize, all the markets you would expect. Payer, provider, employer, state, Federal, anybody who sponsors a broad program, domestic, U.S., international and life sciences. And I'd say we are kind of in the second or third generation in terms of tools, tools that could be effective, and I'd parse them into two areas: kind of those that really affect clinical encounters and outcomes so they're kind of more in the Optum Care domain, where you can really drive performance; and then those that are broader system-wide, which might be more in the Optum360 domain.", "And then the other thing I'd say is that we're in the early stages because the process of those who are interested in these analytics are really just getting going and being able to use them at their full value in terms of the real-time speed they operate at, et cetera, because they're used to things that are much slower, agreed?", "Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight", "Agreed, and I think that's where we've seen a lot of the uptake, Dave. As reform has hit, it's the need for speed, the need for action, the need for having tools that actually allow you to take, affect, and move the needle with respect to cost, quality, and outcomes is critical in how they integrate with other systems.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Whether they're at a consumer level or whether they're at a system-wide level.", "Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight", "Right.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And so that's why I think we're in the early stages but have such a well-established base in this, so I would think that there will be continued evolution and growth to come from this.", "David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC", "Very good, thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thank you for the question. Can you speak to some of the one-time pressures on MLR? So how much was the leap year impact? With the PDR, would there be any pressure on MLR from exchanges that may fall off next year? And how did the four cost buckets end up versus your expectations?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Good morning, Sarah.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So as you look at the consolidated care ratio, so we reported 81.7% in the quarter this year, and that compared to last year, it's about 30 basis points increase year over year. As you look inside that, the biggest factor driving the increase was the additional calendar day, and second would be then the exchange impact, and that being partially offset by the change in reported development on a year-over-year basis. I think the last part of your question was on cost categories. Is that what you said, Sarah?", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Yes, the four cost buckets, inpatient, outpatient, Rx, physician, how do they trend versus expectations?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Good. So as we looked at our medical costs in the quarter, they were \u2013 we had expected coming into the year a moderate increase in the trend, the underlying utilization trend, and I'll tell you in the first quarter we were able to manage to that outcome and so very consistent with it. On a category basis, I would tell you that I wouldn't spike out any change relative to the guidance that we provided at the investor conference back in December. And we continue to expect on the full year a commercial cost trend in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And you're seeing pressure in the usual places, outpatient, specialty?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Testing?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So nothing really changed.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "No, very consistent with what we described in December.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.", "Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us some indicators on how the risk mix is looking on the new Medicare Advantage lives. It looks like United has added around \u2013 accounted for around 65% of the growth in the MA market. So I'm just interested in terms of as you track that, if you can give us some details on how risk scores are looking on the new MA lives. And then in terms of the mix of those members that are coming from competitor share gains as compared to attracting them from fee-for-service? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve Nelson?", "Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, thanks. Good morning, Scott. We're really pleased with the growth that we saw in both the open enrollment period, but also in our outlook for SEP, the special election period. And this growth is a result of the hard work we've been talking to you about over the past two or three years around \u2013 and putting ourselves in a position to offer stable benefits. But the work around improving our stars, engaging our network differently and aligning incentives, really good engagement with our distribution system, and then innovations in our member experience have all led to not only strong sales, but it's important to note, strong retention as well. So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with.", "But in terms of the mix across \u2013 and the different categories that I would think about in describing our mix is around geography, which is very broad-based. The growth came pretty evenly across our geography, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new to Medicare population, we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often, the percentages growing there, and we see that sequentially. That's our experience, but that again is very much in line with our expectation.", "And then the new-to-us category, which folks that have just enrolled in other plans and enrolled in one of our plans again is very much in line with our expectations. So we're seeing a really strong performance in this business over the first quarter, and we expect to build on that. And our outlook for growth in 2017 is really strong in both \u2013 I should mention in both the individual and the group retiree segment as well, as we're seeing a really strong pipeline there.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So really what I'd say is in three dimensions, well dispersed geographically, well mixed between new to Medicare and new to us, and then a good mix between individual and group, so stable group.", "Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Got it. So it sounds like broad-based pretty much across all the channels is the bottom line.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think the point you made about how well dispersed we are geographically is key, so good question. Next, please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning, thank you. You mentioned that international is one of your five major pillars. Could you speak to where you expect to see the growth, where you're seeing the opportunities in international? And how is Brazil doing?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. They actually, I think, are two different categories, so I'll ask Larry to touch on international because I think when we talked about it in the context of growth it was more on the Optum side. And then Dave can touch on Brazil.", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "So, Christine, it's Larry. I think we sized back at the investor conference in December, we sized that market as being about a $500 billion business. This is a marathon, it's not a sprint. We are getting established. We have actually been in the UK for about 10 years. But what we're really engaging in today is much broader. It's down the lines of integrated care. We're working with the trust, and in the UK the trust would be the hospitals. We're working with what's called NHS Improvement. They're the organization that really monitors the trust. We're working with NHS. We're working with the Prime Minister's office, the Department of Health. So we have a variety of programs that we have underway, and we believe that we're pretty well-positioned at this point to bring a lot of the products and services that we actually have in the States. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation a few minutes ago about the data and the analytics, but that also is a very, very good area for us to introduce, and we're working to do just that as we speak today. Dave?", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Christine. It's Dave Wichmann. So just specifically a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market and I'd say the market segments that are the most attractive in Brazil. And the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of a UnitedHealthcare-style service approach, but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better performing healthcare delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation.", "Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and then you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate into the U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there, companies are struggling, middle class is flat to declining slightly, and obviously the political situation is unsettled. It certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time.", "We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments and we are focused on our growth in those segments, and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on a \u2013 at an employer-by-employer basis, but we are seeing growth underneath all of that, which is very encouraging.", "I think most important, really, as it relates to Amil is that we've \u2013 not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong healthcare delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil and we see that as very positive positioning in that market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advance expectations here in 2016.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So profitable despite the economic stress, not particularly helpful political environment, but continuing to actually fare well and growing as a \u2013 in terms of its dimension as a delivery system, which I think is distinctive in that market. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT.", "Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT", "Thanks for the question, good morning. The last time I think you all updated the market sizing opportunity for Optum was back in 2011 at over $500 billion. Do you have any updated thoughts on what the size of the opportunity is now?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "Sure. It's Larry. Brian, we have sized the \u2013 and I'm going to turn this over to John Rex. I'm probably going to answer the question and then he won't have anything to say, but the domestic side today, we would size at about $680 billion, and the international side at $500 billion. So you're looking at $1.180 trillion that would be the market size. I don't know, John, do you have anything?", "John Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Optum, Inc.", "No, that's accurate. That's where would be in terms of the current view of domestic, up from the initial $0.5 trillion. And you think about that growth across, you know, at that point, we talked about eight markets. I would say that there's been growth across all those markets. I'd highlight areas really probably in such as care delivery and kind of technology is among those areas that have been growing among the faster since we last provided that. But kind of a proportionate movement in terms of the area that we spiked out a few years ago.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So next question, please.", "Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about the acquisition pipeline and the opportunities. It looks like you spent about $1.7 billion in the quarter. I know there was \u2013 I've read about the Symphonix deal. I wonder if you could comment on some of the other opportunities that you've seen and taken advantage of.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So maybe we'll talk a little bit about the M&A activity we have done. We typically don't comment on where we're going in these areas for a whole host of obvious reasons, so our comments in M&A are more retrospective than they'll be prospective.", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "A.J., thanks for the question. It's Dave Wichmann. So our acquisition pipeline and our acquisition activities are really focused in a couple of areas in particular. Obviously, we just got done talking about the size of the services market globally, and so we continue to invest capital to access or broaden our capabilities across Optum and then to also establish a foundational market position, so it can grow from there.", "We also see interest in the \u2013 still in the international markets, although our activities there have dampened just a bit given the \u2013 how those global markets are performing overall. And of course we still have interest kind of broadly across our business. We haven't done much in the health plan space in quite some time because of all the work that we've done over the course of the last two decades to establish strong market presence as well as strong presence in each Medicare, commercial and Medicaid. But certainly we would continue to consider those things in the future.", "As it relates to the first quarter, I think folks know that we funded the Helios acquisition at that time, which is a workplace health PBM, in the first quarter. We also, as we have indicated in the past, have a strong interest in continuing to develop our OptumCare business. And so there's a small acquisition inside there as well.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No real change. The same basic agenda, looking at capabilities, looking to build out the platforms. Probably on the international side there might be more opportunity in services and benefits at the time, so good question. Next, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. So question on the tax rate and the intangibles comments you had in your prepared remarks and the press release today. What should we think about as the tax rate going forward from here for the rest of the year? And what do you think is the sustainability of the benefits into 2017?", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Tom, it's Dave Wichmann again. So thanks for your question. The tax rate change is really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year of which we recognized $0.06 in the first quarter. The pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1/1/2017, but as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as allowed by the pronouncement. The sustainability of that is this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think, broadly for companies because what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate, and in part because it has to do with the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans, either vesting and/or becoming available to employees at given points in time.", "So there will be a little more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016. And we'd expect on that at least this impact, if you will, of the new accounting pronouncement to be pretty consistent year-after-year, depending upon, again, how the stock price performs as well as the vesting activity underlying our equity-based plans.", "David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer", "But it is a year-by-year proposition and so long as you have equity-based compensation and a belief that your stock is going to continue to perform, there will be tax benefits that come through and then they'll just come through quarter-by-quarter. Right?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "These used to go through equity in the past, so they're now just going through the P&L. And one other question you might have, just to make it clear, why is it $0.06 in the first and $0.04 in the balance of the year, and it is just the timing of the way in which we issue equity in our business, which is generally in the first quarter.", "Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great, thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks a lot. Larry, I just wondered if you could you update us on your retail care, neighborhood care model in terms of giving us a sense of what number of locations you're up to, and if the target is still kind of 25 to 30 clinics a year?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "Sure. I'm going to ask Jack Larsen to join in this conversation. But that target, as you said, of 30, I'd say we might try to be a little more aggressive about that. If we kind of back up and we kind of look at our business and I think you're pretty much aware of this is our overall business plan, we're trying to be in 75 markets and we're balancing how we do that through acquisitions, through startups and so forth. So we are progressing on target, and our expectations are that we will continue to grow and that's one of the areas, as Dave mentioned, that we will be looking to have acquisitions in, more along the care delivery side, but from I think you're speaking more about the urgent care and what we're doing there. So let me turn it over to Jack and let him answer this question.", "Jack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Larry, and good morning, Michael. Yeah. I would just amplify what Larry said, we do have aspirations for rather smart growth with our standalone neighborhood care centers. I think from a consumer and retail point of view we're seeing great receptivity for the units, the kind of services we offer. And look, one of the more important determinants of overall healthcare cost is where a consumer enters the healthcare system, and we think what it is that our neighborhood care centers offer with respect to the portfolio of services and retail orientation of it, really hits the mark in a number of ways.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And then just one quick question. At some point should we expect the rebranding effort to come under the Optum banner, or is that not necessary given the local dynamics that are out there?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman", "We're always studying that, but what I would tell you, and I think you know this pretty well that this is all about local care delivery and being in local communities. So the brand is pretty strong in the different areas where we work. We do brand it as Powered by Optum and so forth, but those things are six of one, half a dozen of the other, so we're going to have to watch that for a period of time before we make any decision about full branding.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks for the update.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for fitting me in here, guys. I want to talk about the commercial business. The membership numbers came in a little bit stronger than we were looking in the first quarter, so curious where some of those gains are coming. And then I'm really more interested in the 2017 national account selling season and what you're seeing there, how customers are reacting to the potential mergers for some of the two or four of the bigger companies out there? And maybe, are you just seeing more accounts put out RFPs, or do you think retention levels for the industry will be similar and maybe this is a 2018 event?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let's do the first one first with Dan, and then maybe Jeff can comment on the national business scene.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Sure. Thanks, Josh. I appreciate the question. Certainly in the quarter we had very strong growth in our commercial business. It was well balanced across both funding status as well as geography, and then within that by line of business. As we talked at the investor conference, you can look at the fully insured result as an example. The results inside there are actually muted a little bit by a large customer in a third-party exchange that went through a funding conversion.", "So if you actually adjust it for that, you'd see inside there really are strong growth in our small and middle market, and we continue to see customers responding to the value proposition that we're offering in the market. And we also see from a pricing standpoint our competition moving more in line with us. So as they orient more around a future outlook of cost that resembles something closer to reality, what we see is that we're becoming more competitive, and that market frankly favors is.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jeff?", "Jeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer", "Sure. Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. The national account selling season is probably just cost of the cycle. It's down from the last few years. There aren't a lot of large clients out to bid. I think part of that is the industry does a lot of proactive renewals, the same as we do, to keep some of the large clients from going out to a full bid. It's early. The market is sizing up now, we're in a season of the finalist meetings. Probably by June we'll get a better sense of where we're positioned and how that market is shaping up. But it is a selling season marked with a lot of smaller cases as opposed to some of the past seasons that had some fairly large clients out to bid.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So no real impact from any of the pending mergers, is that fair?", "Jeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer", "Fair now. I'll probably update you a little bit better once we get through the finalist season and some of the post-finalist discussions.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That may be more a dynamic to the next year.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's probably more a dynamic next year. So maybe we only have time for maybe two more questions. So next, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities USA.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hello, gentlemen, thank you very much. And as always, it's a pleasure to look at your earnings release. So I'm going to step back from some of the important details we've been discussing and focus on the question of how UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare are integrating, which is always one of my focus areas. But in particular, my concern is that the cost out of pocket is very significant for the consumer. If you go on the exchanges and you try to price an individual policy, it can cost you $38,000 without subsidies. Similarly, if you're insured by an employer, your out-of-pocket costs rise every year, yet Optum is clearly influencing through tying its analytics and services to the actual provision of care and changing that process. Optum is clearly influencing United; it's clearly influencing the market. When or how can United take a leadership role to revolutionize or take that next step to revolutionize the benefit and cost structure so that we consumers can actually see it in our pockets and United can gain share and then really dominate the market?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That is quite a question, and I admire the direction of it. But maybe I could only respond to it in the broadest context.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "That would be great, thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them and then working with them cooperatively and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, two dimensions, better use of the healthcare resource system, resources in total, and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage, and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer-friendly and easier and, as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned that they can actually act on them and the whole spectrum of what we have been talking about that some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a real-time basis.", "The marketplace is adjusting in terms of how do I exactly use these. They know directionally how they want to use them. I don't know if they are nuts and bolts to quite that point, but these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization, and health status, wellness.", "If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive \u2013 to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace, and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They are sponsoring large populations. They have more influence on how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of developments I think can really establish these patterned measures, can really drive change.", "And clients are seeing it, states are seeing it, governments are seeing it. Some of Larry's commentary with respect to international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have arguably a different healthcare system. And their response to these things and then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out.", "So we are in the early stages, the best way to see it is in the large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid, where you can see large state sponsors that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving.", "The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer. And I think there, platforms like Rally really represent the first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get in the consumers' head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question and next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yes, thanks. I appreciate you fitting me in. On the Medicare rate, could you give us your thoughts for 2017? Any reactions to the 0.85% post the fixing of the error, the risk coding changes, and the impact on your partial and full dual mix of business, the employer group waiver plan?", "And then on the HIF, the tax holiday, do you see that flowing through to seniors and accelerating industry growth? And how does that all impact your book of business for 2017? Is it about a top line or margin expansion?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think we're going to get into \u2013 we typically don't get into the nuts and bolts of the Medicare rate. We would again kind of express disappointment that the funding patterns that Medicare has been using for Medicare Advantage seems to under-fund a program that is so well embraced by seniors and so effective at serving them. So we continue to advocate for more consistent and more market-oriented funding for that. So, Steve, I'll \u2013 beyond that comment, offer your response to that and then the \u2013 her second question.", "Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Good morning, Ana. It's Steve Nelson. I'll just make a couple comments to add to Steve's there, beyond the rates, a little color around insurer's fee and the changes to the group benefits. With respect to insurer's fee, to step back a little bit, our goal is to provide predictable and stable benefits to seniors. It's something that we were able to do this year and that's I think going to be important over the long run. So as you know, we're in the midst of benefit planning right now and that is going to be one factor that we consider amongst several other factors in our pursuit of this goal to offer stable benefits in what, as Steve accurately described it, remains an under-funded environment in 2017. So it will be something that we'll consider and be able to talk more about after we get through our planning season.", "In terms of the group, change to the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains \u2013 I would just say the value to the retirees and employers who are trying to find solutions for the retiree population. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development and as we look towards 2017 as one of the strongest in years. So there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of continuing to advocate for seniors on behalf of this very popular and effective program, and we're going to continue to do that. Thanks for the question.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So that's the end of our questions. So just in closing, I offer that we have a unique opportunity to serve more people in more meaningful ways in distinguished UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare through the quality of our work. And as we elevate our focus on quality service to consumers and customers, we expect broad-based growth to follow. So we thank you, and that concludes our call this morning. Thank you very much for attending.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For our full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant pace. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remain strong and consistent with our recent commentary.", "The steady advancement of innovative, market-responsive products, services and experiences has led to balanced organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well-positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention, and important new business awards and opportunities, leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines.", "For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth, as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remain steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remain well-controlled.", "Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we referred to as the exchange market. That effort is on track, and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the three or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain.", "Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year.", "Looking at the company overall, we intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividends. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time.", "We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and the UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve. Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we have achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year.", "Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook.", "OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $7.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year.", "The pipeline of opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations, rather than simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality.", "Last quarter, we discussed with you, in some detail, our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017, covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health.", "A second high potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year, as the number of people using health benefit accounts expands and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire healthcare system more effectively.", "Optum Financial Services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness, and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control, as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives.", "The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance quarter-by-quarter is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring the market four things: seasoned people; experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights to make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results. We have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our task accurately for those we serve.", "Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life science companies, governments, employers and health care providers.", "Now, let me turn it over to Dave.", "David Scott Wichmann - President", "Thank you, Larry. Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve.", "Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 0.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our house call nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016.", "Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through four-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners. And I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve.", "Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well, with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare community and state served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York. And we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year, as part of that state's program expansion. Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex healthcare needs.", "We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health.", "Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first six months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecasts for both self-funded and full-risk offerings.", "Turning to medical costs, we reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year \u2013 a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter, offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses.", "Year-to-date, favorable prior-year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable.", "Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled.", "Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second-quarter prior-year reserve development we just described.", "Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve, as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, still with only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year.", "Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1 times net income compared to 0.7 times net income in the year-ago period. Year to date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2 times net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt-to-total-capital ratio declined to 48%, and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year, as we work back to a target in the 40% range.", "Reflecting on performance for the first six months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates, as are the corresponding losses. Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture, given the performance backdrop of the exchange business, even as the core businesses have performed strongly.", "As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of cost to set up new businesses for \u2013 new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas such as MedExpress, OptumCare and International, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last two quarters of this year.", "Steve?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Dave. As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intensely focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers.", "On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve, and importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.", "We thank you for your interest today. And, operator, let's open up for some questions. One question per person, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Again, we ask you limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. We'll take the first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Could you just give us, sorry, maybe some visibility on how you're handling the Medicare Advantage bids for 2017? I know the information is not public yet, but if you can just talk to directionally how much of the ACA fee suspension you've loaded into benefits versus reserving for other internal initiatives or earnings?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I think our orientation is to really make sure that we are serving the interests of seniors. Steve, do you want to touch on that?", "Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement", "Sure. Good morning, Matt. Steve Nelson.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning.", "Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement", "Yes. So, as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail, but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So, our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits, including premiums.", "There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our Star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience for clinical programs. And we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly, in the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Just \u2013 sorry, go ahead.", "Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement", "With respect to the insurance fee and as a moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program has been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So, our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. And it's a very effective program that continues to drive costs down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction is really high.", "So our perspective and our approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits, and again, enhancing where we can. So, I think, that provides a perspective. And again, we're just \u2013 we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And it's a great question, but it's just a little early in terms of going too far into it, so...", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Can I just one follow-up? Okay, never mind. I know you got a lot of people. Go ahead.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, we can cover these off-line, Matt, through the course of the day.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Right, yeah.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Thanks. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the exchanges. Two things here. One, I know you're broadly exiting, but wanted to get more detail on what happened here in terms of a postmortem. Maybe Dan can walk us through how the initial $400 million of losses was set when you originally realized the problem for 2016, and what the company has seen to \u2013 that has driven the loss to be about double that over the last six months or so?", "And then just lastly, you're running more than $500 million of losses, give or take, in this segment for 2016 in terms of what you've reported for this year. Can we simply add that number back to the 2016 reported earnings to get the true run rate to jump off for 2017 for Steve's strong earnings number for next year, or are there some other adjustments we need to think about? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Dan, do you want to take him through the math?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Sure. Good morning, Justin.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "The question was comprehensive. So, just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. Our expectation coming into the year was that on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So, the net of those two was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance.", "And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the loss expectation by $125 million, and then likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation of the full year. So, when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016.", "As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of two things. It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about a third of that is higher volume. So, we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected. And then two-thirds is really around the consumption. And, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second quarter. That came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So, two-thirds of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption.", "And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and Hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD. Those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So, that's what's informing our view.", "As you think about 2017, I would tell you, of that $605 million on the math I went through previously, a good meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Dan. That's, I think, a great response. So next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. I wanted to circle back to comments around the negative prior-year development. You mentioned that it was driven in part by Medicare and Medicaid settlements related to 2013 and 2014. What is that, exactly? And it seems like an unusually long lag time for a true-up, so if you could just talk us through that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Sure. Good morning, Sarah. Well, first and foremost, I'd tell you that there are certainly a lot of inherent estimates in our business, and as a result, there's lots of pluses and minuses in any given quarter, so when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period.", "As it relates to second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year, and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior-year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things. And I'd tell you, that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well as, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back three years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance, and programs inside that.", "So, those are the things that contributed to that prior-year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that frankly don't have any bearing on our current year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current year component, that obviously \u2013 with more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter. But important when you put it all together, from a medical cost perspective as well as a trend perspective, outside of the individual ACA, we continue to track in line with our expectations across the platform.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And some of it has to relate to how long it takes for the benefit sponsors and the administrations to actually get the final data, so you can actually get resolution.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Absolutely.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. First, just quick question is just on the exchange update. Where did you end up in terms of exchange lives in 2Q, and what does your updated loss forecast assume in terms of attrition for the rest of the year?", "And then just a second follow-up question, just on OptumRx, looks like you're actually annualizing now to over $60 billion of revenue annualized in the first half. So, how are you thinking about the full year revenue guidance? I think, most recently it was at $58 billion, but it seems like you're \u2013 or at least annualizing well ahead of that so far in the first half of the year. Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So that's an interesting two-part combination. So, Dan, do you want to take the first part?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Sure, Scott. On the exchange enrollment, we ended the quarter with 820,000 lives in the exchange, so that's up about 25,000 from what we expected \u2013 or from what we ended the first quarter at. As we look to where we expect to perform over the balance of the year, we expect that to moderate through attrition and land somewhere in the zone of about 750,000 lives, as we close the year out. And then, obviously, with the \u2013 2017, we would expect a very meaningful reduction in that.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And OptumRx?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Scott, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to start, and then I'm going to ask Tami Reller. Tami is the new CFO at Optum, and she's going to make a couple of comments here. So, I'm just going to talk a little bit about the Rx business for a second. We've been in business with Catamaran for about a year right now. And when we did that \u2013 we had a lot of reasons we did the business, and a couple of them, I thought, might be important to call out in regard to your question. And one was around the complementary strengths that we had. And that was the retail and the mail focus, and those business coming together as well as payers and employers coming together. But probably the most complementary was the technology, and we've been able to get that put that in place.", "The value proposition, and that's what I think you're starting to see now, the expanded services, the scale, as well as synchronization is starting to take hold, and it's resonating in the industry. So, we believe we're building a sound business, and you know how that works. So, we've had a good first half. We have hit all the metrics and are set up pretty well for the second half. And so, I'll let Tami comment on that.", "Tami L. Reller - Chief Financial Officer, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "That's great. Good. And I would just reiterate that integration is going well, new business is going well, renewals, all going very well, so we appreciate the question on the business.", "The one thing I would just note, too, is that we had a number of items that we noted in the December investor conference on elements that would affect both revenue and \u2013 as well as scripts, and that has to do with Part D enrollment, as well as one of our large clients moving to an administrative-only relationship and then also the well-known co-op closures. So, some of those elements do have an impact as we go forward throughout the year, but again, remain confident in the OptumRx business overall for the year.", "Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Go next to A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Hello, everybody. I think I'll just ask broadly about capital deployment from here. Obviously, you're coming up on the anniversary of the Catamaran deal, where you step back from the share buyback activity, been running about $500 million a quarter, which is less than previous.", "At what point do you think you might step that back up? And then also, just on general acquisitions and opportunities for transactions there, can you give us any thoughts on the availability of deals, and your thoughts about where you're focused?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think we'll address the capital allocation, but I would not get your hopes up that we're going to give you too much guidance about where we're focused, things like that, I think, as you might suspect. So, John, do you want to cover capital?", "John Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Good morning, A. J. It's John Rex here. So, just thinking about \u2013 ways to answer your question here. So, yeah, we've repurchased about 1 billion shares \u2013 about $1 billion worth of stock year to date. That's against the guidance we had for $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So, you should expect that the repurchasing activity will moderate meaningfully in the second half of the year.", "And Dave had a bit commented in his portion of the script, we're also committed to continuing to bring down our debt-to-total-capital ratio back ultimately to our approximately 40% target range. So, we're just slightly below 48% here, as we exited the Q2. And so we'd expect to continue to focus on meeting those commitments and bringing down that debt-to-capital ratio. So, that's how you kind of think about it in terms of progression and capital.", "A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And as it relates to M&A, I mean, we have a clear business model. We continue to be focused on building that out. We talked in the past about allocating capital to cultivate capabilities that we think are important for the future. And we tend to be careful with respect to how we consider our timing and values. So, I don't think any of those things that had been long-standing attributes really changed. And so, we'll \u2013 we continue to be attentive to the marketplace, but beyond that, I don't think we can give you much.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "It's going to be kind of a broad question, but I'm curious about what you're seeing going on with drug price trend going on now. If we look at your bids, you've won some business with OptumRx, some very sizable accounts, including one where your pricing shows up in publicly filed information, where you can see that your view on trend is a little bit below where some of the competitors are by 0.5% or 1.5%.", "So, can you tell us what you think is going on with drug price trend and with the various regulation that's coming out or that might come out on drug pricing? And where do you see all that evolving going forward over the next year or two?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, we'll comment from a PBM point of view, and then maybe broadly in terms of the pressure on elevating drug prices broadly, particularly, in the specialty categories. Mark?", "Mark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Peter. Well, drug prices are the first item, obviously, on our clients' list. And, I think, if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale. And it is intended to take to the supply chain. So, as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market.", "And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So, we use our tools like formulary, like specialty steerage, like preferred and exclusionary networks, to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now.", "We've reached a scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain to the best of our ability drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis.", "So, we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and, really, the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum. So, that's what we're doing.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe if you could discuss a little bit more how you see the Medicaid pipeline opportunity, involving both near term and longer term, maybe even including the Pennsylvania and LTSS RFP. Dave in his prepared remarks said he expect to grow, so what's giving you confidence about your ability to continue to win RFPs going forward? And then just real quick, how are Iowa costs running versus the losses assumed in the PVR? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Austin?", "Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Thanks for the question. First of all, as far as the pipeline, I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that'll be implemented over the next three years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence, because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So, we see that continuing.", "The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that, Oklahoma another example, so you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations.", "Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you've got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in managed care today, but only about 41% of the dollars. So, when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Couple with that still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have managed care today, some very large, like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So, again, I think, it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward.", "In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We stay very focused on job one, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we did build a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's \u2013 we're one quarter in, so it's very early, so too early to really comment on what we're seeing. Early indications would be that it's in line with our expectations, but, again, very early.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Next?", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line's open.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning. Just was hoping to get some more clarification on Dave's comments about the drivers of medical cost trend. I guess, just generally, when you made your comments about specialty pharma, ER and outpatient and then inpatient, is that inclusive of the ACA exchange membership?", "And then more importantly, is it fair to say that the specialty pharma, emergency room, outpatient are trending higher than you initially expected, and that's being offset by inpatient? Or just any comment would be helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Dan?", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Good morning, Chris. Dan Schumacher. So, first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trend. That's what informed our pricing, our entire benefit planning as well as the guidance we've provided. And that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation.", "It's kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms. But as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower.", "To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that is more moderate levels of trend, as we drive down per capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I will tell you that's largely driven by Hepatitis C. So, we changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business, so we expanded coverage. And that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis that we talked about back at the investor conference.", "And then if you look to the outpatient side, inside there, we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based \u2013 facility-dispensed prescriptions, so that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So, those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused to work down those costs.", "All of those categories, I will tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line in the pharmacy space, a little bit better on the inpatient side, but net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "You bet.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yes. So, Larry, I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in terms of Optum opportunities on the international front?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Well, that's a good question. I'll start with probably the area that we're spending a lot of time in, and that's the U.K., and what's going on with the U.K. I'm going to ask Jeff Berkowitz, who runs that area, to follow up my comments. But \u2013 and we've talked about this in the past. We've been \u2013 we've been in the U.K. for about 10 years or so, but the past year we have put a lot of time and effort into the development of our products there.", "I would say that regardless of the political situation, the challenges, the opportunities, everything that we have been trying to address, nothing has changed. And we feel that the past year, we've been able to establish ourselves in a capacity that people now understand the Optum products. They understand our direction and what we're trying to achieve. So, we remain bullish with some caution around what's going to go on, on the political side. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Berkowitz - Executive Vice President, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So, Larry, just as you said, we've spent the past years in the U.K. establishing a very strong foundation. We have a strong foundation with the National Health system, a strong foundation with the National Health system improvement, and a very strong foundation of work on the ground with the Department of Health.", "And even with Brexit, Optum's foundation stands \u2013 continues to stand strong. And while we don't yet know all the ways Brexit will play out, as Larry just said, in the coming months and years, we do believe that the health service right now will continue to drive its existing plans related to our own efforts there. And we will continue to work closely with England's Department of Health and the NHS to help them achieve those important missions.", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So, Michael, it's Larry again. I would comment on Brazil that we are working with Amil in bringing our technologies, our services to that part of the world. And that's going pretty well. And there are other development countries that are too early for us to talk about. But as we talked about back at the Investor Day, we believe this is about a $500 billion market, so we're going to stay and be part of it.", "Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks for the update.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Good morning, and thank you. And first, I would be remiss if I didn't say congratulations to John, and David, and Tami on their new roles, well-deserved and lovely to see.", "And with that, can we focus on something that's important, but I'm not sure we actually got a whole lot of detail around this? OptumRx has clearly done a very good job of winning competitive business and not based solely on price, or not even importantly on price, but rather on what appears to be an innovative and intriguing combination of services and capabilities as well as scale.", "But implementation is going to be important, so \u2013 and I gathered from your commentary around guidance that you plan to spend to implement, which is great. But can you give us some more details about what you plan to do to ensure that these new lives as well as the existing lives, as seamless an experience becoming OptumRx beneficiaries as did the 11 million commercial lives, which you clearly were able to bring on without even a whisper of an issue? That would be very helpful. And with some estimate of what it will impact presumably in third and fourth quarter. Thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So I think that's an excellent area of interest. So...", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "I'll start.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yup.", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So, Sheryl, it's Larry. I'm going to ask Mark to comment after I finish. So, I know, you know that we have certain priorities that we work toward in Optum, and one of them is to establish, what I'll call, these deeper, more comprehensive relationships. I think we had a goal to have about 8 to 10 of them by the end of 2016. I think, we're pushing 17 right now. And these last wins were part of that.", "So, as part of going after that effort a few years ago, we have been strengthening leadership ever since that started. So, we feel very, very confident in the leadership that we have, and that we have developed as well as with the combination of Catamaran and OptumRx, we're pretty solid when it comes to that.", "When you step over into implementation and execution, that happens to also be one of our key priorities that we pride ourself on. So, this is not really out of the ordinary, what we do. So, we looked at both of those things from an execution standpoint as well as from a people standpoint, and so the third question you asked is about the monetary side of this, and it's built in. So, there should not be any impact at all to guidance. We expect to get these type of relationships, and we have built it in the plan. So, there shouldn't be anything extraordinary that would happen from a financial standpoint. Mark?", "Mark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yes, Sheryl. Good morning, and, Larry, thank you. So, I think, I'd like to just take a moment and talk about what broadly large-scale buyers want and need. And we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating, and we posted some substantial wins here recently, and it's not by accident. Large buyers have a set of complicated needs but, first and foremost, they need a flexible and proven technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics and prices \u2013 price matters. But our model of providing superior service and really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating.", "And then finally, if someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large-scale conversions or transitions. And this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large-scale transition several years ago in OptumRx. And in our prior business at Catamaran, we had bought and integrated eight companies. And so, the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So, we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly.", "If you look back on our 1/1/16, where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work, because that's the heart and soul of this business. You have to do well. It all starts with a successful implementation, and we do know what to do. So, thanks for the question.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. We only have a few more minutes, so a couple more questions. So, the next one, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. One of the areas of growth you called out in OptumHealth, one of those drivers was expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. You called that on the press release. I'm curious. Could you elaborate on that a little bit more on that particular growth opportunity, how sustainable is it, and how much did it contribute to this 15% growth in that segment? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Mike?", "Michael Weissel - Executive Vice President, Optum Consumer Solutions, UnitedHealth Group, Inc", "Sure. So, this is Mike Weissel. Thanks for the question. I think, when we look at behavioral health and we look at the Medicaid market, in particular, we see a number of opportunities. I think, we see them both in combination with UnitedHealthcare, as Austin mentioned earlier, in the areas of the long-term social services or IDD population. Those populations continue to kind of be driven into managed care in some way with the behavioral piece. So, we see plenty of opportunity there.", "There are also other states, which are looking to do that on a direct basis. And so, we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically, in the direct market with some of these states as they look to build it. So, we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the continued integration of behavioral health in the mainstream clinical?", "Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "I just would comment. This is Austin Pittman. So, Mike mentioned this, but the work we continue to do to really integrate our behavioral health with our physical health really creating a new model that we're calling whole-person health is really an exciting new direction for us. It certainly will bode well for UnitedHealthcare and Optum's growth on that piece of business, as well as that external business. In fact, you could probably think of it with a lot of the same attributes that were just discussed around OptumRx, integrating and synchronizing network with our full clinical model. Same thing applies here. It's a really exciting next step for us.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And it's not limited to Medicaid.", "Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "No.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's broad-based. Next question, please?", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi, there. You spoke to the backlog growth which looks really nice in OptumInsight. Could you speak to where you see major opportunities and kind of the composition maybe of the opportunities that you're seeing there?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, maybe just in broad strokes, though. Larry?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "So I'll start and \u2013 I'll start. And it's Larry, Christine. So I'll get going here, and I'm going to ask Bill Miller to come in on this as well. So, when \u2013 we look at all of our indicators, and all are in line with what we are expecting. In three of the \u2013 what I call the top metrics that we engage with to see how the growth is going.", "One would be our qualified sales pipeline, and I brought that up a few minutes ago in the script. And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up the 15%. That $11.3 billion, obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our \u2013 what I'll call, our closed sales. And how we look at the total contract value on that.", "And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter. And that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So, I'm doing an 80% above on contracted \u2013 total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done an entire year of 2015. So, obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going give us a jumpstart into 2017. So, we're feeling very good about where we stand right now. But I might just ask Bill to comment on some of the things that he's actually got going on inside some of these different metrics I'm talking about.", "Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, Christine. Yeah, as Larry said, there's a lot of confidence if you interrogate that backlog and that prevailing confidence comes from \u2013 if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those are piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted. It is at breakneck pace.", "And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline, in general, we are the recipients of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and certainly, pharma.", "And then also, I would think the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the \u2013 many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big, they're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we've always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships.", "And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there, and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that. And I think we have distinguished ourselves very well on the analytics front, on the revenue managed front, payment integrity. So, it's a very diverse sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into 2017.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But to your point, that's a long lead time and could be uncertain \u2013 unclear in times of time frames, right?", "Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just challenging to manage that. So, great question. Next question, please? So we'll take two more, and then we'll cut it off. And John and Brent and others will be around for the balance of the day.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to get some more color on your comments on the capital deployment towards OptumCare. You've mentioned that is a focus area and MedExpress. In context of these trends that we continue to see on outpatient mix shifting and ER, and then most recently with the administration making all these changes, not the least of which is macro, I was wondering if you have an increased appetite at this time to buy primary care docs? And are you seeing more willingness for them to affiliate with you relative to the hospital? And then the second part of that was what about ambulatory surgery centers, given that seems to be a big trend in terms of elective surgeries and procedures?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Well, we'll go another 10 minutes responding to that question.", "David Scott Wichmann - President", "Ana, it's Dave Wichmann. Maybe just to extend on the capital deployment front, and then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex in his new role as CFO did a great job responding to our overall capital priorities, but I think it has been consistent over time. We have allocated about 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that is strongly biased towards the dividend right now, as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%.", "The 50% on M&A we really didn't touch on a whole lot, and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we've been investing significantly into Optum. And you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think, the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital basis that we put in place there.", "Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care, and in this case happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest into opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo startups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly, as you're just getting going in the early stages of that.", "Your instincts are right, and they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And, of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves.", "Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the OptumCare business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets. And we have an initial foundation of that, I believe about $10 billion of revenue or so on a combined basis. We serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice going business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue the development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?", "Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Yeah, just a couple things. Today, we have about 175 MedExpress urgent care centers. And we have been doing about 30 start-ups a year. I think, we'll ramp that up 2017 to about 75. And then we probably have another additional 75 urgent care centers that were all part of the primary care businesses that we have, and we have acquired. So, as Dave said, this is one of our top growth pillars in terms of what we're trying to do for the future, and we're going to be focused on that. The other side of this is OptumCare, and I'll let Jack talk about that.", "Jack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Ana. In the OptumCare Care Delivery business, we're certainly in the early innings of building this. To your question on receptivity, yes, we are seeing increased receptivity of some of the higher-quality physician groups, primarily organized around primary care to look not only to join us but really to do something different in terms of the way they care for their patients, really looking for the assistance coming out of care delivery, out of Bill Miller's business with OptumInsight, around population health tools and really re-equipping them to up their game to be more attractive to large-plan sponsors and large employers looking to contract with physicians in an altogether different way. So, we have been hard at work at that.", "And we continue to see good receptivity, and we're going to be at it for certainly the balance of 2016 and 2017. And I think, in one of your questions, you have preferred to MACRA, clearly game-changing when it comes to the world of physicians and providers. We're certainly evaluating the regulatory release, but we think it is really a stamp of approval of where we're taking physicians and getting them right in the thick of more comprehensive population health management.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think we can play at that level and can do it right from the start.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thanks. Very helpful color.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Last question, please?", "Operator", "And we'll take that question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. Steve, you mentioned some commentary around 2017 and an outlook coming a little bit later. So, I appreciate we're not going to get into the specifics here. But as you think about the comments you've made and then $2 billion of Optum revenues that we know about, Medicare Advantage, including the fee and group wins that you're seeing, the elimination of the exchanges which, that alone $0.37, $0.38 this year. That's like 5% of earnings. Are there any offsets, anything we should think about that's unusual in 2017 in terms of a headwind that would preclude you from getting into your long term 13% to 16% growth?", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, the only ones you missed on the upside were the Stars, the increasing Stars performance and just the overall momentum of growth coming in. And then I think, the offset I would offer is, I think, you have to remain respectful of two things, and that is that our business has increasingly a large factor of federal and state programs, and those programs have funding dynamics to them. So, I think, those things always have to be taken into consideration and respected.", "And lastly, as we've talked through the course of the morning, kind of a never-ending respect for medical cost trends and particularly those we outlined this morning, making sure that we are addressing those effectively. And, I think, those two things are environmental but have to always be called out as elements for consideration.", "And as we indicated early, we are getting a lot of new business opportunities and successes, and making sure that we stand those up in a very effective and successful way and are meticulous with respect to that execution. Those are the things that I would say balance off in terms of making sure that we are living up to our responsibilities. So, that's the kind of outlook I would bring to it.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, we thank you. Just kind of in closing, UnitedHealth Group delivered, I think, a very strong second quarter. UnitedHealthcare and Optum's products and services continue to grow and resonate with consumers and customers. I think, our enterprise is well-positioned to address the changing healthcare needs of the people and markets we serve, and in doing so, we continue to have the momentum of broad-based growth that we're going to take through 2016 and 2017, and hopefully, the decade ahead.", "So, this concludes our call, and we thank you for your interest today.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.

", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we are privileged to report continued broad-based revenue and earnings growth, consistent execution and continuing forward momentum for our enterprise. We serve people's health and healthcare, a sensitive, social and personal domain that we know requires a mission and values-driven culture and a commitment to a quality experience, getting that experience right the first time for each individual we serve. We are advancing consciously and steadily in this direction. More to do to achieve the full potential and positive impact we can have on people's lives, on an access, cost and quality of care.", "We work to improve overall healthcare system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach, consistently executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year. And third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%. ", "Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses, driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received. To take you deeper, Larry Renfro will discuss Optum's third quarter performance and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry? ", "Larry Renfro", "Thank you, Steve. At Optum, we are pleased, once again, to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far, with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation Company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make this health system work better. We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like OptumLabs and built a reputation for reliable service, even in challenging situations. And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. ", "This quarter, we again closed several large, long term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be their partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytics, processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower cost, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. Hospitals and acute-care facilities continue to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology.", "The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion within them. A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at BlackRock have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in annual customer billings.", "This quarter, consulting leader Frost & Sullivan named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to healthcare providers, identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year over year. We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value.", "OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by OptumCare Local Care Delivery. OptumCare leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level; in fact, perhaps nowhere else can the potential benefits of individuals be as profound. And while OptumCare already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out OptumCare market by market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside.", "This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to five years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible.", "OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets in care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90%s.", "OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year over year to $12.6 billion and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year over year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year, led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the OptumHealthcare Delivery businesses. We recognize Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and in turn, help %s make the health system work better for more people. ", "Now, let me turn it over to Dave. ", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again, with solid growth across all three domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive product and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors.", "Our full-year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our Commercial Group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year over year continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In six of the past seven calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served, with cumulative growth across all products, totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. In the seniors' market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirements performance continues to strengthen each year.", "In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter Scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction or NPS and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance and the use of healthcare resources, all leading to better value for seniors.", "Our Medicare Advantage Plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated four stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. This quarter, our Group retiree call centers achieved JD Power's certification, placing them among the highest-performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality healthcare and flawless service. We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017, with the introduction of a new nationwide product set, targeted to a broader senior demographic.", "Our community and state plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs, to improve quality for beneficiaries, while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual eligible beneficiaries and those who need long term services and support. ", "Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia, in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our community and state business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. ", "Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion, grew 13.3% year-over-year, with organic growth, again, across the three businesses. The same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year over year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. ", "Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first nine months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year to date, to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular, seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. ", "As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year over year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion or 1.4 times net income and adjusted cash flow was 1.7 times net income in the third quarter. We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. ", "At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year. And we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our Investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another six weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on the Street. ", "We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture. Steve? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you, Dave. I think at this point, it's important to acknowledge something we don't do enough and that's the tremendous effort of our employees and the efforts they make to bring our mission into the day-to-day reality of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. They exhibit the values we share across this Company as they do that work, values of integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships and performance. Our thanks to their commitment and hard work. ", "As we move toward 2017, our enterprise is well-positioned. You can hear the optimism in Larry and Dave's commentary today and see it in the consistency of our performance. Our businesses are aligned to important market trends and delivering value to the increasing number of customers and people we serve. There is still a long way to go to serve at the peak of our potential. It is up to us to execute and we are privileged to have that opportunity. ", "Thank you for your interest this morning. Operator, we can now take questions. Again, one per analyst, please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Borsch", "I just wanted to ask on the outlook for the rest of the year for Optum, is it still your expectation that you will have about 60% of the earnings growth weighted to the back half? I'm asking because it's -- looks like that's going to be a pretty big sequential jump implied in the Optum earnings or margins, at least from how we're modeling it. If you could comment on that and maybe if there's anything you can tell us about the organic change that you've seen year to date in the Optum non-intersegment revenues. It's just challenging to track that. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think those patterns are pretty consistent with prior periods, but Larry, do you want to take that and then maybe John Rex or whatever, we'll finish off. But Larry, do you want to start? ", "Larry Renfro", "A couple things, I think past history in terms of how our business is lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going to pretty much play out this way and I will talk about that in a minute. The third quarter, strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we are exactly where we expect it to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality and when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentives and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter.", "The number of new accounts that we have, as well as AEP kicks in; some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter, but what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, what I will call, complex relationships and when we get into that and this is all part of how we build this during the year, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We are probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years.", "We have three measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned this a few minutes ago on inside of about $12.6 billion; that's up about 24% year over year. We had our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in, possibly during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2 times over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year. What I call our TCV, our total contract value; that's up about 3 times. So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter.", "We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017 so we're right where we expect it to be. I will tell you that this time next year, if we're sitting here, we will be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter. ", "John Rex", "Yes, absolutely expect those seasonal patterns to continue, as we've seen over the years. If anything, when you think about where the bias of sales to and growth is within the Optum businesses, that should be an actual outcome in terms of that seasonality persisting. So what you want to think about there in terms of businesses that have that type of pattern, think about some of the quality solutions businesses, data sales and analytics, the timing and delivery of the large deals and certainly, seeing plenty of large deals across the spectrum this year, some of the networks solutions businesses. All of those businesses are typically second-half weighted in terms of their performance and that's a pattern that we would expect to persist. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Justin Lake", "Appreciate the early view on 2017 and you talked about being comfortable with consensus EPS which implies of about 14% year-over-year growth with potential for upside given the business momentum. When we adjust for the benefit of exiting the ACA individual market for next year, that growth looks closer to about 9% to 10%, if I'm doing the math right. Just curious in terms of how you think about the main headwinds and tailwinds year over year we should consider when thinking that growth rate relative to your long term growth expectations. ", "Dave Wichmann", "So as you said, we will discuss 2017 at our Investor Conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth, both at Optum which you've seen pretty systemically throughout the year, with the PDM wins and obviously, here with the Quest win which is Optum360 win as well as and I'll call a lot of the smaller business size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All of those things speak to Optum's growth and I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth and its membership across all three lines of business.", "The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA. That clearly will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur and then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range and serve in more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo start-up costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time. ", "The last thing I guess I would point out in 2017, particularly, at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we're -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trend. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clearer, that's when I think you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early in the 2017 Investor Conference in November. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Our commentary today was an attempt to be pretty positive about 2017 and I think the commentary about if momentum continues and we have every reason to believe that it will, l that we can be even stronger, but I really think that whole conversation really should -- is better had more face-to-face at the Investor Conference. So our purpose today is to give you some positive body language on 2017, but really the further conversation is at the Investor Conference. So if you kind of take it from that spirit, that's the right way. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Dave Windley", "I wanted to ask a question around OptumRx and drug costs trend. If you could comment on your views, generally about drug costs trend and then within your OptumRx business, are you seeing or are you deploying particular strategies that you think are delivering a competitively better drug cost trend? Or should I think about the competitive differentiation being through the synchronization function and seeing savings elsewhere in medical benefits as you are interacting with pharmacy members? Thanks. ", "Larry Renfro", "I think the answer to that is really both and I think the distinctive dimensions of the OptumRx business is that they are really kind of redefining pharmacy care services to be much more integrated into the clinical continuum, to have impact on medical costs and to engage earlier. At the same time, be able to bring leading-edge perspectives to the procurements of a drug and supply chain. So Mark, do you want to comment? ", "Mark Thierer", "I appreciate the question and I would say that the one thing our clients are focused on and hiring us to do is to manage their pharmacy costs. One of the reasons I'm excited about this business is there is no one in the industry who has the data, analytic and delivery assets, really, that Optum possesses and so you mentioned synchronization. And as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. So this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services, taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab, behavioral data in a comprehensive data set.", "We call it, [indiscernible] and the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach. How can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cross trend management strategies, that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by pharmacist, housecalls by nurses.", "This could include adherence programs; it's a full suite of programs, all aimed at driving down total medical costs. And so I would say that's one thing that is setting us apart in the market. We're feeling very good about where we stand in our position and we can see it in our pipeline and the growth opportunities that we're chasing. So thank you for the question. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Michael Newshel", "Can you maybe give us some more detail on why you directed the increased level of investments that you mentioned as raising the operating cost ratio? How much spending was not previously planned and incremental to the third quarter and also, is there anything incremental planned in Q4 that you even had planned earlier in the year? ", "John Rex", "Just a little bit on OCR. First of all, I would say that in line with our view here in terms of how we trended in the 3Q, so the first perspective being from 2Q to 3Q, there was a sequential increase of about 60 basis points in the OCR and that is typical of what we see as we move into the open enrollment period and the investments and spend to prepare for that as the season began. So that is a typical move. And I think you're referring particularly to the year-over-year move of a 30 basis point increase. That's, as you stated, primarily driven by increased investments. I cite a few places where we were making investments in the quarter. ", "Things you may have heard us referred to in the past and maybe you've been familiar with, the ongoing Stars investments, medical affordability and clinical investments, specific businesses that we've been very vocal on in terms of where we expect to grow and invest such as the OptumCare businesses. And then I would put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses, within our senior businesses, in M&R, some of the Optum businesses where you've seen there have been very -- some significant new business awards for next year as we prepare for that. Just a general upward pressure also that we see fee comparisons growth.", "All of this, as you would expect from us normally on offset partially by the productivity gains that we've logged. So within our expectations, if I sum it up and those are the types of investments that we're making. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ralph Jacoby from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Jacoby", "I was hoping you could maybe just walk through the favorable development in the quarter. They came off last quarter that had an unfavorable development from both current and prior year and this quarter obviously had favorable, particularly in the first half. So our estimates last quarter is essentially overly conservative on the exchange specifically. But also sort of the unfavorable development from last year; just hoping you could flush out all those moving parts and maybe which end markets are impacted? Thanks. ", "Dan Schumacher", "So maybe I will start broadly on medical costs overall. From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled and as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year and that's actually down 60 basis points year over year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior period reserve development in the quarter. That was about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look of the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior-year unfavorable developments.", "With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the Exchanges, frankly and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare/Medicaid and our Commercial business, both the current year favorable as well as the prior-year favorable. And on the prior-year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. There was nothing in this quarter that was individually material and that prior-year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trends. So as we look to the full-year and look at our medical costs, we expect the medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points and I would probably tell you it would likely orient below that midpoint. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Peter Costa", "My question is on the margins in the Medicare business. Last year, you had higher spending for Medicare Star scores that impacted your Medicare performance. This year, did that spending continue at the same level or does it come down a little bit? And then going into next year, how do you plan to utilize the HIF holiday given that the health insurance fee comes back in 2018 so what should I think about for a trended margins last year to this year to next year to 2018? ", "Steve Nelson", "I will start by just giving a broad perspective on how we think about 2017 as we enter -- I think we're three days into our annual enrollment period for 2017. I really think we are well-positioned overall. As you mentioned, we've seen improvement in our Stars and when we contemplated our benefit planning, back in the Spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that and also the insurers' fee moratorium as well. That allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really excited to offer to our seniors. ", "It's meaningful to them, the stability and premiums and co-pays and choice. We think we're really well-positioned. Then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality which benefits our members but also, something that we're going to stay diligent about.", "We also have, I think, Dave mentioned in his opening comments, some of the distinguished capabilities that we have in our member experience and service, so all of these positions leave room for growth but in terms of the margin specifically, we wanted the positions business for growth and we think we have done that. The margins we target between 3% and 5%, we're operating toward the upper end of that range at this point and expect to continue to do that in 2017. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "We think we spent more on Stars, but we also get benefits from Stars, the performance in Stars has really been highlighted and-- ", "Steve Nelson", "Yes. On the Stars-specific investment question I would say that we -- this time last year, actually, we were talking about investments, strategic investments we were making in Stars and we continue at about the same level looking for more effectiveness, more efficiency and some productivity gains. But generally, at the same level, don't expect that to initially increase, but we are getting really strong returns and we're very excited about the performance and the results that we're seeing in Stars. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Very stable, so stability is the order of the day in terms of approach. This is a business that was challenging a few years back and has been brought back into line. So very positive. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ", "Scott Fidel", "Interested if you can give us an update on how the net new business pipeline has developed for OptumRx for 2017? And then, also separately, maybe an update on the commercial side in terms of how the national accounts' selling season ended up shaping up for you guys? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "So that is a two-part question. Mark, do you want to take the first part? ", "Mark Thierer", "Well, we feel pretty good about the scorecard from 2016. As you know, we posted some very large wins, what I would categorize as some of the smartest and most sophisticated buyers signing on with OptumRx. I think these large wins validated our model. I mean, we've put this business together. We're a year and a few months into and I do think the strategic rationale for the combination is proving out. I think at the end of the day, the reason that we are posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money on drugs, but it is this differentiated model that we're selling.", "The pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model which we're trying to rebuild and combining it with the Optum Clinical platform. Here we're talk about OptumHealth and all of the care management, data management and care delivery services. So I think if you start to look at it, we've emerged as a sort of destination platform in this industry and feel very good about the selling season and the wins that we'll post and bring live in 2017. ", "Jeff Alter", "Just comment on the national accounts season. We're wrapping up that 2017 selling season now and as we've talked about in the past, this was a fairly light season for active employees and it is played out this way. We continue to be able to manage our client retention well up in the high 90%s which is a testament to the value and the relationships that the value that we bring to those clients and the relationships that we have. ", "We'll probably wind up with a relatively flat membership result, when you take into account the success of our Group's MA efforts. So on that front, as I said, it was a fairly light active season but we saw a very, very robust season for Group MA and as Mark mentioned, some of the PBM offerings. ", "And I think what we really showed to the marketplace is that we can take the value of this enterprise to bear on those opportunities and we are combining the unique expertise of the Commercial business, our Medicare business and our OptumRx business and bringing really seamless solutions to the marketplace for our clients. And we've produced a very successful result for the 2017 selling season for both our Group MA business and our OptumRx business. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Josh Raskin", "I just want to talk about capital deployment and specifically, share buybacks. I know you guys have been intent on reducing your leverage this year, but looks like it was relatively slow in the first half and really fell off again in the third quarter so I guess I'm curious one, was there something in the market that give you pause around share buybacks? And then how do we think about 2017? Is that a more normal return to a more normal pattern for UnitedHealth Group? ", "Larry Renfro", "I think we're completely in line with our plan and pattern so we don't view this as anything of that nature and we have reduced debt, so I think it's all line with plan. John? ", "John Rex", "Josh, particularly on share repurchase, but for the year, we had anticipated $1 billion to $1.5 billion in total share repurchase. In the first half, we did about $1 billion so we anticipated that we would be slowing meaningfully in the second half of the year. We repurchased about $140 million in the third quarter, so consistent in terms of our full-year expectations in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Nearer term, you're right. We've been focused on delevering our balance sheet and applying more than free cash flow to debt reduction but the pattern that you've seen this year, consistent with kind of how we've approached the year in terms of our share repurchase activities. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "So I don't think there's anything that's -- and nor do we plan to stray from that, so our capital allocation approaches are perfectly consistent. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Gary Taylor", "I was hoping to get a few more details on your ACA-compliant individual business and I guess, happy that it's not a big topic of conversation for the first time in a few quarters but one, wondering if you could give us both your on and off-Exchange compliant enrollment. Two, I think in the third quarter a year ago, almost 20% of the individual compliant enrollment was coming through special enrollment period. I wonder where that stood this year versus the 20% last year?", "And then just finally, presumably the MLR in the first half of the year has been pressured as you booked additional full-year losses for your ACA-compliant businesses and I suppose we flip to the point where the PDR is probably now helping the medical loss ratio. So any color you could give on either how much the PDR came down or maybe even just what your MLR looks like in your ACA-compliant business this quarter versus a year ago? Just some help on what how that's shaping up versus the projected losses? ", "Dan Schumacher", "First, to the enrollment. So on the enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 Exchange lives and another 210,000 Off the Exchange rate, so on a combined basis, our individual ACA block was just under a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter. When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing has really changed on the ACA front and that's a good thing.", "Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we continue to maintain our full-year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million and of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve and the remaining $80 million flowed trough the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year over year. From our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year.", "I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year and now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base. Hopefully, that covers the list. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from AJ Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.", "AJ Rice", "Probably just go back to the discussion around Optum. If I think about the announcements you've had this quarter the Quest announcement takes you into a new area for revenue cycle management, the VA contract, certainly dramatically expands the business with the government in that area. I know you've talked about DoD contracts as well and I think there's been ongoing commentary about discussions with international governments and NHS, for example. Can you just talk about the expanding opportunities that Optum has? And what are some of the pie-in-the-sky opportunities looking out two or three years for Optum? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I don't think we think of them as pie-in-the-sky, but I think Larry can respond to that. ", "Larry Renfro", "Let me start with international and I'm going to ask a couple of people to help me out. I'll ask Bill to join into this and I might ask Amir to join in from an OptumCare standpoint and I think Mark's already covered it, but on the international front, I would say we've spent the last year-and-a-half building our foundation. We've been planting seeds and I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We are getting stronger with Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we sit here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next two or three days on tour, with quite a few of the Commissioners of the Trust which would be hospitals, the way we would know it. ", "I would say that as we've gone through this with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger and I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate, as we've been validating some things here in the States. So that's where I would say that the international sits in the UK. We are also working with our sister organization, Amil, in Brazil and that's more of a health plan, as you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. We are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking, probably the way we would go about is look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia, but we're going to finish out what we're doing with the UK and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things.", "Again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market and we remain focused and confident that, that 's the size of that market. We move over into what we're doing on the, what I'll call, our large, deeper relationships and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with and then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the, what I'll call, the OptumCare side. I will make one comment myself of what we're doing in the military. We were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exams.", "So we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. Four at LHI; that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. Four in California with MSLA that we own, it will service about 4.2 million servicemen and women and we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So, Bill? ", "Bill Miller", "With respect to our revenue management offerings, we've used this word, validation, a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest web diagnostic companies in the world. I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all go through a rigorous evaluation process and whether it's Quest or Dignity which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems.", "They are looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that can leverage a worldwide workforce and peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up culturally with them and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them.", "So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them so that they are successful. That formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day but more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments and Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I will turn it over to Amir. ", "Amir Dan Rubin", "So we are continuing to see great growth on the OptumCare side. As you know, we have laid out 75 strategic markets that we see as important for ourselves to be in. We are well in over half of those markets and we continue to see growth into new markets as well as growth within those markets. And within those markets, we are seeing growth across different payer categories and were also seeing growth across the continuum of care access. ", "We also continue to grow our MedExpress centers. We see great success in our consumerism approach there with MedExpress and we'll continue to expand those assets. And we also see ourselves addressing more and more complex populations, dual eligibles, of course, Medicare Advantage, special needs population as well. ", "So we will continue to see that and then to find these capabilities leveraging the capabilities from OptumInsight and our analytics, risk stratification into our Care Delivery Groups and now as Larry mentioned, applying those capabilities from OptumCare and OptumInsight abroad globally. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "The quarter looks pretty good overall so I'm going to go back and harp on the one thing that I feel just doesn't look right to me which was the negative prior-year development. We're not used to seeing that from you guys at all. Now we've seen it two quarters in a row so I just wanted to understand how comfortable you are with the reserves. ", "Just to get a little more color, I understand that you mentioned there's a lot of things going on and it was more the core business than Exchanges this quarter. But any color you can provide there about what was really driving that, because we're just not used to seeing it? It looks like at this rate, you may be showing some of the lowest growth development you've seen in the last decades I just wanted to understand your visibility into reserves and what's been driving that recently? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I will just commentary before Dan gets to it, is that we don't really strive for the -- a formula development numbers. We try to get as accurate as possible, so if we have absolutely no development, it would absolutely actually be perfect. I think you shouldn't read anything too much into this beyond the fact that we continue to be very vigilant and making sure that our trends are appropriate, our reserves are appropriate and true things up in an appropriate timeframe. Dan, do you want to come back and comment one more time? ", "Dan Schumacher", "Well, Kevin, I would just add that when you put it in the context of our total medical spend, what you're seeing and, as Steve mentioned, is greater accuracy. So last year, we had worth of $100 billion of medical spend across the platform. This year, we'll be north of $115 billion and what you're seeing is, as we bring more rigor, better analytics, through a better system connectivity, we tie-in, more real-time, to delivery partners, you're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates. ", "And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're sitting on $190 million of prior-year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the three quarters last year. So from our perspective, there's some vagaries that happen quarter to quarter but on balance, we continue to get more accurate and for us, that's our aim. And as I mentioned at the outset, our medical costs continue to be well-controlled and they are coming in a little bit better than we expect in an aggregate, so that's great. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Baker from Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Michael Baker", "With the Section 1332 Waivers going into effect, January 2017, do you expect any states to meaningfully alter their approach to either addressing the broken public exchange and managing healthcare costs? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I would say we should be a little bit retrospect with respect to our view of how states will approach Exchanges and how Exchanges will play out in the new administration, so we're really not interested in commenting on that. What I would say is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying the environment in total, about going into managing the costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more relevant to the marketplace and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well.", "Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA and wherever that has played out, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country and that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating consistency and stability of it.", "Kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. I think commenting beyond that, particularly as new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody. So I think beyond commenting on that level, I don't think we are going to get into what's going to happen going forward on either a state basis or federal. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Christine Arnold", "A couple has been asked. On Medicaid, what are you seeing in terms of the rate outlook and the margin outlook there? I know some of the expansion states are coming through with some pretty hefty rate cuts. You continue to gain business so even though you've improved margins on the businesses new to you, so how do we think about that? And then with respect to OptumRx, you won -- you're going to doing Medicare Advantage. You're going to be growing PDP; you've got these new contracts offset by minor losses of membership relative to all of that and individual so top line looks like it is going to be up a lot. But if you have to give up margin with this new business, how should we think about the Optum margin next year -- Rx, OptumRx? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I thought you were going to Medicaid, so we'll start that way with Austin and then we'll finish with respect to the OptumRx. Austin? ", "Austin Pittman", "So there's really not a lot different in the Medicaid rating environment today than there has been over the past several years. As you know, states continue to be challenged to balance their budgets while continuing to develop new, high-quality programs to care for, as been mentioned already today, larger and larger populations and many of those populations with much more complex needs.", "We are honored to play a role in helping them do that and give consistency to both the quality, delivery and the consistency in cost for their programs. We continue to see race in the low single digits, keeping pace with medical and really, you've got to look at this, pluses and minuses in line with the specific economic situation of a particular state. So again, nothing particularly different. We continue to see things come out in line with our expectations. ", "Mark Thierer", "So it is true that we've seen good membership growth in MA and PDP and obviously, the performance in UnitedHealthcare has been strong, as has a number of other health plan clients that we service so we're not going to get into the 2017 outlook, as we've said that will be covered in the 2017 Investor Conference coming up. I will comment though on the margin profile. I think that we're very comfortable with the current margin profile. We've talked about performing in the 3% to 5% range. We've not had to underwrite business at a deficit and we're comfortable that the business will perform at that level for the foreseeable future. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.", "Chris Rigg", "Most of the big questions have been asked, but just to clarify on some questions on Optum. When you talk about the growth in Healthcare Delivery business and the behavioral services, one on the Healthcare Delivery side, is that primarily MedExpress and can you give us a sense for how the units have trended since you've acquired it in the Spring of 2015? And then on the behavioral side, when you say expansion into new Medicaid markets, are you -- does that mean you're layering a specialty service into existing Medicaid managed care contracts or it's completely new business line out at the Medicaid level? Thanks a lot. ", "Amir Dan Rubin", "Chris, this is Amir Rubin. I could take both of those. So we're continuing to see a lot of growth on the OptumCare side, both on the Local Care Delivery, our Medical Practices as well as on MedExpress. MedExpress, I think you -- specifically, we now have over 180 centers in 16 states and we're planning to grow to over 200 by year-end and we're continuing to see investments into the future there on that platform which has been very successful.", "In OptumCare, we're now managing approximately 20,000 physicians, serving over 8 million consumers, as I said, in almost now 51 geographic markets and so we'll continue to see growth there. We also serve through our special needs program in OptumHealth and our conference care management over 2000 specialty nursing facilities so we will continue to see growth there. On the behavioral side, we are seeing growth both at the Medicaid level and having success with wins in states as well as on the commercial side, selling more business to employers and through to health plans as well. ", "Chris Rigg", "But nothing that's actually structurally integrated into these new proposals and things like that. ", "Amir Dan Rubin", "Correct. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "It's basically operated on an open-market integrated basis. ", "Amir Dan Rubin", "Correct. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "So we'll take about two more questions, I think. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ana Gupte", "It sounds like with that 80.3% on the loss ratio, your Commercial Group underwriting spread seems like it's pretty stable. You sound confident on the cost trend. Any thoughts on the trends you're seeing in the selling season on pricing as the Blue Cross Blue Shield seem to have to expand on Exchanges and maybe sustaining more losses. Is that influencing their pricing posture? And then secondly, on the self-insured side, what are the mix shifts doing and is that, in any way, impacting the price competition in fully insured? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "I'm not sure I can piece that question together fully. I think it's really around pricing. We're not going to comment really about others or what others might be experiencing but we can kind of give you some commentary with respect to what our pricing philosophies are. And I think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to the coming years. So, Jeff? ", "Jeff Alter", "I will comment on what we see in the marketplace in general and I'll just say what we see in the marketplace in general is affirming of pricing particularly in the fully insured which has helped us to grow because of our remaining -- our historical discipline in pricing continues. We always price our businesses to our view of our forward-cost trends and as you look back into our 2014 year, that -- we took some losses because of that discipline and now as those markets begin to firm again, we're growing in those marketplaces.", "So I think the general tone in the marketplace right now is it remains a competitive environment and we believe that will continue through the 2017 season in small business in key accounts but most importantly, what we focus on is making sure our products add value to our clients and are priced appropriately for our forward view of cost. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "We're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the pricing environment. ", "Jeff Alter", "No. If anything, it's a pretty benign environment right now. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Both on the insured and self-insured one below. ", "Jeff Alter", "Yes. ", "Operator", "We will take our final question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "There have been a couple of criticisms of late which I think your quarter results -- congratulations to everyone. It kind of puts it that, but I'm going to ask this question anyway, because it comes up from time to time. So obviously, it's not possible for UnitedHealthcare to win all of this business on its merits but rather, it must be under pricing and therefore, must be crushing its margin.", "So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your -- seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your margins off the new business in the several coming quarters. How much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also, the ability to preserve margins, especially within UHC is ability to the -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units, not just in OptumCare, within OptumHealth or not just the UHC, with OptumInsight but all of it together.", "So I'm asking the same question I asked basically in the third quarter of 2011 and 2012 and beyond which is how much of your results is as a result of the transformation of United itself to a better, smarter integrated business with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, nevermind the transformation of the marketplace? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Well, as usual, Sheryl, your questions almost don't need answers. We are a profoundly different value proposition. We are -- we try to bring value to the marketplace through a much more diversified proposition and that each year, gets more effective, more integrated, more mature. And I think that, as Dave said in his commentary, six or seven years of steady growth in the UnitedHealthcare business, the growth across all of the platforms. It is a different proposition and I think that's -- really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter, in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance, as we continue to grow and expand the business and they are still a lot of opportunity. ", "We are far from our full potential and generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter. Expect to do it into the finish of the year. Have a positive attitude on 2017 and we're just going to keep working on that level so that, I think, it's a good way to close out the call. So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We reported solid growth in virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.", "We are going to leverage this forward momentum and expect to close 2016 with a real energy and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017. We will continue to elevate the quality of our service. I think that's really important for us. We are very focused on NPS and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the healthcare experience for consumers and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Our Investor Conference in November is just a few weeks away and we have held back a number of things this morning so that we can have a robust conversation with you in November. And we look forward to that. So thank you for your participation this morning. ", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Here are important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. ", "A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.", "Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 17, 2017 which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. We plan to keep our prepared remarks brief today. Just a month and a half ago, we held our annual investor conference and fourth quarter results are very much in line with or slightly stronger than we discussed at the conference. So our focus is now well in to 2017. ", "We ended the year with modestly stronger than expected growth across our businesses, and as the story has been throughout the year, customer retention and expanding relationships played a central role at our member and revenue growth for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.", "To briefly recap 2016, revenue of a 184.8 billion grew nearly $28 billion or 18%, as earnings from operations advanced over 20% to $13.3 billion. Revenues advanced 24% to $7.3 billion and adjusted net earnings per share grew 25% to $8.05 per share for the year. ", "Fourth quarter 2016 results included $47.5 billion in revenues, more than $3.5 billion in earnings from operations. Net earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.11. All of these results were at or modestly ahead of the expectations set at our investor conference in late November. ", "Operating cash flows for the year were $9.8 billion, 1.34 times net earnings, within our range of expectation despite timing changes in several state payments. We look forward to the opportunities of 2017, as we continue to drive our agenda of quality based net promoter or NPS performance and growth. ", "Building on the momentum of strong NPS gains in 2016, and that being we began 2017 with one of the stronger operational starts to a new year we\u2019ve ever had. We remain fully committed to meeting or exceeding the 2017 outlook we previewed with you at our investor conference, and Dave Wichmann and Larry Renfro will discuss, we have solid growth momentum going in to 2017, so we will turn to their commentary beginning with Larry. ", "Larry Renfro", "Thank you Steve. Customers of both UnitedHealthcare and Optum have been responding to our focus MPS, quality and value efforts. These are the building blocks of valuable, deep, long term relationships. Customer retention was a factor in UnitedHealth Group\u2019s 2016 growth and that continues as we answer 2017. ", "The healthcare customers we serve turn to us to solve large complex problems. UnitedHealthcare for example, is increasingly helping states managed care for their complex, highly vulnerable and most costly populations. We also continue assist employers with effective, innovative programs to support the needs of their retirees and employees challenged by chronic health issues. ", "For Optum, 2016 was a distinguishing year for developing and deepening relationships across healthcare, as we deliver more value to the market place. In the first quarter, we announced a strategic relationship with Walgreens, offering more choice and greater savings to both consumers and their sponsors. ", "We also entered in to a technology partnership with Availity, a leading health IT provider to meaningfully improve connectivity and processing for payer, care providers and consumers. In the second quarter, several audit organizations engaged Optum to deliver pharmacy care services in 2017, in response to our progressive clinical models for whole-person care.", "Quest Diagnostics joined us in the third quarter in collaboration that will span several of Optum\u2019s businesses starting with Optum 360. We were honored to receive several important multi-year contracts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and we partnered with Allscripts across OptumInsight and Optum Health. ", "In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to announce a new relationship with CVS Health that will strengthen their retail and our pharmacy care service offerings to the benefit of consumers. Moving in to this year, last week we announced we will join the Surgical Care Affiliates or SCA. This combination will expand the breadth of care delivery capabilities at Optum, as we continue to evolve a comprehensive ambulatory care platform including primary, urgent, surgical and homecare, all designed to deliver higher value and quality healthcare to consumers and payers. ", "Surgeons operating in SCA centers perform nearly 1 million surgeries annually in over 200 locations across 33 states with consistently high quality consumer satisfaction and improved value. ", "In SCA, we will grow and build upon a leader we know well in a high growth market. A market where we have already gained meaningful market presence, experience and insight through awesome care. The momentum inside our businesses comes from the growth and depth of these relationships and the breadth of sustainable value we can offer. ", "In 2016, Optum revenues grew 24% to $83.6 billion, as earnings from operations grew 32% to more than $5.6 billion slightly ahead of our most recent outlook. Fourth quarter 2016, was the first anniversary of the Catamaran acquisition and we were pleased with the operating earnings growth of 18% in the quarter for Optum overall, lead by 27% growth at OptumRx.", "Margins reached 8.1% in the fourth quarter and were 6.7% for the full year, up 40 basis points over 2015. Looking to 2017, OptumInsight\u2019s year-end backlog grew 21% to $12.6 billion. As we stand back from Optum and look at our progress, we are advancing the quality and consistency of our services to customers, simplifying our business, strengthening our leadership team and boasting our resources and investments in the most important growth trends in healthcare. ", "While there is more to be done in the United States and globally, the opportunities continue to grow even faster and larger. We are optimistic about our outlook for 2017, with revenues exceeding $90 billion and earnings from operations in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. ", "In 2017, at Optum and across UnitedHealth Group, we are committed to grow by developing stronger relationships, delivering consistent value to strengthen NPS and helping make health systems work better for more people. ", "Now let me turn it over to Dave. ", "Dave Wichmann", "Thank you Larry. UnitedHealthcare also enters 2017 with strong momentum. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 revenues were well balanced growing by double-digit percentages in every product category. Medical cost remained well managed with commercial medical cost trend ending the year in line with expectations at approximately 6%. ", "2016 was one of the strongest organic growth years in our history, with more than 2 million members joining. UnitedHealthcare continues to build well diversified growth momentum as customers and consumer retention rates continue to improve broadly, with notable strength in small and mid-sized commercial groups and in Medicare. ", "In the full risk commercial risk business, we grew by 205,000 people in the quarter and 375,000 people for the year providing a positive starting point as we enter 2017. This growth was broad based, appropriately priced and balanced across geographic regions, products and customer types. ", "In the self-funded segment, the market has been stable with strengthening employment rates helping us grow within existing customers. In 2016, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 335,000 commercial fee based consumers, including 20,000 more in the fourth quarter.", "As expected, individual business declined in the fourth quarter, premium deficiency reserves taken earlier this year were sufficient, and we maintained an appropriate and prudent residual reserve for claims not yet received. Consistent with our commitments too early in 2016, we did not ACA compliant individual business carries any financial exposure forward in 2017. ", "Turning to Medicare, in 2016 we grew our medical membership organically by 625,000 people, about two-thirds through Medicare advantage. 2016 was among our best Medicare growth years, but we expect 2017 to be even stronger. Our positive Medicare advantage performance in 2016 was driven by the combination premium and benefit stability, rising stars performance and improved service and clinical performance all leading to record retention rates. ", "These same factors are driving 2017 growth. We expect to serve nearly one million more senior will medical benefits this year including more than three quarters of a million seniors in Medicare advantage balanced and diversified by regions, channel and products. ", "Moving to Medicaid, adding 100,000 people in the quarter brought our full year growth to 585,000, once again broad-based and organic from new programs in both new and existing space. ", "In 2017, we will introduce services in the states of Virginia and Missouri and plan to enter Colorado via the pending partnership with Rocky Mountain Health plan, further expanding the number of state partners we serve. ", "As we recap the year, UnitedHealthcare revenues of $148.6 billion grew 13% year-over-year, virtually all organic as it has been over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by double digit percentage in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016. Earnings from operations exceeded $7.6 billion and grew at 13% or over $900 million. ", "Turning to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our fourth quarter revenues of $47.5 billion grew 9% over last year. The fourth quarter consolidated medical care ratio decreased 190 basis points to 80.8% slightly outperforming our recent investor conference outlook. ", "The full year care ratio of 81.2% improved 50 basis points year-over-year with core businesses overcoming both the pressures in the individual market in the first half of 2016, and the higher levels of reserve development in 2015. The full year operating cost ratio improved 30 basis points to 15.2% in line with our investor conference forecast. ", "As we step in to 2017, there are a number positive indications that reflect our continuing momentum. Our focus on quality and NPS\u2019s intensifying and bearing results. Consumers continue to engage more deeply in their health earning $255 million in healthy behavioral incentives in 2016. ", "We began the year crisply in customer installation and service on record levels of new and diversified growth across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum enters the year with record backlog, people served and adjusted scripts. And with Optum bank crossing the $7 billion mark in consumer health assets under management, Optum in pursuing a strong vision as a health service organization unlike any in existence today. ", "We will continue to develop our business to fit that vision in 2017. Our merger with SCA will significantly expand our capabilities for consumers, payers and hospital partners that often care, while establishing presence in new markets. ", "UnitedHealthcare enter the year with strong retention rates and new business growth across all three lines of business, and we are seeing improving performance and earnings contribution from our hospital company and health plan in Brazil. ", "We should touch briefly on Penn Treaty an industry topic we first discussed in 2010 that finally seems to be resolving. Penn Treaty is a financially distressed long term care insurance company with no affiliation to us. While we have never sold long term care policies, under state laws health insurers will be assessed a share of the guarantee funds needed to protect Penn Treaties policy holders. ", "We expect to accrue an approximately $315 million operating charge for our portion of the assessment. This charge will be funded over several years and the cash will be largely recovered through premium tax credits overtime. ", "While this outcome is well known, current accounting practice only allows this charge to be recognized when a final court order of liquidation is entered. When that ultimately occurs we will incorporate the impact in GAAP earnings, while excluding it from adjusted earnings per share. ", "To wrap, we remain committed to our outlook for 2017 revenues of $197 billion to $199 billion adjusted net earnings of $9.30 to $9.60 per share and cash flows from operations of $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Only 17 days in to the year, we think this posture strikes an appropriate balance of optimism and prudence. Steve?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thank you Dave. You may notice a separate press release this morning announcing that Tim Flynn has joined the Board of UnitedHealth Group. Tim is an exceptionally creative and solutions oriented executive, a former global managing partner of KPMG. Tim has deep financial and global operating expertise, he is also deeply versed in corporate governance, and we are thrilled to welcome Tim to our Board of Directors. ", "We\u2019ll close with a few words on the overall domestic healthcare landscape. To be clear, we have no better sense than anyone else concerning the timing or any ultimate actions with respect to the Affordable Care Act. So any questions and responses on that subject need to have that clear context. And as you would anticipate, we will not speculate on hypothetical or provocative questions in this area this morning. ", "Our posture has remained consistent for some time now. We remain positive and constructive with respect to what ultimately evolves in the next phase of healthcare change. We see the opportunity for robust, state based healthcare markets offering flexible commercial benefits, flexible Medicaid available to eligible as well as pain beneficiaries, well-structured and managed high risk pools, exchanges where space choose to sustain them and much more. ", "We believe all of these taken together can represent affective, local, state based coverage systems which can well accommodate those currently in the ACA individual exchanges, as well as serve as channels for further expanding coverage if that remains the focus. ", "We see this approach as being simpler, offering more flexibility, more choice and more affordability to both consumers and state and federal sponsors. And as we have for many years, we remain staunch advocates for affordable coverage infrastructure that supports a modern healthcare system including a strong and diversified future oriented healthcare work force and improvements to government sponsored benefits that incorporate better use of technology, information and care resources for Americans. ", "UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare remain full committed to our mission, to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Today we see more opportunities to serve and grow in the next 10 years than the past 10. We will remain and adaptable, innovative and restless enterprise. We see many ways we can work, our work can continue to improve, if we stay focused on that mission, and we are committed to pursue that goal in 2017 and a decade ahead. ", "We thank you for your interest today and now we\u2019ll take questions. Again one at a time please, and we\u2019ll try to respond as many as we can today. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Matthew Borsch", "I just was hoping that you could address the question to the Pennsylvania Medicaid contracts, and how the latest developed in the re-bid might or might not have affected your guidance relative to what you had already baked in for those contracts. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I\u2019ll have Austin do that, but those will that affect our guidance at all after \u201917. Austin?", "Austin Pittman", "Sure. First let me say that our commitment has been and still is to focus on the service of the people in Pennsylvania. That\u2019s what we get up and do every single day, so we\u2019re staying very focused there. As per the Medicaid program or health choices, as you know, we currently serve about 220,000 Pennsylvanians. The procurement process as has been noted has been particularly troubling to us both the lack of transparency and the material shifts and the outcome itself. ", "If you recall, we went from retaining our existing footprint and expanding state-wide in the initial ward to being eliminated from the program through this latest protest and rebid process. So we have formerly protest as others have. We\u2019re pursuing all of our available options to get transparency. As we get acquainted with the details, we\u2019ll take further action from there. In the meantime, as I said at the start we\u2019ll stay focused on serving the people of Pennsylvania. ", "Matthew Borsch", "Just on the guidance, I thought that Medicaid enrollment ads for this year included maybe a material number for Pennsylvania, was that wrong about that?", "Stephen Hemsley", "No I just think that this process will take some time. I think the protest will extend and I think we also have other opportunities throughout the course of the year. So I don\u2019t think that single state like that will affect our outlook. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ", "David Windley", "Acknowledging that your intent in OptumCare is to be multi-payer, I wondered if you could comment on how much of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s medical cost is flowing through OptumCare, what your goals for that might be and then how Surgical Care affiliates falls in to that or leverage that opportunity thanks? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think we\u2019ll have a Larry kind of comment on that. I guess I would focus on the fact that we serve multiple payers through our OptumCare platform have for some time that portfolio continues to expand SCA fits right in to it. ", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. Dave, I\u2019m going to go back a little bit and talk about how we kind of got where we are at with OptumCare, where we are in terms of SCA at this point in time. So if you go back in time five years ago, we had this one Optum plan that we put together and as part of that structure we had a 75 market strategy. ", "Now all this relates to UHC and how we have positioned Optum from the start. So with a 75 market strategy we\u2019ve kind of looked at the market place at a $500 billion market place that now has grown to $1 trillion. And as part of that, we have looked at what the growth pillars are going to be in the future and OptumCare is the piece of that, and that\u2019s where SCA will fit.", "And as SCA is a great organization that we are bringing in that\u2019s going to add scope and scale, it\u2019s going to be very complementary to what we\u2019re doing. So we feel pretty strong about SCA. We feel pretty strong about OptumCare being a big piece of our strategy going forward in the future to get to the breadth of the market that we\u2019re trying to penetrate. ", "I might ask Dan Schumacher to comment a bit about the UHC side. Dan?", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Thank you Larry. As we look at surgeries broadly, obviously the deal to winning a majority of those still take place in hospital setting both inpatient and outpatient and so the reality is that there is a huge opportunity for greater penetration for surgery to take place in an ambulatory setting. And when you look at the kind of quality that can be demonstrated through and ambulatory setting as well as the patient satisfaction that frankly runs north of 90 when you look at the net promoter scores and you see a cost profit that runs about half of what you\u2019d expect in an hospital setting, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity. ", "And within UnitedHealthcare for some time we\u2019ve been focused on sight of service for several years and we\u2019ve made some headway, but the reality is, we think there\u2019s an opportunity to really accelerate and we think the partnership with SCA provides a great potential. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "And if I\u2019m not speaking enough Dave Wichmann will correct me on this. A little less than half or roughly half of the flow that goes, the activity flow that goes through OptumCare is UnitedHealthcare and only 12% of SCA is UnitedHealthcare, is that true?", "Dave Wichmann", "That\u2019s right Steve. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jane Farr with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ", "Jane Farr", "United saw a strong Medicare growth in January. The penetration for the overall market went up more than I've ever seen in January versus December jobs. So, can you talk to your view of underlying long-term growth for Medicare Advantage, either for United specifically or the industry, and your view on where MA penetration could go now that we have the younger population aging in? If you have any numbers around how much of your (inaudible) growth was from fee for service that would be helpful as well?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. I think Steve Nelson can handle this. ", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. This is Steve Nelson. We will talk a little about our growth not speculating on the broader industry, but we did see higher this year as you noted and so the program continues to be really popular and very effective. ", "Just commenting on our growth, I\u2019d reiterate what Dave said in his prepared comment. The growth that we see coming out of AEP is very strong and in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided in our November investor conference. And one sort of an important point there is, about 85% of our full year guidance actually comes to us on January, so the bulk of that membership is already with us. ", "We have some pretty good insight in to the mix as well, and as you can - as we\u2019ve talked about before about half of that was from our group business so we\u2019ve a lot of insight in to that membership and in fact a lot of times we have claims experience there. And then we also had broad growth all of our geographies, markets and products. So really the product stability, the product portfolio, the offers choice is really resonating in the market.", "There are several drivers that I would attribute to at least our growth as we are experiencing this strong growth for 2017. Again the product portfolio that we\u2019ve worked hard over the past several years to put this in place. Also really strong engagement and with our distribution partnership across all of our channels really brand in the market for UnitedHealthcare and then also the investments and the improvements we\u2019ve made in as Dave noted in our stars quality and also in our member experience. ", "So I think this really positions us well to receive this growth and to continue to grow not only in 2017, but beyond. In terms of the conversions, it\u2019s a little early to get in to specific details about the conversions from fee for service, but again there was some market share growth and Medicare wedge overall, and I think it\u2019s a testament to the effectiveness of the program where you see higher outcomes, lower costs and very high satisfaction. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Thanks Steve. And despite the fact that MA has been underfunded over the last several years, it continues to take share with or take 1.3% or 1.5% market share shit is the indication. That\u2019s been pretty steady despite the fact that it\u2019s been underfunded. It is clearly the most popular form of Medicare; it serves the lower income groups. It has great retention value, and we would think that that will continue so that the share of Medicare Advantage will ultimately continue to grow and take its place in terms of the government programs. Next question please. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Justine Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ", "Steve Baxter", "This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. A question for you about the OptumInsight backlog. Appreciating that the backlog here is at a record level, but we noticed that it was flat sequentially for the first time since 2013 heading into the ACA implementation. I was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from clients, and in particular, are you seeing any uncertainty with hospital buying patterns just given the uncertainty of where we might be going with (inaudible) and replace?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Larry you want to take it or Bill Miller. ", "Larry Renfro", "I will start and then I will hand it to Bill. I think that if you look at fourth quarter you\u2019ll see that we had a pretty strong fourth quarter specially OptumInsight and Bill will speak to that in a second. So all of our financials were in line with our expectations. ", "One thing to keep in mind, when it comes to technology services and how we look at Optum360 across the board is that we are very diversified. When we really serve is 300 health plans, 4500 hospitals, over a couple of hundred government agencies and so forth. So we have a lot of opportunity and its diversified opportunity. So Bill just comment on the quarter.", "Bill Miller", "We\u2019re real happy with our performance in Q4 and a part of that confidence in going forward and with respect to the pipeline and the backlog is, there\u2019s several metrics that we look at and while hospital is one sector that we work with, you understand that we have a really wide constituencies of payer provider life sciences companies and government and across the board we\u2019re seeing enormous growth in our pipeline. Our sales and some of the size of the sale in each of those geographies have clients has grown dramatically year-over-year. ", "And if I look at and search for slow-downs, we don\u2019t see it because if you look at the solutions that we provide, they are mission-critical, they are implementing marked technology, they have proven ROI. So we\u2019re not seeing the slow-down that perhaps is being felt in other places because of our diversity, the mission critical nature of our solutions that we bring to market. And so we are seeing wide adoption.", "And with respect to the backlog, while they may have been a little flat in this quarter-over-quarter, if you look at the year-over-year growth it\u2019s a tremendous story. If you look at any given quarter, we\u2019re going to burn through some backlog, there\u2019s projects that get completed and so that doesn\u2019t concern us. ", "I think we look at the year-over-year metric and feel really positive and heading in to \u201917, if you look at how much time we spent in the market, the way we\u2019ve developed our products and the interviews that we do with clients and the expansion of all of our key clients, it sets us up for another really successful year, despite of the fact that there is some uncertainty about ACA and others. That uncertainty always creates opportunities for Optum because clients are looking for ways to thrive and survive in these uncertain times and Optum becomes a really relative and significant client and partner to talk to in those context. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree with that more. Next question please?", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Peter Costa", "Can you give us some more specifics on a couple of (inaudible) in the quarter, in particular the unfavorable development in the fourth quarter and the higher interest and other income in the quarter?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure, we\u2019ll split those out, maybe Dan the development and John Rex, the investment income. ", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Good morning Peter. Dan Schumacher. Let me offer a couple of comments about medical overall and more specifically to your question around development. Now as you look at our consolidated medical care ratio for the quarter, it was a little bit than what we had discussed at the end of November and then inside that I\u2019d tell you that our medical cost continued to be well controlled. ", "And the other thing, as you look at development sort of quarter in and quarter out, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that it\u2019s on a base of medical spend on an annual basis of more than a $115 billion. So when you look at the outcomes this quarter in particular, it isn\u2019t particularly meaningful. ", "Looking specifically at this quarter, I\u2019d tell you that if you look across it both from a geography perspective look across categories I don\u2019t think that there is anything that is worth highlighting. I would tell you that it probably orients a little bit more towards our government businesses, and underneath that we\u2019ve talked overtime about some of the efforts we\u2019ve had around incentives related to quality and the underlying use that comes with that and we\u2019ve seen some of that this quarter and that\u2019s showing up in those outcomes.", "But importantly and overall I\u2019d tell you that our medical base line is for our all of our businesses, we are tracking in line with our expectations as we close the year and that means that we are starting 2017 where we had planned. ", "John Rex", "Peter, this is John Rex on investment income. Really two major elements driving most of that put in the category just larger balances outstanding due to the growth we\u2019re seeing at UHC and Optum Bank. So those are large interest earning balances across those books. In addition higher realized capital gains for our investment portfolio. ", "So, we did some pro-active portfolio of re-alignment ahead of the fed interest rate actions to capture some of that value and compare to our reinvested higher rates going forward as those occurred and so we wanted to be proactive as we are anticipating those events. Let\u2019s say, if I take both those elements rather balanced in terms of the higher investment income that you\u2019re seeing in the quarter. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ", "Scott Fidel", "Steve wanted to ask a thematic question here, just as we enter into the whole discussion around corporate tax reform, and just thinking about the minimum medical loss ratios in that context. Clearly it hasn't seemed like the (inaudible) LMRs have proven to be that big of a deal the last couple of years, but just now as we think about corporate tax reform and then leveraging the benefits of that, do you think it might make sense for the industry to perhaps get more proactive on rethinking the minimum LMRs and maybe lobbying to have some relief there, or basically the question is do you think that minimum LMRs could end up offsetting a lot of the benefits to shareholders from corporate tax reform or not? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "So again Scott we\u2019re not really engage in commentary around policy or what could or couldn\u2019t happen. The only comment I\u2019d make about MLRs and why they were probably not as controversial is because for the most part our offerings were pretty close to those MLR levels anyway. So they\u2019re pretty much across the board. So that\u2019s why I think that they were managed and digest across the industry. And beyond that, we\u2019re just not going to comment on what tax policy could be or what might come forward in terms of changes in the ACA. ", "Our commentary with the market place has really been more broadly about what could be simpler, more sustainable, local market based coverage approaches. So that\u2019s kind of where our level of commentary has been. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. ", "Ralph Jacoby", "Just want to go back to the SCAI deal; obviously it looks like a platform deal in what's a fragmented market. So one, just wanted to make sure I understand the strategy, is it to sort of accelerate the M&A pace or is it a little bit more of a test model, if you will for now? And then how will you navigate, and maybe have you had conversations with all of the various partnerships and JVs, some of which are obviously with other payers as well as hospital systems that could create some friction?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Sure. Larry will comment on this, but we think this step is an important development step. So we think this is a market leading platform we can build on, so we do think it\u2019s important that it fits nicely in to the whole narrative of more comprehensive, local market base, ambulatory care platform. So that\u2019s the high level thinking behind it. Larry you want to pick it up?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure, and I\u2019m going to ask Tami to talk about the footprint so that you get a feel for the footprint and how everything is going to work together inside Optum in regard to SCA and why it\u2019s a primary focus for us. And then I\u2019m going to ask Amir Rubin really to talk about what\u2019s been going on in the diligence side of this and what the business looks like. ", "I will caution you that we are in an approval process. So during this approval process there\u2019re certain things obviously that we can\u2019t do, but I think I can lay out the strategy and these folks will be able to pack it up. I probably didn\u2019t do a good job a few minutes ago of explaining it, but this goes back five years. This is a strategy that we put in place to really go after what I would call the OptumCare business as one of our primary pillar for growth. ", "We started with primary care and I think you know that we\u2019ve been growing primary care over the last few years. We\u2019re probably around 21,000 physicians at this point. The second part of OptumCare was our urgent care with Med Express and other centers that we have set up with urgent care. So we\u2019re up to 250 centers there. So obviously the surgery center kind of starts to play out and add capabilities for us as we go forward. ", "So this is all about growth, and this is about us maintaining our physician with the ambulatory side to really make this move forward, not only here but also globally. Because as we look and I\u2019m going to stray here but just for a second, but I would tell you that the work that we are doing in Brazil, the work that we\u2019re doing in London, what we\u2019re expecting to do across Europe and so forth. This is all a process that would fit nicely in all of those markets.", "So let me turn it over to Tami to kind of go through the footprint. ", "Tami Reller", "Thanks Larry, and maybe just a couple of OptumCare broader perspectives and numbers to give this context before Amir talks specifically about SCA. If you look at OptumCare today, it already represents more than 50% of OptumHealth revenues. And obviously this is an important growth platform, so we expect more in the future. Also if you look at OptumCare, today we have a footprint in 28 primary care markets that expect to expand in to four to six new markets per years. ", "And so as we look at the opportunity between OptumCare broadly and SCA which today has 200 locations in 33 states which we noted earlier, there is an opportunity there to really look at that much more holistically and make some good growth come from that. ", "Larry also noted the more 21,000 physicians today and we would expect to continue to grow that as a nice clip in to the future as well OptumCare probably 2,000 per year as we move forward. So a tremendous amount of growth ahead across the OptumCare platform. ", "Amir Rubin", "This is Amir Rubin, just to add to Larry and Tami\u2019s comments. We did a detailed due diligence process and we were very, very impressed with the exceptional SCA leadership and the model that SCA has developed across the country. As you heard from Steve\u2019s opening remarks, SCA has over 200 centers in 33 states and these are terrific centers with outstanding quality accredited and certified by the highest accreditation bodies NPS scores, Net Promoter Scores of 90 on average, really high net promoter scores delivering outstanding surgical procedures that have the cost of inpatient settings in partnership with surgeons, in partnership with health systems, many of whom are our clients and serving communities very effectively. ", "As you heard from Tami, we\u2019re excited too. There\u2019s a nice overlap, probably about 50% overlap with the SCA market and the OptumCare market, and moreover SCA and its surgeons and the health systems that it partners with, are now looking to move even more complex cases in to the ambulatory arena such as joint replacements, hips and knees and really on the front end of delivering high quality, high service and value based care, serving all care, UnitedHealthcare, as you\u2019ve heard from Dan Schumacher and across OptumCare we serve over 85 cares that we are very excited to continue serving the broad payer market partnering with our health system clients and aligning with physician for the community. ", "Larry Renfro", "This is Larry again. Let me just make one comment. So if you looked at our 75 market strategy that we\u2019ve been executing against today, we are in 28 markets. With this acquisition, we will pick up about 17 more markets. So about 50% of SCA markets overlap with 17 new markets. So this is going to accelerate our growth obviously, and this is a very, very key point in the growth of OptumCare.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. ", "Josh Raskin", "Wanted to follow up, I understand Steve you don't want to speculate on potential regulatory changes etcetera, so without getting into any details on what you're expecting. One, have you spoken with the incoming President-elect or his team, and then are there any changes that you\u2019ve made strategically already? So forgetting about what can happen in the world, but is there anything you're doing in the markets today that would relate to some things that you think could potentially happen?", "Stephen Hemsley", "Josh, I would have preferred to answer the last one compared to this one. We\u2019ve maintained an presence broadly in the healthcare sector, again policy sector, and have been consistent for some time, and I think you\u2019ve seen our materials with respect to really advancing a simpler state-based healthcare system around investments going forward in to the healthcare sector around affordability and good sustainable ways to advance affordability. ", "Systematically very much involved and we have been offering specific ideas with respect to that. It aligns with the businesses that we\u2019ve had in the philosophy and the mission of our enterprise about helping people live healthier lives and about making the system work better for everyone, everyone being all the participants in the healthcare market place. ", "It has been more at a, what I would call, a high level and then invoked more specifically when called upon. We think that\u2019s a sustainable way, we have been on this for some time, prior to the outcome of any elections etcetera. So we would have been indifferent in terms of who would have proceeded that these would be the kinds of themes that we think will drive a better and higher performing healthcare systems that could serve more Americans. ", "And we continued to be on that track and I think the setup of that business as we\u2019ve said many times, the participation across the expanse of the benefit market and the continued diversification in the important markets with Optum, serving areas that where we think we can bring our competencies around, expertise around information and insights about how healthcare could be organized and resources used more affectively and the virtuous application of technology to drive a more modern healthcare system. Those are things that are really native to our businesses at this point in time, very adaptable, so adaptability is a very important thing for us. ", "We can move these things around to approach the market place in different ways, and we think we have been developing the kind of assets and capabilities to serve a healthcare system and combinate a variety of approaches. So that has kind of philosophy and that has been our narrative with the policy community and expert community and will continue to stay in a positive constructive posture in that way because I think it\u2019s - this as we\u2019ve said many times will continue to evolve both as a market place and in terms of national policy. ", "So I don\u2019t know what I could tell you more than that, that\u2019s kind of the philosophy we bring to it and it\u2019s the same philosophy that we speak in Washington and in state capitals, and I think it has and I think it will continue to serve us well and I think be positive to the healthcare market place. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ", "Michael Baker", "I was wondering if you could comment or give an early read on the PBM selling season in terms of potential for activity versus what we saw for the last selling season.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Mark you want to comment?", "Mark Thierer", "It\u2019s busy, it\u2019s busy. This last year we really felt good about the big wins that we posted. It was the largest selling season obviously in our history. But at this point in the selling season we\u2019re queuing up for lots of new employers and health plans are coming to market as well. So I would say right now our pipeline is larger than it\u2019s ever been. And I will just take a moment and tell you, in this business you have to start your new business well, because the market checks and - it\u2019s a small business and we\u2019ve just had our best one won I think in the history of the business our readiness and our preparation for some very large scale clients was I think superior and we are gauging this by how our clients are reacting and the NPS scores that we\u2019re seeing.", "So this successful won one on last year\u2019s selling season sets us up very well for the 2017 selling season. As I said the pipeline is robust. We are pushing our new value prop and we do think that the synchronization message is totally resonating and clients are migrating towards it. So we are feeling pretty good about our opportunity in 2017. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from AJ Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "A.J. Rice", "I might just ask a two-part question on the international business. I think the comments were made in the prepared remarks that you're pleased with the progress you've made down there and I noticed that fourth quarter you had good enrollment in Brazil. You have to go back to fourth quarter of last year for a positive sequential enrollment as well, I don't know if there's something seasonality that drives that or some other dynamic that's going on. ", "But can you just give us an update on where things stand there, and where you are at relative to contribution margins. And the other aspect on international I was just going to ask you about is I think you guys have commented that there are some contracts that Optum is looking at, particularly in the UK, potentially. Can you give us any update on the timing of when we might see those?", "Dave Wichmann", "A.J. it\u2019s Dave. I think I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then ask Larry to comment on the Optum contracts in particular. A.J. I wish I could say that was organic growth down in Brazil, but it was actually a small acquisition that we completed of both a health insurance company and a healthcare company. So it\u2019s an integrated delivery system that serves the ABC region near Sao Paolo. It\u2019s named Santa Elaina and it is a very strong, well performing local delivery system there that really serves the lower end of the middle class broadly. ", "So it added about 250,000 lives or so to our quarter. Maybe I\u2019m not really sure how to respond to the contribution margin comment, but I will say that we do see an improved outlook for Amil and now what is called Americas (inaudible) which is our large national healthcare delivery system predominantly hospital based in Brazil. Of course the political and economic instability certainly aren\u2019t helping the business today, but we have seen nice progress and we have an improved outlook for 2017 for the business. ", "You probably have noticed that we made a couple of augmentations to our leadership team down there. We just brought on Claudio Lottenberg, who was the former President of the Albert Einstein Health System. He is a fantastic leader, very well regarded across Brazil and we think he\u2019ll be a terrific addition to our business.", "We also named a Louis DeLuca to run our Americas health system. He came to us from Samaritano which was the large hospital that we acquired in San Paolo. And then we\u2019ve also added a number of other physicians in the business. I think strengthening leadership and importantly as we come across a five year anniversary looking to make sure that we have a very strong leadership team in place as we transition a generation. ", "Our new team is performing very well, they are focused on more modernized health system and building a strong healthcare infrastructure, and we continue to remain bullish and optimistic about not only the prospects for Amil and Americas (inaudible) but also Brazil broadly. Larry you\u2019re going to touch on Optum?", "Larry Renfro", "Sure. A.J. its Larry. I think on the last earnings call, we talked a little about that. We have been building a foundation in London in the UK area, and we had spent past year really getting our self positioned in what I would call the new models care. We would know it here as the ACLs. As they are starting to take their trust and trust over there are their hospitals, and they are starting to put them together in certain segments of the country, and they\u2019re looking for services that we provide whether that be hospital type services or what we are doing with OptumCare. That\u2019s why there is a very large overlap here when you start talking about OptumCare and what we might be able to do in the UK area. ", "We are in bid and discussions with about five different areas, I won\u2019t go in to them from a competitive standpoint, and we believe in the first 6 to 9 months of this year, we shall start to see some outcome. So there\u2019s no question that it got delayed with Brexit and they\u2019ve had some change in terms of leadership and we\u2019ve had to establish ourselves with new leadership which just takes time. It\u2019s not an issue of them wanting to, they understand our model, a lot of the ministers have been here and they have visited our locations to see the integrated care and how we operate and so forth. ", "SCA should be a positive in terms of how we might look at that eventually, not right away in the UK. So I guess one part of the question is, we\u2019ve got the circled areas that we\u2019re talking about that we are in bids on right now, 6 to 9 months we should start to see some outcomes there and we feel pretty solid about that. ", "The other path we\u2019re going down is on what I\u2019ll call national programs and the big national programs is what I would call a national database where we could bring our data and analytics in to play. Again we are in the process with that and I would think that timing might be a little slower, it might six months, 3 to 6 months and the decision is ours. ", "So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. We\u2019ve got a good team, we\u2019re moving some senior leaders over to the UK and again I think that come summer time we should start to see some results there. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "We\u2019ll do two or three more questions. So the next please. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Kevin Fischbeck", "You said in the commentary that the exchange performance was better year-over-year. Was that simply just a lack of a PDR from the prior year or you\u2019re actually seeing stabilization. I think you last quarter you said that the Q3 results and the exchanges were stabilizing, wanted to see the color down to Q4.", "Stephen Hemsley", "I think it\u2019s broadly stable. ", "Dan Schumacher", "Kevin, its Dan Schumacher. I think the point we\u2019re making there is, last year we recorded the Premium Deficiency Reserve to provide for losses in 2016, and so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, you had to drag in \u201915 and then we resolved the PDR and the exchanges in the fourth quarter this year. So that\u2019s the improvement we are talking about year-over-year. ", "Kevin Fischbeck", "So versus Q3 it was stable?", "Dan Schumacher", "Versus Q3?", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Expectations versus Q3?", "Dan Schumacher", "Yeah, generally in line with expectations. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "Our view on exchanges haven\u2019t changed. Next please. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ", "Lance Wilkes", "Yeah, I had a question on PBM margins, and just wanted to know a couple of points on those. One, as you saw improvement for the quarter, how much of that is mergers synergies and how much - as you look into 2017 of your merger synergy plan are you through? And then related to that would be what sort of trends are you seeing from both manufacturers and rebates on the cost side and what are the trends like on the client side as you look at your margins? ", "Stephen Hemsley", "So that is about a four-part question Mark, so do you want to --?", "Mark Thierer", "So let me just talk about margins in this business. We\u2019ve talked for some time now that we\u2019re comfortable with operating margins in the 3-5 points, and so you asked about synergies. We met and actually exceeded our $0.30 commitment in the 2016 planned year. We\u2019ve not provided a specific outlook on synergies for \u201917, but I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve got running room in the plan and work to do still to extract synergies from the combination. So that has exceeded our expectations and been very solid and I would like to just tip the hat to the operating team who\u2019s made this work happen, it\u2019s been exceptional. ", "You asked about rebates and the picture going forward. This is the thing that we\u2019re paid to do. We\u2019re paid to go to the supply chain on behalf of our clients and extract savings for the benefit of the consumer and obviously for the plants sponsor. So we think that we\u2019ve created a business model here where we have best-in-class contracting capabilities that we take not just to the pharmaceutical industry, but we take it to the retail chains, we take it to the biotech manufacturers and we take it to the generic manufacturers as well as the wholesalers. ", "So this entire supply chain, this is our job to extract savings for the benefit of the member and for the benefit of the plan sponsor, and the outlook for that in this coming year is really very solid. Hopefully that answers your question.", "Stephen Hemsley", "Next question please. This will be our last. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Thank you so much, and I will try not to make it too difficult for you this time. So you've obviously had very significant success across UHC as well as across Optum, and I'm going to ask a similar question to what I asked in a different way. We've also noticed some interesting trends on utilization, despite some spiking from the ACA in hospital based utilization, particularly in patient care. ", "And I'm wondering if you can help me to understand what steps you are taking and what you can attribute your management of cost trend, presumably related to appropriate controls on appropriate sites of care, and what the outlook might be given that you're now bringing OptumCare into a higher level of scale and capabilities with surgical care for your ability to further improve your cost trends through improved coordination and appropriateness of sight and timing and place of care? ", "Mark Thierer", "Well you\u2019ve kind of defined the space in the question, so you clearly have grasped the idea. The ambulatory platform that we are forming is in fact a very important and viable proposition in and of itself, it represents the more organized, more informed deployment of resources in terms of ambulatory care and very much focused on the appropriateness of setting. ", "It also plays to themes that are clearly moving in the market place where these services are moving in to these better venues and in fact technology is a very powerful element behind it both in process and so forth. So it creates a better resource platform to serve consumers and that has implications for all that we serve. It is a multi-payer platform in UnitedHealthcare, it is an enterprise that is very effective and advancing on those and it provides them an advantage in terms of how they deploy it and integrate in to their offerings. So kind of that is a start, do you want to pick it up?", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning Sheryl, Dan Schumacher. The only thing I would add, if you kind of look at it over the last eight years right, we\u2019ve been able to drive down on a per capita basis inpatient, and inside that we\u2019ve focused a lot in those early years around the conversion of inpatient to outpatient. And I think this is sort of the continued evolution as we focus more on the side of service to how do we get that outpatient in to the ambulatory setting. ", "So we\u2019ve continuing to introduce more steps in controlled measures on the front end, but more importantly trying to put in incentives at the surgeon level that really can help drive to the most appropriate settings. So the combination of (inaudible) structure with the consumer providing a strong motivator and then likewise on the delivery side trying to put incentives in place for the surgeons to be able to drive towards a more appropriate use.", "So we really look at this partnership as an opportunity to really strengthen our value orientation, both in our product designs as well as in our relationships with the professionals that are providing these surgeries. ", "Stephen Hemsley", "And the OptumCare platform is free standing value up all by itself, so we basically have kind of a two-dimensional agenda going here and I think that\u2019s - whether that\u2019s core of your question and you\u2019ve grasped what we are doing in OptumCare very well. So again thank you for joining us today. I think the takeaways from this call are pretty straight forward that UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare represent a strong, diverse, well performing enterprise driven by mission and culture with strong leadership team, dedicated employees.", "We remain very committed to taking our performance to even higher levels of quality, value, growth, shareholder return and service to emerging needs of enormous global healthcare market place. So we continue to evolve and adapt to serve that market, helping people live healthier lives and making the system work better for everyone. ", "Thank you for joining us we\u2019ll see you next question. Thanks.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information.", "This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws.

I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the halfway point of 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare continued to grow and perform strongly and we expect our performance momentum to carry forward through the balance of this year into 2018 and beyond. UnitedHealthcare has been a distinctive organic growth leader over the last seven years. During that same time Optum has emerged as the leading force for broadly enabling the healthcare industry with market leading data analytics and practical and innovative approaches to longstanding market challenges. These businesses are strong, stable, and exceptionally complementary to each other, growing and operating effectively while continuing to diversify naturally into adjacent healthcare markets.", "With a socially sensitive global healthcare market constantly challenged and changing we see UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare built for that environment. Adaptable and creative, focused on the people and customers we serve, working with others and playing our role in leading and supporting progressive change across health systems. One important constant is our commitment to mission and the quality of our work, the positive experience and value we drive on behalf of consumers and customers, and their cultural bonds of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation, and accountable performance we seek to bring to everything we do.", "We are at home in the current environment. UnitedHealth Group is a different organization than we were just 10 years ago and you should expect us to be different still a decade from now. Society will continue to need and drive change in healthcare, we will continue to adapt and evolve with it and on behalf of it. We are committed to reaching the full potential that UnitedHealth Group has to offer, knowing the next 10 years hold more opportunity than the last 10, those who are committed to keep evolving, perform consistently, and deliver value. ", "To guide our progress we have a strong, deep, and restless leadership team in place which will continue to positively evolve and change as well. I'll turn to three of those leaders Dave Wichmann, Larry Renfro, and John Rex to take us through our second quarter earnings report. Dave?", "David S. Wichmann", "Thank you, Steve. We enter the second half of 2017 in a strong position. UnitedHealth Group is serving more people more consistently with greater levels of measurable satisfaction than ever. We are reaching, helping, and staying connected to the people we are privileged to serve in more ways and through more channels both digitally and physically in the communities where we work. We are caring for more people, closing more gaps in care, and producing more savings and value for consumers and sponsors.", "We are partnering more deeply and impactfully with care providers in part because our nearly 25,000 OptumCare doctors are dedicated to serving patients affiliated with more than 80 payers across the nation including UnitedHealthcare. That experience helps us to think more broadly than most about topics like the application of technology to enhance the consumer experience, the use of data, analytics and data exchange, effective management of healthcare resources and evidence based protocols, and healthcare quality, consistency and payment models that better serve people and plan sponsors.", "Today we serve 139 million people globally including 126 million people in the United States. And we see UnitedHealth Group's U.S. and global market potential as with all practical limit at this early stage in the evolution of our company. Second quarter results followed things from our first quarter performance. In the second quarter the company produced strong and balanced revenue growth pacing to exceed the $200 billion mark this year. Medical costs were in line with expectations. Operating costs continued to be well contained. The company generated strong cash flows up 29% year-over-year as adjusted net earnings grew 26% over last year's second quarter to $2.46 per share. ", "For the first half of 2017 adjusted net earnings grew 28% year-over-year to $4.83 per share. UnitedHealthCare continued to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter. Excluding the individual market, UnitedHealthCare grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year including 1.7 million more in the first half of 2017. This continues our consistent, multiyear organic growth performance across all three major businesses.", "This growth has been fueled by a long history of restless products and service innovation responding to and even sometimes driving market evolution. This focus towards innovation has advanced the data, information, and tools to support both individual efforts to achieve better health and system wide efforts to deliver better healthcare. A business model increasingly centered on serving the unique healthcare needs of consumers, we are performing in serving new populations such as group Medicare Advantage, people with complex conditions served by Medicaid programs in emerging markets like Brazil as well as in longstanding well established markets. Healthcare is essential to everyone, individually and to the quality and productivity of societies and we aim to serve it all in one way or another, one person at a time to the best of our abilities.", "A dedicated compassionate workforce of 260,000 people serving in local communities built on UnitedHealth Group values and singularly aimed at helping people live healthier lives and helping make our health system work better for everyone. They are led by a deep and stable UnitedHealthcare leadership team that has worked together for more than a decade. And finally our commitment to quality in everything we do, in advancing net promoter scores both strengthening customer and consumer retention and care provider relationships across all of our businesses. ", "In many ways we are still just getting started but you can see the momentum in our results.

But we can offer directionally suggests the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and we feel positively about our ability to perform and grow in 2018.", "Like any year 2018 will have its share of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds are largely organic and company specific. Among them we would include continuing growth momentum and performance particularly with customer retention as our focus on NPS improves, increasingly effective capabilities to manage and contain medical costs, the improving leverage of our operating infrastructure, and our continuing efforts to optimizing capital management, investment income, tax cost, and other areas.", "The headwinds are largely around externalities.

We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Justin Lake", "Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the OptumCare business but first let me congratulate Andrew on the new role and then given the optimism on future growth here that was discussed, hoping you could put some numbers around the opportunity, maybe share with us the current revenue profile for 2017 that\u2019s expected here? And then where do you see the ultimate business opportunity in terms of the TAM as you continue to roll out your 75 target MSAs and then maybe share where you think is the sustainable growth rate for this segment of the business going forward? Thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Justin you seem to have captured all the appropriate themes maybe we'll have Larry start and then Andrew pick that up.", "Larry C. Renfro", "Sure. Justin that's a good question and it\u2019s an appropriate question but I thought I might since we're going to talk about growth and maybe give you kind of a general view of growth across Optum for a second and then we\u2019ll get to Andrew but I'm going to ask some other people to talk about growth as well. I'm probably going to bring in Tim Wicks from a financial standpoint. And John Prince from a PBM standpoint and Eric from Optum360. But we\u2019ll lead off with Andrew in a second. There's really just some three areas of what I'd call metrics that we pay attention to when we are looking at our growth across Optum. Number one is are our sales pipeline and I think you hit that and again I'm talking about Optum in general. And our pipeline today is greater than $40 billion and it's a strong, strong pipeline and that's not including what I would call mega deals. This is excluding them but we have a very robust pipeline of about $40 billion. ", "Our sales year-to-date is around 23 billion and that 23 billion would compare to last year's sales in 2016 in total of about 30 billion. The year before at about 10 billion so you can see the growth that's taken place from an overall sales perspective. The third area on the metrics would be how we look at our backlog and Eric Murphy will talk about that in a second but it's up and I think I mentioned it in the script 19% and year-over-year about $2.1 billion. So as we have really kicked this year off and what we've done through the first six months has been very robust in all three of those areas. So let me switch over to Andrew and let Andrew talk specifically about what the question that you asked and then we're going to walk through some of the other growth areas as well. Andrew? ", "Andrew Hayek", "Thanks Larry, good morning Justin. So as you know we have a belief that there's a significant opportunity to improve the quality, the experience, and the cost of healthcare on a national basis creating value for patients and the marketplace. And the experience over the past several years has been that physicians can achieve outstanding results when empowered with the right analytics, tools, and support. And the market is asking for these kinds of models to improve the cost, quality of care. So our approach is to tailor our market presence based on the local factors in each market that we serve, leveraging primary care, urgent care, surgery centers, and house calls, leveraging technology and tools from across Optum to create value for our patients and for our care providers. We are building this in a multi payer manner serving all payers in the markets that we serve and we believe your question that the market potential is very significant, the depth of the issues resolving, the value we can create for patients into the marketplace is very significant, and we look forward to creating a business multiples of our current size. ", "Tim Wicks", "Justin, it is Tim Wicks, let me jump in as well and talk about overall Optum revenues. So, overall total revenue and unaffiliated revenue growth were both in line with our expectations on the quarter. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together had double-digit unaffiliated revenue growth for the quarter as well. I would point also then to OptumRx and just want to clarify this work in the supply chain that we've been doing is translating into lower drug costs for consumers and customers and that really would translate then into lower external revenue for this quarter even though external scripts were up year-over-year. As you know we never apologized UHC's growth and UHC grew faster in the quarter which is obviously a positive impact to our revenue as well. So as we look at the quarter our revenue and product mix are on plan for yield. Total revenue and external revenue both in line with our expectations.", "John Prince", "Justin, this is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I just wanted to talk a little about OptumRx and how we are doing. We're halfway through the year. We are hitting our new business targets and we remain very confident about hitting our full year target. Our retention is very strong, we have renewal rates in the high 90's. As Larry mentioned in the script we're very honored about the award from the State of New Jersey. That deal actually brings us more than 700,000 new members. We see a broad trend that large, sophisticated buyers are very attracted to our pharmacy care services model, it is very differentiated in the market. We've had some other normal wins and we have a health plan wins and also we have renewed our health plan clients who are out too this year. We have several new wins through the healthcare transformation alliance which we announced last quarter. I would say overall we are very optimistic about OptumRx's compelling buyer proposition in the market, it is resonating well and we are seeing very good results. ", "Eric Murphy", "Thanks John. Justin, Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. To Larry's point around regarding Optum360 as well as our backlog, regarding Optum360 we are in late stage assessments with four major delivery systems. Our qualified pipeline for Optum360 is up 60% year-over-year. The sales cycles in this side of the market as we've shared in the past are elongated and we're working diligently right now to improve the assessments that we do with our clients and prospects in this area to be able to get to value proposition discovery in the shorter period of time to generate results for these delivery systems. And then finally I would share we\u2019re bullish on where we land for the year regarding backlog of between $15 billion and $16 billion for 2017. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So that was more than you asked for Justin but a very fulsome answer so the next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ", "David Windley", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I will switch over to OptumRx, some recent comments that you made quantified the channel savings that you're making reference to this morning at savings I think on a PMP wide basis of about $1300. I also quantified $200 of medical, what I might call mock on savings or what I believe to be your evidence of the value of synchronization and I wondered if you could maybe elaborate on that and talk about where you think that $200 can go?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Sure. John, do you want to respond to that. ", "John Prince", "Sure. David, this is John Prince. I am not sure I followed all the math that you're doing but let me take it at a high level. I think you know I see at the high level happening and if you just look at our external client market is that our number of clients we serve is up, our number of scripts is up but actually the revenue is sort of flat on a per script basis and I think that is really what you see is that the value that we're doing really looking at net best cost for clients as we are delivering that. And I think that is also why our story is resonating in the market in terms of the value that we bring to our clients. What we're also seeing is that even though we're delivering that value our external product gross margin actually is up year-over-year. ", "So actually we're getting the margin online business was driven by that more volume. So we're actually getting greater margin on it but we're actually delivering that value back to the client. When we're going out into the market we're actually talking about not just the pharmacy cost but we're talking about total cost of care. So what you are seeing in the revenue here that\u2019s our story of the market around pharmacy cost but our real value story as you go to market is people looking at total cost of care. And so we actually have a story in the market which we're talking to that actually talks about how we save a client $11 to $16 per month as they talk about our full synchronized solution. And that is what our clients are receiving. In our UHC book about 30% of the clients have that synchronized value. We also do that on a direct basis and also with other partners in terms of other health plans that we served in the market. So, clearly we are seeing a very differentiated value that our clients are seeing in their trend.", "David Windley", "So if I could just clarify so the point to the question was where can the $11 to $16 per member per month go?", "John Prince", "Well the $11 to $16 goes back in terms of their total cost of healthcare, so it actually went forward to our number, actually the client would see that and the return it would give to them. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "It was to the benefit of the client, our benefit is the retention of customers and the growth that we get.", "David Windley", "Thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Hey great, thanks. I wanted to ask a question on MA actually, maybe a two part question. First, given all the growth that you have there just want to make sure that the performance from margin across expectation is coming in line with how you had expected it this year? And I guess secondly you mentioned that you expect to gain share again next year, wanted to get a little more color on the purpose behind that because group MA went so far, is there anything you don't have that your competitors bids up for next year so I just want to know what gave you confidence in saying that you are going to gain share this early in the process? ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Why don\u2019t we ask Steve Nelson kind of give you the broader themes and then Brian Thompson will fill in the rest. ", "Steve Nelson", "Thanks, Steve. Hey Kevin, this is Steve Nelson. Let me just talk a little bit about how we're thinking about growth and the positioning of UnitedHealthcare overall and because I think the themes are pretty consistent as we move to a specific Medicare Advantage conversation. But we've been very focused on a specific agenda trying to drive value, improve our quality, very focused on costs both medical and administrative that are really driving an agenda of what we call distinction, trying to innovate around our both our clinical experience and our service experience, driving improved NPS. We see that actually across our businesses but particularly in our MAPD business as well, driving more attention which I think is significantly contributing to the growth and also the inline performance we've seen this year on that growth. But also you just heard the Optum team talk about their robust capabilities as we bring those things into UnitedHealthcare. We continue to see that really resonating in the market across all of our businesses. And so we're really bringing this agenda of distinction to new populations whether we are talking about bringing populations into more populations with complex care, complex conditions into managed Medicaid or some of the emerging populations that we continue to see grow whether it's a D-SNP or group Medicare Advantages as you referenced. So really well positioned across all of these businesses but MA is a tremendous story so with that maybe just have Brian give some color about what we are seeing there early in this year. ", "Brian Thompson", "Steve, thank you. Kevin, good morning, this is Brian Thompson. For 2017 we are off to a very strong first half of the year on both service and support as well as our engagement with our new seniors that have chosen UnitedHealthcare. What we are seeing is aligning to our expectations, so we are not only pleased with what we're seeing in 2017 year-to-date but also our positioning as we look forward to 2018 and we have a very positive long-term outlook for the industry and for us specifically. We expect as you heard to continue to outperform the market in 2018 overall on MA balanced both in group and individual just as we did this year and the two years prior. ", "The return of the insurance fee will be the single largest headwind in 2018, it's return was assumed that our 2018 bid submissions but despite the return of the tax and program funding pressure there, we do intend to keep our benefit offerings as stable as possible and we intend to compliment our 2018 growth and product stability with advances in both quality and satisfaction. So our products will again be designed for high levels of retention. So on balance we are very optimistic, we are optimistic about our positioning both group and individual against the backdrop of an advancing very positive industry growth outlook for 2018.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you next question. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. ", "Chris Rigg", "Good morning. I just wanted to ask or get a little more color on the operating cost ratio and just to better understand the mix dynamics there and I guess most importantly I'm trying to determine whether is there an incremental investment spending in the number related to the provider side or is that all just mix at this point? Thanks. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "John?", "John Rex", "Yes, thanks. John Rex here, so when I talked about the 80 basis points of impact, that was truly just the mix impact, a higher proportion of really care delivery businesses in our revenue base and that's the impact that we're seeing in the business. So that is straight up the care delivery business expanding and growing and care delivery business somewhere now in kind of two thirds of the range of all of OptumHealth. There are always investments we're making across the businesses and certainly within our OCR this quarter there were plenty but our commitment to you is to always balance those and as we deliver our results by that point of segment the 80 basis points does not include investments that we make.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Excellent, next question please.", "Operator", "We will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.", "Peter Costa", "Hi, thanks. You mentioned the impact of the health insurance will be coming back next year, if it does come back next year that turns into quite a price increase for the commercial planned staff to pay, more than most businesses are growing these days. So can you talk about what you're seeing employers do right now that counteract that rising cost in terms of what cost cutting measures are they putting in place and what cost cutting measures are you putting in place to help ameliorate the rate increase?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So, maybe Jeff Alter and Dan Schumacher can you kind of combine on that. ", "Jeff Alter", "Sure, thanks Peter. Its Jeff Alter. You know a few years ago we put forth a very purposeful initiative to expand our portfolio of fully insured products which included broadening that portfolio to reach many different price points and then connecting those products with varying network structures. So we have a very robust product portfolio that allows our clients to adjust to increasing medical costs whether that\u2019s driven by pharmacy or driven by medical costs or driven by legislative and regulatory actions. So our clients have the ability to create five down opportunities or to change in complimenting their benefit strategies without having to change their carrier because of the proactive work we've done in our product portfolio particularly in our fully insured product portfolio.", "Dan Schumacher", "So I think variety of products and offerings and really focus on broad range of price points. ", "Peter Costa", "Is there anything in particular that's being picked up more than not.", "Jeff Alter", "You know I would say that there's far more interest in varying network constructs. One of the more popular choice has been the leveraging of our more than a decade old premium designation program where we use lot of the OptumInsight in analytics to determine the best providers, those that practice both first and foremost always quality but then efficiency. And so we've created network and product structures that drive people to those top tier doctors using either co-pay or co-insurance variations. It has become very popular because it helps our clients achieve the price points that are affordable for them but also given the comfort that people are getting better outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that's a real story of the integration of the UnitedHealthcare and in Optum to deliver meaningful value to a marketplace that first and foremost drives people to the best performing physicians. But overall achieves a price point for their sponsors. ", "Peter Costa", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Scott Fidel ", "Thanks, just had a question just on the tax rate. I know there's been a few discrete items this year so first, just if you have just an updated guidance for the tax rate this year and then what you would view as sort of a good sort of run rate, tax rate, looking out that we should be modeling for next year excluding obviously the return of the industry?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "We're so we're going to not actually get into 2018 too much but John, do you want to respond?", "John Rex", "Thanks Scott, John Rex here. I will speak to this year. So we're not updating our tax rate outlook for the year here. Let me just talk a little bit about within the quarter because we did speak about it last quarter also. So there is nothing unusual that I would spike out in the 2Q effective tax rate beyond normal exercise activity. So typically with the share purchase -- with stock based compensation accounting we're going to see more impact in the first half and the second half in terms of lowering that tax rate. So we\u2019d expect that to increase in the second half. In the first quarter we had really talked about half of the impact that we expected to be nonrecurring and that was really due to just an unusually large amount of stock option exercises. It was related in part to an older acquisition and so that was the piece we spiked out there. But I wouldn't spike out anything as unusual in this quarter's rate and we'd be at the still in that 32.5% zone. We\u2019d always try to do a little bit better than we can and that would be my aspiration but that\u2019s what it would be.", "Scott Fidel ", "Okay, thanks.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.", "A.J. Rice", "Hello everybody, I just maybe ask about capital deployment John, I think in your prepared remarks you're saying that you guys will hit your yearend target by the end of the third quarter for where you were hoping debt to cap would be. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about your potentially being involved in various M&A type of transactions supporting Optum, Reliant, Advisory Board, etc. I guess conceptually as you guys get to your debt to cap target do you -- is the M&A environment just so robust what you're seeing out there that your capital is going to continue to be mainly focus there, do you see an opportunity to maybe reestablish more actively the buyback program, give us some flavor for where you guys are thinking on capital deployment?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I think maybe Dave Wichmann would respond. ", "David S. Wichmann", "Sure A.J. Thank you for the question. Very thoughtful. So you're right that our ambitions are to achieve our 40% leverage ratio by the end of the third quarter and we think we stand a really good shot at getting there which should be one quarter early. John has done a very nice job in managing our capital structure and getting us into that position along with our team. As you know we don't discuss rumors and speculation about our M&A activity and we're certainly not going to start today. But I think as you know A.J. that M&A has been a critical part of the way in which this organization has identified new opportunities to serve more people and more market broadly. And those ambitions continue as Steve lined out in his concluding remarks in the opening remarks around those ambitions being both domestic as well as global. And really focused in the services category really continuing to support Optum's growth and diversification, establishing platforms like you saw with OptumCare which we believe will be strong growth performers for us for the next decade. And I could go on and list many more but I think you get the idea. So it is a core part of our emphasis. ", "As relates to share repurchase we continue with a consistent policy at this time whereby we are just trying to keep our share count level. And as I believe you saw in June we increased our dividend again to a rate of $3 per share which is a 20% increase in continuing with our ambitions of advancing our dividend to a market rate level. Thank you. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question please. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. ", "Joshua Raskin", "Hi, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about potential changes in tax rate and I understand it's very premature, we don't even have necessarily a real proposal from the Republicans but to the extent that you guys have thought about it, I'm curious what the impact on your tax rate is from the non-deductibility of the excess compensation, how you would think about the introduction add back? And then as I look about your tax rate sort of before the ACA, your tax rate today is running 400 to 500 basis points below where you were so, just trying to sort of level set the opportunity were there to be changes and maybe specifically on those two items that we know have the potential to change?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "You know Josh we are really not going to try to get into themes that could affect 2018 outlook but we would really prefer to do that not in a peaceful way but in a more fulsome way when we can really talk about all the elements. The insurance tax is clearly if it has sustained a headwind influencing 2018 and its progress of data really effects the cost for consumers in both -- across the commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets, etc. And it's a factor in terms of market -- it is stabilizing factor in the marketplace both in its cost. So the return of the tax making would further destabilize the market which is already fragile. And make that market less affordable. ", "So we are we would clearly think that either repealing or deferring that would be a positive thing but as it relates to our actual workings with our 2018 outlook or tax rate and so forth we're just going to save those so that we can actually go through them with you in a more thoughtful way, in a more complete way, maybe to some extent in the third quarter but for sure at our Investor Conference. ", "Joshua Raskin", "Do I get a mulligan then Steve. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "You do. Alright do you want a another.", "Joshua Raskin", "I will pretend that didn\u2019t happen. So my next question would just be, we're talking about OptumHealth and OptumCare specifically. We're seeing a lot of discussion among competitors around growth in urgent care in ASC's, how would you describe the competitive landscape, are you seeing more and more supply of like services in the market and is that impacting OptumCare at all. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "You know, I think we are but I think others are better qualified to respond to that. So, maybe Larry to begin and then Andrew.", "Larry C. Renfro", "Okay, Josh the -- as you know when we put our program together, when we started OptumCare it was probably about 2012 when we brought the Optum business plan and so I would say we got out early in terms of how we were going to approach the market and how we were going to look at it from an investing standpoint or we would partner, we would contract, buy, build. So we had a lot of different strategies in terms of how we were going to really attack and put together our OptumCare program. So urgent care, care delivery, the surgery care, house calls, behavioral we have all of those programs in place and they are actually functioning extremely well. And I'm going to let Andrew talk about it but, the one thing I would say is we are early but we have an established platform. We didn't miss any boat here. We are out and we understand the marketplace and we are in the process of a evaluating many different organizations on how we say that they fit with us and we have a very robust opportunity that we are seeing in the marketplace. So with that I will turn it over to Andrew.", "Andrew Hayek", "Thanks Larry and good morning Josh. So I would say the local markets remain competitive in different ways, in unique ways depending on the market structure. But as we look across our OptumCare platforms in physician groups, the SCA, MedExpress, house calls the distinctive capabilities that we have really created demand for what we have to offer in improving the quality, the cost, the experience, the care and improving the provider experience. And so I'd say is the market force has continued to push towards higher quality at more cost effective price points. The demand for a distinctive platform that can enable physicians and care providers to achieve better results, leveraging tools, and insight and other components of our platform the need for what we have to offer is growing. And we remain very bullish and optimistic around the opportunity to expand across the 75 markets to deepen our presence in the markets we currently serve. As Larry referenced we believe we\u2019re in the very early stages of this opportunity and again in many respects the increasing competition increases the demand for a distinctive platform which we have. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So maybe we could then give it to Dan because that really kind of the voice of demand in there. ", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure, so Josh one thing I would just highlight is obviously when you look at our spend and the composition of it and how much of it orients to the acute setting. We've got so many surgical procedures and so forth that are happening in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and the reality is we've seen for a long time an opportunity to really focus on the side of service, get them into places where we can drive better quality, frankly a better patient experience at a lower cost as Andrew has been talking about. And we do it in a couple of ways. Certainly we do it in terms of our approach to medical management, so looking at prior authorization and making sure that we're getting it into the right side of service on the front end before procedures are happening. We are also building it into the product designs as well so that we're putting incentives in there to make some of the transition from acute to ambulatory to really drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for. ", "And more recently with the acquisition of SCA and our partnership there we are really leaning into that and investing in quality incentives for surgeons so that we can drive greater volumes into these less intensive settings and we're able to do frankly more acute procedures and more complicated procedures in that setting as well. So we see a lot of opportunity in it. We've got it in place in select markets today and we will be looking to expand that meaningfully over the course of this year and into next. So those are some of the things that we're doing around both the plan design, the medical management, as well as the incentives to put those three things together in alignment to drive those transitions from acute settings to ambulatory settings to drive better cost, value, and experience. Larry.", "Larry C. Renfro", "I\u2019d just like to add one other aspect of the Optum business and that would be Optum360. Sometimes we forget that on the primary care side, the urgent care, and now what we're doing with surgery care across the board we have strategic relationships with a lot of the Optum360 clients that are actually involved with us in using those programs. And so we get caught up in terms of talking about how we're looking at our different programs in OptumCare mainly from a health plan standpoint when the Optum360 organizations are actively engaged with how we tie into them as well. So that's a whole other avenue of our business there.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Thanks, good morning. You know, there has been headlines around States potentially tying Medicaid contracts to exchange participation. So just want to get your thoughts on that and then with procurements coming up, how concerned are you that States consider exchange participation even if not explicitly and how could that influence your views around reentering the exchange? Thanks. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Maybe, we'll have Austin begin to comment with respect to safe base to dead end.", "Austin Pittman", "So I guess first and foremost these are really State by State discussions and not something that we're really going to comment broadly here and not going to speculate about that. I would say with regard to your second question we are constantly in conversations with our States on how to expand coverage for more people, particularly those with complex needs. A lot of the activity that we see both in renewal activity as well as new business certainly surrounds that which as we talked about before is a real area of distinction for the combination of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. So we're very positive, we look forward to continue to serve our States and find solutions, particularly get around these populations with very complex needs.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So we'll continue to work with State and so forth but I don't see anything that establishes what might be a trend with respect to tying these kinds of programs together. States have been I think very thoughtful about this to date so I think that's the best response we can offer at the moment. Next question. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. Stephen what we know now about Medicare market [indiscernible] could the market see a continuation of the 2% and then penetration increase that we saw in 2017 and long-term given the inherent value proposition at Medicare Advantage where do you think penetration is heading, with the potential market that is 50% MA? ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Maybe I will have Steve respond to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in the past that we do expect that penetration to go forward and we do expect the MA market to mature and grow. ", "Steve Nelson", "Good morning Sarah, Steve Nelson. I agree with Steve's high level comments there. I have seen clearly in our experience we have seen tremendous growth in our Medicare Advantage and while that clearly we think is driven by some of the things that we uniquely bring to the market whether it's the stability or benefits, the product designs, the service, and the clinical models. But also in addition to that there's just a real strong overall value proposition with Medicare Advantage and we're seeing that not only just with the folks that we serve but as we talk to policy makers too there's really strong support for it. So you see a population that needs it, it serves them well. It drives down cost, the satisfaction is up, it's definitely growing, and so we think that's going to continue. And so we do think there's an opportunity to further advance the penetration of the Medicare Advantage, where it can go hard to tell but I don't think it's unreasonable to think about something north of -- considerably north of where we are, about 40% approaching 50%. It doesn't seem like a unreasonable idea to us, no. I would think that we would think that it could go 50% or better.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We go next to Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes, thank you and I'm going to ask a question that sort of asked before but just as you know had started with your comment but you've added 600,000 group commercial risk lives year-over-year I just wanted to understand I mean, you're obviously doing better than almost all your competitors, most of whom are seeing attrition on the group commercial risks. And I guess the question you described your pricing, I think John did as disciplined and rational which I'm not disputing, my question is, is this really just that you are producing a better medical cost outcome and so you can price lower than the market because a lot of this business you can correct me if I am wrong, it moves unpriced, sorry for the long question?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So I think that we started to get into this a little bit before when Jeff Alter was commenting, it is I think a function of many things of which cost structure is clearly part of it but its spectrum of products, the design, etc. So Jeff do you want to respond?", "Jeff Alter", "Sure, hey Matt. I guess I would try in my response to kind of a discussion of what's here. So I would say the market moves on value, it doesn't necessarily move on price. And we have been very purposeful across our product, our services, the focus on NPS has I think brought a much stronger value proposition to particularly the fully insured small growth market. Long-term disciplined pricing is a good thing and I think you're seeing the discipline that we had in the early stages of the ACA now coming back to us as a value play. Couple that with a very purposeful decision a number of years ago to broaden our product portfolio and to offer a much broader spectrum of network opportunities or choice for particularly our fully insured small group clients. ", "We also have undertaken a different view with our distribution community, our brokers and consultants, a more disciplined approach with them narrowing some of that distribution network to more favorite partners and giving them some added services. So one of the things that we've learned over the years that our brokers and our consultants in that marketplace seek to do business with those that make it easier for them to do business with. We've created again with the assistance of rally and our Optum partners a much easier way for our small business brokers to onboard clients with us, to make plan changes, to recommend using some of the OptumInsight analytics. The next logical moves for buy down so, you really have to look at the value we bring as opposed to the price of our product. I think it maps the answer to why our particularly our small group fully insured business has done well over the last few years. ", "Matthew Borsch", "Thank you. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you, next question please?", "Operator", "We go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Ana Gupte", "Yes, thanks, good morning. On Optum you saw some really nice margin expansion on OptumHealth and OptumRx despite the mix shifting pressures you talked about on providers. I was just wondering if this is an area of focus for the organization or this is one off and where could the margins shake out by business line and overall?", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Larry, maybe you want to respond to that, clearly an area of focus right.", "Larry C. Renfro", "It is an area of focus and Ana we\u2019re obviously you're looking at both from a financial perspective as well from a margin perspective and all that is in line with our expectations. I am going to ask Tim to Tim Wicks to comment on this.", "Tim Wicks", "Sure, thanks Ana. First, as we think about the margin growth that we're seeing since we had -- we\u2019re pleased to start a very strong start to the year 2017. The earnings are in line with our expectations June year-to-date and comprise about 40% of the full year expectations and so right in line with both our prior several years of experience in the first half of the year as well as our 2017 guidance.", "I think it's also important to understand that there's seasonality in our businesses and maybe I'll just point two examples where there's some seasonality. One, is in OptumInsight, as you know the second half of the year is typically pretty strong and in terms of the relative distribution of earnings growth in the year and it's really driven by several other businesses in OptumInsight quality and the risk businesses, the Optum360 content sales as well as technology data and software sales. ", "The second example I would use is in OptumHealth as well is when we look at OptumHealth SCA volume is characteristically also stronger in the second half of the year. And then typically we expect fourth quarter overall for Optum to be stronger than the third quarter as well as we go through the year.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "Thank you. We\u2019ll do two more questions and then we'll have to close it. So, we will do two more questions first. ", "Operator", "We'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Thank you very much for keeping me in. So I'll just observe that if this is early stage growth for $200 billion revenue run rate company to produce what you're producing I'd like to see what late stage looks like. So thank you for that but, the real question I have here is that I've learned overtime to pay close attention to what is said on this call and one of the things that you mentioned Steve early on in your remarks was that words to the effect of it is now time to turn our attention to cost. In the past when you've turned the organization's attention to something its resulted in significant advances for the business enterprise as a whole and I'm wondering if this is one of those things that we should be paying attention to, and if so if you can quantify it in any way or qualify it in any way to give us a sense of where the opportunities are, I know we've discussed it from the OptumCare perspective but, more broadly across the enterprise would be helpful? Thank you. ", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "I'm not sure I can offer you too much specifics but that was intentional. I think that in general if you take a look at our organization we have grown well over the last couple of years. We've been able to add some and introduce some strong companies into our portfolio. And I think that if you see the growth and in essence the net productivity out of that you\u2019d sit back and say there's an opportunity to strengthen the enterprise, continue to lead the enterprise focused on the things that are most important. And if you recognize the value equation as its played out in the marketplace many of today's themes were around retention of customers, value to customers, and so forth. As one of the questioners pointed out, the price point is a very important part of this. We have to challenge ourselves to deliver value all the time. We're in a very strong position, this is a great time to be taking that challenge up and that is what we're focused on. ", "We think we can deliver more value, we think we can drive more innovation, fresh approaches, and I think this enterprises folks who are ready to do that. The alignment of new technologies to that effort, use of more advanced data analytics produce a lot of opportunity for us particularly just given the set up of our businesses. So those are the themes around that and we are focused on our marketplace that's going to be looking for value and think that we can anticipate that. I think NPS is a big part of that effort as well. Thank you for the question. Next, last question please ", "Operator", "And we'll go to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Zack Sopcak", "Hey good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask about CMS\u2019s proposal to remove knee arthroplasty from the in-patient only list. Was that something that you considered happening in the near term when you are in the stages of acquiring SCA and how do you think about the impact of that business over a longer term, is it meaningful and does that have any impact on your MA strategy going forward?", "Andrew Hayek", "It\u2019s Andrew. I'd offer a couple comments here. From an SCA perspective the team there has been focusing on higher acuity procedures for several years in orthopedics, in spine, in cardiovascular and that includes total joint replacements which the SCA team has been performing on a commercial basis for a number of years with outstanding results. Very consistent with the AAA in terms of the quality outcomes, the patient experience, and of course material cost savings. So we've been applying that in the commercial environment and there's been discussion for a number of years at the CMS level around the potential to allow total joint replacement in the surgery center setting which we of course would embrace allowing us to extend the benefits of that platform in terms of quality experience and obviously reducing total cost and extend that to the Medicare population. So in many ways we have been anticipating this. This is something on a commercial basis we've been doing. We can obviously speculate as to how -- what the outcome will be but this is a positive and consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing.", "Stephen J. Hemsley", "So thank you. Thank you once again for your interest in our progress today. Kind of midway through the year our performance and momentum remain strong. We expect to continue to deliver higher quality and value in healthcare and sustainable growth throughout 2017, 2018 and the years to come. Our thanks to our people who through their commitment to our mission and culture are helping to drive our enterprise to reach its full potential. Thank you and that concludes our call today.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This quarter, we are pleased to report continued broad-based growth and forward momentum for our diverse healthcare enterprise. In our sessions with you each quarter, it is both humbling and an honor particularly from this chair to represent the dedication, energy and work of the 260,000 women and men who comprised this company today. I have the privilege of witnessing their efforts up close as I work with our people across the globe and it is inspiring. Each day, our people leverage clinical insights, data and information, advanced technologies and a service minded culture to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Having the opportunity to live this mission and witness its impact drives all of us.", "Over the past few decades, we have evolved as we have grown to serve more people and expanded our capabilities, but to us it often feels like we are just getting started. We see more opportunities to serve and to grow further in the next 10 years than ever before. We are focused on diversifying our business applying analytics and advanced technology to improve the use of information and better engage people and to improve the effectiveness of our businesses and ultimately the broad health system. We are raising our quality through rigorous net promoter disciplines leading to greater trust and loyalty. We are reducing healthcare costs to make healthcare more affordable advancing market leading innovations and simplifying the healthcare experience for consumers and care providers. The pace of growth of our organization that is achieved will be determined by how well we work with, perform for and serve others. The more we effectively serve the healthcare market\u2019s true needs, the more we will realize our full potential leading to predictable and consistent growth in revenues, earnings, cash flows and enterprise value.", "To that end, this morning we reported strong performance in the third quarter of 2017. We grew revenues by 9% to $50.3 billion and grew adjusted earnings by 23% to $2.66 per share. And we reported $7.5 billion in cash flows from operations and annualized return on shareholders\u2019 equity of 22.5% and a debt to total capital ratio of 38.2%, down nearly 900 basis points over last year. We now expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings to approach $10 per share. We expect this strong business momentum and performance to continue into 2018, 2019 and beyond driven by growth and service to our customers. In light, we will walk you through recent business trends in more detail beginning with Larry Renfro, our UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Optum.", "Larry Renfro", "Thank you, Dave. Optum\u2019s third quarter included continued growth, strong margin than earnings and further strategic advantage. Third quarter revenues grew nearly $2 billion to approach $23 billion, an 8.4% advance over last year. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations of $1.7 billion were again well-balanced with each segment producing double-digit percentage growth in operating earnings. A nearly 16% increase in Optum\u2019s earnings was driven by the combination of strong revenue growth, business expansion and strengthened operating margins for both OptumHealth and OptumRx and a steady 20% operating margin at OptumInsight. Overall, Optum\u2019s operating margin of 7.4% increased 70 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. OptumHealth grew revenues over 21% year-over-year as it expanded to serve approximately 9 million more consumers over the past year. OptumHealth has among the broadest reaches in healthcare directly serving 90 million consumers.", "Per capita revenue growth was again strong in the third quarter rising more than 9% versus last year as earnings from operations increased 27%. OptumHealth is supporting the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs by providing healthcare services and expertise. Earlier this year, the Defense Health Agency awarded Optum a 5-year agreement to support Military Health System\u2019s global advice service. Beginning in March 2018, our registered nursing staff will provide triage services, self-care advice, care coordination and general health advice to active members of military and their families, 24/7 via secure phone videoconference or web chat.", "In August, the Advisory Board and OptumInsight agreed to merge in a transaction we expect to close by the end of 2017. The Advisory Board has long been a distinctive leading provider of research, consulting and technology serving about 4,000 hospitals and health systems across the nation. We believe their outstanding team of independent healthcare experts can extend their work into payer services, life sciences and other healthcare arenas leveraging Optum\u2019s data analytics capabilities and the breadth of Optum\u2019s product offerings for our combined client base. We look forward to their team led by their Chief Executive, Robert Musslewhite joining OptumInsight.", "We were pleased this quarter to receive a multiyear award to serve the Triple-S Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico Health Plan managing its administrative and operational infrastructure. We expect our technology and capabilities in core operations. Transaction processing and connectivity will help Triple-S achieve its quality, satisfaction and cost ambitions. OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog has grown more than $1 billion so far this year reaching nearly $14 billion at third quarter\u2019s end. And earnings from operations grew 11.6% over last year\u2019s third quarter. At OptumRx, we fulfilled over 320 million adjusted scripts in the third quarter, growth of 12 million scripts over last year and consistent with our above market growth rate in 2017.", "Earnings from operations grew 11.3% over last year while revenues grew 4.7%. As we delivered substantial value and supply chain economics to our customers, OptumRx has positioned itself to compete as a market leader. We served the generic brands and specialty pharmacy needs of consumers in retail, mail and home infused delivery models. We have high customer retention and we have been awarded meaningful new pharmacy care service contracts, including the State of New Jersey beginning this January as well as a leading state Medicaid program beginning mid 2018 and ramping up to the course of the year. These complement growth from our health plan partners and from medium-sized and large employers in the commercial carve-out pharmacy market. We have strong momentum in specialty pharmacy, but we expect full year 2017 revenues to increase 20% over last year and growth momentum to continue into 2018.", "Our synchronized data driven approach to specialty pharmacy integrates pharmacy and medical engagement. We then drive customer satisfaction by delivering strong service and personalizing the patient\u2019s experience across the breadth of information channels they choose to use. Through these and other ways, Optum brings insights to help make health systems perform better. We recently formalized the way we present our distinctive data and analytics capabilities under the Optum IQ brand. The Optum IQ name sharpens our narrative by capturing the rich data and deep distinctive analytic capabilities embedded in the products and services we delivered to customers. Overall, at Optum, we remain relentless in pursuing organic growth, strong execution raising NPS, innovating and feeding and growing relationship.", "Now, let me turn it over to Steve Nelson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Steve?", "Steve Nelson", "Thank you, Larry. Like the Optum team, UnitedHealthcare is pleased to report strong performance across the business this quarter. At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to focus on a few critical priorities. The first is quality, which includes both clinical quality and the experience consumers and care providers have with us. We are gratified to see our NPS core is advancing with consumers and clients across our product lines and with providers. Next is our relentless focus on managing costs. As customers expect us to be good stewards of their financial resources, one example, 2017 is tracking to be the ninth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare\u2019s customers will experience fewer, inpatient hospital admissions per 1,000 people.", "Third is our partnership with Optum. We are further leveraging capabilities to improve performance and innovate for our customers and care providers, nowhere does our clinical engagement performed better than where it combines with the clinical delivery capabilities of OptumCare\u2019s local market ambulatory care practices. Consumers regularly give OptumCare practices NPS scores in the 70 to 90 range and for 2018, 100% of OptumCare Medicare Advantage patients will be in plans rated four stars or higher. Together, we are able to better serve the clinical needs of UnitedHealthcare patients with the higher quality, lower cost and improved customer experience. In turn, we strengthened Optum\u2019s practices through market leading growth, innovation and clinical insights all aimed at better serving people one at a time everyday.", "The fourth priority is what we refer to internally is distinction. It is how we describe the truly compelling experience we are creating for people across a variety of dimensions. This includes creating distinctive relationships with care delivery system partners and driving simplicity for consumers. On Rally, our consumer digital platform we added additional private health insurance plan selection capabilities this past quarter to help pick the best benefit plan for their needs taking into account their age, family status, health background and economics.", "Doing these things well leads to the final priority, I will discuss today, growth, where our innovative commercial benefits have grown with remarkable consistency and we have considerable long-term opportunities for substantial growth in the public and senior sectors. Nationally, there are about 85 million people representing 1 trillion in annual spending who do not benefit from managed care offerings. The majority of these people are served by unmanaged higher cost fee-for-service programs operated by federal and state authorities. These people will benefit from the insights and the progressive tools that effectively support coordinated patient treatment across all access points in the healthcare system. Seniors and Medicaid beneficiaries served through our more progressive care models see higher quality care, lower costs and improve value. We expect the growth for years to come as the market continues its steady shift from costly outdated programs to innovative approaches like those offered by UnitedHealthcare.", "In Medicare, our revenues of $16.3 billion grew more than 17% over last year. Over the past year, we added nearly 1 million people, 100,000 of them in just the last 3 months split evenly between Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement. We expect more Medicare growth in 2018 based on both the growing MA market and our unique value proposition, which offer stable products, a simple and personal experience and a distinctive culture. In 2018, our quality Star scores advance again. Approximately 85% of the seniors we serve will be enrolled in plans rated four stars or higher. The initial stars data for 2019 payment year once again show strong organic improvement, because our underlying plans are performing consistently at higher levels. We expect our final star ratings in 2019 payment year to approximate or exceed the high performing levels of 2018 supporting benefit value and better health outcomes for the seniors we serve and growth for our business in this important market.", "In community and state, third quarter revenues grew 12.8% over last year. Third quarter membership levels remain stable representing a year-over-year advance of nearly 600,000 people with the continuing favorable mix shift toward more complex health conditions and higher acuity programs, which is our strength. During the quarter, we went live with programs in Virginia and in October, the First Californians joined UnitedHealthcare under new Medi-Cal contracts in two counties. In addition, we are excited by our active pipeline of renewal and new business opportunities as states expand and diversify the populations they serve through managed Medicaid.", "Turning to UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, our commercial group full risk offering sustained momentum in a consistently competitive environment growing to serve 40,000 more people this quarter more than 0.5 million in the past 12 months and 1.1 million over the past 3 years. These results reflect improved experiences for consumers and predictable cost trend management for employers driven by a combination of innovative benefit designs and locally payer networks, all of which lead to rising retention and strong new business generation. We recently decided to enter the Northern Plain\u2019s health insurance markets, including Minnesota beginning in the second half of 2018. Our team in Minnesota is looking forward to serving our neighbors more fully in coming years. Taken as a whole, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues this quarter by $3.6 billion to $40.7 billion nearly 10% growth and earnings from operations of $2.4 billion in the quarter grew over 13% year-over-year.", "Now, I will turn the call over to John Rex for a financial review.", "John Rex", "Thank you, Steve. Across UnitedHealth Group in the third quarter, we delivered strong, well-balanced performance, with most principal businesses again posting revenue growth rate, up 10% or higher. Consolidated revenues of $50.3 billion for the quarter grew 8.7% over last year despite the ACA effects at UnitedHealthcare. Our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded $4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders of nearly $2.5 billion rose 26% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EPS rose nearly 23% to $2.66 per share. Medical costs have been well managed within our established outlook range, while trending modestly lower.", "The third quarter medical care ratio of 81.4% brought the year-to-date ratio to 82% would suggest we will be closer to the lower side of our full year 2017 outlook of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The operating cost ratio ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 14.7% in the third quarter due to the typical seasonally higher levels of operating expense as we prepare for on-boarding new growth in January. Overall, operating costs remain within the range of our expectations even as we see meaningful opportunities to improve our performance in this area.", "Cash flows from operations were $7.5 billion in the third quarter or 2.9x net income bringing the year-to-date adjusted figure to 1.6x net income. Third quarter cash flow was driven by strong underlying business performance, working capital management, the absence of an annual insurance tax payment in the quarter, and the annual receipt of payments from CMS that adjust rates to reflect member\u2019s medical conditions. Our strong performance enabled us to reduce our debt to total capital ratio to 38.2% at September 30. Since we acquired Catamaran 2 years ago, we have reduced this ratio by 11 percentage points even as we continue to expand our business portfolio and enhance shareholder value. Over that time, we created a unique, diverse and fully capable pharmacy care service business, continue to build on our OptumCare platform through the acquisition of urgent care, ambulatory surgical and local market physician practices, and distributed nearly $5 billion in dividends repurchasing $2.5 billion in stock.", "We have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted net earnings and now expect to approach $10 per share. This would be a full year growth of 24% and strongly ahead of the original range of $9.30 to $9.60 per share as we communicated at last year\u2019s investor conference. Dave?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, John. Before I give a first look at 2018, let me touch briefly on the federal executive order from last week. We have a great deal of experience in the area covered in the order, short-term policies, association plans and expanded use of HRAs. We will be engaging with policymakers as the regulatory frameworks in these areas are developed over the next 60 to 120 days and hope to elaborate once the process has concluded. With regard to cost sharing reductions, you will recall that we have a very limited exchange presence, about 30,000 people in four states who are CSR eligible and we submitted plans for 2018 both with and without the CSR payments. Thus, we expect any impact to be extremely small.", "Now, to 2018 as you look at next year, it is important to keep several tailwinds and headwinds front of mind, themes, we have been consistent about over the last several quarters, continued growth, momentum and performance, particularly with customer retention as our NPS disciplines improve, increasingly effective capacities to manage and contain both medical and operating costs, the improving performance and capabilities of our modern operating technology and data analytics infrastructure and ongoing efforts to be strategic investors and thoughtful stewards of the capital you have entrusted to us. With regard to the headwinds, these remain largely around externalities centering on government programs, funding trends and taxes. On the latter, the return of the health insurance tax is the most meaningful. We and others have advocated strongly for the repeal or continued deferral of this tax. It ultimately increases cost to consumers through either increased premiums or benefit reductions and thus affects Medicare beneficiaries, individual policyholders, large and small businesses and Medicaid recipients. Absent the insurance tax reinstatement, we see our 2008 per share earnings squarely in our longstanding 13% to 16% long-term growth range.", "In 2018, the insurance tax would represent for us roughly $0.75 per share of comparative year-over-year earnings headwinds. That figure is composed of the rate increase in the tax itself, the effect of our market share gains in commercial and Medicare Advantage since 2016, and the accounting convention that creates a timing gap as it applies to commercial businesses. So as we look toward 2018, we see our per share adjusted earnings within a typically sized range with the top side of that range in line with the current market consensus for 2018 and we see an enterprise with strong momentum and a commitment to performing to its highest potential in 2018 and beyond.", "Before opening up for questions, there are a couple of things we would hope you take away from today\u2019s report. First, our businesses are performing well at all levels and particularly for those we serve. We expect to continue to do so in 2018. That performance continues to produce distinctive growth. Second, we have focused initiatives in numerous areas such as innovation, digital health, artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, NPS and advancing a consumer culture. The breadth of these initiatives reflects our restless and ambitious team, one determined to make a difference in healthcare serving one person at a time.", "Finally, we are a healthcare company rooted in our core competencies and delivered in benefits and services. Together, UnitedHealthcare and Optum offer distinctive competencies in clinical insight, technology and data and information. As we bring these key capabilities and distinctive value to clients, we are privileged to serve more people and we expect to continue strong growth for a long time. Our goal remains realizing the remarkable growth, service and social potential of this enterprise. We look forward to discussing all of this more with you in more detail at our investor conference in November.", "Thank you for your interest today. We will now open the floor to your questions, one question per person please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Peter Costa", "Good morning. I would like to ask you about 2019 Medicare Advantage plans we have seen good growth in your earnings from Medicare over the last few years. It looks like going into 2019, there is a lot more plans for pricing a little more competitively as well as growing geographically. You had great growth in 2018. Can you talk a little more specifically about what you are thinking having seen everybody else\u2019s plans now for growth in 2019?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Peter. And I appreciate you acknowledging our past growth, I think our team has done a very nice job in building this business and really setting the stage for our continued success in that area. Obviously, we are not commenting on the specifics of 2019, but we will give you some general sense of things. So, I will give it to Steve Nelson.", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. I assume that question is about 2018.", "David Wichmann", "Yes, benefits plan probably.", "Steve Nelson", "Peter, you said 2018.", "Peter Costa", "2018, sorry about that.", "Steve Nelson", "Making sure, okay. A lot of work to do between now and \u201819 benefit plan because we are about two days into the selling season for Medicare Advantage and yes, tremendous growth. We have been really focused at UnitedHealthcare across all the businesses to really advance the idea that I mentioned earlier in my comments around distinction and with very key focus on some fundamental areas, substantial growth, advances in quality leveraging our Optum capabilities, managing our costs both administrative and clinical and nowhere has that, I think, shine through more brightly than our Medicare Advantage. So, I think it\u2019s great to have Brian Thompson, our CEO of Medicare shed some light on 2017 and kind of outlook for \u201818 as you kind of see things shaping up.", "Brian Thompson", "Sure. Thanks, Steve. Peter, good morning. As far as 2017 goes, our performance continues to be very strong, what we are seeing aligns to our expectation. So that really sets the foundation for a robust optimistic outlook both for the industry at large as well as our performance inside 2018. I think what we are seeing as we look at the marketplace for 2018 is very stable benefits broadly, very few exits, very few closures, really great for this team here. I think that will enable continued advances in both popularity as well as the penetration for Medicare Advantage at large. Competitively, no big changes, generally speaking with respect to the competitive landscape, what we are seeing large, it aligns with our expectations. Our offerings in particular remain very strong, very stable, well-positioned for continued growth inside 2018 and we do expect to outpace the industry and growth in 2018.", "Peter Costa", "I was hoping you give a little color on the group business versus the retail business as well as how you are getting past the health insurance fee?", "Brian Thompson", "Sure. Peter, with respect to group, obviously 2017 was one of our strongest years ever both in terms of retention and strong growth. I think it can be considered a bit of an anomaly, but certainly don\u2019t want to diminish what is setting up to be a very strong year inside 2018 as well, great growth again in terms of new customers as well as strong retention.", "David Wichmann", "Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question please.", "Peter Costa", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Justin Lake", "Thanks. Good morning. First, Dave, congrats on the new role. Secondly, just appreciate the commentary on 2018 very helpful. I think what I would like to try to delineate here is 2017 when they have one away you talked about it, I think your Investor Day, $0.25 tailwind, this year you are talking about it coming back is being a $0.75 headwind. I am just curious if there was a change in the way you passed it through in \u201817 versus as it came back in \u201818. And if you did, for instance, take lower net income target margins than any of your businesses, can you kind of flush that out for us a little bit and little color to background there? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Thanks for the question, Justin and appreciate your acknowledgment of the new role and our guidance on 2018. I will ask John Rex to respond to your question.", "JohnRex", "Good morning, Justin. Maybe let me give a little more color on that. So, first when we talk about the $0.75 that\u2019s the sizing of the year-over-year earnings growth headwind that\u2019s created from the tax coming back in, I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat over two-thirds of that is the explicit 2018 earnings reduction impact that we feel from that, while really the remainder of that. So they are somewhat under one-third derives from that really the tail impact that we saw from our 2017 earnings. If I think about kind of the composition of that and how that breaks down on the 2018 end year I would say more than half of that derives from Medicare Advantage and the non-deductibility of the fee and the restroom commercial risk products. And then as you mentioned really the other part of that $0.75 is just the other side of the tail of the 2017 tailwind. So, that\u2019s really the way it breaks down and overview as we think about the \u201818 impact.", "David Wichmann", "So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Justin, we\u2019ll break this down greater at our upcoming investor conference, but we did recognize you would like to get some visibility on its components.", "Justin Lake", "Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Dave Windley", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to flip over to Optum. On OptumInsight, backlog grew nicely, I think previously the target there had been in the $15 billion to $16 billion range to end the year you will need a pretty strong fourth quarter to get there. I wondered if that\u2019s still the view and then OptumInsight has also been running at very attractive margins kind of above the long-term target. Is that sustainable or maybe asked a different way? Are we looking for a kind of higher target range? Are you revising the range up or is there some reason why that might moderate back down into the 16% to 20% range? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Thanks, Dave. Larry Renfro?", "LarryRenfro", "Dave, it\u2019s Larry. Couple of comments and then I am going to ask Tim Wicks to talk a little bit about this from a financial standpoint and how he sees it in the CFO role and I will ask Eric Murphy to talk about it as the business lead on OptumInsight, but as I know you know the third quarter finished slightly ahead and I would say going into the fourth quarter this is historical for us in terms of what we expect OptumInsight to actually how they will perform in the fourth quarter and they are right in line with our expectation. I think Tim will probably talk a little bit about that we had a pretty large account that came in at the end of the third quarter last year that may have a little bit of impact on the number the way that you are looking at it, but overall I would say that the momentum is very strong and we feel confident in our expectations. So, Tim?", "Tim Wicks", "Great. Thank, Larry. Dave thanks for the questions. It\u2019s Tim Wicks. Good to talk to you. The question around backlog, I think it\u2019s really important to know that as we hit $13.9 billion this year, it was a really great, strong quarter of sequential growth of $500 million and was led by revenue cycle management, BPL and government businesses. And also I am just noting that number has grown $1.3 billion year-to-date. I would also want to note that it\u2019s important to understand that late in Q3 of 2016, we had a very large end-to-end sale that\u2019s now in implementation. So, a portion of that\u2019s rolled off, but since that time as I mentioned earlier, we have also added $1.3 billion of new sales into that number and the backlog number is now up 11% year-over-year. And I will turn it to Eric to talk about the pipeline.", "Eric Murphy", "Yes, thanks, Tim. Good morning, Dave. Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. In terms of the specific question you asked about our backlog and our expectations regarding Q4 and for the year, first I will start with \u2013 Q3 was absolutely in line with our expectations relative to our contribution to backlog. We come into Q4 with a very strong pipeline of active pursuits. So, we are very bullish on our ability to be able to achieve our objective as you stated a $15 billion to $16 billion of total backlog for 2017. We anticipate the contributions of that backlog in Q4 being concentrated around our inventory and acute revenue cycle management, where our pipeline is up 60% year-on-year. So, we anticipate a strong finish to Q4 into 2017.", "LarryRenfro", "So, Dave, it\u2019s Larry, I want to take this back to Tim, because I don\u2019t believe he answered the margin question.", "Tim Wicks", "Great. Dave, first just to note, you had mentioned the margin at 20.7% for Q3. I think it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s up 40 basis points from Q3 of 2016, so year-over-year a 40 basis point margin expansion than the same amount September year-to-date. Sequential margin expansion over just the last quarter has been 200 basis points, but as you think about that margin expansion just consistent with prior years, we anticipate being continued sequential margin expansion in Q4 and that\u2019s really driven by seasonality in the business whether it\u2019s perpetual sales or additional performance and incentive fee payments that we expect to see at the end of the year as well as Optum360 content sales and other technology and data and software sales. So, we expect this seasonality and we see it each year as we roll through the year and would expect the kind of Q4 seasonality that we have had previously, but not a real expectation to change our overall outlook to anything higher than what it is right now.", "Dave Windley", "Okay, thank you.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Great. Thanks. Just wanted to share your comments around trend so far this year, how it\u2019s coming in what\u2019s been maybe you think that it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of what you are looking for and if there is any impact of the hurricanes in Q3 and potentially in Q4?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Kevin. As in our prepared remarks, we said that our trend is expect to be less than 6%, so within the lower end of the 6% plus or minus 50 basis point range that we had provided at the investor conference last year. Overall, it\u2019s looking strong. Our team does a very nice job of containing healthcare costs, but let me ask Jeff Putnam, our Chief Financial Officer of UnitedHealthcare to add some details and then maybe I will make a few comments on the hurricanes.", "Jeff Putnam", "Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Kevin. I\u2019d like to start our medical cost trend reflects our efforts everyday that we do to manage costs and improve clinical quality on behalf of our customers and we are driving this in several ways through traditional focus on medical cost management initiatives, getting at the right level of care at the right place of service. We are also increasing the effectiveness of our clinical model with additional focus on those with the greatest need and getting them connected to the right care. And we are increasing the alignment of our provider partnerships leveraging data and aligning incentives. As Dave mentioned, we are talking about our \u2013 looking at our 2017 trend to be below 6%, but that\u2019s still within the lower half of our original range from a year ago and you have to defer a little color on where we are seeing it, overall unit cost continues to be the primary driver and we look at it by category. It\u2019s really broad-based. We are seeing trend shift slightly downward across all categories and then there isn\u2019t anything specific that I call out around that.", "David Wichmann", "And then Kevin, as for the hurricanes, obviously it\u2019s been an unprecedented time period and it\u2019s been a really powerful and inspiring time to see how our employees have pulled together to help people that we serve and frankly their fellow employees as well in the communities broadly. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the countless women and men of our organization that gave so selflessly during this timeframe and continue to do so today. We invested heavily in the aftermath of these storms we provided financial relief for employees. We helped our customers get back on their feet. We worked with state leadership and we provided all kinds of financial assistance and in-kind services for the relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. So, there is typically some level of utilization offset, but I want to remind you that in the case of Optum, there is also lost revenue from reduced utilization. These are significant markets for our OptumCare businesses and then we had of course a fair amount of direct damage to our business as well as the financial effects of all these relief efforts. So in the end, we didn\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to the financial impact if you will, but because that wasn\u2019t what was most important at the time, but in the end it ended up being not material to our overall performance.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "I guess, regarding the Q4 potential implications, I mean, if you are pointing to a lot of instructions going on and I think a lot of people are expecting how did that plan to accelerate costs Q4 volumes just to be seasonally stronger every year. Do you feel like you have got good visibility into that trend in Q4 that there is any disruption as far as claims processing or anything like that, that might create an issue for you one way or the other?", "David Wichmann", "We believe we have good visibility to our business and we don\u2019t see disruption is affecting our Q4 results.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Okay, thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Kevin. Next question please.", "Operator", "We will go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Matt Borsch", "Yes, thank you. Could you just talk to not necessarily looking for more numbers here on the question from Justin earlier regarding the\u2026", "David Wichmann", "Matt, it\u2019s very difficult to hear you. You are breaking up, are you on\u2026?", "Matt Borsch", "I am sorry, how about that? Is that better?", "David Wichmann", "Much, much, thank you very much.", "Matt Borsch", "Thank you. So, my question was picking up on the health insurer fee resumption. I am not necessarily looking for more numbers, but just sort of qualitatively you talked about more than \u2013 sorry more than half from MA and the two-thirds of the $0.75, so the rest of it presumably on the commercial side. Is that getting to the fact that in the small group market or where is it the commercial was not entirely a pass-through at least with respect perhaps to the tax grows up and has there been any change in the pricing environment that you are reflecting in the way that you are handling the health insurer fee relative to what you have done in the last few years?", "David Wichmann", "I\u2019ll let John to respond.", "JohnRex", "Yes. Matt, on the commercial side of that, that has to do just with the accounting convention on the commercial business in terms of the periods that one collects the tax and recognizes that and the period that one expenses it. So for any piece of business that\u2019s other than the January 1 renewal date, there is going to be some gap in the timing that occur. So, we had called out that one of the tailwinds in 2017 was the result of that.", "Matt Borsch", "Right.", "JohnRex", "That flips into a headwind for us in 2018, because we get the full expense recognition in 2018. So, that smoothes out over a few years, but it creates the thing or the 2-year variability.", "Matt Borsch", "Got it. Thank you. If I could just sneak in one other question here, is there anything to read into the \u2013 or maybe you can just talk to any circumstances around the loss of that the 500,000 public sector account and does that reflect anything in the competitive environment for a self-funded business?", "David Wichmann", "No, I will ask Jeff Alter to touch on it. It was a single account. There is nothing particularly unique about it other than we happen to lose this one and unfortunately so for, Jeff.", "JeffAlter", "Yes, good morning Matt. As Dave said, I think you have to think of this account as a very unique circumstances extremely large account. We were honored to serve them well through a number of renewals. We see very disciplined in our pricing on both admin and the projection of that client\u2019s healthcare costs during this renewal. And unfortunately, we weren\u2019t chosen to continue to work with that client. I would say we remain focused in serving that client and their members really well during this run-out period and we hope to be in position to compete again the next time that client puts their business out for bid.", "Matt Borsch", "Alright. Thank you.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Matt. Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "MichaelBaker", "Yes, thanks. Just want to get some your perspective on the potential opportunity for more active management of state Medicaid formularies in light of the Massachusetts waiver that was filed?", "David Wichmann", "I will ask John Prince to comment.", "John Prince", "Good morning. This is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. Michael, in terms of the question around state Medicaid formularies, I am probably going to get into detail the specific Medicaid plan overall. We are very pleased to be very involved with Dave\u2019s. It\u2019s a very large business for us. We actually support state from fee-for-service Medicaid in terms of their design and plan. We also support a variety of managed care Medicaid plans in their design. I think most states are looking at different strategies to create more affordability for their customers. We have been very successful in that market working with states around designs that get out of affordability further ongoing plans beneficiaries as well as trying to become more consumer-oriented. I am not going to get into specifics on a given state, but overall, it\u2019s a very solid market, where people are very focused on value and experience.", "David Wichmann", "Good question, Michael. Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Gary Taylor", "Actually, at this point, my important questions have been answered. So, I will just let you proceed. Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Gary. Next question please.", "Operator", "And we can go next to Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Chris Rigg", "Good morning. I was just hoping to get a little more color on the increase in the favorable reserve development year-to-year? And then if you could give us any color on the relative performance in the business lines, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? That will be great. Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Well, I think our development is indicative of the cost containment efforts across our enterprise and we have \u2013 I will ask Jeff Putnam to comment on its components.", "Jeff Putnam", "Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, as Dave mentioned, we are working to control medical costs and improve quality. And our development this quarter reflects that as well as a modest change in claims processing timelines and both these, they take some time to mature and get their way into our claims data and reserving as we maintain a very consistent and tightly controlled process. And with this, when you step up and look at this, we are pleased with the overall accuracy and consistency of our reserving over time, especially when you look at $117 billion in medical spend last year and approaching $130 billion this year. By business as you know we don\u2019t break that out specifically, but I would offer that both our commercial and government businesses recorded favorable development this quarter.", "David Wichmann", "And then maybe Steve Nelson can touch on overall performance.", "Steve Nelson", "Sure. Hi, Chris. So, as I mentioned in my earlier comments really excited about the performance across all of our businesses. We are really well-positioned and we see a lot of opportunity. So, maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to comment broadly on, I think particularly of note is the strong performance we have had in fully insured and then maybe Austin Pittman could just share a little perspective on the Medicaid \u2013 managed Medicaid opportunity continues to be a strong growth opportunity for us.", "Dan Schumacher", "Sure. Thanks, Steve. Chris, to your question around performance in each of our businesses, we are performing from an earnings perspective in line with or better than our expectations. And probably within that, I would highlight to Steve Nelson\u2019s point, our commercial business is standing out a little bit. And that really is built on very strong growth foundations. So, we are doing well on the fully insured side. We have grown that over the last 3 years as we mentioned in the prepared remarks by 1.1 million lives and inside the year, we are doing better than what we had expected when we got together a year ago at the investor conference. So, really strong growth and underpinning that is some really potential efforts that we have made over the last several years to broaden our product portfolio so that we could pair that with highest performing positions and be able to create price points in our offering that can appeal to a broader spectrum all the way from our largest clients down to our smaller clients. And then I think also worth mentioning is some of the advances we have made in not only our clinical model and medical management, but our innovations around the consumer both our advocates on the phone as well as in our digital experiences and a lot of that is in partnership with very strong partnership with Optum. So, those are some of the things that are contributing to the strong commercial performance.", "David Wichmann", "Yes, thanks, Dan. I will just comment on the Medicaid market overall. It continues to be a very strong marketplace, very active. We are honored with recent new market wins in Virginia as well as in Missouri. We have had important renewals recently with Louisiana and Colorado, Arizona LTSS, so again really strong performance across the board I think in recognition of the value that we are bringing to our state partners. Because we look forward, we have got a very strong pipeline over 20 RFPs in-house. That pipeline is shaping up pretty heavily with a turn towards populations of very complex needs, which really plays to the strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We have carved out a very distinctive capability in serving those populations. So, again, it\u2019s a strong marketplace. I think states continue to look to manage Medicaid that deliver value in predictability and cost as well as importantly increasing the quality to the individuals that we serve. So, we are very, very bullish about the future of that marketplace. So, hopefully, you are getting a good sense of the consistency of the performance of the business across the board that we are referring to in our prepared remarks. I might add to that, that our international business, our global business has performed nicely year-over-year as well. Nice progression in particular coming from our colleagues down in the meal.", "Chris Rigg", "Thanks a lot.", "David Wichmann", "Yes, thanks. Next question please.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. The theme of consumers on high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms and I think United has the most work here understanding the dynamics\u2026.", "David Wichmann", "Sarah, we are struggling to hear your question as well.", "Sarah James", "Sorry. So, the theme of consumers on the high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms. And I think United has done the most work in understanding the dynamics of consumer behavior, deductibles and HFA balances. So, can you talk big picture where do you see high deductible plans going as a percent of the commercial market, what\u2019s the growth profile there and can you give us an idea of the cost trend differential or initial headwind to cost trends experience when a consumer moves to high deductible plans from a traditional commercial plan?", "David Wichmann", "So, these plan designs have been heavily sought after and have been a key contributor to our growth in part because of our ability to offer an account like an HSA alongside them are in HRA as well. So, it\u2019s been a considerable growth category for us and it\u2019s expected to continue to rise, but evolve and become more modern with greater focus on tailoring products and networks to individual consumer needs whether they be individual policies or in the case of a group A\u2019s policies, the individuals inside those groups, but maybe I will have Jeff Alter provide some additional color on or Dan Schumacher.", "Jeff Alter", "Sure. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Sarah. Just for context as you look at our portfolio across our self-funded and fully insured clients just a shade under 30% of our enrollment base is in consumer-directed offerings, a little less so in our fully insured offerings and a little more so inside of our self-funded offerings. And so we have seen some very nice take up in that over time as employers increasingly look to that as a vehicle to help continue to offer high-value benefits at a more reasonable price. In terms of sizing the delta as people step into initially into consumer directed and then what it does over time, I think obviously if that varies considerably based on where people set those attachment points and deductibles, but needless to say that there is a very, very meaningful first year benefit depending on how you structure it and we have seen improved performance on a trend basis relatively speaking over time in our high deductible offerings.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you for your questions, Sarah. Next question please.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Thank you very much. So, forgive me, but I am going to make an observation here on, it is both comforting and remarkable in a positive way to note the consistency not only of the very strong results across the enterprise, but also the presentation and commentary and guidance and a brilliant debut, David and I don\u2019t say that for any reason other than must not be easy to come in front of all of us asking out the questions on your first earnings call and this is certainly a good way to start, but that consistency is important and the way I look at the company both in terms of the growth and in terms of the de-leveraging in the capital deployment which is where my question is going here. So, you have now returned to stellar ROE performance 22% plus, you\u2019ve got your debt to total capital under 30% at 38% presumably with the kind of growth you are talking about this year and next year there is more room and you have from what I see a multitude of opportunities, David is the keeper of the keys has been involved in so many of the acquisitions that the company has made and you are now sitting on top of the organization what\u2019s the next strategic direction in terms of capital deployment. I know the basic formula, but where are the interesting things that United needs to go and do whether it\u2019s internally or externally to take the company beyond where it is today?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you for your kind remarks, Sheryl. I appreciate that. As you might suspect this transition was architected by Steve Hemsley in our board and they have done a fantastic job and I guess that should be no surprise to anyone. And thank you for your acknowledgment of the performance of the business. It does continue to advance quite nicely. All that said, we are not yet performing at our full potential and there is a lot of opportunity for this organization to continue to improve to better serve people to grow organically as well as deploy capital in ways that it has in the past with maybe a slight tilt in direction overall. As you know, we haven\u2019t invested in a significant health plan in nearly 8 years. We do, do some small plug-in acquisitions here and there and largely for the purpose to enter into a new market and/or to gain some kind of competency that allows us to better serve people more nationally. So, the vast majority of what you have seen from us in terms of focus on the UnitedHealthcare front has been to drive an organic growth agenda and then to push more globally. And when I talk about globally I mean selectively globally, we entered into Brazil, we felt that, that was a good market. It is turning out to \u2013 as it continues to evolve to in fact be a good market and we look forward to the day when the political climate and regulatory and economic climates of Brazil shape up. We think that, that will be a nice growth category for the middle class and as a result will lead to nice growth in our business. You probably saw that we extended that into some initial activities in Chile, Colombia and Peru through the pre-announced acquisition that\u2019s underway with the Medica. That is \u2013 the combination of those two give us the type of South American presence that we believe we can leverage to serve the people of South America and they in a broader way recognizing fully that not all markets are investible. So, global will be part of it, but I would say measured global investments. The more significant investments that we will make going forward particularly on the growth front will be through Optum as we have in the past. As John articulated in the prepared remarks, we have formed the pharmacy care services business, which frankly allowed us to have a foundation from which to reinvent that business if you will meaning bringing greater technological capacities, bringing our synchronization story and capacities there as well as also addressing some of the transparency issues that exists in that market overall. We believe we can add considerable innovative value to evolving that.", "Second of that would be are really where a lot of our investments are today is really in the healthcare delivery space, particularly in the ambulatory context across certain major markets in the United States. You have seen us move out on those obviously their smaller acquisitions, they may not show up as much, but the Optumcare business is one which we have grown nicely through local care practices establishing a foundation in urgent care, continuing to leverage our nurse at home capacities that came from the XLHealth acquisition dating back to 2011 I believe and \u201812 excuse me and then also the recent addition of our surgical capacities. So, Andrew Hayek and his team are continuing to build that business on an organic de novo as well as through the deployment of capital. And then I think, you will see us also move heavily in this area around technology and taking advantage of the vast assets that this company has in information and data leveraging that more distinctly like you have seen us with Rally, which was a pre-revenue company 3 years ago. Now, it\u2019s a distinctive consumer digital health capacity in the industry. We will continue to do the same on the healthcare delivery front as well as find ways to create greater value out of the data assets to better serve healthcare communities broadly. So, I\u2019d say those are the directions that we are headed with, so biased towards investing in Optum, but I would like to just underscore that our capital deployment philosophies will be consistent with what you have seen in the past. It\u2019s important for us to drive strong returns and liquidity for our shareholders. We will continue to see our dividend move to a market rate and we will be balanced about how we manage our debt positions as well.", "Sheryl Skolnick", "Perfect. Thank you so much.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you for your questions. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ana Gupte", "Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you about OptumRx and the clinical synchronization model that you have tied to medical membership up-sale and margins relative to what you are seeing now with the standalone providers like expressed having pressure retail same-store sales down and your thoughts about potential entry and your response to maybe Amazon coming in which is being speculated?", "David Wichmann", "Okay, there is a lot there, Ana. I will ask John Prince to respond and maybe I will give you a few comments on Amazon at the end.", "John Prince", "Sure. Thank you, Ana. It\u2019s John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I will cover a couple of parts. So, I think the first part was around sync and the second one is just sort of the broader market and then lastly is entrance to Amazon and others. So, in terms of sync, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. Our focus is around how you solve fundamental issues in healthcare, one is driving and that\u2019s the best net cost and pharmacy cost for our customers. The second one is how we improve the total cost in healthcare. And I think that is where we are differentiated in the market where with our capabilities at Optum, we are able to actually solve that total cost of healthcare. We had a earlier version of that in the market, the last 2 years. We have done with UnitedHealthcare with other health plans direct from markets. It\u2019s actually created a great value in the market. We are now pivoting that to a broader solution. So, we have a new version of sync which we are out in the market selling. It actually not only leverages the touch point of the phone call, how you actually saw borders in the healthcare, but we are actually very focused on what happens with the prescribing physicians, what happens in the doctor\u2019s office and how it can influence that. We are focused on our digital assets, which is where a lot of transactions happen in healthcare. And we are very focused on what happens in retail setting and have a lot of partnerships in that retail setting. So, we are taking things to the next level.", "In terms of the second question, which is on market pressure, at a broader level, I think the market is very active. I think it is very interested in the solution. We have actually had a really good selling season. We actually have had a lot of good wins to the market. And I think that shows that people are very interested in a new story around what drives value as well as what drives experience. And so I\u2019d say the market is very robust, very interested in value and that\u2019s actually to working out. So, we are going to end the season with a retention in the high 90s as well as a very strong selling season. So, I think we are in very good position in terms of looking at broader market. The last piece is let me cover Amazon in terms of the market. And I will frame that discussion from a broader context. So, as you look at what we are focused on from an OptumRx standpoint, we are focused on creating the next generations of pharmacy care models. And as part of that as I mentioned before, we are focused on total cost healthcare leverage and that model is also very focused on achieving a member\u2019s health and wellness goal on behalf of our clients. So, it\u2019s a very different model that really leverages clinical expertise and it\u2019s at the heart of what differentiates us in the market. As it relates to partners in the market, we are channel agonistic. So, our perspective is that we will meet a consumer where and how they want to be served. So, as you look at various retail partners, we are open to new distribution partners. We are willing to partner with anybody that drives value, decrease cost and also improves the consumer experience. So we are open to any partner out there that actually addressed that. Our history has been very effective. So today, we have deep relationships with CVS, with Walgreens and with other partners in the market and we are open to \u2013 we will continue those types of partnerships.", "David Wichmann", "I think you addressed any commentary. I might say, I was really just going to talk broadly about partnerships. The business has done a nice job of partnering with the marketplace broadly in the past and in no time will that become more important than the future as well. So, we will continue to engage with innovative and thought leading organizations and seek to serve consumers better managing their healthcare needs in helping make health systems work better for everyone. Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Thanks. I wanted to go back to MA. Can you help us think about typical margin profile in year one at MA versus rapid improvement, you have historically seen kind of into year two, when do you get that to sort of full mature margins and then help us think about any difference between that ramp for individual versus group? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Brian?", "Brian Thompson", "Hi, Ralph. Yes, this is Brian Thompson. I won\u2019t get into the specifics. What I can share with you is obviously as we approach 2018, the return of the tax is the biggest headwind. The good news for us is our own internal advancements are really meaningfully helping us reduce that tax impact to those that we serve first and foremost is our quality advance, secondarily is the productivity and scale that we get from that growth. And then to your point, perhaps the biggest tailwind for us is that strong clinical engagement that we did in year one that we see come to fruition in year two. So, it\u2019s certainly the biggest momentum driver for us as we prepare for the return of the tax in 2018.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "And what about group versus individual?", "David Wichmann", "It\u2019s very comparable.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, Ralph. Next question please.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Zack Sopcak", "Thanks for the question. So, Dave in your opening comments, you touched briefly on the capital plans covered in the executive order. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the experience you had with those, were they meaningful and maybe it\u2019s hard to say at this point, but how margins may have historically been in those businesses versus those were typically accustomed to?", "David Wichmann", "Yes, thank you Zack, good question. I am going to ask \u2013 we do have considerable experience with short-term plans. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to comment.", "DanSchumacher", "Sure, thanks, Zack. Good morning. So, probably addressed the association as well as the short duration plan, so on the association front, the reality is we have got decades long experience in that. Actually, our individual business was founded on an association and we likewise support associations in our group business. All told, we have got about 300,000 members in association plans today. So we have got a lot of experience, the performance is strong and I would say generally in keeping with our broader portfolio. And so we will look forward to engaging the dialogue around how they could shape going forward. On the short duration policies, obviously, the regulation that came in on April 1 that reduced the amount of links of the plans has been challenging for the marketplace. And so we are excited to see that extended to the full year, because the reality is it provides a bridge for people in between coverage. It\u2019s a lot more affordable option. It provides very strong access and value to consumers. And the reality is before that regulation we saw incredible increase in the growth as the cost of exchange offerings have grown and it\u2019s been a bridge for people. So, we look to continue to support people as hopefully the duration of those plans gets extended.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you for your question, Zack. We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take that question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Christine Arnold", "Good morning. Thanks for putting me in. I think that we really haven\u2019t delved in as much detail as some of the other things as OptumHealth and recognizing that as a tailwind to your 10% to 15% top line target as well as your 8% to 10% margin target. How should we think about that business performing over the next couple of years in the context of that top line and margin assumption putting SCA aside? I know you are still investing a lot in that business. So, was that 8% to 10% margin something we should be thinking about near-term or should we think about that as a longer term target? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Maybe I will ask Tim to comment on the margin and then maybe Andrew can provide some comments about where we are headed with the business.", "Tim Wicks", "Sure, great. Thanks, Christine. So, as we think about the year today, reported margin grew 50 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points sequentially driven by FDA. In addition, there was margin expansion from our care delivery businesses, HouseCalls and financial services as well and overall OptumHealth earnings grew 27% while we make strategic investments in the platform much as you represented. I think as you look at those investments, really important to think about that we make those investments in businesses that we have an intent to grow and those investments are designed to further improve that ability to grow and that\u2019s really evidenced even in this most recent reporting period around our revenue growth at OptumHealth of 21% year-over-year for the third quarter. I turn it over to Andrew to talk specifically about the areas of investment and market areas, where we are making those investments across platforms.", "Andrew Hayek", "Thanks, Tim and thanks for the question, Christine. So, we are pleased to be at the higher end of our range of 8% to 10% margin in the third quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we continue to balance current profitability with making investments in future growth and some examples of those are investing to help transition physician groups from fee-for-service to value-based contracts, which does require an investment period. Second is investing to ramp up new contracts and as Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, in our military and veterans segment as an example for contracts commencing in 2018. And thirdly is opening new MedExpress locations. And as you would imagine that requires an investment as each location ramps up to profitability. So given this, we expect our margin to continue to fluctuate over time and be in that range of 8% to 10%. We will continue to balance current profitability with investing and we were pleased with the 27% growth year-over-year in the quarter. There is strong performance across most of our businesses, local care delivery, HouseCalls, behavioral, financial services, consumer engagement. And so we were bullish on the business and we will continue to balance investing with current profitability.", "David Wichmann", "Great. And Larry?", "Larry Renfro", "So, Christine, it\u2019s Larry Renfro. I just want to make a couple of comments that one is kind of a commercial here on the military side, we have a new senior executive leader here by the name of General Patty Horoho. She has joined us about 5 months ago and she is leading the effort in the OptumHealth side of the military programs and I might ask \u2013 just ask her in a second to comment on a couple of the programs that are coming through on the military side. The other piece that I would add into this is that we have Optum360 that is part of our OptumInsight organization that utilizes OptumHealth as well in a lot its programs, especially when we do, do programs with major organizations that we have worked with on the West Coast and the East Coast. So that\u2019s tying in as well when you get to the physician groups and surgery centers and so forth. So, to keep it short, so Patty, would you mind just talking a little bit about what you are working on and give everybody a little [indiscernible].", "Patty Horoho", "Thank you, Larry and good morning. I have the honor to join Optum about 6 months ago after 33 years of experience culminating as the 43rd U.S. Army Surgeon General. And what we have been able to do is really leverage and find ways to transform our healthcare system from one that treats diseases to one that promotes good health. And so two of our newest 5-year contracts kept in the September of this year, we began performing the medical disability event for military veterans on behalf of the Veterans Benefit Administration. And through this contract, we provide exams in 44 states in the District of Columbia. The second 5-year contract is the TRICARE Global Nurse Advice Line, where we will operate the Military Health System\u2019s Global Nurse Advice Line starting in 2018 and this is our frontline nurse advice care coordination line offered 24 hours a day utilizing telehealth capability to military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. And what I would just say is that this is just the beginning of our ability to serve our military, their families and our veterans and we are just getting started. Thank you.", "David Wichmann", "Great. So, I think you could take from that that our bench is deep and continues to get deeper. Welcome, General Horoho and thank you Christine for your comments.", "David Wichmann", "So, I will wrap briefly with this. UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are intently focused on fulfilling the healthcare needs of the people and customers we serve. As we had distinct tangible value to healthcare, we continue to grow at a sustainable market leading pace. We expect to continue this trajectory through the remainder of 2017 into 2018 and for the decade ahead. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference in New York on November 28. Thank you for joining us and for your continued interest in our enterprise.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. ", "Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.", "This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the company\u2019s website.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.", "David Wichmann", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported 2017 results that are ahead of the outlook we shared with you at our investor conference at the end of November. Full year 2017 revenues exceeded $201 billion increasing more than $16 billion year-over-year. Operating cash flows grew to $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $10.07 per share with operating earnings from both UnitedHealthCare and Optum ahead of the forecast we provided at our conference.", "We had an active December on the growth front. We wrapped up the fourth quarter serving the benefit needs of nearly one half million more consumers completing another successful sale season in individual group MA and dual special needs plans as we turn into 2018. And advancing our strategic positions in two of five growth categories by signing both Banmedica and DaVita Medical Group, while maintaining our operating focus to both closed 2017 strongly and we expect to carry that momentum into a healthy start to 2018.", "We know the effects of tax changes for 2018 are top of mind for many. So we will begin there today with corporate tax reform. Our starting point for determining our approach was with our mission helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone and our recognition of the enormous gap between where healthcare is today and where it could and should be. We concluded that our ambitions for a better health and for a better health system are best achieved through investment in ways that will make healthcare far more affordable and of far higher quality.", "More specifically corporate tax reform is expected to improve earnings and cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2018. That\u2019s after an estimated $400 million to $500 million reduction in premium revenues due to minimum loss ratio and lower net health insurance fee recapture effects and a 200 million to 300 million additional investment and operating costs as we accelerate existing initiatives and artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health related initiatives in local communities.", "We expect to invest the remaining increased cash flows to better fulfill our mission and in turn to grow and diversify our enterprise for the long-term all aligned to the ambitious agenda we discussed with you on Investor Day.", "We now expect adjusted 2018 earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share and cash flows from operations in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. John Rex will offer more details later in this call and as usual we will be available by phone throughout the day.", "Before leaving Texas, I would note that we continue to advocate strongly for our multi-year deferral and ultimately the repeal of the health insurance tax given its high cost to consumers and society. If a deferral for 2018 occurs, we plan to return the value to those impacted by the tax.", "As highlighted in our investor conference, we are pursuing growth and diversification in five key areas, healthcare delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits, digital healthcare and global. Our busy December helped us to advance these goals. The combination of OptumCare with DaVita Medical Group establishes primary and ambulatory healthcare delivery in several new local care markets for OptumCare. Through Banmedica and with Amil and Americas medical services in Brazil, we\u2019re establishing a foundation for growth in South America for decades to come.", "And then Steve Nelson will discuss United Healthcare\u2019s 2018 growth in individual and group Medicare advantage and dual special needs plan should again lead the market.", "Now let\u2019s turn to businesses starting with Optum\u2019s Chief Executive, Larry Renfro.", "Larry Renfro", "Thank you, Dave. Delivering strong results for Optum customers in 2017 enabled us to drive strong revenue and earnings growth and to create opportunities for further growth in 2018. Full year, 2017 Optum revenues increased 9% exceeding $91 billion. 2017 earnings from operations grew by nearly $1.1 billion or 19% with individual businesses earnings growth rate ranging from 16% to 28%.", "We again balance innovation investments in our businesses and strategic acquisitions with business simplification and focused cost management. The result is improved margin performance. Our full year operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 7.4% including 9.1% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings from operations grew by more than 20% for every reporting business.", "We entered 2018 with positive indicators for our business outlook. Optum helped serve 91 million people at year-end. Strong 10% growth on a large and growing base. In the fourth quarter, Optum Rx fulfilled 333 million adjusted scripts and OptumInsight advanced this backlog producing full year backlog growth of 19% to $15 billion. Our strategic relationships continued to advance as we became more deeply involved with an increasing number of sophisticated customers. Let me give you a few highlights.", "In state government services, West Virginia became the first state to engage Optum to integrate program eligibility across all state sponsored health benefit program. Over half the state population or about 900,000 people will access Medicaid as well as other human surface benefits through Optum\u2019s new integrated eligibility platform.", "We expect to build on our strong and differentiating capabilities serving health plans. Our health plan customers members, our patients, receive quality care from our physicians at local clinics and ambulatory sites of service. We had strong growth in data analytic work related to risk and quality and we received a multi-year award to manage the technology platform modernization for SSS, Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico.", "The healthcare transformation alliance relationship is off to an excellent start with 10 companies selecting OptumRx, driven by their interest in quality, cost transparency and total cost management.", "Finally, with the full implementation for Quest Diagnostic, completed their exceptional performance levels, we now manage more than $65 billion in annual billings on behalf of our diverse revenue management customers and the new client pipeline is vibrant.", "Acquisitions this past year added market leading platforms, strengthening our capabilities and depth of resources. Surgical care affiliates with its leading ambulatory surgical care practice grew revenues 7% on a same-store basis, driven by ever more complex surgical procedures shifting to non-hospital settings.", "We plan to accelerate center development in 2018 and 2019. We expanded OptumCare primary care driven practices into 10 new major metropolitan areas. This includes our pending acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, with more than 2000 employed or affiliated physicians serving 2 million patients annually.", "Like our OptumCare doctors, DMG physicians our well known for delivering high quality care to their patients and are seasoned and are working in a value-based care context on behalf of a diverse group of the most respectful payers. Combined with DMG, OptumCare will be in 35 local care delivery markets, nearly one-half of the 75 markets targeted for engagement or development. And these market operations are still in the early stages of growth and development, a fraction of the size they are targeted ultimately.", "And we combine with The Advisory Board, the market leader in healthcare research, consulting and technology. We expect Optum to bring further resources, capabilities and value serving the 4,000 hospitals and health systems that comprise The Advisory Board\u2019s membership. And we look forward to accelerating their engagement in the next six months.", "Finally, we continue to innovate to better serve market needs. We doubled the number of people with Rally IDs in 2017, now more than 15 million, while administrating more than $400 million in consumer incentives. Market interest for this type of scale tested solution is growing.

PreCheck MyScript has already being used by tens of thousands of prescribers for nearly 1.5 million transactions.

Like Optum, we\u2019re pleased to report strong growth and performance across our businesses on behalf of those that we serve. UnitedHealthCare\u2019s 2017 revenues exceeded $163 billion, and grew 10% year-over-year. 3 of our 4 businesses posted percentage growth rates in the mid-teens or higher. An employer and individual offerings performed exceptionally well, growing 9% absent the $5.3 billion negative impact of reduced participation and ACA Individual Insurance products and the 2017 Health Insurance Tax Moratorium.", "Medical costs were well managed for the year and our full year medical care ratio was near the lower end of our original forecast. The full year 2017 commercial medical cost trend was about 5.5% and we continue to forecast the trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points for 2018. Operating costs were well controlled in 2017 as operating margins strengthened 30 basis points to 5.2% with fourth quarter operating margin seasonally lower as expected.", "We improved our positioning for 2018 and for the long-term. Together with Optum, we renewed early the AERP relationship, a key long-term positive for growth serving the senior\u2019s community. We also strengthen our ability to address the social determinants of healthcare to better serve people with complex needs. And we\u2019re seeing strong interest for multi-site employers in the Nexus ACO products, the first national ACO product targeted to large self-funded customers looking for higher quality and cost performance. Nexus ACO leverages UnitedHealth premium physicians to achieve cost savings of up to 15% as customers see reductions in readmissions, ER visits, inpatient length of stay, and hospital admissions.", "We expanded into several new markets including the western slope of Colorado and upstate New York. And we\u2019ll enter Minnesota and the northern planes in the second half of 2018.

Participants in the UnitedHealthCare Motion Wellness Program have used activity trackers to walk 65 million miles, earning nearly $20 million in incentives to cover out of pocket medical expenses.", "In 2017, we served 2 million more people in the U.S. employer group, Medicare and Medicaid market segments, including almost 0.5 million more people in the fourth quarter. In Medicaid, we grew by more than 800,000 people in 2017 reflecting entries into new state, support for 110,000 more dual special needs plan numbers and a significant late year expansion in Iowa. In 2018, we expect further growth from our 2017 entries into California and Virginia from further acceleration in serving dual needs special plans and from continued in-market organic growth. The Medicaid pipeline for 2019 and beyond continues to be robust as states increasingly look to manage care for innovation, effective service and cost containment.", "In Medicare, we serve nearly 1 million more seniors in 2017 and we again expect strong growth in 2018 consistent with our expectations. Based on performance in the annual enrollment period, high customer retention and continued success serving employer group retirees through our national four-star quality plan. In UnitedHealth employer and individual, commercial group full risk offerings group served 130,000 more people this quarter and 465,000 over the past year.

We expect opportunities for growth in these markets to advance as we have in the past two decades or more in the US. Our 2017 growth and our 2018 outlook demonstrate the competitive value our offerings bring to consumers and the market, rising rates of customer retention and strong new business generation reflect the sustaining value of innovative benefit and network designs, improved service, rising NPS, distinguished clinical engagement and effective cost control.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "John Rex", "Thank you, Steve. We delivered strong well-balanced performance again in 2017. Consolidated revenues exceeded $201 billion, cash flow from operations were $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $10.07 increased 25% on top of 25% earnings growth in 2016. We re-valued our US deferred tax liabilities to reflect the newly enacted federal statutory rate of 21% which added $1.2 billion in non-cash earnings in 2017. We have excluded this from adjusted earnings per share. Our expectations for 2018 have been revised solely to reflect the lower expected tax rate now approximately 24%. The incremental investments Dave referred too and items such as rebate obligations related to loss ratio requirements, triggered by the lower tax rate.", "The change affects several line items which I will step through. We now expect adjusted net earnings per share of $12.30 to $12.60 in 2018, with cash flows from operations rising $1.7 billion from our prior outlook to a range of 15 billion to 15.5 billion. Dave referenced the $400 million to $500 million impact on premium revenues, which we expect to accommodate within the existing $223 billion to $225 billion revenue range we set at our November Investor Conference.", "We now expect UnitedHealth Group earnings from operations to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17.3 billion in 2018. This is reduced by 700 million from the prior range. Roughly 400 million to 500 million of which is driven by the premium effects of the new lower tax rate with greater than half attributed to a lower insurers fee gross up. The other factor within this $700 million reflects the end year P&L impact from the investments Dave noted to better serve people and improve the healthcare system, while strengthening our growth and innovation value.", "We expect these accelerated investments will result in 200 million to 300 million in incremental operating expense. Our current plans while still maturing allocate these investments to both businesses, leaning toward Optum. We now expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in a range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. With the midpoint increasing is much as 30 basis points from our prior outlook, again driven solely by mechanics related to the tax rate change.", "In addition, with these impacts, we expect our 2018 operating cost ratio to run in a range of 15.3% plus or minus 30 basis points with the midpoint 10 basis points above our prior outlook.", "With respect to our overall capital position and outlook, we expect to continue to follow our longstanding approach to capital allocation. This includes maintaining a consistent approach of investing in the business and returning capital to shareholder, steadily pacing toward a market rate dividend, while targeting a debt to total capital ratio in the 40% range over the long-term.", "All of the above is contained in the revise 2018 guidance table included in our supplemental information package this morning. The takeaways are that we entered 2018 with growth and earnings momentum and strong financial flexibility, a significantly improved cash flow outlook and a debt to total capital ratio below 39% at year-end 2017 with clear opportunities to put capital to work. Dave?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, John. 2017 was a strong year for UnitedHealth Group by virtually every measure. Top-line growth, rising NPS, strengthening culture and service, strategic advances, operational execution and as a result, strong financial performance. We are entering 2018 with solid momentum and a clear direction and much to get done. We plan to sustain this ambitious pace most importantly because our mission and culture and those we serve require it. Our goal remains realizing the full growth service and social potential of this remarkable enterprise. Thank you for your investment and interest in support of that goal.", "We will now open the call for questions. Asking you to limit to one question a piece, so we can get to as many as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Justin Lake", "Thanks, good morning. I appreciate some of the detail on tax reform. Just wanted to drill down here a little bit more. First, you talked about the 400 to 500 million and most of that or more than half of that being from the health insurer fee impact. I think it's pretty clear that you know the grossed up of the Medicaid - Medicaid states would require to give you back, needs to be smaller because the taxes go down, but beyond that can you help us understand how much that is of the half or more that\u2019s 400 to 500, how much is commercial and how much is Medicare that you might have passed through which I assume is zero on Medicare. And then more importantly for 2019, would love to hear your thoughts on the sustainability of the tax reform benefit that you\u2019re seeing here in 2018 including any differentiation on that sustainability by business would be really helpful. Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Good question Justin, appreciate it. We\u2019ll have John Rex talk about the -- give you a little bit more details on the impact of the $400 million to $500 million on premiums. As it relates to 2019, we\u2019re not really in a position to give elemental guidance at this stage. I understand the question but hopefully you can also appreciate that is as is always the case with respect to market dynamics particularly in the commercial market with respect to pricing it subject to a number of variables including negotiation and also attribution of cost. So, it\u2019s not as -- not to belittle it at all but it's not as simple as applying math. This is something though that as the year progresses and we see what happens with the health insurance tax, we will be very deliberate and making sure that we quantify the effects of that and do so in the context of giving you guidance for 2019. John do you want to discuss the four to five please.", "John Rex", "Yes, good morning Justin. Let me just give a little more background on how that works which will benefit everyone on the call here. So just recall, when we look through how this works through our P&L, the larger component as I mentioned in my prepared comments is the impact of the lower premium gross, the federal tax rate decline. So, remember the health insurance tax of course in non-deductible, that results in a gross upon the premium line and that flows through the P&L and that impacts the number of ratios as you heard me describe this morning across the P&L.", "So as a result of the gross at the pre-tax operating earnings of course were impacted. As that requirement declines, it\u2019s neutral on the after-tax earnings line but it impacts pre-tax. So that\u2019s really what we are attempting to go through here. I think you spotlighted one of the kind of the easiest to understand ones in terms of some of our state program arrangements here where really when we went into this, the arrangements for the state were explicitly around being made whole for the tax gross up because of the non-deductibility. So that has an explicit impact as that declines and so some of those state arrangements are explicitly that way and so when we go to collect that we\u2019ll be collecting a gross up rate of 21%. There are other businesses where they have some impact, to contractual arrangements. I\u2019m not going to parse them out in terms of the specific amounts we\u2019ve joined as Dave described. But you\u2019re right about kind of how that impact flows through.", "Justin Lake", "I am sorry just wanted to confirm here. In Medicare I think you guys have talked about the gross up not having -- you never passed it through to consumers via lower benefits. So that doesn\u2019t need to be given back. Is that correct? And then on commercial, how much of commercial do you expect to get back over time and how much is already in this number? Thank you.", "David Wichmann", "Well, Justin we are -- as it relates to in Medicare in particular -- obviously that\u2019s all subject to a discussion with CMS and negotiation that occurs in connection with the offering of the annual benefits. Our goals are always to maintain as much consistency as possible and benefit offerings, network access, pharmacy offerings, formularies as much as possible to keep those benefits as stable as can be. That\u2019s one of the leading contributors to a very strong net promoter scores with that population. So again, our goals there are to maintain as much stability as possible.", "As it relates to the market, if you think about what we have here, we\u2019ve got two businesses. One which is regulated and one unregulated. But the regulated business taxes if you will, we have the tax of value of that if you will a piece of that, a good chunk of it goes back to the market through these recapture mechanisms that we\u2019ve outlined here this morning, that\u2019s the 400 million to 500 million that John described.", "In addition to that, we thought it would be best that we then invest in things that we know happened to be through our P&L, in this case of areas we know where we can improve healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs in the future. That\u2019s a 200 million to 300 million that John described as well. The vast majority of the residual is either attributed to the Optum business and/or we felt was best and most appropriate for us to invest in continuing to advance healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs really aimed at trying to achieve this mission around helping people and helping to improve health systems.", "So that\u2019s where we are at today. We think it\u2019s a fair balance. We think that that balance is something that\u2019s sustainable over the long haul.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Dave Windley", "Hi, good morning. I figured there will be a lot of questions on tax pass-through, I'm going to avoid that one. In your OptumHealth build out, I am curious to what extent or how far along are we in the process of your benefit designs on the UnitedHealthcare side including some type of favorability toward OptumHealth networks, is that something you can do now, is it something that you plan to do, is it something that you need to build more critical mass in OptumCare before you can get there? I am curious about how much -- if you are building a plan that helps the healthcare system to work better, I would think you would want to favor that, I am wondering how much you are doing there?", "David Wichmann", "It\u2019s a great question Dave and it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s often misunderstood about our OptumCare platform, and that is a multi-payer platform. It serves 80 plus payers broadly. The dynamics around its offerings to the market, particularly around pricing are negotiated including with UnitedHealthcare, there is no favoritism applied other than what you would characterize as normal dynamics in a marketplace. And so, our intention is to not -- is to provide a broad offering and engage the ambitions of all payers so that we can serve more patients. But Andrew, do you want to touch on maybe some of our strategies there and how we\u2019re advancing that business?", "Andrew Hayek", "In today\u2019s comments, we are very much committed at Optum and in OptumCare to a multi payer strategy and serving multi payers in the markets we serve is integral to our business models including our medical groups, our IPAs, our ambulatory surgery centers and our neighborhood care centers. So, we work to earn and maintain the trust and confidence of our payer partners around the country. And we do that by providing outstanding value to the members and the communities we serve in terms of quality, patient experience and impacting the total cost of care. And then as you look at the track record that we have as we added IPAs, medical groups, as we added SCA, as we added MedExpress, we have continued the multi-payer strategy of those entities. And in fact, we\u2019ve worked very carefully with each of those payer partners to expand those relationships, continue to serve them and help their success.", "David Wichmann", "So, Dave it\u2019s fair to say those that get kind of closest to OptumCare, the payers that do are the ones that get the best value out of it. And certainly, UnitedHealthCare works very collaboratively with OptumCare, but several of our payer, our customers do as well. Next question please?", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll next to Matt Borsch with the BMO Capital Markets.", "Matt Borsch", "Thank you. I was hoping that you could just talk about medical trend. And from a couple of different dimensions, number one, to understand as your outlook for going back up to the 6% range versus 5.5% that you experienced, is that just the conservatism that we\u2019ve seen from UNH over the last several years or is there something specific? And I guess related to that is, what you think the impact to the economy is here? And if you\u2019re surprised at all by the 2017 if anything, it seems like a softening of trend relative to the prior year? And sorry, if I could fit this one in and that base of question of the pace of benefits change in the high deductible plan impact in this mix?", "David Wichmann", "Okay, that\u2019s all right, Matt, I will try to get all those answered. As it relates to medical trend in 2017, our teams worked very hard to control healthcare cost. Usually, our forward view of trend is comprehensive and it also reflected deep respect for the healthcare economy and the ways trends developed overtime. But, I think our teams did a really nice job of continuing to mitigate trend for 2017 and have done -- have taken a prudent approach for 2018 and beyond. Do you want to talk at all about the how trend has advanced year-over-year and maybe what some of the elemental items are?", "Larry Renfro", "As Steve Nelson mentioned in his commentary and as Dave touched on where we\u2019re now at 5.5%. So right at the low end of the range from a year ago that we laid out, but completely in line with our investor conference. It really reflects as Dave mentioned, our efforts to manage cost and improve quality and we continue to do that through things like ensuring the right level of care, the right place of service, the effectiveness of our clinical model, alignment with our partnerships and we\u2019re really seeing -- the improvements have really been broad base across our category, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific, wouldn\u2019t point to the economy especially around that as well. And as Dave mentioned as to 2018, we\u2019re always respectful of trend and there is nothing that we\u2019ve seen as we closed out 2017 that would view our change at this point for 2018.", "Matt Borsch", "What about the pace of benefit change in on how that\u2019s obviously played a role as you move to more employers to high deductible plans. Is that continuing at the same rate going into this year?", "David Wichmann", "Dan Schumacher, will comment on that, Matt.", "Dan Schumacher", "Good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Dan.", "Matt Borsch", "Good morning.", "Dan Schumacher", "As you look at the benefits what couple of dimensions to it, right. We have -- if you look at the deductibles, deductibles are rising a little bit faster in 2018 as compared to the rate of increase in 2017 and in part due to the reintroduction, I think of the insurers feed that\u2019s pushing pricing up and putting some pressure on employers to make more adjustments to the benefits. If you look at aggregate buy downs, I think those are relatively comparable year-over-year, but if you just look at the proportion of people that are buying and choosing more progressive plan designs, I would say that that has been a long-standing trend that continues in 2018, just a thing that was in 2017.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Tanal", "Thanks a lot for the questions, guys. Wanted to just touch on the $400 million to $500 of minimum MLR rebates. I\u2019m sort of curious to understand whether that had anything to do with sort of pricing plans for the all tax regime and what that could mean for 2019. And relatedly on the incremental investments side of things these were described as accelerated programs in the release. And I\u2019m wondering if you can sort of give us a flavor for how much flexibility that might enable for 2018 and then looking into 2019 as well?", "David Wichmann", "Maybe we will have John Rex address the fore part of that question and then I\u2019ll wrap on the investments.", "John Rex", "Let me just get back to that. So, to be clear here on the $400 million to $500 million, that\u2019s comprised of two components and the minimum MLR rebate component of that is less than half of that component. The greater component has to do with just really the lower premium gross ups as the federal tax rate declines. I just really want to be clear on that in terms of how that works. So minimum MLRs, less than half of that $400 million to $500 million, it\u2019s really just the mechanical impacts, the recapture impact on the lower premium gross up, that is the majority of $400 million to $500 million. And Dave will address the investments.", "David Wichmann", "So, Steven it\u2019s a very good question. So, what we\u2019ve done here is we really have investment occurring on two fronts. One is it relates to the $200 million to $300 million as I described earlier, it\u2019s going through the P&L and that\u2019s the one when you\u2019re picking up on a lot of those investments through the P&L are in the application of technology if you will across the business and in order to accomplish a number of things, it\u2019s to both improve the quality of our services to people which includes the advancing of our MPS ambitions which I think we\u2019ve laid out pretty strongly as well as to continue to find ways to improve cost structure thereby delivering greater value broadly to the health system and to individual consumers within it.", "You should look at that as an uptick in the run rate expectations of our level of investments, partly in response to the tax, a great change if you will. Beyond that is the balance, which is $1.7 billion or so in improved cash flows in the business. And that you\u2019ll see us align more quickly strategically in the market to advance things like our care delivery platforms, which we just discussed.", "As you know, we are not quite midway through the establishment of the foundation of our market presence in local markets in that business, as an example. So that additional investments and technology related platforms to advance things like precision medicine, genomics, things of that nature where we believe we can apply our capacities as an organization are some of the areas that you will see us advance our investment portfolio.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James.", "Michael Baker", "Just trying to get a sense of the size of the PBM pipeline of opportunities this year compared to last year. And if you could gave a little bit of color on market segments that are more active that would be helpful?", "David Wichmann", "We see nice growth in the PBM, both this year, including the growth within our customer base and we have a nice pipe for 2019. John?", "John Rex", "So we just finished off a really strong year. We had our new business targets. We also had really good retention as I talked about at Investor Day we\u2019re at almost 98% in terms of our retention. We\u2019ve seen solid growth both with our existing client based, including health plans. So really broad based both across all market segments for 2018. In terms of 2019, I think it's still early. We have a really good pipeline, but their pipeline year-over-year is pretty similar, but it\u2019s actually still early.", "We have some wins for 01/01/19 already, so we\u2019re seeing strong active growth for the market. And I\u2019d say the big deals we won\u2019t care about until the end of first quarter, so strong pipeline and good growth. I don\u2019t see any changes in terms of what market segments are selling more than others right now. And I\u2019d say last summer comment is that our value story in the market is really resonating. We\u2019re seeing strong interest from sophisticated buyers that are attractive to our pharmacy care services model.", "Operator", "Our next question is from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "A .J. Rice", "Maybe I\u2019ll just ask you about the acquisition pace, seems like in \u201917 and accelerated and it certainly as we went through the year, it seemed to accelerate as we got toward the end. I mean that could be a function of greater availability of deals; it could be a function of particularly and after we build out the infrastructure; you feel more confident as you can integrate them faster pace of deals; it could be the balance sheet is now as your target. Can you give us a flavor for R&D? We\u2019re in an environment where your acquisition pace is likely to accelerate. And maybe I\u2019ll just throw in there an update on the international outlook since I know both Optum and UHC have pointed to that as a growth area and with the BenMedica deal maybe that brings you back into focus a little bit?", "David Wichmann", "Thank you, A. J., very good question. There really is nothing -- we really didn\u2019t accelerate the pace of our acquisition, it's just coincidental that those two acquisitions happen to come at that time. As indicated, they line up nicely with two of the five growth areas of our business. We\u2019ve long indicated that we have an interest in measured investments in global, and that BenMedica allowed us to get into three additional South American markets. We have been studying those markets for about five years, and that allowed us to advance our position there. As you know, we\u2019re in an open process right now to close that transaction.", "And then the other one was the DMG acquisition, which again I would characterize as more coincidental but highly strategic in terms of our ambitions and interest in building the Optum care platform overall. So really no acceleration, you shouldn\u2019t infer anything with respect to how we\u2019re allocating capital broadly.", "I would like to just take a moment, if I can, to have Molly Joseph who is our Chief Executive of our International Business, UnitedHealthcare International, maybe just spend a moment on BenMedica and our positioning in South America broadly.", "Molly Joseph", "Thanks for the question A. J. Let me just offer my perspective on three things related to our global expansion; first is the business progression we\u2019ve seen in Brazil; second, the pending transaction with BenMedica; and then perhaps touching on how we view Latin America, more broadly. Brazil, we\u2019ve started 2017 with pretty ambitious expectations for the business, particularly in the area of margin improvement. And that was across both our health benefits and our BenMedical delivery businesses. Very pleased that we\u2018ve fully executed on that plan.", "The improvements are really being driven by a combination of a very strong local management team that focused on innovation and quality and increasing, the localized application of our enterprise capabilities and competencies in clinical, in technology, in data and analytics.", "So we entered 2018 in Brazil with really strong momentum for continued margin expansion and quality advancement, which brings me to BenMedica. As Dave mentioned, BenMedica is a organization that we have known for a very long time and we have suddenly built the market for a long time. There are market leader across Chile, Columbia and Peru, in both healthcare benefits and medical delivery. And they have a really strong local management team with a proven track record in delivering very consistent high margin growth across both lines of their business and across all three of those countries.", "So similar to Brazil, we see a opportunity to create value by combining that strong local team and that strong platform with our enterprise capability, again across, clinical, technology and data and analytics. Transaction is currently in an open tender process and we would expect to close that yet this quarter.", "So pivoting then to our view of Latin America more broadly. We see really attractive healthcare dynamics and characterized by a growing demand for affordable private healthcare. And our acquisition of BenMedica will put us in a leading position in four of the largest economies across that region. Collectively, these countries have a population roughly equal to that of the U.S., but perhaps more growth opportunity in these emerging private healthcare markets, as well as a broader and longer term opportunity to serve the systems more holistically by also serving public markets.", "So we think we\u2019re really well positioned for the value creation over the long horizon and we are focused on bringing value to those markets.", "David Wichmann", "So we took a little bit of time there, because you hadn\u2019t had the chance to discuss this at our investor conference. And of course, this came right on the hills of that as the DMG, which we\u2019ve already referred to earlier today. As it relates to the international markets, in particular, I just want to stress again that our approaches to those markets will be measured approach to deployment capital in those markets will be measured, and deeply respectful of the volatility that\u2019s inherent in each one of those.", "And our expectations are that they provide returns that are reflective of those risks and risk profiles that exist in each of those markets. Not to belabor this, but there was one other acquisition that we had closed, The Advisory Board that I might just ask Larry Renfro to make a few comments on as well. Thanks.", "Larry Renfro", "So A. J., I know this would be something important to you, The Advisory Board where you closed, I think it was in the latter part of November. So we\u2019re in the process of implementing the Optum playbook in terms of integration and alignment, but it\u2019s gone extremely well. Well received it in the marketplace. And we really believe that this is going to enhance our sales pipeline, as well as our sales for 2018. It\u2019s very, very complementary business and their management team is strong and it\u2019s so complementary to us. We\u2019re looking for a lot of good things out of The Advisory Board.", "Operator", "Next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Rigg", "Actually just had a follow-up on the international and global strategy. When we think about at least South America, do you think overtime this becomes one cross-border enterprise under a unified brand name, or is it a portfolio approach where you\u2019ll continue to run both businesses separately for the long-term? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Just like North America, South America is an inherently local market. And so in that regard at least for the time being, we have two very strong or three very strong brands now in Brazil, both Amil and Am\u00e9ricas M\u00e9dicos Servi\u00e7os and then in Chile, Colombia and Peru, predominantly Chile, BenMedica is the holding company. But they also operate with a series of very recognizable local brand names, both in healthcare delivery as well as healthcare insurance.", "So I think you will continue to see that posture. To the extent that we need to clarify that like we\u2019ve been doing with some branding activity in Brazil this past year, we will do so. But for the most part we\u2019re deeply respectful of the brand value that these folks have created overtime.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.", "Josh Raskin", "So wanted to talk a little bit about med stuff, and I am curious what percentage of your book today has first dollar coverage. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about migration strategy going that one open enrollment period before the changes take effect for 2020? And I guess I am just curious on the economics of that switch. I assume the dollars are -- gross margin dollars are higher. But I would be curious if the returns are any better. And then lastly, do you think this is a big impact on the industry, i. e., a step function for MA in 2020 or do you think this is going to be more incremental? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "As you might suspect, a lot of the growth we\u2019ve seen MA comes from our Medicare supplement products overall. But I would ask Brian Thompson maybe to more specifically respond to your question.", "Brian Thompson", "Sure, Dave. Good morning, -- thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the last point. I don't see this as a big transformative change. We\u2019ve seen this and been aware of this change. [Audio Gap] for some years now. We have the vast majority of our business today in first dollar coverage, but have been very pleased with our introduction of what we call the Plan G in the middle of 2017 and we are certainly seeing that resonate in the marketplace.", "But actually in terms of the seniors' perspective, we like the continuation and really the collision of both the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare supplement products in the marketplace really provide broad, good choice for those that are choosing. And again as we're selling right now very pleased with the margins on both plans, I don't think there is much as to be differentiated in terms of economics of either. But certainly don't think this as a big move over the long-term.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "I wanted to go back to tax reform and the long-term sustainability of the benefit. I appreciate that facing change over the next year, so you have to watch and wait. I guess I start with United actually and actually almost literally wrote the book on pricing per membership. And although I guess competitors might decide to put that back in the benefits, you obviously don't have to follow a suite. And so I would think that would be largely -- how much of benefits you decided to keep versus not keep, so maybe you could give some perspective on that. And then is there any thoughts initially about where you think competition wise there might be more pressure within the business? I would think that most of the Optum businesses actually will probably have less pressure than the health plan businesses. But want to get your perspective on that?", "David Wichmann", "So as it relates to the $400 million to $500 million, just again to reiterate, most of that is the combination of two things. One is the minimum MLR amount so that we would need to return to policyholders, if you will. And then, the second relates to the lower tax rate on the health insurance tax. So that is what I would characterize is more of a -- I hate to say, but more of a mechanical element, if you will, and returning those premium values to consumers.", "As it relates to sustainability, again, I would urge you to think about the tax reform affecting our cash flows and earnings, as in a bifurcated way. One is, as it relates to the services business, which -- and as well as all the unregulated aspects of UnitedHealthCare, which are substantive. Those components are the ones that we're retaining and investing, if you will. And then think about the other half or the other portions being that, which relates to the regulated entity, of which you can see a substantial dollar amount is being returned to the market.", "On top of that, we invest in managing healthcare costs better, as well as applying better services. And then on top of that, invest more fully in what I'll characterize as more substantive event or transformative change to improve the health system and improve our offerings broadly to the marketplace.", "So in our view, we believe it to be sustainable, because of the fact that we have such a substantive amount that's already been reverted back in premium values, plus the other changes that we\u2019ve outlined. So our intention is at this stage from this distance, which is it\u2019s pretty early on, that we\u2019ve made the right allocations if you will in determining how to best utilize this tax reform value.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Gary Taylor", "Just want to ask a little bit about OptumRx, and it looks like the revenue growth accelerated -- year-to-year revenue growth accelerated sequentially and the OI accelerated pretty meaningfully the growth there sequentially. And anything you wanted to call out for us there.", "David Wichmann", "Gary, I\u2019m not sure we got your question, it that was fairly broken. So if you could rephrase it please.", "Gary Taylor", "I was asking about OptumRx.", "David Wichmann", "Okay. Thank you, much better.", "Gary Taylor", "And the question was, it looks like the revenue growth, year-to-year revenue growth, accelerated sequentially a fair amount than and the OI growth accelerate pretty substantially, sequentially as well. Just wondered if you could give us a little more color on that performance?", "David Wichmann", "Sure. I\u2019d ask John Prince, please.", "John Prince", "In terms of the acceleration, I think the key driver of that is our strong increase in adjusted scripts. So if you look at our volume, which is driving our business, our adjusted scripts is up 5%. Our scripts are actually been accelerated all year long. So our script growth was the highest in Q4 versus any other quarter in the year. So that is really driven by the success we\u2019ve had in the market in terms of taking on new clients, winning new business and keeping our existing clients. And so that is the key driver from it.", "One other driver from it has also been the Specialty Pharmacy business. So we highlighted that at Investor Day that we\u2019ve been very successful in the specialty market, that\u2019s the market where you both plan with existing business and also compete in the open market. Our value story has been resonating. Our experience has been very solid, both for members and physicians. And so we\u2019ve been getting a lot of uptake in our specialty pharmacy business, that all has been driving our overall revenue growth. So very solid from the business standpoint.", "David Wichmann", "Thank you for your question, Gary. We\u2019re going to pick up the pace here a little bit to try to get in this as many questions as possible. Next question please.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "A little bit of time has passed and you\u2019ve had more time to think about the executive order and lack of individual mandate. Any updated thoughts on how disruptive you think that will or won\u2019t be, maybe have you had dialogue with small group. What\u2019s your sense for their appetite and maybe change their approach. And does that at all relate to your commentary on your call around enrolment being pulling back I guess in 1Q and coming back due to small group, I think. If you could flush that out as well. Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "So I\u2019ll address the executive order and then I\u2019ll have Jeff Alter to talk about the market dynamics here in just a moment. So the executive order had three components to it, the one I think that has the most momentum or at least initial momentum is around the association how plans, but we also have HRA and short-term limited duration policy considerations as well. So what I think happening across all of these is that the administration is pursuing an expansion of products that are available to consumers and in an effort to lead to more participation. And I think that that also lead to more insurance market stability broadly.", "So we\u2019re supportive of that, of expanding the choice of the offerings that consumer has and continues have. And I think each and every one of these regulations are really geared in that way. So we\u2019re supportive of these efforts to improve choice and frankly provide access to lower cost alternatives because as you well know healthcare costs too much and consumers are seeking more affordable options.", "We\u2019re still reviewing the association health plan rules at this time and we\u2019re not going to speculate on the potential outcomes of regulatory matters. But I would remind you that we have significant experience and do offer association health plans today, primarily in our individual business and/or operate in markets like PEOs and others that have similar characteristics. What\u2019s important about these is they must be designed carefully in order to enhance coverage options and to ensure that they don\u2019t destabilize other aspects of the insurance market, like the small group market. So that\u2019s largely where our commentary will be aimed, is making sure that there is no unintended consequences of these.", "And then with respect to enrollment in the first quarter, Jeff, can you touch on that please.", "Jeff Alter", "As you saw, we had another strong quarter of growth at the end of 2017 and that makes a run of 13 consequence quarters of strong fully insured group growth. When you look at 2018, our outlook that is unchanged from our investor conference has a market dynamic that has the introduction, full introduction of the health insurer tax. And that\u2019s resulting in much higher premiums and quite frankly, much higher year-over-year increases for our clients.", "So with that in mind, we look at our very large one-one enrollment in our larger business. We continue to see small group growth and we believe that as the year paces, we will return to growth in that the remaining three quarters and continue our run of strong growth.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Zack Sopcak", "Just wanted to ask quickly about your MedExpress Walgreens collocation highlight, I think you\u2019re at about 15 sites at your Investor Day. Curious how that\u2019s going and how you think about in your perspective what metrics you have to see or think about a broader rollout for United and Optum? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "I know this has gotten a lot of attention here, in particular, over the course of the last week or so with some activity at the JP Morgan Conference. I want to keep this into context. We have about a dozen or so locations that we brought online throughout 2017 and that was really to see whether not a retail side of service in this case with Walgreens would be an attractive venue for care delivery.", "The results are not near final but we\u2019re hoping that our MedExpress surgical care model with an adjunct pharmacy performs as good or better than without meaning that we can provide more convenient service to consumers at a lower cost and with very, very high levels of quality as MedExpress had as reflected in their NPS scores from consumers. I also want to put into context in that and this is just part of developing an overall higher performing local health systems. So it just be one component that maybe nested inside a local care delivery market with ambulatory surgical capacities and house calls and things of that nature.", "This is the future health system that we see delivering considerable value to people. The other thing I just want to emphasize is that we\u2019ll evaluate other venues and partners as well. This is an exclusive to any one, in particular, our interests are being able to line as productively as possible with others in these local communities to see if we can deliver additional value to people.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "So on the providing side of the house, wanted to see what your thoughts are on your organic strategy and M&A. And firstly on the build out of the Optum care into 35 and then into target 75 markets. What type of competition are you facing with either other plans or private equity or other health systems? And how do you become the acquirer of choice? Obviously, you did get the DaVita asset.", "David Wichmann", "I think we\u2019re nicely positioned initially here, but we\u2019ve got a long ways to go. But I wonder if we -- over that for Andrew, Andrew Hayek", "Andrew Hayek", "So first and foremost, we started this strategy to build out Optum care in high value ambulatory care networks several years ago. And so we\u2019re several years into the strategy. The addition of DMG is another step forward in that process. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity to combine with DMG. And I would also remind you that we\u2019re in the midst of an approval process that\u2019s underway. And the step forward for us allows us to combine DMG\u2019s outstanding clinicians, local leadership and national leadership. They\u2019ve achieved very strong results in Stars, clinical outcomes and patient experience. And our capabilities and our strategies are very complementary. We anticipate that many of DMG\u2019s capabilities will make Optum care stronger. Reciprocally, we believe we can add a lot of value to DMG. And by doing this, we enhance the value we provide into the markets we serve.", "More broadly, the markets that we are targeting and entering have been and remain competitive. We earn the right to partner with medical groups and IPA, and surgery centers and ambulatory care centers through value. But we need to demonstrate our ability to enhance clinical outcomes, the patient experience and reduce the overall cost of care. And that is true across Optum care in each component parts. So we earn that right to partner and we think as we continue to grow and enhance our capabilities, we become a more and more attractive partner.", "And now that we have the ability to combine various ambulatory care assets with the medical group and the IPA, we can address a broader spot of healthcare needs in the marketplace and become an even more attractive partner overtime.", "David Wichmann", "So Ana, very good question, one of five key areas for growth in the future this one, very early stages. Again, it feels like we are assembling relatively quickly, but it's one thing to enter into the markets and other things to apply information, technology and really enable these health systems to be strong performers and make a difference on the cost and quality, consumers receive in those market. So more to come over the coming years on this strategy as we continue to roll it out. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Frank Morgan", "For several quarters now, you called out the growth in the behavioral health services as one of your drivers of growth inside of OptumHealth. I was curious if you would give us any additional color on that growth area. What specific services, the in-patient out-patient and what in particular markets, is it more of a government or Medicaid product? And then wanted just a clarification, I think you said of surgical care affiliates 7% growth. And I want to confirm is that organic and then also if you could break out price versus volume? Thanks.", "David Wichmann", "Frank, thank you. That is a same-store growth rate as we described, but Andrew oversees all those businesses. Andrew Hayek?", "Andrew Hayek", "I will start with SCA, so the 7% is our same-site net patient revenue growth, so that\u2019s how we measure organic growth at SCA for several years. And so that\u2019s the combination of volume and rate. Keeping in mind that a total joint replacement could take couple of hours and reimburse $20,000, pain injection could take 10 or 12 minutes and reimburse less than $1,000. So we use same-site revenue as the organic growth measure. And 7% is a very strong number, that\u2019s the high end of the range that we have grown over the past several years, and is a reflection of the cumulative impact of the strategy we pursue, partnering with health plans and medical groups and health systems, being very disciplined in shaping our portfolio, the right M&A as well as some strategic dispositions to make sure are in the right markets, focusing on high acuity procedures, ramping up total joints, cardiovascular, complex spine, et cetera. So we\u2019re very pleased with the 7% same-site growth rate. And as Dave -- as was mentioned in the script, we continue to grow our SCA portfolio.", "On behavioral health, we\u2019ve had strong performance across the board and that\u2019s including our medical expense, our ability to serve our consumers, including the growing needs in autism and substance abuse disorder. And so really we feel very good about our product and our presence. And we continue to ramp up and add external customers and grow in virtually each of the segments that we serve. So we feel very good about the behavioral, the trajectory we\u2019re on and the prospects for 2018.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.", "Sarah James", "Can you speak to the OptumCare ASC surgical trend environment? So how is the trajectory going this year versus in the past? Are you seeing consumerism impact total annual surgical demand, or is it just back-end loading and changing the location of service? And taking that one step further. Do your systems allow you to see impact of in-patient diversion for non-UHC members? In the past, you\u2019ve said that you could track this on the individual member basis on the insurance side. But I am wondering for the submarket of OptumCare\u2019s ASC, can you tell how much of that volume was diverted from in-patient or does this data and technology not currently exist with that?", "Andrew Hayek", "I would say from a wide lens, stepping back that ASC environment, certainly fits into consumerism. And so over the past several years with rising membership and high deductible plans, consumers being more aware of various alternative sites of care and having more financial responsibility for the cost of their care; we study this; we hear it anecdotally; patients are asking more questions; are asking questions to their physician; and they are searching more. And when they do, the ASC environment for clinically appropriate procedures is at very attractive site; based on quality outcomes, based on the patient experience, we have a Net Promoter Score of 91, as well as the cost effectiveness; procedures in our setting of care are roughly half to less than half the price of the same procedure in a hospital environment.", "So we do fit very well into consumerism and we have some data as well as many, many anecdotes that affirm the consumerism does drive increasing interest in our sites. In terms of back-ended nature, the years have always been seasonal, that's due to the members and patients when they're at the end of the year and they have a deductible to spend. They would rather get the procedure done by the fourth quarter before the plans are reset. So there is nothing new or different about that trend.", "And then in terms of in-patient diversion or share of the market that we're receiving, we work with multiple plan partners to measure this in various ways. We have a number of pilots underway with multiple health plan partners to track this and do a better job of capturing the right, clinically appropriate procedures. We're making progress. We feel very good about it. And we're still in the very early days. There is still a lot of opportunity to think about higher acuity procedures, like total joint replacements, complex spine, cardiovascular procedures. So we're very optimistic about what the future holds.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold", "OptumInsight backlog $15 billion, uptick nicely in the quarter. And could you talk about the specific areas where you're really seeing traction in OptumInsight? And where that backlog is really building?", "Eric Murphy", "To your point, we added $2.4 billion to our backlog during 2017. In Larry's opening comments, we shared, that\u2019s 19% year-on-year growth. So we're pleased with that performance. We had a strong Q4 in terms of sales, which enabled us to achieve the $15 billion objective. For Q4 sales, the primary contributors to that backlog came through our state government business, as well as our ambulatory rev cycle business. In terms of the path forward, we take a very robust pipeline into 2018, which should help us achieve our $17 billion to $18 billion guidance that we provided to you during the Investor Conference.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Peter Costa", "My question is on your guidance. Well, I appreciate very much that your guidance changed only includes tax reform items, so that makes easier for us. But the fourth quarter looks like it was running ahead of your guidance. And the fact that you even called out the UHC was ahead of your own expectations in the fourth quarter. So why aren't there other changes to guidance going forward? Or does that imply that you're more comfortable at the top-end of the range now or were there some negative things that we should be thinking about that came into play during the quarter?", "David Wichmann", "Well, Peter I think really what it's reflective of is we're maybe 45 days from the time that we had our investor conference and first led out the depth of our initial guidance. Overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of the company and how it's advanced to the balance of 2017 and how it's established itself nicely for 2018 and beyond. At this instance, we didn't think it was appropriate or necessary to reflect any additional guidance changes based upon the core performance of the business. Let us get through a quarter or two here and we'll reevaluate what our expectations are for 2018.", "Peter Costa", "And what was the prior period development in the fourth quarter, if you don't mind?", "John Rex", "I think it was $200 million.", "David Wichmann", "So thank you Peter. To wrap up, in 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered quality products and services, practical innovation, a better consumer experience and increasing customer satisfaction. Financial performance was strong, marked first and foremost by distinguished and diversified growth, meeting or exceeding our outlook by virtually every measure, including revenue, cash flows and earnings.", "We have carried this momentum into 2018 and expect to continue to improve quality and MPS scores and build greater trust and loyalty, enabling continued growth for many years to come.
