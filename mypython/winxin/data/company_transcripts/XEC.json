After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone, and again, welcome to the Cimarex First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. An updated presentation was posted to our website this morning. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements.", "A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file an amended 10-K for 2016 and our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31 later today.", "Our prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration; and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs; and our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.", "So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, Karen, and thanks to all of you who are joining us for the call. Cimarex had a very good first quarter. Our production beat was driven by continued improvement in our well results, operational excellence and field execution and a bit of luck, as we had not experienced any significant weather or field outage events during the quarter. Hats off to our organization for outstanding execution during the quarter. As a result, we're raising our full-year production guidance to 1.09 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.13 Bcf equivalent per day. Our full-year exploration and development capital remains unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.", "We're pleased to be sharing a trove of operational updates with you during the call this morning. John will be updating you on a number of important projects as he will describe these projects of tested well spacing, the stacking and staggering of wells, landing zone selection and completion optimization. Our results in these projects have been highly encouraging. Quarterly results are interesting, but we focus on the long term.", "Our core belief is that shareholders are best served by reinvesting their cash flow at the highest rates of return we can manage. Our industry tends to be trendy as certain plays and basins fall in and out of favor. Our focus remains on full cycle, fully burdened return on capital employed. We strive to build a portfolio that can deliver superior returns through the cycles. We have never felt more confident in our assets, our ongoing results and our ability to execute on our mission. We are achieving excellent return on capital and are extending our inventory life through tighter well spacing, opening up additional zones and through exploration leasing. The rate of change within Cimarex is accelerating, driven by increasingly positive results. As the song goes, the future's so bright, I gotta wear shades.", "We have spoken at length regarding our commitment to science, innovation and an understanding of the downhole physics behind landing zone selection and completion innovations. These understandings have tremendous implications to well bore spacing, well performance and net asset optimization. We also speak directly to return on capital, asset life and depth of inventory. Being good at the science tends to extend inventory life.", "The results you will hear in this call are no accident. They are the direct result of an organization that is focused on innovation, honestly examines its failures as well as its successes and strives to be an open, transparent culture where technical debate is highly encouraged. We relentless study our competition and try to learn from their successes and failures.", "As we look across the fence, we occasionally see infill projects that have significant well-to-well interference, resulting in meaningful degradation from parent well response. We understand these challenges and at times have faced these disappointments ourselves. Success or failure on these fronts will be a strong differentiator among E&P companies. We are pleased to report the results you will hear in this call. They are the result of tremendous persistence on the part of our geoscience and operations teams. As I said, it is no accident.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to John, allow me to comment on the recent release of our accounting error. We recently discovered an error in the calculation of our ceiling test impairment. It was a simple error, but one that should never have been made. We immediately reported the error to our auditors, set about correcting our financials and put additional controls in place to make sure that this never happens again. Nothing is more important to us than our credibility. We will do better.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some highlights from our program.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results. During the first quarter, Cimarex invested $306 million on exploration and development activities. About 69% of our first quarter capital was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. We invested $197 million of the $306 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Company-wide, we brought 70 gross, 26 net wells on production during the first quarter 2017.", "As Tom mentioned, our 2017 exploration and development budget is unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, with $850 million to $900 million still earmarked for drilling and completing wells. For the full year, we plan to invest 62% of our capital in the Permian region, with the remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent.", "We entered 2017 with 11 operated rigs with 6 located in Mid-Continent and 5 in the Permian. During the month of April, we brought on three additional rigs in the Permian, which increased our total operated rig count to 14.", "Now, on to well results. I want to start with the Permian region where we have some exciting results to share with you regarding a delineation test in the Upper Wolfcamp interval located on our White City, New Mexico acreage position. The Pintail 23-36H (sic) [Pintail 23-26H] well, whose location can be seen on slide 12 in our investor presentation, achieved a 30-day peak IP of 1,557 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 64% was oil. This well result, along with some recent competitor well results in the area, is helping us gain confidence that we have a highly economic target in the Upper Wolfcamp interval, along with the de-risked Lower Wolfcamp zone on our entire Eddy County, White City, New Mexico acreage position.", "Staying in the Culberson County area, the Lower Wolfcamp, Tim Tam pilot, has been on production long enough in order for us to share with you their results. As shown on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 16 of the presentation, these infill wells are performing as well as nearby parent wells with similar landing zones. The five 10,000-foot infill laterals achieved an average 30-day peak rate of 13.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with oil percentages varying from 26% to 36% depending upon landing zone.", "This result confirms that we can very economically develop the Lower Wolfcamp interval at a minimum of six wells per section. In fact, due to the exceptional performance of these wells, we are formulating plans to test even tighter spacing in the Lower Wolfcamp later this year.", "In Reeves County, we have encouraging results to share with you regarding our Wood State, Upper Wolfcamp infill project which is testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section. Excluding the Wood State 47-26 2H (09:05) which is shut in awaiting remediation work, these five infill wells achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 1,973 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 46% was oil.", "More importantly, as shown on slide 19 of our presentation, three of the five wells after 175 days of production have averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent of cumulative production, which is slightly less than the best parent well drilled to date by Cimarex in the area. As a follow-up to this project, we are currently flowing back the Pagoda State wells. This four-well pilot will be testing the equivalent of 16 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp.", "And then in Northern Lea County, as shown on slide 11, we have adjusted our Wolfcamp fairway polygon to include additional prospective acreage based on our updated subsurface maps in this area along with incorporating recent competitor well results. This adjustment had resulted in our prospective Lea County Wolfcamp acreage increasing from 5,600 to 32,000 net acres. We are now working on plans to drill our first Wolfcamp lateral in this North Lea County area later this year.", "Now, on to Mid-Continent. The Leon Gundy project is our stacked/staggered Meramec-Woodford spacing pilot testing 10 wells per section in two benches within the Meramec, along with the proven spacing of nine wells per section in the Woodford. These wells were brought on production in October and we now have enough data in order to discuss the results. The four 5,000 foot lateral Gundy Meramec wells achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 8.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 60% was gas, 20% NGL and 20% oil. As shown on slide 23 of our presentation, the cumulative production of the four Gundy Meramec wells after 200 days is greater than the average cumulative production for nearby Meramec parent wells. This is a very nice outcome.", "Finally, completion operations have begun on our Woodford eight-well increased density pilot that is testing both 16 and 20 Woodford wells per section, as diagramed on slide 25. First production from this infill pilot is expected in early September.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, John, and thank you all again for joining our call today. I'll recap on the usual items, our first quarter production, our updated 2017 production outlook, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service costs.", "While we're off to a great start in 2017, our Q1 2017 net equivalent production came in at 1.063 Bcf a day, beating the upper end of our guidance by 13 million a day and setting a new record for total company production. With quarter-to-quarter production gains in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, our Q1 total company net equivalent volume was up 11% from our Q4 2016 posting of 960 million a day and 9% from our Q1 2016 volume of 973 million a day.", "With our focus on Permian oil and high-liquid Mid-Continent projects, we saw a solid sequential quarter increase in oil production, reporting a total company Q1 oil volume of 52,181 barrels of oil per day, up 15% from Q4 2016 and 13% from Q1 2016. Our oil volumes were up in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with our Q1 Permian oil production up 13% and our Q1 Mid-Continent oil production up 20% from Q4 2016. With a strong contribution from our Reeves County Wood State project that John mentioned, our Q1 2017 Permian net equivalent volume came in at 577 million a day, that's up 13% from Q4 2016 and 21% from Q1 2016. We brought on a total of 25 gross, 16 net Permian wells during the quarter and we had 14 gross and 11 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.", "We also saw a nice gain in our Q1 Mid-Continent volumes with continued operated and non-operated production adds from our East Cana infill project. Our Q1 Mid-Continent net equivalent production came in at 484 million a day. That's up 9% from Q4 2016. In aggregate, we brought on 45 gross and 10 net wells in the Mid-Continent during the quarter and we have 68 gross and 15 net wells still waiting on completion at quarter's end.", "Looking forward into 2017, we've updated our model to incorporate our actual Q1 results and the projected drilling and completion schedules for the three Permian rigs we added in mid to late April. With our Q1 production beat and our revised projections, we've increased our full year guidance to 1.09 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day. That's up from the 1.06 Bcf to 1.11 Bcf a day we reported last call and it reflects a 13% to 17% increase over the 963 million a day that we reported in 2016.", "The 2017 capital remains focused on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects. As a result, we continue to project significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent during the year, which results in total company forecasted year-over-year production growth in the range of 24% to 28%. Our projected capital and completion activity remains skewed, approximately 60% to the Permian and 40% to the Mid-Continent. We anticipate bringing on 60 net Permian wells and 39 net Mid-Continent wells during 2017, and that's up from the 30 and 31 respective net wells that we completed in the two areas during 2016.", "With our strong tailwind from Q1, we're modeling Q2 production to be in the range of 1.08 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day. That's up 2% to 6% over Q1, and it's an 11% to 16% increase over Q2 2016. We're forecasting a number of our Permian and Mid-Continent spacing projects to come on online later in the year, and that will accelerate our capital and completion activity forecast into the Q3 to Q4 timeframe. As such, we're modeling Q3 to be relatively flat to Q2 followed by a nice production ramp in Q4.", "Our production calls for Q4 2017 exit rate in the neighborhood of 1.13 Bcfe to 1.19 Bcfe a day, and that's a strong 18% to 24% increase over Q4 2016. On top of that, we'll have approximately 44 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion as we forecasted at the end of the year. So with that, we anticipate having great momentum going into 2018.", "Jumping over to OpEx, our first quarter lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe. That's right at the midpoint of our guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 and just below our 2016 average of $0.66 per Mcfe. Our Q1 posting was approximately $0.07 above the $0.58 mark that we reported in Q4, and that's primarily a result of increased workover activity in Q1 as compared to not only Q4 2016, but several recent past quarters.", "We are starting to feel some LOE cost pressures in items such as compression and water hauling. That said, our production team remains vigilant to maintain the reduced operating cost structure that they've worked so hard to achieve.", "Taking into account the fluctuating nature of our workover expenses and our 2017 focused on high-liquid projects, we're maintaining our 2017 lifting cost guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 for the year. That's well below the $0.83 per Mcfe we posted in 2015 and the $1.08 we reported in 2014.", "And finally some comments on drilling and completion costs. On the drilling side, although a number of cost components have remained in check, we've seen 5% to 10% increases in items such as day rates and directional services. And with less availability on the ground, we've seen 15% to 25% increases in the cost of our tubulars. With our dry hole cost or drilling cost representing only about 30% to 35% of our AFEs, at the total well cost level, the largest cost pressure we're seeing is on the completion side.", "In addition to seeing increased cost \u2013 service cost to pump our fracs, we're also experiencing a tighter market for prop, which also appears to have limited supply on the ground. We've been able to offset a good portion of the service cost increases by optimizing our job design, utilizing fewer stages and pumping zipper fracs where we can, and we've focused on long lead time planning to ensure adequate prop sourcing for our program.", "As compared to Q4 2016, we've seen our current total company per well average frac cost increase approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, which again is dependent on so many variables such as lateral length, number of stages, pounds pumped and so on. Although we focused our drilling and completion efficiencies to limit the impact of these frac cost increases, we've experienced some modest increases in our total well costs.", "In the Permian, we've raised our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFE with larger fracs, approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, with a range of $5 million to $6 million. In the Wolfcamp, we've increased our AFEs for larger completion, 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp wells in Culberson by $300,000 to $10.5 million to $11.7 million per well. That's still down from the late 2015 cost levels we had and with a much larger completion today. In Cana, our current Woodford 1-mile lateral AFEs are running in a range of $7.5 million to $8 million, that's up $400,000 to $500,000, again, all driven by higher frac cost.", "And as we continue to experiment with frac design, we bumped the midpoint of the cost range for current 2-mile Meramec AFEs by about $250,000 with a range of $10.5 million to $12.5 million per well with frac design again being the largest cost variable.", "So in closing, we're off to a great start here in 2017. Our diversified oil-focused development program generated a great production beat in Q1. With that as our springboard, we're forecasting continued production growth coming here into Q2 with forecasted year-over-year total company production growth of 13% to 17% and just as important a strong exit rate to enter 2018.", "We stay focused on finding cost pressures in order to keep our cost structure healthy and strong and our overall program continues to generate positive results, all that despite the modest cost increases we've seen in our total well costs. All in, we remain very excited about 2017.", "So with that, I'll open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Good morning, Jeanine.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Good morning.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just back to the oil production for the quarter. You provided guidance during the last earnings call of 30% to 35% growth 4Q to 4Q and just given the strong oil production during 1Q, is there upside to that prior commentary or is the strong 1Q oil number mainly a function of timings? And we also noticed as you mentioned that you did more wells in 1Q than expected, but that Q2, number of completions went down.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is Joe. The way I would answer that question, we \u2013 in total, as you look at the year, the net well completions quarter-to-quarter, we had a good number of completions in Q1. We'll see that slow down a little bit in Q2 and ramp back up into Q3 and then taper off just a smidge in Q4 as wells come online, and with that parallels our projected oil production and our oil growth. We're still projecting that our oil growth will continue to extend itself into the fourth quarter and surpass slightly the ranges that we quoted last call.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then my related or unrelated follow-up, in terms of the rig count for the year. You guys have 14 right now and we noticed in the updated presentation that the commentary of 18 rigs by 4Q dropped off to 5? So, just wondering if the 18 rigs are still the plan for this year or was that just \u2013 we're reading too much into that?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. It's still quite frankly little bit of flux as to when those additional rigs will come on. It's a matter of timing between us and our partner in the Mid-Continent region with our next major development project. We're still working with them, trying to decide the overall scope and size of the project. And based on what we finally settle on would dictate whether the rigs show up late this year or early next year. So we're still working on that right now.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Jeanine, I'll just add to that, those additional four rigs, as John mentioned, are for our development project on the Western side of our stacked asset. Those wells, whether we added them \u2013 those rigs whether we add them this year or next year, we're going to be flowing in the \u2013 John, correct me, it's East side. Yeah. East side.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "East side, the more liquid-rich of the Woodford.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "But the rigs were going to be deployed for drilling and the completion would flow into 2018. So it's really not a big impact on \u2013 it's zero impact on this year other than whatever drilling capital it would've had. But as John mentioned, we're still working through the timing there.", "Operator", "Thank you. And...", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "And this is Joe. I'll add that we have, as forecasted, approximately 44 wells that we'd still be drilling and waiting on completion with the \u2013 just the Permian rig counts that we've got in our current plan at the end of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. Couple questions. Lea County, it seems like there's been a lot of activity there lately or a lot, I guess, results coming out between yourselves, EOG had some nice wells. I know Devon's doing some down-spacing in there. Can you just talk about, is this something different or I know you've been up there and you're testing tighter spacing, but can you just talk a little, I guess, more general about the area and what you're seeing?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. David, let me start, and then John will follow up. We've always loved Lea County. One of the reasons that we haven't aggressively developed our acreage at the multiple levels is because it's really quite good and we wanted to make sure that we got our spacing and our science right because you can always back up and get a do over. There have been some offset well results. We've extended our mapping, and the play has just extended. And we're quite bullish on the outset, not only for the Wolfcamp, but a number of different zones.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. I would just say that you'll see more of our activity moving into Lea County later this year. We have quite a bit of drilling we want to do up there. It's not \u2013 like Tom said, we've always loved Lea County. It's just over the last few years, with the pull back in our capital, most of our drilling has been to hold acreage that we needed to hold down in Culberson and Reeves. We are very fortunate that almost all of our position in Lea is a well-held HBP acreage, be it a previous drilling we've done mostly in the Bone Spring and other targets. So we're just now starting to focus more energy to get in there and then taking advantage, as Tom said, of the fact that a lot of our competitors are \"delineating\" our acreage for us. So it looks very, very attractive and thus resulting in the updating we gave on the increase in the acreage there.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, and just to clarify. So, compared to three to six months \u2013 or whatever, six to nine months ago, this is \u2013 or compared to the original 2017 guidance is maybe the better way of looking at our development schedule, this has moved up and you're probably moving that in and moving something else out. Is that fair?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "To be honest, no, we already had plans to be in Lea County. I think right now, incrementally may be a well or two, but certainly, it will have a bigger impact as we look into 2018. And, again, we have the luxury of having that HBP position. So, we want to make sure \u2013 if we go up there because that acreage is very precious to us, we want to make sure we develop it right. So we have a very good plan. We have a couple spacing pilots that's always been planned for later this year, one in the Wolfcamp, one in the Avalon. And from that, we'll formulate more plans to get probably a little bit more activity when we get into 2018.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, and thanks for the completion schedule in the slide deck, but what's your appetite, I guess, to \u2013 I guess this is to Tom, what's your appetite to increase CapEx? Obviously, you have the balance sheet for it. You have the dollar sitting there if you need it. How are you thinking about acceleration \u2013 or potential for acceleration beyond the current plan?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we \u2013 our plan is our plan, so you're asking me to speculate, and that's something I'll do that. We really are quite positive on our assets. John and I spent all day yesterday with the Culberson County team looking at that asset, and it's just tremendous. Not only are we seeing fantastic well-level results, we're seeing real good improvements in our science around infill drilling and spacing.", "And then, when you look at that asset where we have a huge arena of 10,000-foot long horizontal wells that we can drill without regard to the lease line, it's pretty easy to get pretty excited about it. And that's just one part of our program. And so as we look ahead, we do have the wherewithal to accelerate. We have the balance sheet to accelerate. We have the projects to accelerate. And although we don't publish inventory numbers, you can read between the lines, the way we look at it internally, our inventory has increased significant because of the work that our organization has done. So, yeah, we'd like to bring that net asset value forward and we have the wherewithal to accelerate.", "Now that said, there are some macro events that are going to overprint that. We want to make sure that we're drilling into an acceptable cost and commodity structure and we're going to manage that balance sheet pretty carefully. But I think definitely as you look at us, there is a chance that we have some bias to the upside here.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. No. I appreciate the color. I appreciate the speculation. Thank you.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Dave.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Irene Haas of Wunderlich.", "Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Yes. To carry on David's question. Zooming back to Lea County, you mentioned that you pretty much remapped your play outline, that you're going to be drilling your first well in Lea County. Can I ask when and what target horizon?", "Then my second question is your recompletion. You're using bigger fracs and got quite a stunning uplift. I was wondering where the location of that well \u2013 is it 23 South, 33 East? And also, a little more color as to what you exactly did there. I'm very curious.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Okay. Well, I will answer certainly your first question in regards to Northern Lea County. Yes. We have undertaken better mapping of the Wolfcamp up in that northern part of our acreage. We're starting to appreciate, it doesn't take as much net thickness within the Wolfcamp to still have a very good outcome and that is leading to us getting much more bullish on our acreage up there. And, of course, that, coupled with some competitor results nearby, never hurts either.", "We've actually already drilled a Wolfcamp well in Lea County. I guess we need to make sure we get our map updated, and that well has been known for quite a while now, and it's a very good well. And we have plans now to go up to that Northern Lea County area that we've expended our polygon on, and there, we'll be testing again the Wolfcamp up there. Based on competitor results, we have high expectations for that well. And with that in hand, hopefully later this year, we'll get even more bullish in terms of future drilling we want to do there next year. Regarding the recompletion though...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. We're not sure which well you're talking about, Irene, Were you referring to the Pintail well that John mentioned in Eddy County?", "Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "No. Triste Draw 25 7H. I think you guys went in and saw quite a bit of uplift. That is also in Lea County.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we did. But the latest Triste Draw I'm aware of is an Avalon new drill well.", "Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Oh, the new drill. Okay.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Which is a very good well, but we don't have enough production to speak to that well just yet, if that's the one you're referring to.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. Irene, as you know, we like to have at least 30 days of established production, on some of these longer laterals we like to have even more than that. So, we'll typically want to make sure that we have something definitive about a well before we talk about its results.", "Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Fine. Then with the Northern Wolfcamp well, is it in the Wolfcamp D or B or A?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "It would be what we would just call the Upper Wolfcamp. Others would call A. That would be the primary target for that acreage up there. And that's what we'd be going after.", "Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hm'hmm.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Good morning, everybody. I'm wondering, the land and seismic CapEx for the first quarter is a little bit higher than we were anticipating. Just wondering, did you actually add any acreage or was that just a lease retention cost or anything else you can talk about there?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Sure. This is John. That was acreage additioning (33:28), we leased \u2013 we had an opportunity on a new concept and we liked the concept. So, we went out and aggressively acquired acreage on it. So, that was, yes, that was a little bit above and beyond what we planned for the quarter. It's kind of more of a one-off event. We don't expect to spend that same amount on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we saw a very good opportunity for an idea that our team had put together. And so we went out and captured it. Again, I'll emphasize we don't expect that same type of expenditure for the remaining quarters this year, unless, of course, they come up with a really good idea.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "And then, we'll go do it again. But that is what was going on in that first quarter.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Just by way of overall program, we want to always be making land investments. But what we do is we look very carefully full cycle at the return on our investment, fully burdened with land, corporate overhead, all associated costs, and then we look at our total program and make sure that land is not too high a part of the overall expenditure. And we've always managed the company that way. We look at it on an ongoing basis.", "You have to make the land investments. Otherwise, you're essentially liquidating the company. You may be liquidating on a 50-year time horizon, but we always want to be bringing in new things to replace what we drill. And so from time to time, you're going to see that land investment swing up and down. It's a part of our ongoing business.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Can you say where that new opportunity is, or is it going to remain kind of in the stealth mode for a while?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Stealth mode.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. At this point \u2013 I'm going to ask one more on the prices. It looks like you had pretty good realizations for your products in the Permian for the first quarter. There have been some concern about where those prices may head. I just wanted your thoughts on that potential for adding firm transportation or further hedging?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is Joe. On the gas side, yeah, I think, overall, that differential increase is kind of stemming around concerns about Mexico infrastructure and demand and maybe secondly the pipe outlets to the Gulf Coast. And we're having no problem selling our gas right now. We are seeing the hit of the differential. Long term looking out, we're looking at the various options for pipe out of Waha to the Gulf Coast because we think it will be something that we're going to need to secure ourselves with.", "We do have Perm on El Paso coming off the tailgate of our Hidalgo plant and we're looking at possible other open seasons as well. So, we're taking a proactive stance to try to secure the Perm that we think makes sense relative to our volumes and then think long term on how to better get our gas out of the basin.", "With regard to the oil side, we believe that there's capacity that does exist right now. Current supply or surplus capacity on takeaway out of the basin we think is sufficient for the short term. Long term, we're going to look \u2013 again, like I mentioned on the gas side, at possible solutions as well. As far as Delaware, gravities being a little bit higher than Midland. We do see a variation in our gravities from Reeves over to Culberson and our contracts to sell both those will allow for us to blend and we're well below the minimums on those contracts. So, we've had no problems right now getting oil or gas out of the basin. So hopefully that answers your questions.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hey, Mike, I'll just add on that. On the first quarter, we did see a positive Midland \u2013 Cushing differential, which definitely benefited our realization in the first quarter. It's something in the neighborhood of $0.60 positive. Looking forward in the second quarter on the futures market, that's probably going to go up to maybe $0.80 to $1, currently at $0.70 at today's spot price. And looking out in the third or fourth quarter, this may be up to just over $1. And out into 2018 on a fourth trip (37:47) it's in the $1.20-ish range going out into the future. So yeah, we'll definitely have to keep monitoring that Mid-Cush differential and even consider our hedging practice around that. Currently, we only hedge it to WTI NYMEX, but we'll keep monitoring that differential.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Very good. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey. Good morning. This is actually Ray (38:13) on for Neal. Just looking at that successful Pintail well test, any further plans that you guys have in Eddy County and any color on how far north you guys \u2013 into Eddy County you guys are planning to go?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. This is John. Yes, we plan to drill quite a few more wells up in the White City area, both in the Upper Wolfcamp and the Lower Wolfcamp. And yes, we will be testing upwards to the Northern part of that contiguous acreage block. I think if we looked at slide 12, you can see where the Pintail is located, but you'll see we have more acreage located further to the north and we do have plans, as I said, to test both upper and lower, and that part of it.", "I'll also just add, again, there's quite a few competitor wells that come on in and around that acreage block. And that has given us quite a bit of encouragement that a lot of that acreage is going to be very prospective for both towns. And so, hopefully, in the coming quarters, you'll hear us talk more about some results up there.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Within that acreage block, that ends up on our Culberson County map is up in Eddy County. It's higher working interest. We don't have a partnership around that acreage. And depending on where you draw the outline, this 35,000 net acres to 40,000 net acres, we've been up there for quite a while. In fact, our first Wolfcamp well in our program \u2013 first horizontal well was drilled up there in 2010 in the Lower Wolfcamp. We've done a fair amount of development up there in Bone Spring and are still doing so, and this well that John's spoken of, the Pintail well was our first Upper Wolfcamp test up there. It's highly encouraging and it opens up most, if not, all of that acreage to Upper Wolfcamp in addition to Lower Wolfcamp and that's also a fairly contiguous block that supports long laterals. So it's a real significant data point to us in terms of our future program.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And as you guys continue to test and delineate your Mid-Con, just want to get an \u2013 if there's an update on thoughts around timing for full-on development there.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, when you say full-on development, I'm assuming you're referring to incorporating the Meramec into our development plans because of course we have been developing the Woodford now here over the last several years, what I would call full development. What I would just say is that the spacing pilot result that I commented on, the Leon Gundy's is extremely encouraging to us in regards that the Gundy's or the Meramec wells responded very nicely to our design, such that it really points the way to quite a bit of our acreage could be receptive to that 19 wells per section development and that is something that we're looking at very intensely. We have some additional testing we're going to do of that concept in terms of stacking two layers into Meramec and one into Woodford. Well, we have a few small projects that we're doing later in the year to test that. But we're also developing plans to get to that type of 19-well-per-section development sometime next year in 2018 on some of our acreage. So we are getting there.", "And then to continue on that, of course, us and Devon still are formulating plans for long lateral development there in that Eastern part. Right now, it's still focused on Woodford, but we still have some plans to go forward with that long-lateral development plan probably, like I said, late this year, early next year.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up question to Lea County. Just wanted to ask you about the Bone Spring opportunity. I know it is an area where you've historically focused on legacy development. And I was curious how target lateral landing might change your views on delineating and further testing in the Bone Spring. We've seen some really strong industry results around Central Lea, and if that's in your plans this year.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I'll take a stab at that and I'm sure Tom will want to follow up. For most of our Northern Lea County, we have already done a lot of legacy drilling in the Bone Spring. That's quite frankly where the whole play started. But we also recognize that that was technology from seven, eight years ago that when we look at our footprint there and look at those existing wells we have, we see wells that clearly did not have the most optimal stimulation.", "We see potential white space, I'll call it, along the lateral of potential undrained reserves. And we obviously do not even feel like we see it like you mentioned that we may be tested all in our landing zones appropriately with those wells. So we have looked at going in and doing some additional infield drilling up on that acreage with modern stimulation and that's something we're still formulating and I'm sure we'll be doing some of that in the coming \u2013 rest of this year.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. The only thing I would add is \u2013 keying on what John said, that Bone Spring section really is multiple benches, multiple targets, many of which have not been tested. Our historical development is focused on sand benches in the second and third Bone Spring and it's a fairly target-rich section. So, we anticipate that being a part of our program for a long time. It's just we have lots to do and when you're going to get to it is the question.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great. And just as a follow up to the exploration side of the story here. Just curious on your thoughts going into the back half of the year on incremental test in Ward and if there's any update to your drilling program around the Wolfcamp there?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. We have now drilled one 10,000-foot lateral in Ward. We're still monitoring that well closely and we have plans in the coming months to drill a second 10,000-foot lateral in Ward. Once we get those to kind of under our belt, we'll then be giving you an update on what we have found in terms of the new drilling with the new stimulations and what our expectations will be going forward for that acreage position.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Allman with FBR.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hi, Joe.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, Tom. In your presentations, when we see the cumulative production curves that are straight lines with little or no bend, why is that happening and what do you take away from that and what message do you have for us in terms of modeling and estimating EURs and type curves and so on?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, that's a great observation and that's one of the things that is very exciting about our long lateral program. Not only are we seeing really nice top-line production rates out of these wells, but a much lower decline. Now, we have a lot of debate internally as to what the explanation of that is and then we'll probably have some debate here on the call amongst ourselves.", "I think certainly, you could address that situation with plumbing, probably larger casing design would advance those production rates. But there's costs and operational issues associated with that. There's also the question of surface facility. So, it's a fairly complex matrix of cost than benefit. Yes, there's one school of thought that would say those slight declines are a negative because that means that a lot of hydrocarbons are waiting in line to get out of the wellbore, but there's no school of thought that says, you know what, those are great outcomes because it allows you to make more efficient use of your surface facilities. You keep them full for longer. And one thing I can tell you is the top-line returns out of those products are outstanding. And I'll give Joe or John the opportunity to comment on that.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. This is Joe. The only comment I'd make on that front is that in particular in Reeves County where we have higher liquids, we see it more prudent to run in the hole with tubing gas lift and any capillary treating mines at the time that we turn the well on. And this saves us from shutting in the well and doing it and as we get further down the road and that \u2013 down the road not being that far away before we feel like we'll see some detrimental flow due to lifting issues. But when you have the tubing in there, you're somewhat limited by which you can flow. And so that has a lot to do with what we're seeing in Reese County.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. And there's also \u2013 you never want to forget the water. It's one thing to look at the oil, but these wells make a lot of water as well. And so the surface facilities, disposal, all of that goes into your equation as to how you're going to design and flow these wells back.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "That's helpful. And just any additional comments you have on that just in terms of what it means for EURs and type curves and any message you have for us on that. And then I've got a follow-up question. Is there anywhere besides the Cana-Woodford where you've already decided on the optimal spacing and optimal completion and drilling technique and completion design such that you're ready to pretty much go full bore, full scale development?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we haven't decided that in the Cana-Woodford. I mean, we've got some really good test results that as we've talked about in the past, 12 wells per section. We're currently completing or about to complete a project at 16 to 20 wells per section. So, this is a constant evolution here. As our understanding of the downhole system improves, that has direct implications to spacing. So, I hope it doesn't stop. We're going to have to just continue to learn as we go and have continuous improvement.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. I think the good news out of all that is \u2013 and I would echo what Tom said, is in some ways, we don't really know optimal for every single target we have. But because we have so many of them, it's not as though we're not able to deploy capital because we have a lot of different opportunities in the Meramec, the Woodford, both benches on the Wolfcamp as well as the Avalon to continue to test those spacing issues and still get good well results until we get capital in the ground, that we kind of have that luxury.", "When will we get to that point? I don't know. Again, like Tom said, we just reviewed Culberson County yesterday. We were looking at the Tim Tam wells, very exciting wells for us. And immediately, we're all drawing what the next wine rack would look like for the Lower Wolfcamp and what would we do and how many wells could it be. And in the end, that is a wonderful thing in terms of the ultimate inventory and more importantly the ultimate PV value to this company with that acreage block. So, in some ways, I don't know. I don't know that we want to be in too much of a hurry. We want to make sure we get it right. But as I said, we're fortunate that we have enough of a portfolio that, trust me, we got enough places to go with the rigs to get this testing done, yet still get some very top-line results.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "That's all I have. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I wanted to ask you about slide 20, the Triste Draw Avalon well that showed that huge increase on (50:35) test completions. I was wondering, is this being compared to older completions of the same lateral length?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. This is John. That would be comparable to, say, a year or two generation frac design behind with the same lateral length. That is correct.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "So, I'm not criticizing the Culberson results because they're great, too, but when we look at slide 13 and the Culberson uplifts, a similar cumulative uplift, there's a lateral length portion of it, and then there's the effect of the completions portion of it. It seems like here, the effect of the completions by itself is much more dramatic. I just wondered if you had any thoughts on that.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I mean, number one, I would say within the Avalon, we're very excited about the \u2013 simply by redesigning our completions, we got that kind of uplift for a well that's landed (51:31) the same, same lateral length as you pointed out. And so we in fact have gone back out and drilled another well in that area, that is currently still flowing back, where we've even pushed the envelope on the completion design and hopefully here in the next quarter or so, we'll talk about it.", "In terms of what you see there on slide 13, yes, there's a component of lateral length which is important. But now, you're seeing us refining our completions. It's also fair to say that unlike in the Avalon and Culberson, we're in about generation number six in the frac design stage. So, we're not going to \u2013 I think you could say with each new revision, you're not going to see as much of an uplift as what you might have seen with that first change in Avalon. But still, we're making very good progress there in Culberson with our frac design in terms of improving the ultimate EUR for those wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "But I would say your observation is fair. I mean, we're \u2013 in our portfolio, we have a lot of different stratigraphies, lot of different lithologies, and they don't all respond similarly to frac optimization. You also have gas versus oil in the reservoirs, in some places, we're in a retrograde condensate, in other places, we're black oil in the reservoir. I would say, we share your observation that the Avalon play is probably the play where frac optimization has had this biggest just percent increase.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes, on the first generation change, absolutely, unequivocally, it has.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, this is a high-class problem, that's for sure. But I just wanted to discuss that because it really kind of stood out. For my second question, I just wondered, could you add a little color on the Wood State well that is requiring remediation, just what went on there?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. This is Joe Albi. Late last quarter when we were cleaning out that well, we stuck bottom-hole assembly and coil tubing and made the decision after retrieving the majority of it that we would rather shut the well in, produce the offset well, slower any possible pressure in and around that well a bit and then come back in later to retrieve the fish. And so we currently have ongoing operations right now to retrieve that fish and are getting close to home.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. They're making good progress. That's just one of the maddening things, particularly when you go to pad drilling. And we talked about this on our last quarter call, where you have six or eight wells that are all close proximity. If you have an operational issue on one, it could delay the production on the entire set. But we're getting after it and I really want to credit our operations group for coming up with a creative, inventive solution that lets us get back on that well, produce the offsets and do so with a strong, strong emphasis on safety.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "And just to finish the thought, I mean, based on what you know now, do you expect that that well is going to be able to perform to its potential once you get the fishing done?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. I think our expectation is, and based on our experience in the past, is that yes, ultimately when we get that well back on, we will achieve the same EUR expectation. It's just it will not have the same kind of IP rate only because there's still \u2013 it's been sitting there with a lot of water both \u2013 the stimulation water both from its own well and other wells. So, it will take a while for that well to clean up. But in the end, no, we still have high expectations we'll get about the same EUR for it.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. This has nothing to do with the rocks, just the plumbing.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "We had floated for a while, it's basically downhole restricted flow.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Right.", "Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my questions guys and nice jobs on the ops update in the quarter. Just was curious if you can give some color, you discussed sort of deferring some of the cost increases...", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "It was cut out.", "Operator", "I'm sorry, his line (55:46). One moment please. Okay, we have lost Mr. Deckelbaum and actually that does conclude the question-and-answer session. So I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, the only thing I would say is thank you very much for your interest and we appreciate your support. We're working hard to continue to post these kind of results and look forward to continual operational updates. As you know, it's always nice to talk about results. That's what we're all about. And we look forward to bringing you additional results as the year goes on. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

(Broker)", "Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Cimarex Energy Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us this morning.", "Last night an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we will discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "Today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, VP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Cimarex CFO Mark Burford is also present to help answer any questions you might have.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Karen.", "And thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex.", "We have some exciting new results to report to you for investments made earlier this year, including the completion of our first two-mile lateral in the Meramec. This well, the Clayton, had a peak 30-day IP over 16 million cubic feet equivalent, which is a 72% uplift versus the average one-mile lateral in Meramec we've drilled to date. Cimarex also completed its second two-mile lateral in the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. That well, the Cavalcade, looks to be one of the best wells drilled in the Culberson Wolfcamp A to date. In addition, our production group has done an excellent job on both existing production and bringing on new wells, wells which continue outperforming our expectation. These two factors combined led to another production beat.", "To begin with, however, I want to start with some conclusions. I'd like to begin the call by outlining a few key takeaways that we hope you glean from this morning's call. First, our production beat is a result of significant and meaningful improvements in our well performance, and increased focus on our base production, and an emphasis on operational excellence. Joe and John will give additional details on these operational improvements.", "Second, we hear lots of talk lately that the industry focus is no longer on growth for growth's sake. This is heartening since we've been saying this for 20 years. Cimarex has also maintained an unrelenting focus on return on invested capital. To that end, we do not have an overarching strategic preference on commodity type. We drill the wells that offer the best full cycle returns. We model our investments using realized prices with room for draconian downside. Our production mix will shift between gas and oil depending upon our well mix and the returns we find within our portfolio.", "Third, Cimarex has a bias for pressured reservoirs, and pressured tight reservoirs tend to produce a commodity mix that is both oily and gassy. These reservoirs have tremendous deliverability and also contain the energy which gives longer horizontal wells a turbo charged uplift. John will discuss the results of our first long lateral in the emerging Meramec play. Don't miss the significance of this well to our acreage position and the future potential of this play to Cimarex.", "Fourth, Cimarex is entering a period of significantly improved capital efficiency. You will hear lots of discussion today about upcoming development projects and pilots that involve 10,000 foot and 7,500 foot horizontal wells. These longer horizontal wells are providing great improvements to our capital efficiency, and our program is rapidly evolving to be dominated by them. Our acreage positions in both the Anadarko and Delaware Basins support a growing long lateral program. John will discuss our upcoming long horizontal well development projects in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp A, Delaware Basin Wolfcamp D, and the Anadarko Basin Woodford Meramec.", "And fifth and finally, as we look into 2016, we see Cimarex positioned where we have told you we need to be. We've told you we need to find a sustainable path in this downturn, one where we can make a living, add value and not wait for the rescue ship. We will enter 2016 with 12 operated rigs. Owing to tremendous improvements in drilling efficiencies, completion optimization and cost reductions, we may be able to accomplish with 12 rigs what we had previously modeled with 16.", "As we look ahead, we model a program for 2016, 2017 and beyond, which is within cash flow and cash on hand and allows us to survive and prosper in this difficult environment. This has always been our goal and it is a tremendous complement to our organization and to our assets that we have found firm footing.", "With that I'd like to turn the call over to John for further details.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thanks, Tom.", "I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on upcoming activities. Cimarex invested $184 million during the third quarter drilling and completing wells. About 60% was invested in the Permian region with the rest of that money going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Companywide we brought 56 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter.", "Our Permian operations are in Delaware Basin, where we brought on 4 of the 14 net wells during the third quarter. All were Wolfcamp wells. Our long lateral program in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County continues to provide solid results. We now have 30-day peak IP rates averaging 2,308 barrels of oil per day from 13 Wolfcamp D long lateral wells. As always, we continue to work on optimizing our frac designs. We have had great success in lowering drilling days along laterals meaning individual rigs can accomplish more than previously thought. Joe will talk more about those details shortly.", "On our last call we talked about our plans to spud our first Wolfcamp A down spacing pilot in Culberson County. Locations are being built and drilling is expected to be underway this quarter. This six well pilot will be drilled using 7,500 foot laterals and will test two different spacing designs. Half of the wells will test eight wells per section spacing while the other half will test six wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.", "Regarding our plans to begin development drilling in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson, we have adjusted our plans from what we discussed on the last call in that we will now drill five new 10,000 foot laterals stack staggered in the Wolfcamp D on the two adjoining sections immediately east of our two spacing pilot sections. This change will insure the accuracy of the production data since unlike the original planned sections, there'll be no parent wells embedded within these development wells. Plus the added benefit that we expect to achieve very good A-tax rate of return for these 10,000 foot wells, even in this challenging commodity environment. Drilling will commence in the first quarter of 2016 with production scheduled to begin mid-year.", "Now on to the Mid-continent, you will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford row 4 infill development program late last year. Completion on these 57 gross wells covering seven sections are nearly finished and production has begun. We will be moving drilling operations to another Woodford row infill on the east side of the core. This development covers six sections. Cimarex will operate the westernmost two sections, drilling 14 gross wells. The entire row project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Production from this east Cana development row is expected to come online in July of 2016.", "And in our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 11 5,000-foot laterals. These wells have an average 30-day peak IP rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with oil yields that vary from 15 barrels per million cubic feet to 330 barrels per million cubic feet. Our first 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production for about two-and-a-half months. The Clayton 1HX has an average 30-day peak IP of 16 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is a 72% uplift from the average of 11 5,000 foot laterals we've drilled.", "We have another Meramec long-lateral producing now, with a third currently drilling. We are very encouraged from the early time production we are seeing from this second long lateral. So much so, that going forward we plan to drill long lateral wells on all of our delineated Meramec acreage wherever possible.", "As we think about the future developments at Meramec, Cimarex is focused on an area we call 14-10 (10:07). This area is made up of 30 contiguous sections that have the potential to be developed in both the Woodford and Meramec using 10,000-foot laterals. It's a big area. To better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have designed a down spacing pilot which we have commenced drilling on. See slide 21 for an illustration of the design.", "This pilot will consist of 11 wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The pilot will be executed using 5,000-foot laterals on a little over half of one section. The spacing in the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section, of which there will be five wells in the upper and five in the lower, staggered within the Meramec.", "The Woodford will be drilled with our standard nine wells per section development plan. In addition to this pilot, we have started filling back a two-well stack staggered pilot in the Meramec and our partner has commenced drilling on a Meramec spacing pilot testing five wells per section and one landing zone. The data from these pilots will be critical in helping us design the appropriate development plan for this vast Meramec and Woodford resource.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Well thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll be touching on the usual items. Our third quarter production, our Q4 and full year production outlook and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and where we're seeing service costs.", "We had another great quarter in Q3. Our total company net equivalent volume came in at 978.9 million a day. That's up 4% from the 942 million a day we produced in Q3 2014 and it beat our guidance of 920 million to 940 million a day by a fair margin. As Tom mentioned, and as was the case last quarter, our guidance beat once again comes as a result of stronger than expected new well performance and our production group's focus on minimizing downtime and optimizing production, with us seeing particularly exceptional results coming from the Permian.", "As we have mentioned in our last few calls, our 2015 production growth was forecasted to come from the Permian in the early part of the year and then from the mid-continent in the latter part of the year and we're seeing just that. Our Q3 2015 Permian equivalent production came in at 562 million a day, up 38% from Q3 2014, while our Mid-Continent production came in at 405 million a day, down as anticipated from the 518 million a day we produced in Q3 2014. Our Cana Row 4 completion activity, as John mentioned, began in late Q3 and is forecasted to arrest the drop, providing us with a very strong boost in production as we finish off the year.", "As expected, our Permian completion activity slowed during Q3, with only four net wells coming online during the quarter as compared to 30 in Q1 and 18 in Q2. As a result, our Permian net equivalent volumes declined during the quarter, down 5% as compared to Q2. That said, the Permian continues to make up the lion's share of our production, representing 57% of our total company equivalent volume and 85% of our total company oil volume.", "Our Q3 Mid-Continent production came in as forecasted at 405 million a day, down slightly from the 419 million a day we posted in Q2. We're on track with our plan, projecting the Mid-Continent production to wrap up considerably here in Q4 as our Cana completion activity picks up steam. With the activity, we're projecting 21 net Mid-Continent wells to come online in Q4 versus a total of 19 for the first nine months of the year.", "As we look forward into Q4, our Q4 guidance of 0.98 Bcfe to 1.01 Bcfe per day incorporates our forecasted ramp up of production from Cana, coupled with a slight drop in Permian production with our most recent slowdown in Permian completions. Our Q4 2015 guidance reflects an exit rate that's 3% to 6% above our Q4 2014 average of 915 million a day, and it provides us with a great springboard into 2016.", "With our strong year-to-date results, we've once again upped our 2015 full year guidance, incorporating our Q4 projection. Our 2015 total company net equivalent production is now projected to be in the range of 983 million to 991 million a day, up from our previous guidance of 960 million to 980 million, and reflecting a 13% to 14% growth over 2014.", "Shifting over to OpEx, as Tom mentioned, our production group continues to focus on trimming our operating costs. With their efforts we've seen sizable reductions and optimizations in items such as saltwater disposal, compression, rentals, power, fuel, as well as well service costs. As a result, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.70 per Mcfe, well below our guidance of $0.90 to $1.05, flat with our Q2 2015 average of $0.76, and down $0.29 or 29% from our 2014 average of $1.08. When incorporating our forecasted production by region and the variable nature of workover expenses, we're guiding our Q4 lifting costs to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.87 per Mcfe, down from the $0.90 to $1.05 estimate that we quoted last call.", "The important byproduct of our LOE reduction is the additional funding we're supplying our drilling program. Our Q3 2015 average monthly LOE of $23.1 million per month is $6.6 million per month below our Q3 2014 average of $29.7 million a month, which over a 12-month time period equates to us bringing up about $79 million that we can direct towards our drilling program, truly significant.", "On service costs, with the continued industry slowdown, the markets for both our drilling and completion costs remain relatively soft and in check. Since our last call, most of our drilling costs components have remained relatively flat with us seeing some modest decreases in a few items, such as cementing, well tubing and surface rentals, particularly in the Permian. Day rates for idle rigs continue to be very competitive, down significantly from last year's rates of $26,000 to $27,000 a day to current quoted levels that are in a range of $17,000 to $18,000 per day.", "On the completion side after the first signs of cost relief in Q1, our average total company per well frac cost came down approximately 15% to 20% from Q4 with us pumping an average of about 12% more fluid and 20% more sand. As we've worked our way through Q3, we've capitalized on the continued reductions in frac cost by keeping our average well frac cost in check, while pumping even bigger jobs. As a result, our average total company Q3 frac cost is still down the same 15% to 20% from late last year but we're pumping 65% more fluid and 84% more sand on the average than we did late last year. The bottom line is we're seeing a slight drop in our major program total well costs since last quarter while continuing to pump even bigger jobs, with our total well costs down anywhere from 15% to 20% from where they were at the end of last year.", "Our current Cana core one mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million. That's down about $100,000 from our last call and down 16% to 17% from the $7.9 million to $8.4 million quote that we gave you last year. In the Meramec, with it still early in the program, we expect to see our current single well lateral wells fall closer to the lower end at the $7 million to $7.4 million AFE range that we quoted last call, which is down about 13% from late Q4.", "In the Permian project drilling continues to be our primary focus. With more wells under our belt, we've cut our Wolfcamp two-mile lateral spud to rig release time 20% from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015 and have a record well this quarter that came in at 20.5 days. We have seen similar drill time reductions in our one-mile lateral Bone Spring Avalon category of wells, cutting the average days from spud to rig release 26% from 23 days in 2014 to 17 days during the last quarter, again with a record well of a very respective 9.25 days. We've established good momentum, cutting the drilling days in our entire Permian program, and as such, we're getting more done with fewer rigs. With continued gains in drilling efficiencies and market cost reductions, we've dropped our two-mile lateral Culberson AFEs down about $200,000 with current AFE estimates of $10.8 to $11.6 million. That's down 18% from late last year.", "So in closing, another great quarter's under our belt. Strong year-to-date performance resulted in yet another quarter with a good production beat. We've made significant strides to cut our LOE. Our drilling program continues to churn out very positive results. And we remain vigilant to keep our costs in check and optimize our program results.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Drew.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "It looks like you have two objectives with the 2016 program, one being to maximize capital efficiency and the other one to size up the resource base. So I'm hoping you can shed some light on how you balance innovation or pushing the envelope on well performance on one hand and minimizing costs on the other. And I guess as it relates to the pilots you plan to drill, how much variation in well design do you expect to implement?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Drew. This is Tom. That's a great question. You know certainly capital efficiency and return on capital remains our top focus. But you always have to have room for innovation. In particular, our assets are in wonderful areas where we have a very thick stratigraphic column. And understanding and identifying the full extent of that column and how many ultimate targets we're going to have is critical to full cycle development.", "I would say first order is looking at the stratigraphic section and understanding how many unique landing zones you'll have. And then second order is what the wells will be spaced side to side. And the challenge as we develop these resources and go into full development is making sure that we've identified all the various landing zones that will become available to us because you cannot always go back and get them later. If you don't identify all the landing zones up front, you run a serious risk of orphaning some targets that will not be available to you, either not at all or if you come back later you'll severely interrupt existing production.", "So it's always a juxtaposition. And some of the pilot projects that John has outlined allow us with small sample projects to test those various landing zones to try to optimize so as we go into full development we're doing it prudently and with the decades of inventory in mine so that we don't strand resources. So it's always a tradeoff between innovation and capital efficiency.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John my only follow up with that, Tom's right on point is what's nice about these projects we have outlined is we are looking for greater capital efficiencies out of these particular pilots especially the Meramec Woodford one that I described. If we're going to be looking at mean ways to reduce our per-well cost, on a per section basis and we hope to see those type of achievements with that type of pilot while also generating very good returns in testing those multiple levels. So we hope to really achieve a lot by these pilots and put us in a very good position to go forward in our development plans.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "And this is Joe. I'll just add something further to that. With these pilots we'll also be experimenting with the optimal facility design, the utilization of zipper fracs to try to optimize our completion costs to that end.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Everyone thank you for all that color. Very helpful. In the Meramec as you complete those, that first pilot, I guess, the pilot you and Devon have the two pilots, are you looking to move forward to drilling those long laterals later in 2016 or is the outcome of the pilot kind of predicated on that?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well this is John. Like we've always talked about when we look at pilots and we ask ourselves, what are we trying to learn from pilots in terms of the ultimate spacing, as Tom alluded to the different landing zones. Yes, we tend to lean towards 5,000 foot laterals for those just from a standpoint of capital investment. But as far as going forward especially in terms of holding acreage and future drilling in the Meramec especially once we understand the ultimate spacing pattern, our plans are to drill 10,000 foot laterals over the majority of our Meramec/Woodford acreage. The nice thing is our acreage is contiguous enough that we have that ability to do that.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I'll just ask one more. Can you compare the returns in the Meramec as they look today to Culberson County Wolfcamp and Cana? Are they similar across those three?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "You know, it varies obviously; in the Meramec, as I talked about in my part of the script, there is a large variation in yield and deliverability and so there are some sweet spots I would say in the Meramec that when we look at it, especially from a standpoint of 10,000 feet, those wells come right to the top as far as the type of returns that we can generate. They compete head on with some of our best Bone Spring drilling as well as some of our best Culberson Wolfcamp long-lateral drilling. So it's very nice to have that kind of portfolio that again we can go after here.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for all the color.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Please go ahead.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, so question is, can you give me the average number of rigs that you are running during the fourth quarter? And perhaps a little insight into first quarter, are we going to just average 12 rigs for the first quarter, and then the entire year? Just trying to get a feeling of your activity levels.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, well this is John. I think currently we have eight...", "Unknown Speaker", "Seven.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Seven, I think about to have an eighth rig, and certainly by December we will be at 12 rigs. That is our plan, and that will be our plan going into the first quarter of next year, is 12 rigs. Those rigs will be deployed currently with six in the Permian and six in Anadarko. And within each of those programs, within the Permian two will be Bone Spring rigs, the other four will be Culberson rigs. Well three of them will be Culberson; the fourth one will be Reeves, currently. In Anadarko it's probably more of a mix of four Woodford and two Meramec, but that will vary some during the course of the year.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "And...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And to answer your question on the average, Irene. You can maybe call later and we can get that to you. But we'll have 12 rigs by the beginning of the year and that's kind of where we want to enter 2016 too, we think that's a good number and gives us kind of the flexibility we want.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Are you going to stay at 12 rigs? Or would you have any ambition to get up to 16? Or you don't need to?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well we don't have any immediate plans. We certainly have the capability, but right now we'd like to stay at 12 and kind of watch and wait.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey good morning, everyone, and congrats. Tom I just wanted to come back to some of your earlier comments on returns. Can you maybe just give us some color around what you require for an investment, maybe on a full-cycle and half-cycle basis? And can you also just frame some of the draconian downsides that you highlighted?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well returns are \u2013 everybody who talks about returns, we're probably all talking about different things. You hear people talk about half-cycle, full-cycle, I will say that at the end of the day, we sum it up and we look at a fully burdened return, and that's how we grade ourselves. And that would include all land, amortized, all overhead associated with programs, any and all capital and what we book for reserves. And here at Cimarex we only look at proved, developed reserves. We don't -- you know, if we book PUDs at the end of the year we don't count that in terms of our reserve adds that goes into our returns. And so there's a lot of room for things to go wrong in that but our experience is that on a return basis, if you're good at this business, you're really good, you can get consistently mid to high teens fully burdened. Now different people may have different reads on that. That's our experience.", "But things go wrong in our business. And that means if you're expecting to deliver to your shareholders mid to high teens on all investments you'd better be drilling wells that are A-tax 25% or better. And it just so happens when you sum up a program that's A-tax 25% or better, if you're good you may end up having fully burdened mid-teens. Now there's a lot of variation around that answer but that's the way we see it and that's what our experience tells us.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So within your portfolio today what would see as generating A-tax 25% or better?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, certainly I would say just about everything we're drilling. With very few exceptions we won't get below that unless it's some extraordinary piece of information we think we can leverage for the future. And you also asked about our downside. We're currently running our investments at a $30-flat NYMEX oil held flat forever, at $40-flat NYMEX held flat forever, and $2 and $2.50 gas held flat forever. And then furthermore we take the dominant revenue phase of a well and we see how low can that dominant revenue phase go and will we still get an A-tax 15% on that investment.", "So we try to stress test our investment. We're not perfect at it and there's certainly an ongoing debate here at Cimarex as to how we should be looking at it. But we tend to live in a world where things don't always work as we planned and want to leave ourselves some room for that.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. I appreciate that answer. And maybe just on 2016. So I guess from your comments, sticking with 12 rigs instead of 16 is more due to efficiency than anything else? And you've previously mentioned that you want to spend the proceeds from the equity deal earlier this year next year. Are you still thinking that way? Or are you comfortable maybe preserving some of those proceeds into 2017 at this point?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, this is John. I'll take the first part of your question. Maybe Mark will follow up. Based on our comments earlier, especially what Joe talked about in terms of how quick we're drilling these wells, when we look at our programs now when we run up to 12 rigs, we come pretty close to spending the amount of capital that we envisioned spending in 2016 when we originally looked at it from 16 rigs. I mean, we are really drilling these wells fast. And so it just means we get more done with less rigs. We're still looking at a certain capital model but we're just more efficient with it. Mark?", "G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. Just to follow up on that Jason and also you might have seen in the pie charts that our mix of drilling in 2016 is slightly shifting, a bit more Bone Spring and Meramec in that mix of drilling. As John alluded to the net number of wells we can cause through 12 rigs with that shift in mix of drilling is not that dissimilar to what we're running with 16 rigs. Capital is down with just a little bit less long laterals in that mix of wells -- so capital would be probably -- efficiency of drilling time and also just overall well costs currently at least capital will be down probably with where we had it, 16 (32:33) but number of net wells we're looking to get done is pretty comparable.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll just finish up. Jason, when we did our equity offering and we first talked about 16 rigs we were in a -- what looks to us today as a significantly higher commodity environment. We were at $60, $65 oil and looking at that as a go forward we've slipped quite a bit. Now balancing that slip has been increasing well performance, increasing drilling efficiencies. So we're pretty pleased with where we sit today from a return landscape, but we think it's prudent to be talking about the rig activity. We are, we maintain that flexibility and we hope that our Cimarex shareholders are listening will be glad that we're proceeding cautiously but moving ahead.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate the detail, everyone. Thanks.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Thanks. I appreciate the time. I guess first, just wanted to talk a little bit more about the Meramec and as you've continued to work through the delineation program there. How much of your acreage in the Meramec, with Meramec exposure do you believe will have multiple landing zones within the Meramec ultimately? Is it the whole slug? Or is there a particular portion?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "The whole slug. This is John. We don't know yet honestly we don't know. I mean, it's a pretty thick section and so we haven't written off any of our areas I don't think yet where we think we can only do one landing zone. We just don't know. Time will tell and it's going to take more drilling by us, as well as our competitors. I will say that we do continue to experiment with different landing zones. We traditionally drill most of our wells in what we call the middle Meramec. We have some more recent wells we've done in the lower Meramec and we've been very pleased with what we see there. So it's hard to say right now because we're just so early in the game. So yeah, I hope it's the whole slug but we'll see.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Tom. One of the things I would add to that is we're almost internally talking about the Mississippian section more than the Meramec. We certainly have the Osage that sits underneath the Meramec and there's a reasonable suspicion that there's lots of areas where that's contributing significantly. And then we also look at the Mississippian Woodford as one continuous petroleum system. So I think for a lot of our acreage we're going to easily say that we're going to have three different landing zones in that petroleum system. That would include the Meramec, Osage and Woodford. But John's right we're still delineating that and right now it's premature to give you an acreage count but it's a lot of our asset.", "Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. Fair enough. Is it safe to say that whole 14-10 (35:43) area that you highlighted would all be prospective by you're thinking currently for multi-zone development side of it?", "\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We're evolving here and we'll give you more color on that project as we get our plans further defined. But when you talk about an area the size that John talked about, essentially all of its Cimarex operated. We can drill 10,000 full length horizontal wells with three landing zones. It's a big, big project. You don't have to go back very many years to where this project swamps the size of Cimarex in terms of what it does. So it's worthy of a lot of forethought and we're putting a lot of thought into it and how do we develop it in the smartest way.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Yeah. That's helpful and you guys alluded to it earlier but did notice that the Meramec's getting a good amount more of the 2016 pie versus the original plan from last quarter. How much more I guess could that, I mean, it does seem like if those wells continue to perform as they are as a highly efficient piece of the capital program. How much more of that pie would you say that the Meramec could command if things continue to play out as they are?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWell this is John. I think in some ways that reflection of the pie shape you're seeing is first and foremost a recognition that we do have some acreage we have to go out there and hold. I'm proud of the fact that early on in this play once we had a few wells under our belt, we did get out and pick up a nice block of acreage but that acreage has termed. And so part of that capital you see is us getting out there and insuring that we hold that acreage position.\nBut I'll also say and true to our word, we chase returns and as we continue to drill these long laterals and if we continue to see good type of returns, then yeah. I mean, we're going to take a hard look at that and make a decision as we always do. We like to maintain our flexibility in that regard, but again, the main reason you're seeing that additional capital is primarily to hold acreage for us this year.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Great. And then I guess last one on my end. Just looking through all the slides and listening to commentary, it sounds like quite a bit of the completion activity is around midyear and in second half in 2016. I guess how should I -- how should we think about the first half from a production profile standpoint? Is there much in the way of completion activity? Does it all kind of keep sequential momentum going? Or should we expect some sort of lull in that period?\nG. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President\nYeah. Michael, this is Mark. And even though the plans have not been established completely for 2016 is still in motion, but your logic is correct. As some of these plays that we're moving into or some of these areas that are in field development should take a good portion of the first part of the year to drill when we start completing. That's still the case as we look into 2016. So that's a logical thought process through 2016.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nEarly models would tell us the production growth occurs in the latter half.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks. Congrats.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Michael.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons. Please go ahead.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nMorning, everybody. Appreciate all the detail. Congrats on the Meramec. The question I wanted to touch on, Tom, was I guess specifically on the Mid-Con, successful results, definitely working through optimal spacing, optimal visioning of the way you want to go forward. Has it changed your attitude at all to any particular additional set of acreage? Anything you're seeing either within distressed assets or just within your results that lead you to believe the trend might be going in a certain direction that might enhance an M&A opportunity in that area?\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nWell, that's a great question. This is Tom. We would love to find assets in our core areas that are at reasonable valuations and are bolt-on, either extensions or even the ability to drill 10,000 foot laterals because they're adjacent to our existing position. That would be a wonderful thing. As you know, the Meramec is not a secret. There are a couple of really aggressive private equity players out there, there are public companies that are extremely aggressive and there are new entrants every time we turn around. So valuations out here are pretty challenging when you look at per acre costs.\nThere was a regional BIA sale that you're probably aware of, that was two or three weeks ago? And what we bid one, what did we win one track, John?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWe got one track, yes. Thanks for reminding me, Tom.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nThere was, even the private equity players were standing there stunned because of the valuations. So it's, we're, we would love to add assets either through M&A or acreage bolt-ons, but we have to be disciplined. We just have to be disciplined.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nWith that discipline in mind, is there any particular area that would be outside your core areas? Outside the Permian and the Mid-Con that could potentially gets interesting the longer we stay at these lower prices? Clearly there are some guys with much worse balance sheets than you guys who may be more incentivized to do something?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nThis is John. I guess I'll take a stab at that. I mean we have a group that is constantly looking at new opportunities for us outside of our two core areas. And we're always looking at different basins that we think would be a good fit for us. But it always comes down to what can we bring that's different than what they already have? I mean it's one thing that they may have an impaired balance sheet, it's another to say whether or not they're a poor operator or, what could we do differently? So we look at that, for sure. But that's a tough challenge for us, because again you're talking about bringing in something that would have to compete with the type of assets we already have under our belt in both the Permian and Anadarko.\nSo it's a pretty high threshold for us to get interested in something outside of those two basins, just given the large inventory of opportunity we already have. But we do look. We're not -- we are always looking because we're always chasing the best return. And if we think there is a better return somewhere else, then yeah, we'll go after it. But boy, it would be tough.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nWe always have an active search ongoing, either for assets or M&A. Not a week goes by where we don't have several meaningful discussions on opportunities. But, as John said, the bar is high.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nAnd then just one short-term question, the Q4 completion schedule, how many Permian wells are on it?\nJoseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP\nFor Q4, this is Joe. On a net basis we're looking at about 11.7 net wells in the Permian and about 20.8 in the Mid-Continent.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nPerfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi. You talked about trying to identify landing zones early to make sure that you don't go and orphan any zones. And can you talk about that a little bit in regards to the Wolfcamp C, because it looks like from the presentation the Culberson Wolfcamp C development dropped off in exchange for the longer laterals in the Wolfcamp D. And then also in the Meramec and the Woodford, in terms of co-development you talked about how thick the sections are but what would you need to see to be confident that you can continue with the Woodford development and then maybe come back later and catch the Meramec over time?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWell, this is John. First off, we have not given up on the C. I want to be clear about that. What we've elected to do is in this case we are going to go develop the D on those two sections. Really what we're doing is we want the see the effect of a stagger on those wells within the fifth D (44:47). And we want to get that result because that's not something we've achieved yet with our other two pilots. I will tell you that we have plans after we finish with those long laterals to go right back up north to what we had previously talked about as our C hero assault (45:04). And there's a good chance that based on what we see from this latest development area that we'll then layer in the C wells. Right now it's just one step at a time. Right now we really want to see the effect of stagger and we don't want to overcomplicate it in this case.\nAs far as the Woodford, Meramec and I guess what we tend to call optionality, that is can you develop Woodford and then come back later and develop Meramec? Those are things that quite frankly we're trying to ascertain right now with some of the wells that we've been drilling. I don't know that we have a firm answer on that just yet as far as can we do one and come back and do another later, or do we have to do it all simultaneously? I can tell you that's a big debate within our company and that's something that we have a number of wells that have been drilled or will be drilled that will be testing those type of concepts. Because that is something that we have to understand as we go forward.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nJeanine, it's Tom. If we had to take a risk on that I would say our bias would be to drill the Meramec first and come in later and get the Woodford underneath it rather than the other way around. And that's just, the Woodford and the Meramec behave very differently when you offset them. But John's right, we don't know the answer to that yet. One thing we do know, if we codevelop it all simultaneously then we don't really have to spend a lot of time worrying about this.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. That's really helpful. And then in terms of the production profile for 2016, dovetailing on our previous question, it looks like that for the Permian the approach for completions there for next year is just drill all the wells and then complete all the wells at the same time, which I think is what you're doing in the Mid-Con, and I assume that has something to do with the reservoir characteristics in the Mid-Con. Is there anything in the data that suggests that you need to absolutely do that same type of development approach in the Wolfcamp? So is it at all possible that you could do a less chunky program and kind of smooth out production for next year?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nThis is John. Yes, there are areas within the Wolfcamp where I think we have satisfied ourselves that we could be less chunky in our development, and that is, maybe take a section at a time. But honestly, from a capital efficiency standpoint I don't know that's in our best interest in terms of planning out all the infrastructure involved in this. I think from our standpoint it is best to look at it more in multi-section development, if we're really going to achieve those future capital reductions we'd like to see on a per well basis. So honestly I think that's just where the whole industry's going, that you're going to see a lot more of these larger scale developments. And that's going to lead to a more chunkier type of production profile.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. Thanks very much.\nKaren Acierno - Director of Investor Relations\nYou know, Jeanine, supplementing the infills we'll have rigs running in the Bone Spring. So those rigs add production on a more regular basis. So it's not as if all the production will be coming on that way.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Meramec. We may have individual Meramec elimination (48:11).\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the Bone Spring program. I'm looking at slide 15. You talk about 100 locations identified. And I suppose that's mostly in New Mexico. And I was wondering what is your view of the acreage down in Culberson County? And what could be the Bone Spring potential there?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nYeah. This is John. We love our Bone Spring acreage in Culberson. As you can tell, we've drilled quite a few wells there. And in fact, of the two rigs that will be drilling Bone Spring that we anticipate in 2016, one of those rigs pretty much will be drilling down in that Culberson area. There is great potential still there. I know we always sound like a broken record when it comes to the Bone Spring. You know we don't think of it as a regional resource play like a shale. For the Culberson acreage it just takes more drilling on our part to get more confident and de-risking on more of the acreage. So yeah, there's still plenty of locations left in Culberson. And there's still a lot of upside left down there. But we still need to explore some of that.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nOkay. So that will be as locations added as you go delineate that acreage block?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nYeah. We basically kind of step out from section to section. The issue with Bone Spring is pretty simple. It's water cut and we have to be very careful on water cut and that's really what drives our economics. And so as we get better and better definitional on the water cut and within our plays, then that helps us define better where all the good locations are. And that's something we're still defining and understanding better down in Culberson.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nI want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and we look forward to delivering further results in the future. Thank you all very much.\nOperator\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Second Quarter 2010 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford, Director of Capital Markets. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much Regina, appreciate it and welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. We did issue our earnings release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website and I will refer it to you.", "We'll be making forward looking statements in this conference call. So I will refer you to the end of that press release for our disclaimer regarding forward looking statements. And here in Denver on today's call we have Mick Merelli, our Chairman, & CEO; Tom Jorden, EVP of Exploration; Joseph Albi, EVP of Operations; Paul Korus, Vice President & CFO and Jim Shonsey, VP & Controller.", "So with those introductions over, let's just go and jump into the call. I'm turning the call over to Mick Merelli.", "Mick Merelli", "Yeah, thanks. Thanks for joining us today on the call. We had a solid second quarter. We grew production 31% over last year, hitting a record of 594 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Second quarter volumes were made up of 37,000,173 barrels per day of liquids and 371 million cubic feet a day of gas. Our production mix is 62% gas and 38% liquids and that's using 6:1 conversion. Our gas versus liquids on a revenue basis is 41% gas and 59% liquids.", "We do have a strong liquids contribution in our Cana play in the Gulf Coast and of course our Permian activities. We reported second quarter earnings of a $125 million or about a $1.46 per share and cash flow from operations totaled $260 million. Our exploration and development capital investment in the quarter was $247 million.", "Our six month E&D capital has totaled $430 million. For the full year 2010 the capital program will likely fall within a range if 900 million to a $1 billion. We extent to continue to fund this capital and investment for that program out of our operating cash flow.", "The range is up from our previous range of 700 to 900 million. We continue to have very good results in our Permian Basin drilling and we are getting more active there. Our rig count is up. We've been acquiring acreage. We've acquired about 45,000 net acres in our Delaware basin activities so far this year; probably acquire more as the year goes on.", "So we're expanding in that area. So our capital is moving ahead. We're having a good year. Of course we define that based on getting good returns on our capital invested and we like the returns that we're getting so far.", "Now I'm going to pass it off to Tom and Joe and let them cover our drilling and production in more detail. And with that Tom, tell us about the drilling program.", "Tom Jorden", "Thanks Mick and good morning or good afternoon to everyone. As Mick said, operationally our second quarter was a very good one for Cimarex and we're feeling quiet positive about the remainder of the year and in actual future years.", "All of our areas are continuing to perform very well as we've highlighted in the past. Just to recap, our three core areas are the mid-continent which is essentially our resource gas play; our Permian, which is essentially horizontal oil drilling and our onshore Gulf Coast. ", "We have a great balance of opportunities and as we always remind you, we are ready to return focus, but right now with the high relative value of oil, we are adding capital towards our higher return Permian Basin horizontal drilling.", "Our current guidance estimate for capital is between 900 and a $1 billion would break down to about equal 45% between Mid-Continent and Permian, and then approximately 10% of that total capital should be spent in our Gulf Coast. So, that's change from prior. The most significant change there is our Permian capital has ramped up over previous estimates and really is going toe-to-toe with our Mid-Continent, Cana and another obligations that we're pursuing aggressively.", "So, I'll cover and summarize some of our drilling activity. Our overall exploration and development activity for quarter, we drilled and completed 89 gross or 55 net wells in the first half of 2010, of which 84 gross or 52 net were successful. At quarter end, we had 33 gross or 16.5 net wells that were in the process of being completed or awaiting on completion. So we still have a fair backlog of completion activity.", "In the Mid-Continent, we drilled and completed 49 gross or 24.2 net Mid-Continent wells during the first six months of 2010 and 100% of those were producers. At quarter end, we had 17 gross or 6.7 net wells that were in the process of being completed or were awaiting on completion. For the Mid-Continent, first half 2010 exploration development capital totaled 200 million or about 46% of our projected total capital.", "In our western Oklahoma, Cana-Woodford Shale play, we drilled and completed 35 gross or 15.6 net wells during the first half of 2010. At quarter end, 15 gross or 6 net wells were being completed or awaiting on completion in this area. So, we're on track to get about 35 net wells drilled and completed this year.", "Since our Cana-Woodford drilling began in late 2007, we participated in 123 gross or 51.6 net wells and out of those total wells, 92 gross or 38.8 net were on production at quarter end and the remainder were either drilling or waiting on completion.", "Second quarter 2010 net production from the Cana play averaged 75 million cubic feet equivalent per day versus the second quarter 2009 average of 24 million cubic feet equivalent per day. So, we've seen our results ramp up there. We are very, very pleased with continuing improving results out of our Cana play.", "Our Woodford drilling to-date in our Cana play has been one well per section and we've spoken extensively about that in the past. In order to determine optimal spacing, we initiated an infill pilot program. We have done this jointly with a partner and the tests consist of nine total horizontal Woodford wells being drilled and completed within one square mile. Five of those wells were spaced 500 feet apart and the other four wells were spaced 660 feet apart.", "Our initial results are encouraging. We've about 45 days of flow back. We're still waiting on significant data coming in but we can give you a little bit of flavor of our results. We'll continue to monitor the performance from these wells to determine if these results support 80 acre or the tighter spacing is actually 64 acre spacing. If that were to happen, the results would significantly increase our view of the resource potential for our Cana play.", "Of the infill wells we've drilled after our 45 days of production, our first 30-day average of those wells is somewhere between 5.1 and 5.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day and that's an average and includes the wet gas stream and the wellhead condensate. We're seeing results that are very, very encouraging that said we're still watching those wells, we have a lot of data that we've collected, that we have yet to analyze and just to give you a flavor what that is, we recorded extensive MicroSeismicon those wells to try to map the fracture efficiency, the degree to which the fractures of adjacent wells, may or may not be interfering with one another but fracture wing link, now we haven't the results that MicroSeismicdata yet.", "It was a complex job with different receiver strings and vertical and horizontal wells and it's still in processing. So, one of the critical pieces of data from that pilot project being the MicroSeismicjob still, we haven't seen even preliminary results on that. We also put tracers on our wells and we haven't seen any results from our tracer data so that's a critical piece of data that we have yet to see and then we haven't yet brought back our parent wells to see what extent they'll come back or what the extend the in-field drilling has affected them.", "So, our MicroSeismicdata or tracer data bring the parent wells back and then just saying a little longer performance of those infill wells are critical to us before we wanted to be definitive but we will say that our initial results are quite encouraging and look like certainly we've got some nice 30-day average flow rates out of those infill well on an 80 and 64-acre pilot project.", "I'd like to touch on a couple other areas in the Mid-Continent and just give us some highlights. Staying on Cana, what we've discussed our Southern acreage and our quandary as to whether that will ultimately be economic. We have about 10,000 acres of our total acreage positions in the Southern extent of the play. We drilled our Oaks Well that well is somewhat encouraging, it's currently making 2.3 million cubic feet gas a day and 55 barrels of condensate a day, that's given us encouragement enough to continue to keep that area alive, we're releasing lands to the extent we can, we are evaluating that to see if we'll drill additional wells down there but certainly we're not relying of and that was the risk in the project if we haven't had some encouragement.", "We continue to optimize our completions, our track fracs are -- we're going back to 13 stages after experimenting with going to as many as 20, we didn't see the kind of uplift with that those additional hydraulic facture stages that we're looking for, what we did there, we had the lateral link the same, we reduced our stage link to get more stages in the borehole, didn't see any improvement there, so we've dialed that back. We've also cut our job size down a little bit, we were at one point, up to as much as 250,000 pounds per stage of profit, 340,000 gallons of slick water per stage and we're currently dialing at down to about 120,000 pounds per stage of profit and that's 40-70 resin-coated profit and we're about 180,000 gallons of slick water per stage and we think that's not going to leave to any degradation of results to dial that back.", "Our current cost in the Cana play, our AFEs is somewhere between 7.1 million and 7.5 million to drill a complete these wells, that's something that we put a lot of energy on to see if we can get that down. Right now, we're focusing, we've been putting a lot of efforts into geo steering our wells and we're making sure that we're targeting particular subsets of the Woodford reformation and we're looking to see if we can relax that a little bit and drill these wells a little faster. So, we're still in the process of optimizing, the Cana play continue to be a strong focus of ours, our results are very encouraging, both from our continued improvement of results from our parent wells with also our initial results of pilot project are something that, although we are still studying it, we are encouraged by it.", "Moving on in the Mid-Continents, the Texas Panhandle, in the first half of 2010 we drilled 8 gross wells or 6.2 net wells, 7 of those were Granite Wash and one was, one was Morrow. Second quarter drilling included our George 17-4H well, where we had a 61% working interest, that's a horizontal Granite Wash well in Southern Hempfield County. That actually offsets our huff well and we have talked about in past. That was brought into production in late June, it averages 7.9 million cubic equivalent per day about 6.9 million cubic feet of gas and a 180 barrels a day oil in the first 25 days.", "We were encouraged by that that was actually a shorter lateral then the huff, but still very nice result. Now moving on to the Permian Basin, in the first half of 2010, we drilled and completed 33 gross or 24.7 net Permian basin wells, 94% of those were completed as producers. At quarter end we had 15 gross 38.8 net wells that were in the process of being completed or were waiting completion.", "First half 2010 exploration and development capital for the Permian totaled a 155 million or about 36% of our total capital. So, as you can see first half we were about 36% of total capital, I said earlier we are projecting 45% of our total capital to be for total year for the Permian, so that tells you that we're ramping up our activity in the Permian. We got some great plays, we're very exited about and as Nick also said we're off on some very active leasing projects in Permian basin.", "Starting off the Northern portion of our South Eastern Mexico Eddy Chaves County is Abo program. We've had some new results come in there, we have two wells that were currently - two rigs that were are currently drilling, we have a 3D seismic shoot that we are currently acquiring data on in that play. That Abo program continues produce very, very nice results and really glad to have it.", "Recent Abo wells are brought in production includes our Valley Forge 20 State Com 4H. Came on 590 barrels of oil equivalent per day and there we have a 50% working interest. We have over 35,000 net acres in the Abo and we see multi-years of drilling, as I said we have two rigs running and should keep two rigs there for the foreseeable future.", "Moving on to out Central Eddy & Lea County First & Second Bone Spring program, that's one that we've talked about in the past that's a new program in Cimarex in 2009 and has become our most active program in the Permian basin.", "Recent Bone Spring Horizontal oil wells include our Parkway State Com 2H. Where we have a 58% working interest, came on a 970 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our Southern California 29 Fed 15H, there we had a 100% working interest, that well came on at 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And those are 30 day average rates.", "So, we are seeing some outstanding results in our horizontal oil play in Eddy and Lea County. Moving on further South in Eddy country in our White City area, we're also evaluating the Bone Spring potential. That's an area that historically was a more of a vertical well gas play. We then turn it into Shale horizontal Delaware play we've talked about that in the past and then we are evaluating net acreage for the first and second Bone spring, we have talked in the past, we have drilled a horizontal Avalon shale well. We're currently valuating that well. But we're encouraged with the results.", "We're having outstanding results in the Permian. We're seeing great returns and as I said, we're picking up activity and we see that as an increase on our operating rig count from five, beginning of the first quarter, to 12 operating rigs currently. With the increase in rig count, we expect to drill approximately 100 net wells in 2010, which is a 33% increase over the assessment of 75 net wells.", "Our 100 net wells fall within our major plays. We'll have 30 of them in the Bone Spring play, 15 of the in the Abo play, and 40 wells in the (inaudible) drilling vertical wells.", "Moving on to the Gulf Coast, and the Gulf Coast for first half of 2010 and in our southeast Texas Yegua/Cook Mountain terrain, we drilled 7 gross or 6.6 net wells, of which 6 or 5.6 net wells were successful and the Gulf Coast first half of 2010 exploration development capital totaled 72 million or about 17% of our total capital.", "Out Gulf Coast drilling has been primarily there with City of Beaumont, in Jefferson County where we had 5 gross or 4.6 net wells, all of which were successful. In the second quarter, we brought on our Manion Gas Unit No 1 and our Jefferson Airplane No 4 wells. Our Manion Gas Unit No 1, is currently producing 6.7 million cubic feet a day a very nice well full of smaller features. It's producing out at the same, Kirby Sand. There is our Two Sisters, or Amazon Queen or Nine Dragons well. So, I would continue to be encouraged by the results we're seeing there.", "Our Jefferson Airplane Complex, we're monitoring it. We've had some issues with some sand production there. We brought some of our wells to lower rates to control our sand production. Our higher productive wells are in compared to drainage there. So, we're having to manage that compared to drainage situation and manage our sand production. So, it's been a bit of balancing act in the Jefferson Airplane Complex. But, overall I would say our wells are performing as expected.", "Since quarter end, we brought on our BP Fairfield well and that's a smaller feature in the Yegua Sand that was currently making 5.2 million cubic feet a day. We're also bringing our FE well online. That's another very smaller Kirby feature. And then we talked about our deeper prospect. We're currently drilling our Tallapoosa prospect. That's a well named with JB Gordon No 1. That's a deeper prospect. It's much higher risk. It's higher potential. It actually sits some 1,500-2000 feet our Kirby Sand. As we talked about in the past, we see a deeper set of geophysical anomalies in our date set that we're very anxious to testing.", "We had several follow-up ideas at Tallapoosa prospect. We're going to be successful. But again, the fact that we have had such good success on this survey doesn't do anything to de-risk or de-project it. It really stands alone with its own ground for risk profile. But that well's underway. We're very excited to see that well down and if we're successful, it would lead to some follow-up drilling. So, we currently have one rig drilling in our southeast Texas Yegua/Cook Mountain play and studies as she goes, we will see what happens.", "We've said in the past, we're always trying to extend that plays. We're working on some new ideas to extend that. That's a play that's been a core part of our business for many years and will be for the foreseeable future.", "So, very nice results so far this year. All three of our core businesses are performing well. We are ramping up our Permian activity but we like that balance. We certainly liked the results we're seeing in our mid-continent program, dominant of our Cana resource gas play. Our Permian program is firing on all cylinders. That's internally generated opportunities and we've had some outstanding results and then our Gulf Coast program continues to perform as expected and we still have a fair amount of drilling to do there.", "So with that I'll turn it over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Joe Albi", "Thank you Tom and thank you all for joining us today on our call. I'll hit on our second quarter production results, update you on our 2010 guidance, touch a bit on our production group activities and then follow up with a few comments on where we see current service costs. As Mick mentioned, Q2 was another good solid quarter for us with the continued success that we had in each of our core areas. We reported average net daily equivalent production of 594.4 million a day and despite being somewhat impacted by pipeline and facility shut ins, we really set some nice marks during the quarter.", "We came in at the upper end of our projected guidance of 570 to 600 million a day. We set a new company record for quarterly production. We had our fourth consecutive quarterly increase in production since we slowed down our activity in late 2008 and early 2009. We were up 140 million a day or 31% from our Q2'09 average of 454 million a day and we were up nearly 10 million a day as compared to Q1'10.", "In comparing second quarter '10 results to second quarter of '09, we saw nice production increases in both gas and oil and NGL liquids. Our Q2'10 gas production of 371.4 million a day was up 54 million a day or 17% from our Q2'09 average of 318 million a day while our Q2'10 oil and NGL production of 47,000 barrels a day was up more than two fold from the 23,000 barrels a day that we reported in Q2'09.", "As compared to Q1'10, on an equivalent basis, we were up in each of our core areas. In the mid-continent, our second quarter production of 248.4 million a day was up nearly 10 million a day from our first quarter average of 238.8 million a day. Our Gulf Coast onshore production of 183.2 million a day was up 2 million a day from our Q1 average of 181 million a day while our Q2 Permian production of 155.1 million a day was up slightly from our Q1 average of $154.5 million a day.", "Now I want to spend just a little bit of time discussing our Q2 numbers as they compare to Q1. At first glance you'll see that our reported gas production of 371.4 million a day was down about 5% from our first quarter average of 391 million a day. Our reported oil production of 26,400 barrels a day was down 5.7% from our first quarter average of 28,000 barrels a day but our reported NGL production of 10,800 barrels a day was up 151% from our Q1 average of 4,300 barrels a day.", "Digging deeper into the numbers, three factors really come to surface. First, as Tom alluded to, beginning in April and continuing into June we intentionally reduced the production rates of three of our Beaumont wells to protect the wells from reservoir management standpoint.", "In April we saw early signs of potential fine sand flow production in our Jefferson Airplane number 1 well. We did extensive modeling of the reservoir and wellbore flow conditions and we made the decision to cut that production from not only that well but also two other Jefferson Airplane wells during the quarter.", "The rate reductions occurred ongoing from April through June and although pinching back the wells reduced our production during the quarter we announced just deferred production from these wells and minimize or anticipated declines in Q3 and Q4.", "Secondly, we experienced a number of unanticipated pipeline and facility related shut-ins during the quarter which deferred upwards of 10 to 15 million a day of production during the quarter and the majority of these occurred in South Texas and Permian.", "And thirdly, our increased natural gas liquid production was a result of real three things, increased Cana and other process gas drilling activity, contract amendments in South Texas and the Permian and our continued focus of maximize the delivery of our South Texas gas into the markets to provide processing.", "But when the dust settled our intentional rate reductions in the Jefferson Airplane wells and the pipeline facility shut-ins reduced our second quarter oil and gas production from the levels we saw in Q1 while our focus on processing resulted in a increased production from natural gas liquids in the second quarter as compared to Q1.", "In the end of equivalent basis we are up for the quarter and essence just shifted some production from Q2 into Q3 and Q3.", "So, looking forward with the modeling of activity in each of our core areas we have increased our production guidance to the remainder of the year. All three of our core areas provide us with catalyst for continued production growth. During Q2, we saw our Cana program deliver another quarter of production growth growing our mid-continent gas production by 8 million a day from Q1 to Q2 from a 188 million a day in a Q1 to 196 million a day in Q2.", "We anticipate the program to continue the production growth during the year and ultimately getting near that number I think we quoted in our last conference call where we'll see total Cana production get upwards of a 100 million a day by the end of the year.", "We picked up our activity in the Permian, as Tom mentioned we have got we have gone from five rigs in March to a current level of 12. The results of that activity really is expected to been seen here in the last half of the year and not so much here during Q2.", "And our current rig schedule for South Texas includes a good number of leads that if they are successful they can certainly help us in the tail end of 2010 and certainly through 2011.", "So, as a result we have increased our production guidance projections for the remainder of the year and despite selling about 3.5 million a day of production at the end of Q2, closing date on that transaction was June 30.", "Our guidance for Q3 production is estimated at 585 to 815 million cubic feet equivalence per day that's up by healthy 33 to 39% from our Q3, '09 average of 442 million a day.", "And for the year we have increased our 2010 guidance once again, projecting total company net equivalent production of 585 to 609 million a day for the year. That's up from our guidance last quarter of 575 to 595 and up significantly from our beginning year guidance of 540 to 570 million a day.", "It also represents a very respectable 26 to 31% increase from our 2009 average of 463 million a day. With our continued focus on oil and liquid rich gas we anticipate that we will exit the year with oil and NGL production making up about 38% of our total company production which is about where we reported last quarter and that again is 8 percentage points higher than the 30% we averaged in 2009.", "While shifting gears to our production operations group, our emphasis during Q2 was once again focused on improving our operating efficiencies. And in doing so, we managed to keep our lifting cost inline with that of Q1.", "Now although we're seeing some cost pressure in items such as saltwater disposal, compression, pulling-unit cost, our second quarter average lifting cost of $0.84 per Mcfe was virtually flat to our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcf.", "We also fell in the low-end of our second quarter guidance range of $0.80 to $1. At current levels we're operating at a 24% decrease from the $1.11 per Mcf average that we saw in 2009. So we have managed to keep in our hip pocket a lot of the cost reductions that we're able to derive at the end of '09 and coming into '10. Although, we plan to continue our focus on cost efficiency with the likely cost pressures that we're seeing, we saw no reason to change our previous 2010 guidance estimate of $0.80 to a $1 for the year.", "As was the case again in Q1, our second quarter exploitation activity was focused on lift projects in both the Permian and Mid-Continent. So re-completion activity in southeast New Mexico, Southern Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle and a half dozen or so infill drilling projects in West Texas and Kansas.", "Through June, we've deployed about $22 million towards our exploitation efforts and are staying with our projection from last quarter that will end the year somewhere near the low-end of our -- we're giving you a guidance budget of 50 to $75 million for the year.", "And finally on the drilling and completion cost side, over the last six months we've seen anywhere from 5 to 20% cost increases in items such as rigs, cementing, rentals and mud. But frac cost continue to really be the wild card for us with cost pressure directly related to crew availability.", "There's so many net moving parts to this cost component that it's hard for me to quote you an exact increase in the costs that we're seeing. But depending on the area, the size and the scope changes in our frac design, we've seen anywhere from 10 to 100% plus increases in our frac cost over the last six months.", "We've also experienced delays in scheduling some of our jobs. Frac costs for the most part seemed to be putting the most cost pressure on our total well costs. That said, through careful planning and continued operating efficiencies we've managed to minimize our well cost increases, while getting the sales without any extensive delays.", "In Cana, Tom had quoted AFEs of 7.1 to $7.5 million. Depending on debt, that number can range upwards of $8 million but the bottom line is from Q1 to Q2, we're seeing about $1.5 million increase in our total well cost in Cana.", "Our 6,000 foot vertical Blinebry/Paddock well AFEs of $1.7 million are up slightly from the $1.5 million we were recording in Q1, while an 8,000 foot New Mexico Bone Spring horizontal well with a 4,500 foot lateral is now AFEing at about 3.8 million or about $200,000 higher than Q1.", "So we're seeing may be 4 to 8% total well cost increases but through efficiencies we've managed to keep a good bit of control on our cost. So our challenge obviously as we move forward is to continue to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can keep our well cost in line, keep the rate of returns that we're seeing where they are and continue to expand our activity and get the results that we're currently seeing.", "So with that all I'll turn the call over to Paul Korus.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you Joe. I just want to recap a few things and then address some of the questions that we've had from calls this morning. Recap mid-year status for Cimarex, great shape, $329 million of net income, $3.84 per share, 573 million in cash flow. If you annualize those numbers you could see that we are well on our way for over 1.1 billion of cash flow in annualized earnings per share of over $7. So great shape from that perspective.", "At the same time we have no bank debt and we have a 142 million in cash in the bank as on June 30th and as Tom and Joe have described for you, operationally great year. Production is up 30%, very steady. We're on track for probably what might be our largest percentage increase in crude reserves we've ever had, a good rates return and low finding costs. So that's a pretty healthy score card I would say.", "On the other hand, since we are making more money, we've had to increase our estimate of what we're going to go for income taxes this year from about 100 million to a 120 million. As a result you saw in our second quarter numbers that we trued up the split between our current and differed tax items to reflect that about 65% of our book tax provision which usually runs around 36.5% will be differed with the remaining 35% being our best estimate of what we think we'll have for current taxes. So that's what we ended up with for the six months results with a lot of movement between the first and second quarter. And that's what we would expect to see as we finish the year.", "The other item that I think we got some questions about this morning was so called adjusted earnings. We are kind of down the middle of the fair way and we report GAAP earnings because we know the rules for those. Adjusted earnings are somewhat in the eyes of the analyst. But the way we would look at that, it mostly revolves around the hedging.", "You saw that in the first quarter using market-to-market accounting we had 52 million of hedge gains in the first quarter because prices went down and brought all our hedges into the money. So we basically recognized much of the earnings in the first quarter.", "In the second quarter we only had 3.3 million of mark-to-market gains on the derivatives. That's because prices went down a little bit further. But anyway, if you net all those things out, you could say that had we been using effective hedge accounting treatment, our revenues would have been about $16.6 million higher in the second quarter and then we would have not had the 3.3 million of mark-to-market gain, in which case out pretax income would have been about $13.3 million higher. In turn net income would have been around 8.4 million higher and earnings per shares about $0.10 higher or a $1.56 as opposed to the reported $1.46. So that's the way we would look at the adjusted earnings figure and I think some of you are and some of you aren't but the kind of guidance or explanation we would give around that.", "I think that's all I need to say. So would be happy to begin entertaining questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mitch Wurschmidt with Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Mike Merelli", "", "Thank you, Mitch.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Yeah, just, I was looking at the Bone Spring and Abo results. They keep getting better and better each quarter and I'm just curious. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing differently or is it the area, the play you're in or how repeatable you think that is?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Mitch, its Tom. Much as I'd love to cite our efforts, a lot of that is the rocks. We're really in some very nice areas. We're getting these wells completed efficiently. I think our team in Midland has done a great job operationally, getting these things done. But, it's really just nice rock. We're finding and we're testing some new areas and they're very prolific and we're just tickled pink with the results. When we first got on this play we were talking about results that were considerably lower than what we're achieving.", "So we're increasing our own estimate, pre-drill. Of course that means that some other people are paying attention. Lands got a little more expensive. There are some play entrants. If you follow the industry as I know you do Mitch that there are a lot of other people now talking about that Bone Spring play in Southeastern Mexico. So, it's just really worked out well for us and to that I attribute good geology and good operational execution.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "That's great. It's helpful. Can you talk a bit about, maybe EURs you're seeing on some of those wells? Like you kind of mentioned well costs. Where are you kind of coming in on some of the EURs or the average you should be looking at?", "Tom Jorden", "", "We're currently -- when we got started in this, we were talking about the EURs between 200 and 250,000 barrels. For the areas we like, which is most of the trend, our EURs now are coming in between, I would just 550,000 barrels on an equivalent basis is our current model. And we think that's sustainable. We think that's where our results speak to.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And, that's for about I guess the $3.8 million well?", "Mike Merelli", "Well it depends on depth. Joe quoted 3.8. That would be, it goes deep to shallow as you go from west to east. So that's probably 3.8, 4.2 maybe, yeah.", "Tom Jorden", "Current AFEs for a deeper well are running around 4.1", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay, great. That's really helpful. Can you break down like what the rig count; you mentioned 12 rigs in the Permian. How does that break down between the Bone Springs and some of the other plays and kind of how do you see that going into 2011? Any color on that would be great.", "Mike Merelli", "Yeah you bet Mitch. There are 12 rigs. We have three of them in the New Mexico Bone Spring play. Two of them are in our Abo trend. We have two of them drilling vertical Paddock wells. We have three rigs on White City, testing various things. And then we have one in our Third Bone Spring play down at our low in-field and one kind of bounces around drilling some miscellaneous wells.", "We haven't poured our 2011 plans yet. That's a process we typically kick off in October. I will say that I've spent little time with our Permian Group and they are wanting to increase activity fairly significantly and I think you would probably see that proportionately. We like all those plays.", "So, we really like the Bone Spring play, the Abo play, the Paddock play. So, I think you'd seen, that ratio probably hold solid. But I would expect and again, I'll caution to say we haven't done our 2011 planning yet. But I would expect that will be increasing our Permian capital, I would say, 20% or more for next year.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "That's great. And then, thinking about the inventory you guys mentioned 45,000 acres picked up in the Delaware Basin. I assume that's Bone Springs potential as well. Could we get maybe a number on total potential acreage that could be perspective for the Bone Springs?", "", "Joe Albi", "Bone Spring mentioned several different plays. We have our Bone Spring that we're playing in Eddy County is second third bone spring. First Bone Spring is the Avalanche Shale and so I will say that of our acreage that we currently tabulate, we think exposure to that Avalanche Shale play, we probably have 100,000 or more acres that's potentially sitting right in the middle of it. So as I say that I'm going to caution that there is more that we don't know about that play than we do know about that play but there is some drilling going on and it does sort of subsume about 100,000 acres that we think will be exposed to that play.", "In the New Mexico Bone Spring play, we have about 38,000 net and about 65,000 gross and that's a very difficult number to really put a stake in the ground on because that's changing all the time. We're leasing aggressively. We find ourselves through trades and using the force pooling that we leverage our position to increase our working interest but we've gotten multi years of inventory and we really like those plays.", "Mitch Wurschmidt - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "No, I really appreciate all the answers guys. Congrats again. I'll jump off and let somebody else jump on. Thanks.", "Mike Merelli", "Thanks Mitch.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Pope with Dahlman Rose.", "Nicholas Pope - Dahlman Rose", "Afternoon guys.", "Mike Merelli", "Hi Nick.", "Nicholas Pope - Dahlman Rose", "Hey, on the asset sale that you all made during the quarter, what exactly did you sell and how much reserves are attributed to that?", "Mike Merelli", "They were our assets predominantly in Mississippi because that followed us for 10 years at least. He probably didn't know we had assets in Mississippi. So that was the bulk of the proceeds and the associated reserves are about 8.7 Bcfe.", "Nicholas Pope - Dahlman Rose", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just, could you give more detail about the pipeline curtailments that you'll saw during the quarter, I guess where they were located and do you have an idea of like what the -- how much that impacted the production during the quarter.", "Joe Albi", "This is Joe Albi. Our best estimates for production reductions during the quarter, I think I quoted 10 to 15 million a day. A majority of that occurred in the Beaumont area and it was a situation where there was some maintenance repairs going on number one and number two there was a small pipeline rupture that needed to be tended to. So that had the biggest impact on us. We also had maintenance shut ins in the Permian that also were playing a big role in that whole shut in period. It's hard for me to give you a dead on number because we re-pensioned our Beaumont wells at the same time that we had the shut ins ongoing. So if I use before shut in versus after shut in, it gives me a range of potential impact for the quarter.", "Nicholas Pope - Dahlman Rose", "Okay, that's no problem. And were any of those pipeline impacting the quarter end numbers. You don't provide the last week and the operations update?", "Mike Merelli", "No", "Joe Albi", "That all happened in June for the most part. April through June.", "Nicholas Pope - Dahlman Rose", "Okay, that's all I had. Thanks a lot.", "Joe Albi", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, could you comment on what the cost of the Granite Wash wells that you are drilling are?", "Joe Albi", "", "Well this is Joe Albi, the current well cost for a Texas Panhandle Granite Wash wells is running around $5 million and that's up about $0.5 million from where we were in Q1 most of that is on the completion side and due to increased stimulation cost.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And how long are those laterals, how deep are they?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Yeah the 11,000 laterals are about 5000 deep, it kind of depends where you are, it kind of that's going to vary from 8 to 11,000 feet and laterals if we can get a 5000 per laterals we'll try. 4,500 feet is probably more realistic given land constraints, where you can put your rig.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay a lot of other operators have drilled well. They are sort of in the teens 20s of IPs, is there -- do you think the lower IP that you had in your well was because of shorter lateral or is that the area you are in or any other?", "Tom Jorden", "This is Tom, we offset our huff well which had teens rates so it's -- we do have that kind of potential in the area. As I said the reason George Well was reduced rate was really two reasons. We are drilling a San Channel, we in the lateral we ran out of sand and we stopped lateral a little short because we though we were out of sand and then when we were running our casing we stuck the casing and didn't get all the way in and off about another 500 feet of lateral.", "So, there is about 2,500 foot effective length in that well and that certainly accounts for the reduced rate.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. Okay. In the Cana test, could you give us an idea for the parent wells, what the 30 day average was?", "Joe Albi", "Gil I am sorry, operator we are having, it's not coming too very clear here on our end.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you hear me better now or?", "Joe Albi", "Gil I can barely hear you. Go ahead Gil please.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "For the Cana wells the parents wells that the down spacing wells were tested that were nearby. Can you give us what the 30 days rates were for those wells?", "Tom Jorden", "For the parent wells?", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "", "Tom Jorden", "I will say I don't have that in front of me. I can give you that if you want to call, I will say our model for parent well in that core area would be about 4.8 million cubic feet a day of wet gas. So, that would be not in the equivalent rate but actually a high btu gas stream, our model in that area will be just slightly under 5 million cubic feet a day that's what we would expect.", "For the particular two wells that were on those sections that were on those sections I don't have that in front of me. We didn't quite achieve that with our in-field but we really didn't expect to, I mean our model going forward we were looking for something 70% better than a parent well and we would call that encouragement and we certainly that encouragement.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay got it, so the 5.1 to 5.4 is equivalent volume.", "Tom Jorden", "That is the equivalent volume that includes the methane stream, the NGL volume and the wellhead condensate.", "Gil Yang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Ray Deacon with Pritchard Capital.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "", "Hey Tom I was wondering if you look at the Gulf Coast production and just kind of look a the sustainability of that area.", "Tom Jorden", "Ray I am sorry.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "Yes, I'll just get the telephone, oh sure.", "Tom Jorden", "We're apparently having some difficulties. Give us one minute and we'll try to dial in from a different phone. Well you hear us now?", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "You did that pretty quick, so but -- hey just one quick question, it was -- in terms of the Gulf Coast I guess people seemed concerned about potential declines there, if you I guess -- am I understanding right that you think you can keep production flat if you kind of drill average wells what you've seen historically through the end of the year, is that -- does that sound about right?", "Joe Albi", "Well, this Joe Albi. What all we can really go on is what we know as far as the existing wells and your productive capacity is are and what we've modeled for Q3 and Q4 is that the anticipated decline that we thought we'd see a year ago, we're not seeing it now and that's a combination of couple things. Pulling back our wells like we did in the Jefferson Airplane Complex, number one; and number two, we had a great good string of productive wells along the way. What I can tell you is that if we have success on that rig line that there's a pretty damn good chance that we keep the flattery and even increase it. That it all comes down to the wells that we ended drawn from here.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "Okay, got it. And can you -- I know it's early with the Bone Springs but I guess can you quantify what the rates return will look like for it's sort of a typical Permian well that you would drill since the all way 2000s I guess.", "Joe Albi", "Well, in rate -- of course I will say again Bone Spring is several different plays but for our second Bone Spring, third Bone Springs, horizontal oil program and Eddy, Lea County, we're typically looking at current oil pricing and we ran a forecast in the share pricing and then we look at downsize sensitivity, our share pricing is whatever the future prices, that they will make decision and then the downsize sensitivity is $45 NYMEX held flat forever, less local market deducts when you look at there's a local market will take the hit for that.", "We're typically looking at rates to return that are 50% or better for this horizontal wells that current oil pricing and then if that $45 flat, that's play is it's not a typical to be looking at flat pricing that's somewhere between 25 and 35% rate of returns. So, now I would like to that the return to that play but assuming it's also very important to us as it does have certain robustness to that downsize sensitivity if we saw collapse in oil prices.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "Got it. Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of [Ronny Iceman] with JPMorgan.", "[Ronny Iceman] - JPMorgan", "Good morning, guys. Back to the Cana, with going back to 13 stages and cutting back on the frac size, have you quantified what the impact is to the EURs, especially in the quarter?", "Joe Albi", "We think there's no impact. That's why we changed it, we've done a lot of science talk here and continue to do a lot of science and one of the things that we experimented with a shortening, I'm really getting into the weeds here but you ask the question and we have an answer.", "We are four clusters per stage and initially our clusters were about 80 feet apart so we had four of them per stage and stage was 353. We experimented with shortening that cluster spacing down the 50 feet and going with stages that were about 250 feet apart and that's how we were getting more stages in the lateral.", "We were just shortening the space between clusters and the idea was that each cluster will generate an independent hydraulic fracture and that we thought we could generate more of them without interfering with one another.", "The goal is you would like to put those things as close together as you can but there is a point where if the get too close together they interfere with one another. In other words, if you get too close, two cracks you are trying to open up we are actually closing one another because they are just too close.", "We went about shorter cluster spacing, we completed quite a few wells with it and didn't see any statistical uplift, didn't see really any benefit whatsoever and so it was more expensive, it was more operationally intensive to do that and we doubt that back. We would think that with our lighter treatment we will see no degradation in EUR.", "I know that sounds a bit lot but we have a lot of data for that we have a lot of data for that.", "[Ronny Iceman] - JPMorgan", "In the quarter what are you carrying right now as going forward in EUR?", "Joe Albi", "Well our type curve which is for a new drill is about 8.8 bcf of wet gas I don't want to say wet gas, I mean we have associated natural gas liquids that will come out of that stream and we have about 62000 barrels of oil and the first 30 day average of that well would be about 4.8 million cubic feet a day of a wet gas stream and of course that goes in the processing and if gets natural gas other than that.", "[Ronny Iceman] - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Hagen with Lazard Capital Market.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "Just a follow-up on Ronny's question on the Cana, now that you are going to be pumping smaller jobs in fewer frac stages, are we still going to see well costs around 7.1 to 7.5 or is it potentially going to go down a bit?", "Tom Jorden ", "", "Well we are seeing, this is Tom and Joe is going to comment on that as well the operations group proposed to Joe and said he keeps his finger on that pretty tightly. We are looking at from our standpoint in exploration to drill these wells little faster by not staring them as much. So, we certainly like to try to shave some days off but we are seeing some upward pressure in our stimulation cost.", "Joe Albi", "Yeah I would say a good safe range right now to use will be 7.5 to $8 million total and like Tom said a lot of the hinges are on how we directionally drill these, we could potentially cut some costs there and by going back to the 13 stages that has helped. It's by saving another 700 - $800,000 up the total stimulation cost.", "But again you got a lot of components going at the same time so we're trending water around 7.5 to 8 million.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "Okay great. Thank you. And then in the Avalon shale Tom, you said you had 100,000 acres. Is that a net or a gross you are talking about?", "Tom Jorden ", "That's a net number but again I wanted to give my standard caution that's acreage that I can probably on a math show how Avalon shale wells are been drilled and if I drew a big oval around that our acres sit inside that.", "We are still early days evaluating our level of interest in that play and so I would discourage you from taking that 100,000 acres dividing it by 8 per well number and extrapolating that because we don't that internally.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "", "Okay. Thanks Tom. Just can we do that math? What kind of spacing are you using currently in the Abo and Bone Springs?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Well, the Abo is really 168 per spacing and that's also true in our New Mexico Bone Spring. If you really held my feet to fire asked me to justify, should it really be 200 or should it really be 100, we haven't done a lot of work on that yet. But we're pretty solid at 160.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "", "Thanks. And then the Abo just to connect sort of completed the Permian, how much acreage you think you have there? I think you said about 40,000 and Bone Spring, and add something, but what about the Abo?", "Tom Jorden", "", "You know, the Abo, we have about 35,000 net and most of that is Cap Rock Township. Actually the number is 39,000. We're acquiring small interest here and there. I wish I could tell you that we had the potential to pick up a lot more acreage in that play, kind of geologically limited. It's probably never going to be three times of that.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "", "Okay. I am sorry. I had one more on the Third Bone Spring in West Texas. What's the rationale for just running one rig there is it? Or the wells less productive, is it more expensive or is kind of the?", "Tom Jorden", "", "We didn't lay leasing play there. This has been kind of a quite year for us but we attempted to flange up our position with leasing. That play has become much more competitive. There are some operators out there that had been not pursuing that play. They have a lot of acreage and they've now stepped up and drilling wells and making nice wells. That play is economically little tougher than others. We like the returns on that play. It looks very good. But that is deeper. It is more expensive drilling and so, if you looked at the return of that play, it's not as solid as some of the stuff over in New Mexico. That said, the play we generated internally, we really like it.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Market", "", "Great. Thanks a lot Tom. Thanks for all the details.", "Tom Jorden", "", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "At this time, there are no further questions. Are there further remarks?", "Mark Burford", "", "No. Thank you for joining us today everyone. We look forward to reporting to you for the results. Any follow-up questions, please give us a call.

My name is Sharona and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].", "", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor to your host, Mr. Mark Burford, Director of Capital Markets. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "", "Mark Burford - Director, Capital Markets", "", "Thank you very much Sharona and thank you everyone for joining us today for third quarter conference call. We did issue our earnings release this morning the copy of which can be found on our website, if you do not have that.", "", "We will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call, so I also refer you to the end of our press release, which discuss these forward-looking statements.", "", "And today here in Denver, we have Mick Merelli, our Chairman and CEO on the call. Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations: and Paul Korus, our Vice President and CFO as well as Jim Shonsey, our Vice President and Controller.", "", "With that we\u2019ll quite and get started right away and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mick Merelli.", "", "F. H. Merelli - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Good afternoon everybody and probably most of you it\u2019s afternoon. It\u2019s good morning here.", "", "We had a solid\u2026 a good quarter\u2026 a good solid quarter. We reported earning of $73 million and cash flow of $235 million. Our exploration and development capital in the third quarter was a little bit over $234 million. Regarding production, we are seeing improved production performance. Our third quarter production average is $448.5 million essentially $449 million was an increase $5.9 million over the second quarter of this.", "", "We are seeing good results from horizontal drilling programs in the Permian and we continue to like and see strong results from our Texas, Panhandle Granite Wash program. Our Permian and Mid-Continent regions are\u2026 production is growing. Sequentially, second quarter \u201907 to third quarter \u201907, production in these areas increased by 15 million cubic feet equivalent a day or about 5%. Again, a lot of that growth was a result of our horizontal oil drilling and well our horizontal oil drilling and gas to improve projects.", "", "Overall, Company growth and production was little bit of the negative mitigation there. That came from our Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast regions. They were down about 10 million cubic feet a day equivalent quarter-over-quarter. That you are going to here us later in the call some positive news out of both of those areas. Again, later in the call, Joe Albi will cover production in more detail.", "", "Regarding our drilling program, we expect our exploration and development cap to investment to be close to $1 billion, which is pretty much what we thought it would and it continues to be in that area. Nearly 80% is going towards our Mid-Continent Permian basin regions. Our overall after tax rate return\u2026 our return on our program is looking better this year than it did last year and part of that is that this year\u2019s moderate-risk drilling program, returns have not been squeezed as much by higher cost to drilling complete. We are seeing some reduction in those cost which oppose in those programs.", "", "We continue to constantly moderate our returns and we run up as you all those of you that have listened to us in the past, now we run flat case sensitivities and that\u2019s how we make our drilling decisions, and try to watch it as we go along. We have an active program with 31 rigs running. Where we are going to be next year? And I know some of you are kind of wondering that. That\u2019s going to depend on commodity prices, what\u2019s going to happen to those. We have a lot of gas opportunities, lot of oil opportunities. We are not sure what the year holds ahead for us in that regard. And of course, it depends on service cost and continued success in our\u2026 on our horizontal oil and gas place and expansion actually of those place.", "", "Tom Jorden and his teams are currently compelling their project inventories in preparing plans for next year. But again, we are going to be very flexible in our approach to activity and that\u2019s going to as usual depend on our returns. We did have some asset sales. We continue to evaluate our base property for assets that are non-core to trying to get done. So, far this year, we sold about $110 million of properties, which have either closed or we expect to close in the fourth quarter.", "", "As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we are continuing to work on our sale for Gulf of Mexico assets that\u2026 hopefully, by our next conference call, I can give you a little more detail on where we are at with all of that, but that\u2019s an active program that\u2019s going hit and probably I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, because we are negotiating with people as we speak. So that\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t talk about too much.", "", "With that, I think I am going to turn it over to Tom Jorden, and he can tell you little more about what\u2019s going on our drilling program.", "", "Thomas E. Jorden - Executive Vice President, Exploration", "", "Thank you, Mick. I am going to just walk through our exploration and development activity, our year-to-day results. Some of our region focus and some of our particular programs and then give a brief flavor what we are looking at accomplishing for the upcoming years.", "", "As Mick said, we are currently putting our plans together for the upcoming year and we\u2019ll be reviewing those over the next six weeks or so. But year-to-date, we have drilled 345 gross or 199 net well during the first nine months of this year, and we completed 92% of those as producers. Our exploration and development capital for the first nine months of the year is totaled $717 million. And as Mick mentioned, we are on track and expect our 2007 full year exploration development capital to be approximately $1 billion. We have 31 rigs running and I will cover those region-by-region.", "", "Let\u2019s start I would like to talk about our Mid-Continent region. In the Mid-Continent, we drilled 191 gross or 97 net wells during the first three quarters of 2007 and 96% of those wells were completed as producers. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $270 million and we expect the full year for the Mid-Continent region to be about $390 million. The bulk of that activity is in our Texas Panhandle Granite Wash program where we have drilled 70 gross or 51 net wells and completed a 100% of those as producers. So, that\u2019s a low risk repeatable program that we are very, very happy with. Notable wells that commenced production in the third quarter include our Wilson 217, we had a 90% working interest in that, that was a Morrow well that was currently 7.1 million a day. The DD Payne 3BH a horizontal Granite Wash well at 2.7 million a day, we had 50% of that. Hobart Ranch 67.18%, a 100% working interest at 2.1 MMcf a day. And the Europe 584 where we had 80% is at 2 MMcf a day. So, it\u2019s an ongoing project while we are high activity project there, we currently have six rigs running in the Texas Panhandle. We expect to average between 9 and 10 through the year 2008 and we have an outstanding team work in this area.", "", "We are very, very pleased with the progress our team is making, both in exploiting our existing assets, but also looking at some new opportunities and those opportunities are finding not only in land acquisitions, additional farming opportunities, joint ventures, but also technology. We have a very, very exciting pad drilling program underway. We are utilizing pad drilling for drilling horizontal wells and are able to more efficiently exploit our reservoirs not only from a reservoir management standpoint but a lot of Texas Panhandle is tough, inaccessible terrain and we are able to get wells drilled that wouldn\u2019t have been available to us otherwise. Out team is working to quickly evaluate and close on a $36 million acquisition that we expect to add over 60 drilling locations, the majority of which we think will be horizontal wells. That $36 million acquisition, we have slated 44 additional horizontal and 16 additional vertical locations and we think those will average about 2 Bcf per well for horizontal and maybe 1 Bcf per well for vertical so very action oriented, great team work in the Texas Panhandle and we are delighted with our results this year and we are looking at stepping it up significantly for 2008.", "", "We have also seen some good results in Anadarko basin and our Southern Oklahoma project where we drilled a total of 69 gross, 22 net wells completing 91% of them as producers. In Anadarko basin in Cattle County, we drilled the Barney 129 which is a 100% working interest well had a nice thick Red Fork section which commenced production at 4.9 million cubic feet a day and we are currently in discussions as to\u2026 it certainly will generate offsets and we are discussing how many offsets that will generate. Many of you have heard us talk in the past calls about our growing Woodford Shale presence. Not only we have a small presence in the Arkoma basin, but also the Anadarko Woodford Shale, there we are participating in two wells that are currently in the completion stage. One is operated by another company and second one we operate. We should have some completion information from both those wells here in the next month and will help us to significantly evaluate that play. It is an active area of leasing.", "", "In Southern Oklahoma and Garbin [ph] County the Harrell A9 where we had a 100% working interest came on production at 3.8 million a day. We had two rigs running in Southern Oklahoma and we have had some very, very nice results from that program this year. We have 12 operative rigs currently in aggregate in Mid-Continent region and as I said six are in Texas Panhandle and six are in Western and Southern Oklahoma.", "", "In the Permian Basin we have really found our rhythm this year. In pulling that asset together, we have got a great team working the Permian Basin. For the first nine months of 2007, they drilled 122 gross and 80 net wells, 92% were completed as producers and year-to-date our capital investment in the Permian has totaled $250 million. We expect the share in aggregate to spend $380 million in the Permian Basin. And that\u2019s split up into a number of significant plays to us. As Mick mentioned, we have some very, very nice horizontal drilling oil opportunities in the Permian Basin that our teams are getting after, has certainly contributed to the increase we reported in the oil production.", "", "Year-to-date, in Southeast New Mexico, we drilled 47 gross and 32 net wells with 89% of them being completed as producers. We had two major horizontal oil plays in Southeast New Mexico that we are quite excited about. One is on the area between Eddy and Chavez County and another is in Lake County. And we have an aggregate between three different projects I will talk about. We have 13 rigs running in the horizontal oil plays in the Permian Basin. Recent wells we brought on production in Southeast New Mexico include the Crow Flats 16 State 2H. We have 73% working interest in that well and it came onto 350 barrels of oil per day. The Homer State Com 1, a 100% working interest at $300 million a day and the State HH2 a 100% working interest well at $2.9 million a day. So, we are brining in wells online on a regular basis. It has been a nice manufacturing process out of the Permian.", "", "In West Texas we've drilled a total of 21 gross or 12 net wells of which 90% were successful. In Ward and Winkler counties, we have drilled 15 gross or 7 net horizontal wells in our third Bone Spring play that we talked about in recent conference calls. As a result of this program, our Bone Spring production in the area has increased from approximately 600 barrels of oil a day in early 2006 to nearly 5000 barrels of oil a day currently and it\u2019s growing. We have 16 operating rigs drilling in the Permian Basin and the bulk of those are proscading these horizontal oil plays. We are actively leasing, we are pursuing joint ventures, it\u2019s a growing program and we are looking for a significant ramp up in those programs in 2008. In the Gulf coast we drilled 32 gross or 23 net wells during the first nine months of 2007, completing 69% as producers.", "", "Year-to-date on shore Gulf Coast we have invested $145 million. We expect full year expenditures to be approximately $175 million. Current year Yegua/Cook mountain drilling in Liberty and Harton Counties has totaled 12 gross or 10 net wells with an 83% success rate. We have talked about that play continuously over the last few years. That\u2019s 3-D seismic driven, it\u2019s an amplitude versus offset fairly high technology play and we have had a great run there and we continue to be very, very pleased with the economic results that play has been turning. Wells we have recently commenced production include the Grammier 1 a 98% working interest well at 5.8 million cubic feet a day. Our Blackstone Rock Creek 1, a 100% working interest well at 5.6 million cubic feet a day and our Barbeaud 1 again a 100% working interest at 3.5 million cubic feet a day. So that\u2019s a very nice high working interest project for us. We have two operative rigs currently drilling well in the onshore Texas Gulf coast.", "", "So far so good, this year. We are very pleased with the results, we are looking at ramping it up and significantly increasing activity in some of our horizontal oil plays. Moreover we are currently pouring our plans for 2008 and we will be pulling those together and talk about them in our next quarterly conference call. With that I would like to turn the call over to our executive vice president of operations.", "", "Joseph R. Albi - Executive Vice President, Operations", "", "Thanks Tom. Excuse me. Mick mentioned it was a good quarter for us. In fact it was a pivotal quarter for us. Our increased drilling and exploitation activity lifted our total company production from levels of 441 to 442 million a day in the first half of the year to an average of 448.5 million a day for the third quarter. Late in the third quarter we saw a very nice production increase from the activity that Tom just described. Our accelerated Permian and Mid-Continent drilling activity and then some late quarter successes in our Gulf Coast program. And in fact it jumped our September productions to a level of 460 million a day. We anticipate continued production growth into Q4 which after counting for property sales we are projecting to fall in the range of 460 to 470 million a day. And that would equate to 4.5 to 6.5% increase to where we were in the fourth quarter of \u201906. So we are certainly seeing a reversal and hope to have a nice attractive growth rate when we are comparing exit rates \u201907 to \u201906.", "", "During Q3 Tom mentioned the 31 rig count presently but we increased our operative rig count by 25% from levels of 24-25 rigs to 30 to 32 rigs. Most of these were in the Permian and Mid-Continent and that accelerated activity continued to fuel production in growth that we had already had in those areas. Our third quarter Mid-Continent production of 194 million a day was up 6.6% from last quarter of the Permian jumped 2.1% from last quarter to an average of about 145 million a day. The impact of our Permian horizontal successes have also hit the score card when you look at our oil mix. In fact our Permian net oil production is up 18% from Q3 \u201906 to our current levels of 9600 barrels a day and in fact when you look at total company production mix we have gained 2.5 points approximately. percent of our total production as oil as compared to third quarter company wide\u2026 as compared to third quarter of \u201906.", "", "In the Gulf Coast with the sale of our Columbus assets we are down slightly in Q3 but with the late third quarter successes that Tom mentioned some of those in the fourth quarter. We anticipate Q4 to be back in the range of 70 to 72 million a day. Offshore once again we had weather delays and pipeline destructions through a portion of our production during Q3. We dropped from about 38 million in Q2 to 33 million in Q3. And although delayed by weather our main past hookup operation is ongoing and we hope to have 5 million a day on not as soon as tomorrow but certainly by mid November with an additional 15 to 20 million a day anticipated decline in late Q1 or early Q2 of \u201908. Of course however these volumes will hit the books if the sale of the field occurs prior to hookup. But even with the delays offshore and accounting for 2007 closed and anticipated\u2026 to be closed property sales we are projecting \u201907 to average in the range of 448 to 451 million a day although virtually flat to \u201906 we are very pleased. And we have reversed the production drops that we saw in \u201906 and projected in the year with a fourth quarter accel rate 5 to 6% higher than where we were last year.", "", "Touching on a couple of highlights of our exploitation program. We continue to be on track to meet our projected budget of 100 $150 million for the year. In fact at the end of September we already put a $100 million to work. We drilled 63 new wells, performed 190 significant work over re-completion projects. Most of these in the Mid-Continent and Permian areas. We continue to be active in nearly all of the core project areas we discussed with you guys before. In the Permian, the majority of our activity continues to be focused in the Westbrook field in West Texas. We drilled 33 wells to date performed 21 re-completions through September.", "", "We anticipate further development of the field and that development to extend through 2008 with continued drilling re-completion operations concentrating primarily on optimizing our flet conformance. We have accelerated our re-completion and deepening activity in our Walnut Bend field located just north of Dallas. Have seen some real nice re-completions come out of that higher than expectations. Through September we performed 23 re-completions, started on our deepening program and in fact the activity that we have done over the last 17 months has more than doubled the total production from about 700 barrels a day 17 months ago to current levels of 1450 barrels a day. We have got an inventory of higher quality projects that\u2019s in the range of 80 to 100 type number of projects and again here we see exploitation activity continuing well beyond 2008. In Panoma we drilled 25 wells, performed 21 workovers through September and for the most part completed most of our infield drilling.", "", "But we are now going to embark on the next phase of our exploitation activity and that\u2019s if you look at the numerous work over re-completion opportunities that we have in this 637 well field. Those guys won\u2019t be bored looking at that. In the third quarter we started to embark on accelerating our reserves in the Hugoton field. This is through the adoption of new field rules which allow for 3 take points per unit of chase and counts for growth intervals. With the new rules we have identified 48 projects on our operated properties. We performed a half a dozen or so of those with very good success and we suspected further evaluation work will lead to additional re-completion and inter drilling opportunities there. In Southern Oklahoma we shifted our focus to re-complete the lower oil Simpson sections of the numerous wells we have in three major fields and that make the wins. And early results are encouraging and I believe that this can provide additional growth as well into 2008.", "", "In the Texas Panhandle we are in the initial stages of what I think will be very successful Granite Wash re-completion program. We performed four projects today. We have got immediate inventory of 15 to 20 projects with numerous other wells in line behind those. And one reason for re-completion a 100%, working interest flowers [ph] 184 just came on at rates of 2 MMcf so that certainly can have an impact on our production. Also in the Texas Panhandle we made significant progress during the third quarter reacting very quickly and we are proud the production group for reacting as quick as they did to implement three saltwater disposal projects to help reduce some of the re-increases we have seen on the saltwater disposal side. The projects that are currently in place are reduced by 1.5 million a year, $1.5 million a year. Further activity that we have planned over the next few months should shade $1 million to $1.5 million of that ROE. So that could mean about $0.02 an Mcf reduction in ROE.", "", "Overall we continue to be encouraged as we dig deeper into the exploitation potential of our assets. We have a healthy inventory by days that seem to lead to another generation by days after we dig into it deeper. The projects are fueling new ideas for the future. We have been able to expand our groups to attack the projects and I get more faces looking at them. We find new projects. And importantly our look backs are confirming that \u201907 will once again be a very profitable year for the program. So that\u2019s all I have and with that I will turn it over to Paul.", "", "Paul Korus - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer", "", "Thank you, Joe. A couple of comments about our third quarter earnings as we have already mentioned our third quarter earnings totaled $73.2 million or $0.87 per share and that compares to the third quarter of last year when earnings were $94 million and $1.11 per share. And we want to point out as we described in our news release that the latest quarter had three unusual items that on a combined basis reduced our earnings by about net $0.02 per share. So ex-items we really look at it is about $0.89. And then last year we had items that boosted our earnings by a combined totaled of $0.18 per share. So, we just wanted to point those things out for you. We\u2019ve covered a lot about production just to recap for you, our production volume in 448.5 million equivalent a day did come in within our guidance of\u2026 which had 445 to 455. We were up 1% sequentially and also up versus a year ago. Those numbers may not sound that impressive to you but we are very excited about a couple of things. One, is that we had good timing and that our production, our oil production volumes were up 12.5% year-over-year and the second thing is as we look into the fourth quarter, we are forecasting that our production should average somewhere between 460 to 470 million equivalent per day which add a mid point of 465 would be a new all time record for the company. It will be up 3.5% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Our production volume has struggled over the last 18 months and obviously the first stage, a turn around is that things have to stop going down and will be getting going up and I think you can tell from the comments for Mick, Joe and Tom that we all certainly feel that we are at beginning stages of that.", "", "Just a few comments about our prices, our realized gas price before hedging this quarter was $6.4 versus Henry Hub average of $6.16 like many companies that have already reported we too had mirror work differentials in this case $0.12 per Mcfe pre-hedge versus the second quarter of $0.36 and the result of that is the reading for that is simply the result of a much tighter mid-continent versus Hendry Hub bases differential. In addition to that our gas price hedges netted us another $11.5 million of revenues, which equated to $0.39 per Mcf. So we reported a average gas price $6. 43. We already have October and November index prices in and looking at the forward curve for December and both mid-continent and NYMEX. We would expect that our pre-hedge differential for the fourth quarter would be about $0.80 and after hedge may be about $0.60 which we would have paid to by $6.75 reported price for us.", "", "Our oil price in the quarter average $71.63 versus an average WTI spot price $75.38, so if WTI were to average $90 or so in the fourth quarter, we would net about $86 and given that production\u2026 oil production is currently running a little over 21,000 barrel a day. I have to remind myself everyone throughout that\u2019s $1.8 million a day of revenue that we are getting from our oil production and just to remind everyone about our current hedge position through the fourth quarter, we have 80 million a day of mid-continent gas hedged that Mid-Continent floor of $7. So it does look as\u2026 well we did make money on those in October and November and we will see where December turns out. There is probably a few things that I should talk about, our expense guidance, we did up our production expense guidance.", "", "Our average for the third quarter was a $1.36 per Mcfe, which was up from $1.26 in the second quarter. Mostly, where we see cost increases is in saltwater disposal, electricity, fuel and compression costs, plus the fact that oil wells are inherently more expense to operate than gas wells but with the cost control measures that Joe has mentioned principally focused on saltwater disposal as well as more efficient pumping mechanisms. We think we should be within our guidance of $1.32 to $1.35 in the fourth quarter.", "", "The other item I think that needs mention is because we did increase our guidance on our combined DD&A and asset return obligation\u2026", "", "Question and Answer", "", "Operator", "", "Please go ahead.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "You all did such a great job was comments on the call. I actually don\u2019t have any questions but I want to congratulate you on having production growth starting to increase again.", "", "F.H.Merelli \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "", "Thank you very much.", "", "Thomas E. Jorden \u2013 Executive Vice President, Exploration", "", "Thank you.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay.", "", "Operator", "", "[Operator Instructions].", "", "And our next question is coming from Matt Stewart from [inaudible]. Please go ahead.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi good quarter, guys. Just had a quick question. I think you said it on the call but I missed it. Of the fourth quarter production, what\u2026 how much are you expecting coming from the newly held Gulf of Mexico assets?", "", "Thomas E. Jorden - Executive Vice President, Exploration", "", "An additional 5 million a day will probably come on, mid November. So we price incremental 2.5ish average for the quarter. That would be a safe estimate. Thank you to remind us. We sell the main pass area that doesn\u2019t show up if it closes before the hooker.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Right.

", "Here in Denver on the call we have Mick Merelli our Chairman and CEO, Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Joe Albi, Executive Vice President of Operations and Paul Korus, our Vice President and CFO and Jim Shonsey our Vice President and Controller.  And we\u2019ll go ahead and just jump right into the call today, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mick Merelli.", "Mick Merelli", "", "Thank you Mark, welcome everyone.  We had a good first quarter.  Earnings totaled $150 million, cash flow hit $335 million and our investment in E&D was $307 million.  We have an active drilling program and it as we\u2019ve advised previously looks like we\u2019re going to invest between $1.1 and $1.3 billion.  And it looks like we\u2019ll be able to cover that with our cash flow.", "On production, our first quarter production averaged $476 million cubic feet a day equivalent.  That\u2019s an increase of 5 million cubic feet a day equivalent over the fourth quarter of last year.  We grew sequentially even with property sales of 11 million cubic feet a day at the end of last year.", "Our rising production reflects our drilling program, we\u2019ve had a good drilling program so far this year.  We\u2019re seeing good results from our horizontal oil drilling programs in the Permian.  Oil production grew 3,000 barrels per day over last year\u2019s first quarter reaching an all time high for us of 22,756 barrels per day for this quarter.", "Gas volumes increased 16 million cubic feet a day over the first quarter of 07, reaching 340 million cubic feet a day in the first quarter of 2008.  This is largely the result of our Texas Panhandle and Yegua Cook Mountain drilling programs.  Permian and Mid-Continent production in the first quarter grew 45 million cubic feet a day equivalent or 14% over the first quarter of last year.", "Later in the call Joe Albi will cover our production in more detail.  As I mentioned earlier, we expect this year\u2019s exploration and development capital to be around $1.1-$1.3 billion.  This is a very active program.  The program is about 20% larger than last year\u2019s program.   So far, so good, we\u2019re very optimistic about our program, we see a good program for the rest of the year and so we\u2019re going to continue on.", "At this point I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Tom Jorden and he\u2019s going to tell you more about what\u2019s going on in our drilling program.  Tom.", "Tom Jorden", "", "Thank you Mick.  I\u2019m going to talk about our exploration development activity in the quarter and our outlook.  We\u2019re off to a fast start this year and truly a credit to our organization on both the exploration and production drilling completion side.  Everybody is really pitching in and getting a tremendous amount done.", "We drilled 126 gross and 76 net wells in the first quarter, completing 91% as producers.  We currently have 36 operator rigs running and another one rigging up so I count 36 plus 1 are 37.  Our first quarter capital investment totaled $307 million.  As Mick mentioned, we still expect our full year 2008 exploration and development capital to be in the range of $1.1 to $1.3 billion.", "As I\u2019ve said, we have a very active program and with our current level of activity we\u2019d expect to be at the upper end of that range.  So a lot of projects, a lot of activity and we\u2019re pleased to report some good results.  Now I\u2019ll cover our program by region.", "In our Mid-Continent region which includes Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, our first quarter 2008 drilling totaled 70 gross or 34 net wells completed 95% as producers.  In the first quarter our capital spending totaled $132 million or 43% of our total capital, that\u2019s in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.", "In the Texas Panhandle granite wash, our drilling totaled 29 gross or 21 net wells with 100% of those completed as producers.  Texas Panhandle drilling made up 58% of that total Mid-Continent capital.  We bring wells on all the time but we always like to note a few of our recent ones.  ", "Wells commencing production in the first quarter included our Courson Ranch 4-13 were we had a 35% working interest and that came on at 3.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, our Flowers 61-22, we had 100% of that, came on at 2.3 million cubic feet a day, our Hobart Ranch 27-68 where we had 100% working interest came on at 1.9 million cubic feet equivalent a day and our Earp 58 5H horizontal well where had a 35% working interest, it came online at 3.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day.", "So a very active ongoing program, we\u2019re brining wells on continuously there.  In the Anadarko Basin in Southern Oklahoma we drilled a total of 31 gross and 11 net wells with 90% of those being completed as producers.  In the Anadarko Basin, we have 5 horizontal wells in the Woodford Shale that are currently producing, that\u2019s our deep Woodford Shale play that we talked about in the past.  ", "So we currently have 5 producing wells, 2 that are at various stages of completion.  We have including the one that we\u2019re currently rigging up, we have 3 operated rigs running and we\u2019ll soon be going to a 4 rig operated program in the Anadarko Basin Woodford Shale.", "These are 13,000 feet deep wells.  We\u2019re currently drilling 2,500 foot lateral links on these horizontals.  They\u2019re expensive wells.  Based on our current configuration, we\u2019re in the neighborhood of $7 million completed well cost for a 2,500 foot horizontal lateral.  We\u2019re evaluating the effect of longer laterals with more frac stages.  Some of our upcoming wells will be longer laterals going to 4,000 feet of horizontal section and that will involve additional frac stages.  It will also be a more expensive well.", "Based upon what we know right now, we\u2019re very optimistic about our chances of moving this into an active development area which would be a very good contributor for our results.  We\u2019re moving one additional rig in now that\u2019s rigging up as I said which will bring us to 3 operated rigs.  We have a fourth rig scheduled to come in this summer so we should here very soon have 4 operated rigs in that Woodford Shale play.", "That brings us to 15 operated rigs currently drilling in the Mid-Continent region, including 9 in the Texas Panhandle and the one that\u2019s rigging up.  In the Permian Basin our first quarter 2008 drilling program totaled 50 gross or 37 net wells, 96% of which were completed as producers.", "First quarter capital spending totaled $120 million or 40% of our total spending, so we have a very, very active Permian Basin program, we\u2019ve been very pleased with our results there.  In Southeast New Mexico in the first quarter 2008, we drilled a total of 27 gross or 17 net wells with 93% of those being completed as producers.", "Recent wells that we\u2019ve brought on production in Southeast New Mexico included our Bierstadt 12 Fee 4H horizontal oil well, we had 100% working interest to that and it came on at 300 barrels per day, our Crow Flats 16 State 3H where we have a 62% working interest came on at 550 barrels of oil per day, our Maroon 24 Fee 1H where we had 100% working interest came on at 250 barrels of oil per day and our White City 10 Federal 2 where we had 100% working interest came on at 1 million cubic feet a day.", "So as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we have some very active horizontal oil plays that are coming to fruition.  We\u2019re very pleased with our progress and are continually developing new plays in addition to those that we\u2019re reporting.", "We have a total of 23 gross, 19 net wells that were drilled in West Texas of which 100% were completed as producers.  Our Third Bone Spring program has continued to realize great results.  In Ward and Reeves County, drilling totaled 4 gross 3 net horizontal wells in the Third Bone Spring formation.", "Recent wells that we brought on production in the Third Bone Spring include our Cimarex University 18-31 1H, 100% working interest that came on at 400 barrels per day, our Cimarex University 18-38 2H, 100% working interest came on at 360 barrels of oil per day, our Cimarex University 20-43 1H, 100% working interest came on at 250 barrels of oil per day and our Fortson 47-1H where we had a 35% working interest came on at 700 barrels of oil per day.", "So just like in New Mexico, we had some very nice horizontal oil projects, high working interest and some very nice initial results.  We have 16 operated rigs drilling in the Permian Basin including 7 in Southeast New Mexico and 9 in West Texas.  So a very nice active Permian Basin program, our Permian region base in Midland has done a great job of getting that program fired up and accelerating into the first quarter of 2008.", "In the Gulf Coast, onshore we drilled 6 gross, 4 net Gulf Coat wells in 2008 first quarter.  We completed 83% of those as producers.  Our first quarter capital spending totaled $50 million or 16% of our total spending.  The majority of this activity has been in our Yegua Cook Mountain program in Liberty and Hardin Counties, Texas.", "Drilling in the first quarter totaled 3 gross or 2.4 net wells with a 100% success rate.  This has been a great program for many years, you\u2019ve heard us talk about this in past calls and it\u2019s been a great program again this year.  We also have a very deep inventory.  In fact as we look at our program today, we have as deep an inventory as we\u2019ve ever had and we brought on some very nice wells so far this year. ", "These include our Leonora well where we had a 70% working interest, it came on at 10.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, that\u2019s 5.6 million cubic feet of gas and 780 barrels per day of oil.  Our Pic Realty Corporation where we have a 72% working interest recently came online at 17.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day, that\u2019s 11.9 million cubic feet a day of gas and 950 barrels per day of oil.", "So a very, very nice start to our Gulf Coast program.  We have 5 operated rigs drilling on the onshore Gulf Cost, 4 in Texas and 1 in Mississippi.  We\u2019re also actively shooting addition 3D data out there, we\u2019re looking to grow that program both through new shooting and the acquisition of additional shelf data.  So a very nice growing program for us, as I said our inventory on that project remains as deep today as it\u2019s ever been.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "", "Joe Albi", "", "Thanks Tom.  Well we\u2019re extremely pleased with where production ended up here in Q1 and it\u2019s a direct result of accelerated activity and the successes in both our exploitation and exploration programs.  Our rig count has increased from 23 rigs a year ago to the 36 rigs that we reported in our operations update and we\u2019re seeing the impact directly on our production.", "We had a great quarter.  Despite selling 11 million a day of production at the end of December, our reported volumes of 476 million a day for Q1 exceeded our fourth quarter of 07 volumes of 471 million a day and beat our Q1 guidance of 458 to 468 million a day by a healthy margin.  ", "The quarter\u2019s production also continued a trend in production growth for the total company as compared to first quarter 07 volumes of 442 million a day, our first quarter 08 total company volumes were up 8%.  More importantly, we\u2019ve also seen good double digit production growth in each of our core operating areas.", "As compared to Q1, our first quarter 08 volumes were up 15% in the Permian, 13% in the Mid-Continent and 12% in the Gulf Coast.  As Mick mentioned, the successes of our horizontal oil programs in the Permian continue to increase our total company oil production.  First quarter 08 net volumes of 22,757 barrels a day represent a 16% increase to first quarter 07 volumes of 19,552 barrels a day.", "That said, we also have seen volume increases on the gas side.  Our first quarter volumes of 340 million a day are up 5% from a level of 324 million a day in the first quarter of 07.  Each of the drivers in our core operating areas are contributing to our production growth.: our horizontal well oil programs in the Permian, our vertical and horizontal granite wash program in the Texas Panhandle and our South Texas and Liberty County programs in the Gulf Coast.", "Our exploitation activities have also had a positive impact on production.  At the end of March, our exploitation efforts added approximately 13 million a day of new production.  With our rig count and exploitation activity on solid footing, we\u2019ve bumped our production guidance up for the remainder of the year.  ", "For second quarter we\u2019re projecting another increase in quarterly production with guidance of 478 to 488 million a day.  Our hopes are to end the quarter in the higher end of the range, but we\u2019re being a bit cautious due to seeing a few recent shut ins relating to plant and or pipeline maintenance and repairs.", "Also with a good solid first quarter behind us, we\u2019re increasing our full year guidance to 475 to 495 million a day, up from our initial estimate of 465 to 485 million a day.  Again, we\u2019re hopeful to fall in the upper end of the range, but need to have a few more new wells under our belt before we feel comfortable increasing guidance any further.", "Accounting for 2007 sales, our new guidance represents a very respectable 8-12% increase in production from 2007.  I want to mention a few words on our exploitation program.  At the beginning of the year our production group put together a fairly ambitious plan for exploitation activities, inventory in $175-$200 million in projects.  ", "We\u2019ve maintained a more deliberate approach to our exploitation activity in the first quarter, putting $32 million to work during the quarter.  It now appears we may fall in the range of $125-$150 million for the year.  Having said that, our current program has met all of our expectations with regard to production add and project economics.  ", "Of the 463 projects originally identified in our 08 exploitation plan, we\u2019ve completed 104 of them at the end of the first quarter, 24 new drills and 80 recompletion and or work over projects, the majority of our exploitation drilling activity occurring in our Southwest Westbrook field in the Permian Basin where we drilled 23 new wells and performed 9 recompletions", "With an identified remaining inventory of more than 30 new wells and more than 40 recompletion projects, our near term objective for the field is to focus on optimizing the conformance of the flood.  In addition to Westbrook, we have numerous other drilling and recompletion projects identified throughout New Mexico and West Texas in the Permian.", "In the Mid-Continent area, we performed 20 recompletion projects in Q1, most of which were in our Walnut Bend field, located just North of Dallas.  We\u2019ve maintained a very healthy pace of activity in Walnut Bend, keeping us on track to meet our 08 plan, which called for 36 work overs, 6 deepenings, 4 new drills and 33 injection projects.", "We expect our exploitation activity in the Mid-Continent to pick up steam starting here in the second quarter.  As of the early part of April, a total of 91 projects had been approved or were in various stages of completion.  Here at the first part of May we\u2019ve got 198 AFE projects now in the cycle.", "A good percentage of the work was not only associated with Walnut Bend but various other recompletion and artificial lift projects through Southern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.  In the Kansas Panoma area we completed 32 of the 131 projects we had identified for 2008.  All of our Q1 activity in this area was concentrated on recompletion work over re-stem and artificial lift projects in both areas.", "However, in the second quarter we\u2019ll initiative the beginning of our 20 well drilling program which was planned for 08, the majority of which are going to be wells that are located in or around the Kansas Hugoton area.", "In addition to our drilling, recompletion, work over and various other exploitation projects, our production group has continued its efforts to lower LOE via projects like saltwater disposal, compressor optimization, chemical programs, lift design and since the fourth quarter of last year, saltwater disposal projects performed in just the Texas Panhandle and West Texas alone will save us about $8-$9 million a year in LOE.", "In a nutshell, our production group has done a great job to get our exploitation program off to another good start and we expect to continue a very healthy pace of activity for the remainder of 08 and then to continue into 2009.", "Just a couple comments on what we\u2019re seeing in the market before I turn the call over to Paul.  Our rig rates have stayed fairly well in check over the last year, hovering around an average of about 18,000 a day.  Keep in mind that about two-thirds of our rig fleet is now running with top drives which have bumped day rates about 3,000-5,000 a day.", "Although we see the market tightening up a bit, the continue demand for new builds seems to be keeping rates in check.  Steel costs, however, are on the uptick due to a run up in material and shipping costs as well as a weakness in the dollar, we\u2019ve seen more than a 50% increase in market price for pipes since January and we\u2019re hopeful the market will correct itself by the third or fourth quarter.", "Nevertheless, we are well positioned with an inventory of pipe and have allied ourselves with various suppliers to guarantee allocated deliveries to keep up with our inventory of projects.  While steel is going up, we\u2019ve seen a fairly sizable decrease in stimulation costs over the last year.  The majority of our fracs are slip water jobs which due to competition have come down in price by a factor of two over the last 12 months.", "So all in all while drilling and completion costs are staying somewhat in check, even with the pressures we\u2019re seeing in the steel market.  Nonetheless, day to day, to ensure our chances of success for economic investment, we\u2019re constantly incorporating current market conditions into the cost estimates we use as we move the program forward.", "So with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul.", "Paul Korus", "", "Thank you Joe.  I guess kind of in the current political environment in the oil and gas company doesn\u2019t want to talk too much about record revenues, earnings and cash flow, but yet we are seeing them and of course if oil continues to trade in the $110-$120 range and natural gas prices north of $10.00, as we look to the second quarter and remaining quarters it\u2019s a little bit like you aint seen nothing yet.", "But nonetheless we did have very good earnings and cash flow in the first quarter.  $150 million of earnings which was 2.3 times what we earned in the first quarter of 2007.  Similarly the so called non-GAAP measure of after tax cash flow from operations was $335 million or 55% higher than what we were seeing a year ago.", "If you divide those cash flows by units produced, we were bringing home $7.72 per Mcfe on cash flow versus $5.42 a year earlier.  Revenues, earnings and cash flow obviously befitted from strikingly higher oil and gas price realizations and as you know we are very lightly hedged on gas and completely un-hedge on oil.", "Our first quarter 2008 gas price was $8.38 which was up 25%.  More importantly though, our oil price increased a whopping 71% to $94.38 from what seemed high a year ago, $55.22.  In the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve beat the analyst estimates of our earnings and despite that fact that we pre-release our production volumes and give some near term guidance on prices as well.", "But like the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year we benefit from the tightness in the natural gas liquids market which gets translated to a higher realized gas price for us and I think that\u2019s largely the difference between what you see for our reported earnings and analyst estimates because we\u2019re not trying to do that on purpose, we think there\u2019s value added from estimates being closer to actuals.", "Nonetheless our pre-hedging gas price for this quarter was $8.35 which was $0.32 higher than the average Henry Hub price of $8.03 for the quarter.  In the first quarter of 2007, our overall gas price was $0.22 below Henry Hub.  These differences are despite the fact that Permian Basin and Mid-Continent gas index pricing was $0.73-$0.88 respectively below Henry Hub in the first quarter of this year.", "And last year, those indexes were about $0.45 below Henry Hub.  So that clearly illustrates the impact that the NGL prices are having on our gas price realizations.  We\u2019ve covered production quite a bit already, so I don\u2019t want to say too much other than that you should note that we had some nice Gulf Coast wells which clearly offset the decline in Gulf of Mexico production that we had after we sold our main pass properties last year.", "So with our full year guidance being raised 10 million a day on both the bottom part of the range and the top end of the range to 475-495, you may ask, why keep a bottom range that is below our current rate of around 480 or so?  The short answer is to allow for the uncertainties that some of which Joe mentioned with pipeline capacity limitations, but we\u2019re also entering the time of year where we see hurricanes, bad storms on shore, refinery outages, things like that.", "Now we can\u2019t predict that any of those events will occur but our experience tells us that they may and often do.  So that\u2019s why you continue to see a fairly light number on the bottom part of our range.  I think the rest of the numbers in our release and our guidance for cost structure are pretty clear. ", "The only confusing point may be our G&A in the first quarter coming in at $11.6 million below guidance.  We expect that to go back to $13 million a quarter or so.  We had some accounting adjustments that resulted in about $1 million flip from G&A to production costs in the first quarter, so I think you can clearly rely on our guidance for the rest of the year.", "The thing we don\u2019t provide in our guidance and cost structure in income taxes.  We are at about a 36.5% rate for those who model cash flow.  You do have to decide how much you think we\u2019ll defer versus how much we\u2019ll be current.  In the first quarter about 34% of our taxes were current, 66% or so deferred.  As we look ahead with higher prices than we\u2019ve received in the first quarter, if the markets do hold and of course that\u2019s always a question that everyone has to decide for themselves when they make forecasts.  ", "But if we remain in that $110 range for oil and $10 gas range, so if you do a mark to market on pricing, all the sudden you see for Cimarex our taxable income being well north of $1 billion on a book basis.  In which case, we\u2019d probably be deferring only about half or 50% of our tax provision.  We\u2019d owe the government about $200 million.", "So for those of you that model our future cash flow, I just want to make sure that you\u2019re not surprised that if you\u2019re using something close to current market prices, you should probably assume that about 50% of our taxes will be current.  If you\u2019re using what seems to be more along the lines of consensus analyst estimates of $8-$9 and $80-$90 oil, then you\u2019re probably safer to use something around 40% current.", "That\u2019s enough on the numbers, so operator we are ready to entertain questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions)  Our first question comes from Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "First on the Woodford Shale, can you give us a little bit of details regarding what the program is going to shape up for this year in terms of the number of wells that are going to be drilled or that could be drilled?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Of course it depends on rig rate, the number of rigs we have deployed, what we\u2019re going for this summer, we have 5 down in the program.", "Mick Merelli", "", "It\u2019s still an emerging play and obviously we\u2019ve got some level of positive result on it but we don\u2019t have our arms around it yet, so we\u2019re optimistically moving ahead with some more rigs and I think based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, but we\u2019re a long ways away from really understanding what the overall economics and of course we\u2019re poised to increase our activity there.", "Tom Jorden", "", "We\u2019re always going to say contingent, contingent, contingent.  There\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know here in the play.  We\u2019ve had initial encouragement and I think we could easily get somewhere between 20 and 30 wells done this year depending on rig availability and operational constraints.  Right now we\u2019re in the very early stages.  So we would accelerate or throttle back pending new information.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "So you have 5 wells drilled right now?", "Tom Jorden", "", "We have 5 wells producing and 2 wells currently in various stages of completion.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "On the well cost, the $7 million, since it\u2019s early, do you think you can shave that down some as you go forward and go into market with development mode?", "Tom Jorden", "", "I\u2019m explorations so my answer is yes we\u2019d like to get cost down.  The drilling guys stand up and say wait a minute, we\u2019re under a lot of cost pressures, I mean they\u2019ve done a great job thus far.  Our completion costs are reasonable but as Joe mentioned, our tubulars are putting some pressure on us.  So we are not modeling a cost savings going forward.  ", "When we\u2019re looking at our economic models we\u2019re projecting out with current costs.  But I can tell you in every play we\u2019ve given our drilling completion guys a program, they\u2019ve found ways to optimize.  So we\u2019re optimistic.", "Joe Albi", "", "We saw this happened own in the Warwink area in West Texas.  When we get an opportunity to put a program together it allows us to assimilate various cost efficiencies such as pad drilling or dual horizontals, finding ways that we can stimulate multiple wells on the same day and if we can get a program going here it\u2019s obviously our focus to trim the cost because that has a very positive impact on our economics.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "What\u2019s the breakout between drilling costs versus the completion cost of those wells?", "Joe Albi", "", "It\u2019s close to 50/50 if you include the tubulars and such.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "Looking at the overall program obviously you continue to have success, you\u2019re seeing a ramp up on the production side of things.  It\u2019s kind of early but are we looking at reserve adds for this year?  How are you feeling about that just in terms of what you\u2019re going to be able to add, F&D costs and then is there going to be any different in the way you book reserves and increase in PUDs at all this year?", "Paul Korus", "", "The way we\u2019ve addressed those things in the past, we don\u2019t comment on F&D costs until we report them at the end of the year.  We don\u2019t make projections about future additions to proved reserves and we\u2019re unlikely to change our spots in the way we book proven undeveloped reserves and you will not hear us talk about probables, possibles, un-booked potential and other things like that.", "Operator", "", "There appear to be no further questions.", "Mark Burford", "", "Thank you Barbara, thank you everyone for joining us today, we\u2019re off to a good start in our first quarter reporting here and continue to look forward to updating you throughout the year on some of these plays that we have going and look again forward to talking to you.

My name is Brei and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Energy second quarter 2008 earnings and operating conference call. All lines are placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator instructions) It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mark Burford. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "", "Thank you, Brei. Thank you very much for joining us today everyone at Cimarex second quarter earnings conference call. We did issue our press release this morning. Copies can be found on our websites and we'll be making forward-looking statements on today's call and I'll refer to the end of our press release which does have some language regarding forward-looking statements. In today's call, we have Mick Merelli, Chairman and CEO; Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration; Joe Albi, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Paul Korus, Vice President and CFO; and James Shonsey, our Vice President and Controller.", "Mick will be making some opening comments on the same quarter results and where we're going second half of the year. Tom will provide some details on drilling program in each of our core operating areas, and Joe will cover our production and exploration programs, and Paul will comment on the financials. We'll go ahead and get going and jump right in. I turn the call over to Mick Merelli.", "Mick Merelli", "", "Thank you. Good morning to those of you to our West and East. It's noon here \u2013 11 o'clock here in Denver. Thanks for joining us on today's call. We're very pleased to announce record quarterly financial results. Second quarter earnings, totaled $229 million, or $2.68 per share, bringing our year-to-date earnings to $379 million, or $4.44 per share. It is interesting that we've earned more in the first half of 2008, than we did in all of 2007, and 2007 was a pretty good year.", "Our results benefited from higher commodity price and some nice production gains. Our average realized price this quarter was $10.57 per MCF for gas, and $121.64 per barrel for oil. We grew our production to an all-time high of 488 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the second quarter of this year, and that's a 10% increase over last year's second quarter.", "For the first half of 2008, our exploration and development investment totaled $667 million. For the full year of 2008, we expect to invest $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion on exploration and development activities. We continue to build our acreage position where we see potential for good returns, and we're realizing very good results in all of our programs.", "We continue to expand our drilling activity particularly in the Permian and Mid-continent areas. This is a very active drilling program, from a capital standpoint where we all spend something like 40% more this year, than we did last year. So far, this year, our program for generating good rates of returned.", "Looking at the second half of '08, and further, we'll continue to expand our drilling and future opportunities in multiple place. We have a portfolio of horizontal drilling in the Texas Panhandle, Anadarko, Arkoma, Permian, and then Permian Basin. And we also have an extensive 3D conventional drilling program in the Gulf Coast. We continue to grow this inventory and our organization is structured to develop grassroots opportunities. We expect this year to spend something in the range of $150 million to $200 million on acreage and seismic and may wind up being more than that.", "We're well positioned as we've ever been and we expect continued growth in drilling activity and inventory. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to cover the detail of our drilling program.", "Tom Jorden", "Thank you, Mick. This is Tom Jorden and I'm going to walk you through our exploration and development activity for the second quarter.", "So far this year, we drilled 252 grows [ph], or a 158 net wells completing 94% of those as producers. So most of our program is at moderate risk repeatable project driven drilling.", "Exploration and Development. Capital investment for the first half of 2008 totaled $667 million and we're looking for a more active second half than we did at first half. Our full-year 2008 exploration development capital was projected at approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and we have increased our guidance for this capital. Previously, we've described our capital to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, so we've raised our guidance and that's always a moving target depending on our project availability, depending on the prevailing price, depending on the rig availability. But this is the time of year when we're doing \u2013 or focusing for the second half and we do expect a more active second-half than our first-half, so we ought to be in that $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range.", "The update of the range reflects the culmination of higher activity in our Permian and mid-continent drilling programs and some price inflation. We were running approximately 36 operated rigs when we reported our first quarter results and we've increased to 39 operated rigs currently. So we've got very active program going and it's a lot of fun to see our various regions having a good year getting after \u2013 bearing some of the successes for some of the projects we put in place the last couple of years. And now I'll cover our drilling program region by region starting with the Mid-continent.", "Our first-half 2008 drilling totaled 133 gross or 73 net wells, and we completed 98% of those as producers. Our first-half Mid-continent capital totaled $295 million, or 44% of our total expenditures. And the Mid-continent, as we define it, is a combination of our Western and Southern Oklahoma and our Texas Panhandled projects. In our Texas Panhandle or granite wash drilling totaled 61 gross, or 45 net wells, with 100% of those completed as producers. Now we're always bringing on wells in the course of business, but some notable wells commencing production the second quarter included our Killbrew 218-4 well on the Texas Panhandle, where we had 100% working interest, came on in 5.3 million cubic feet a day. The Earp 6010H horizontal well, 100% working interest, came on at 4.6 million cubic feet a day. The Issex [ph] 17 horizontal, 100% working interest came on at 3.2 million cubic feet equivalent a day. And the Campbell 538 horizontal well, again 100% working interest, came on at 3.1 million cubic feet equivalent a day.", "So, those numbers kind of show you a couple of things. One is we're increasing our emphasis on horizontal drilling. We have a nice program that continues to grow there. And second, our work interest resides [ph] there. Nothing is more efficient for use in organization having a high working interest in our projects. We're continuing to see good returns on this great program. We have growing opportunity and that's thanks to team work in the area, with a very aggressive technical and land staff working on our panhandle and they are doing an excellent job building our program.", "And, in the Anadarko Basin, the Arkoma Basin in Southern Oklahoma, our drilling a totaled of 72 grows and 28 net wells, with 96% of those being completed as producers. And in the Anadarko Basin, 11 horizontal wells have now been drilled in the Woodford Shale play. Those are wells that we have participated in. The wells are in various stages of completion. Evaluation of those 11, 10 of those are currently producing and one is being completed. We have four operated rigs currently drilling in the horizontal Anadarko Woodford.", "We're still leasing acreage. We're trying to increase with our current 34,000 net acre possession. But until we've determined that we're not able to lease, we're going to be a little cagey on giving details about that program. Obviously, with four rigs running, we think it's meeting an economic threshold for us, but we're just not to the point yet where we are prepared to give details. I will say the jury is still out on well cost and performance and it's a very active focus area of ours.", "Otherwise in Oklahoma, we have brought on some good wells and production rates from those notable wells \u2013 vertical wells in Oklahoma, include the Toelle 247, where we had a 63% working interest came on at 12 million cubic feet equivalent data, that was the vertical Atoka well. The Fox 113, where we had a 43% working interest, came on at 5.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day. So we have 16 operator rigs, in our mid-con and region and of those 16, that's 9 new Texas Panhandle and 7 in Oklahoma, and very, very active program for us.", "Moving on to the Permian Basin, our first half 2008 drilling totaled 97 gross and 69 net wells, 97% of those were completed as producers. In the first half of the Permian, we invested $255 million, or 38% of our total expenditures. Permian continues to be just a great arena for us, you know, by and large, these are properties that we acquired through the Magnum Hunter acquisition 2005. It's been a great 2007 and 2008 for that project. Our group in Midland, Denver, and Dallas has really stepped up to the plate to bring new projects online.", "In Southeastern Mexico, for first half 2008 drilling, mainly targeting the Morrow and Wolfcamp formations, we drilled 49 gross and 33 net wells with 94% of those being completed as producers. Recent horizontal Wolfcamp wells, brought on production, include our drumstick 7 Federal 1-H horizontal well where we had 50% working interest, came on at 325 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our County Line Federal 1-H horizontal well, 55% working interest, came online at 225 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And our Cave Lake 24 Federal 3-H horizontal well where we had a 62% working interest, came online at 190 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we have an ongoing horizontal program there that's bringing on some very, very nice oil rates.", "We also have a strong Morrow well come on in the quarter. The White City 31 Fed 4 in Southeast in Mexico where we have a 100% working interest, commenced production averaging 5.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Moving over to West Texas, also in our Permian region, we drill a total of 48 gross or 36 net wells in the first half, of which, 100% were completed as producers. Our Third Bone Spring horizontal oil drilling totaled 10 gross or 9 net wells, and we have 9 rigs working here in the Third Bone Spring place. That's a very, very active play for us. We've talked about that in the past and will continue in the future. Of those nine wells, six are drilling horizontal laterals and three are drilling the vertical hole. The way we prosecute that play, we have a big rigs that drill the vertical hole and then we come in behind that with a smaller rig drill the lateral. So we have six horizontal and three vertical wells operating and in play for a total of nine.", "So recent Bone Spring wells that were brought on production include the Cimarex University 18-41 B1 horizontal well, 100% working interest that came on at 670 barrels of oil equivalent a day; the Monroe Estate 1H horizontal well, again, 100% working interest came out at 450 barrels of oil per day; and the Warwink University 18-26 A 2H were we have a 37.5% working interest, came out at 380 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have 19 operated rigs drilling at Permian Basin and that's 9 in Southeast in Mexico and 10 in the West Texas. So, as we move on to the Gulf Coast, and I leave the Mid-Continent and Permian, I just want to make a comment that we're seeing the fruits of some of the project drilling we've discussed in the past. A number of these are horizontal plays. These projects have legs that will be on going for years to come and we're just very, very pleased with not only of our economic results but the way our teams have gotten after it both geology engineering, land. Getting these things prosecuted and get in the mood [ph] ahead.", "In the Gulf Coast, we drilled 19 gross or 15 net wells in the first half of 2008 and we completed 58% of those as producers. Most productivity occurred in South Texas which includes the Texas Coast \u2013 Southern Texas Coast, really, over into Liberty county, southeast part of the state. There are \u2013 we have Yegua/Cook Mountain joint program. This year we drilled a total of 11 gross or 9 net Yegua/Cook Mountain wells with a 55% success rate. We have four rigs drilling in the Yegua/Cook Mountain trend and we're on track to drill 25 wells here in '08. That's up from 19 in '07. So, the Yegua/Cook Mountain continues to be a very, very nice play for us. In terms of just pure profitability, it's our most profitable play. We've recently shot and processed some new 3D data. We're drilling on a program that we shot late last year and we just have a 3D seismic program that the tape just came off the field couple of weeks ago and we hope to be drilling on that shortly.", "Recent wells commencing production include the Jack Knife Number 1, where we have 70% working interest came online at 4.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day and the Clubb West 2, where we have 70% working interest, came online at 3.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That play, the Yegua/Cook Mountain play, continues to expand. We're \u2013 and now we're shooting additional data but we're looking to expand those \u2013 that trend going both East and West.", "So, in conclusion, we're in the middle of a great drilling program this year. We have a growing opportunity set, and we're really thrilled to be putting some production growth to evidence of the results that we're seeing. So with that, I will turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Joe Albi", "Thanks. Thanks, Tom. Q2 '08 was very good to us from a production standpoint, with reported production of 448.4 million a day, we exceeded the top end of our guidance, and have now logged, excuse me, advanced 488. I'm sorry, 488.4, I was going to say, \u201cHoly Cow. What happened?\u201d 488.4. We've exceeded the top end of our guidance. And we've logged our fifth consecutive quarter of production growth and this, despite us selling a good number of properties here in 2007.", "Our second quarter production sets a new record for the company and it represents a 2.5% increase from our first quarter average of 476.2 million a day, and 10.3% increase from our Q2 '07 average of 442.6 million a day.", "Our production gains, and Tom just hit on this, tied directly to our activity. In the second quarter of '07, we're running 22 to 24 operated rigs. In Q2 '08, we're running 37 to 39, that's more than the 50% increase. The result? Well, it simply increases in both our oil and gas production. Our average net daily oil production has jumped 13% from 19,800 barrels a day in Q2 '07 to 22,471 barrels a day during Q2 '08, while our average net daily gas production has increased 9%, from 324 million a day in the second quarter of '07 to 354 million a day during Q2 '08, and that is a record for the company.", "We continue to see double digit production growth in each of the core areas of activity. As compared to the second quarter of '07, our Q2 '08 equivalent daily production increased 20% in the Mid-Continent, 15% in the Permian, and 12% in the Gulf Coast.", "Our Texas Panhandle program is a driver behind the 20% increase we've seen in the Mid-Continent area over the last year. At the end of Q2, we had 16 worth rigs working in the Mid-Continent area; 7 in Oklahoma, with 4 focused on the wood produce Tom mentioned, and 9 in the Texas Panhandle with 5 of those working up horizontal Granite Wash program. Together, this increased activity just rig count alone, boosted our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent production to 219 million a day, which is a record for the company for the region.", "Our increase in company oil production is primarily driven by our horizontal oil activity in the Permian Basin. Those plays have increased our Permian oil production 35% from 9,163 barrels a day in Q2 '07, to 12,399 barrels a day in Q2 '08. Total equivalent production from the Permian hit a 163.3 million a day in the second quarter, again, a region record for the company. We now have 19 rigs running in the Permian, 15 of which, are dedicated to our horizontal oil programs. In the Gulf Coast, as Tom mentioned, our focus continues to be on or South Texas, Yegua/Cook Mountain place, where the recent successes that we've had there have contributed and are the direct contributor to the 12% increase in production we've seen since the second quarter of '07.", "Looking forward, we provided third quarter guidance of 483 to 495 million a day, and with anticipations for continued growth we hope to obviously fall on the upper end of that range. This range equates to an 8 to 10% increase from our thirds quarter '07 reported average of 448.6 million a day. With our strong second quarter, we've raised the lower end of our full year guidance to 418 million a day, with no change on our upper end of 495 million a day. In this new range, 480 to 495 million a day, equates to a healthy 9% to 12% increase in production in 2008 after accounting for our 2007 property sales.", "A few words on our exploitation program. With total CapEx of $69 million down at the end of Q2, our '08 exploitation program is still on track to meet the $125 million to $150 million spending range that we mentioned to you on our last conference call. Through Q2, we've completed a total of 190 significant exploitation projects, 46 new wells, and 144 recompletion and/or work-over projects. The program continues to meet all of our expectations with regard to production adds and project economics.", "The majority of our exploitation drilling activity took place in the Southwest Westbrook field, our West Texas area, where we drilled 28 wells and performed 16 recompletion and/or work-over projects, which represented $17 million in capital that we spend since the beginning of the year. Our focus on the field during Q3 and Q4 will shift slightly, more directed towards water injection in order to optimize flood conformance and the likely result would be fewer wells drilled in the field during the last half of the year.", "Year-to-date, mid-Kansas and mid-Continent areas, we've performed 11 drilling projects and 88 work-over and/or recompletion projects, representing $32 million in CapEx, $6 million of which has been directed to our Walnut Bend field located just North of Dallas. We've performed in that field 25 recompletion projects and three deepenings since the beginning of the year. And currently, have seven work-over rigs work in the field and it looks like we're on course to put another $7 plus million down by the end of the year.", "This has been a real nice project for us. Over the last two years, our exploitation efforts have arrested our field decline and increased field production to 1500 barrels a day, which is more than double the 700 barrels a day the field was producing when we acquired it.", "In over our other areas, our production group has been focused on our base properties. Finding ways to maximize production and lower LOE. Via compressor optimization, artificial lift, salt water disposal projects, and enhancement to our chemicals and training programs. Too numerous to mention are all of these projects but the reference are certainly surfacing, in both our production and our LOE. As an example, since the fourth quarter of last year, we project that the salt water disposal projects performed in just the Texas Panhandle and West Texas areas alone will save approximately $8 to 9 million in LOE.", "In a nutshell, our production group has done a great job this year, managing our base properties as well as our exploitation program and we hope to match their first half performance here as we get in into the second half of the year. Just a couple of comments on the market before turning the call over to Paul. Rig rates. Although our average onshore rig rates have hovered around \u2013 have been hovering around 18,000 a day during the first half of the year, we're just now beginning to see some signs of upward pressure. We're also seeing the market tighten a bit. But even with the tightening of the market, we're comfortable with our existing rigs and relationships and commitments that we have that we'll be able to continue to expand our program here into the remainder of '08 and then further again as we going into 2009.", "Steel cost. We touched on in our last call. They continue to be on the up tick due to a run up in material and shipping cost, tightening supply, weakness in the dollar, we've now seen nearly a doubling in the market price for pipes since January. Again, with the tight market, we believe we're very well positioned to fight the tight supply having a good inventory of pipe, a physical inventory of pipe, and by aligning ourselves with various suppliers to obtain a portion of their allocated deliveries as we move down the road.", "All of these, our increased pipe materials, fuel, day rate cost, they're going to find their way to the bottom line of our completed well cost and are now season shown [ph] that they probably represent anywhere from a 5% to 7% increase in our total well cost as compared to the beginning of the year. That said, as always, as we continue to move our program forward, we'll incorporate current market conditions into all of our project economics and make sure we're drawing economically viable programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul and I'll correct you if get the production rate wrong in the second quarter.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. Much has been covered already, I'll just touch on a few things that may requires some clarifications.", "The increase in the capital program for this year to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, just some regional ranges that you can think about. In the Mid-Continent, we now expect we would be about $600 million to $700 million. In our Permian Basin area, we would expect to be between $500 million and $600 million. So those areas have both increased by about a $100 million each. And then our Gulf Coast \u2013 our expectations for our Gulf Coast area is broadly defined all the way from South Texas \u2013 Southeast Texas. In the Louisiana and Mississippi, we would still expect to be around $200 million.", "So that will \u2013 that gives you the breakdown of the range $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. So how that fits in to our overall results? Well, obviously, we have a very large drilling program this year, but it is funded cash flow. There had been no borrowings in our credit facility and no dead offerings in the equity issue. And the satisfying part or gratifying part about that is it is delivering 10% volume growth which we do believe is sustainable. You know, other things you should consider is that because we have always been largely on hedge \u2013 unhedged, we're \u2013 are reaping full benefit of the high prices is then in turn resulting in record earnings in cash flow. So we're very satisfied with where we are and what we've done so far this year, and look forward to finishing it off strongly,", "In the news release, we provide guidance on most of our expenses. Some have changed a little bit, but we're really talking pennies and nickles, some things not discussed in the news release that I think it's worthwhile for the \u2013 especially the analysts and those with model future earnings and cash quota [ph], to think about, is that you'll notice that our second quarter gas price realization relative to NYMEX was $0.36 below NYMEX or Henry Hub index, whichever you track.", "As you know, in the first quarter of this year and last year's fourth quarter, we actually had positive differentials. First quarter, we were $0.31 above it. So we had quite a large swing from $0.31 positive to $0.36 negative. It's influenced by many factors but that the single most important factor is an expanding Mid-Continent and Permian Basin gas price differential relative to the Gulf Coast.", "For instance, the second quarter Mid-Con NYMEX differential was about $1.75 versus only $0.89 in the first quarter and we see a similar widening in the Permian Basin. As many of you know that track the gas market very closely, we already have July and August index prices in, and for July and August fifth [ph] weeks, the differential between Henry Hub and the Mid-continent averaged to $1.67. So with all that said, we would expect, and so therefore we're modeling ourselves, that will have a differential of somewhere probably between $0.35 to $0.70 for the third and fourth quarters.", "Then also on the oil price realization side of things. Our differential was only $2.34 in the second quarter. We did have some one-off oil revenue collections in there. We have a little project that away [ph] we call it our value-add team and they're doing a very good job of this some revenues that didn't have related volume adjustments. So on a go forward basis, we wouldn't expect to see that and ourselves are modeling a $3 differential to WTI.", "And then lastly, I've mentioned in the news releases, income taxes. We continue to see an effective rate of above 36.5% on our book earnings, but given our capital spending program, we would expect that roughly 30% to 40% of that total cash provision will be current with the other 60% to 70% deferred as we move forward to the rest of this year.", "I think that's enough comments on the numbers. So Brei, we would be very happy to entertain questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Larry Busnardo from Tristone Capital.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Mick Merelli", "Good morning.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "First in the WoodFord programs. Tom, did you say you're currently running", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, we are. Four operator rigs.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "Four operator's rigs. How many wells do you think you can get done this year? And do you plan on maintaining the four rigs for the remainder of the year?", "Tom Jorden", "We do. We have \u2013 well, I'm going to quote \u201coperated, non-operated\u201c. We've been in 12 wells year-to-date and our current projection is between 27 and 30 for the year. And that's \u2013 a number of those are non-operated. Right now, we are participating in eight wells in that play. Four we're operating and four we're non-operating. So, the non-op portion was a little harder to predict.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "And those are all Woodford wells? Are they all horizontal?", "Tom Jorden", "They are all horizontal Woodford wells.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "Okay. And then, I guess, just from your standpoint with the four rigs running, how many wells, looking ahead to next year, I know you still got to set the budget and things like that, but how many wells could you get done in \u2013 for the year with the four rig program?", "Tom Jorden", "", "That's an active program. It's expanding. I really \u2013 don't really want to comment to much about next year other than say it's going to expand and that we're making provisions for that expansion right now.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "Okay. On the wells you drilled to date, from, I guess, a geological standpoint. Do they all look very similar?", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "Any variances, or \u2013 ", "Tom Jorden", "", "There is, there, yeah. We've seeing variances from well to well, and Larry, again, we're really not prepared to discuss this play in any significant detail, other than to say that we are encouraged. There are a lot of challenges ahead of us, and we anticipate our activity going forward to being to (inaudible) to what we're currently doing, but we are seeing variances, and its a very challenging problem.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "Challenging just from drilling and completion, then obviously it's still very early so you're working to the program, is that \u2013?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Yes. These are deep expensive wells, and so there are just a lot of variables that control this play including drilling cost, product price, sub-surface completion technology, and I probably left a list out. So we're working our way through it and we'll be giving more details as we get more results in, and as we evaluate, you know, we're not going to talk about it freely until we're feeling confident that we've got the opportunity control that we want to control.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "Okay, understood. Just shifting over to Southeaster New Mexico. Could \u2013 just remind me, looking at an average well there, how much they cost EURs and then what type of returns you're getting at current prices and then kind of \u2013 what's kind of a break even on those? I know, its probably going to be a fairly low oil price but\u2013@", "Tom Jorden", "", "Yeah, I know, you know, a garden variety well in Southeaster New Mexico, you know of course, Southeaster New Mexico is a pretty broad section of real estate. Horizontal Wolfcamp program, a garden variety well is going to be $4.5 million to drill and complete. It's going to come online at somewhere between 200 and 400 barrels per day. It will probably ultimately recover 250,000 barrels, again, that's a pretty wide variance there, and at $120 oil, that's a phenomenal rate of return. And, we run price sensitivity. I can't tell you the break even, but I will tell you that we run price sensitivities at $75 flat, NYMEX less local market deduction, our program is still profitable at that price. So, we would, you know \u2013 prices \u2013 why we run that? Because when we buy land or when we commit to drilling opportunities, we want to make sure that prices would exclude all to that level, that we would still drill that well. That we would \u2013 that prices with $75 NYMEX, that's a program that could sustain that price. And, it is.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "Could you do the same just for the Bone Spring program just in terms of well costs, IPs, and the EURs?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Yes. First, Bone Spring has a little more variable IP and reserves because in some areas we're drilling in the field and some areas we're drilling out of the field. But, Bone Spring is a little deeper drilling, so, a well in the Bone Spring is going to be a little north of $5 million. If its a single lateral, if its a dual lateral, it will probably be a little north of $7 million or $8 million. Those are depths of 11 to 13,000 feet. A Bone Spring well for single lateral will IP between 250 and 500 barrels a day, if its a new area. A new well is going to produce between 250,000 and 350,000 barrels and again, very profitable today's oil price. We're very, very pleased with the (inaudible) set of programs and the critical measure to us is can that program sustain that $75 flat NYMEX price and indeed it can. Now, that's \u2013 price that get too much lower than that and that will probably near our limit there but it's a good program.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "And then on the dual lateral. Is that the range then, the single versus dual that you just gave out?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Dual lateral \u2013 of course, we don't have a lot of production as to a dual lateral but we model them as a 400,000 barrels, 600,000 barrels a day IP and that's an extrapolation. The truth of the matter is, we don't know. We don't have enough history there.", "Larry Busnardo \u2013 Tristone Capital", "", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Hagen with Merrill Lynch.", "Eric Hagen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Hey, good morning. A question following up on Larry's. In the Granite Wash, what kind of EURs are you seeing? Have those improved and if so, it's because of some kind of new drilling completion process and what's the completed well cost out there?", "Tom Jorden", "", "You know, Eric, we \u2013 Granite Wash is again a big slot of real estate and so, the EUR's are highly variable and it depends on the area. A typical Granite Wash vertical well currently is probably a little less than a Bcf. For horizontal well, our program is young, so we really don't know yet firmly what those EURs are going to be. We're looking at well cost under or between $3 million and 4 million. So, we'd hope for significant uplift over a vertical well and EUR that \u2013 yes, it's very young progress so we couldn't be definitive on that.", "Eric Hagen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "What's a threshold price when you said $75 NYMEX for the horizontal Wolfcamp for the oil plays. What about for the Granite Wash?", "Tom Jorden", "", "The granite wash is price sensitive, it's a fantastic program because it's highly predictable. And again that's all credit to our exploration an operations group. They're doing a fantastic job of projecting the results and drilling their wells at the cost that we estimate. But at $7.50 NYMEX it gets a little skinny. So we run that flat price case. It can stand $7.50 NYMEX but if prices go a little lower than that, we would be concerned. Now if you follow this, as I know have, Eric, for last few years, we've put some hedges in place, couple of years ago, and it was indeed because of that sensitivity. We were spending more and more money in Panhandle and we were concern about stability to sustain a little price sensitivity and we put some hedges in place of that time to protect their capital investment. So all of our areas as we look at price sensitivity the Panhandle has fair degree of sensitivity.", "Mick Merelli", "", "I think one other thing \u2013 it's Mick \u2013 it's a big program. We're one of the most active drillers in the Panhandle, and that sensitivity, we're kind of talking a lot \u2013 obviously different wells have different sensitivity. Different areas have different sensitivity. So, even if gas prices went below \u2013 if it was perceived that you had a future strip that was less than $7.50 flat, there'd still be a significant amount of that drilling that would make economic sense.", "Operator", "", "Does that conclude your question? The next question is coming from Jeff Robertson from Lehman Brothers.", "Jeff Robertson \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Good afternoon. I apologize if you've already answered this question, but, Tom, in Anadarko Basin, Woodford play, your acreage looks like it's scattered over a pretty broad geographic area. Can you talk about a little bit about the drilling results to-date? And how much of your acreage you've evaluated, and what the plans are going forward?", "Tom Jorden", "Yeah, Jeff, we \u2013 I'm not sure the broad geographic area. In the area we're drilling, our area is actually fairly concentrated with \u2013 the easy answer is, we participated in 11 wells that are in productions so, we've evaluated 11 sections. Those are all in 11 unique sections. We're seeing variability in those well results and our (inaudible) forward.", "Jeff Robertson \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Is the variability, or do you know yet, Tom, whether or not the variabilities are related to structure or just different rock characteristics?", "Tom Jorden", "We do not know. I don't think the variability \u2013 I can't say \u2013 I don't think it's related to structure but we can not \u2013 we're still working through the science to explain our variability.", "Jeff Robertson \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Duane Grubert from CRT Capital.", "Duane Grubert \u2013 CRT Capital", "With the recent sector sell off, could you comment a little bit about your views on the idea of doing buybacks perhaps?", "Mick Merelli", "Well, we'll just have to \u2013 I really can't comment. I wouldn't take that off the board. We obviously, we generate a lot of cash flow, and we stand a lot on \u2013 we have very active drilling program, we spend a lot of money, we generate a lot of money. So that's \u2013 it's always a possibility, and there's different ways that can be accomplished. We're looking at those, we'll just have to see what happens. I know that's a kind of a round \u2013 around the bend way to answer your question, but I'm just saying that we're open to that, but to tell that we're considering it or anything else would you know \u2013 we're just open to it, we'll have to see what happens.", "Duane Grubert \u2013 CRT Capital", "Yeah, that's a fair answer, and kind of similarly, you integrated the Magnum Hunter properties, you've been getting oilier with your recent programs. Do you see Cimarex as having a capacity to expand into yet a further business unit and backhanded, I'm asking are you also looking at the acquisition market given this relative softness lately in the market?", "Mick Merelli", "", "No, again, I think that that's, you know, really what we learned out at Magnum Hunter was that its one thing to buy things, its another thing to have the organization to digest it. And so we've spent the last three years building up the organization and getting over what we have bought. That was a big buy, and I really underestimated how much time to take to get around it.", "Having said that, we feel that \u2013 we really feel pretty good about having our arms around it right now, so any thing's a possibility. We might buy something or it just have to be something we really like. We're not acquirers that just go out to buy things because they're cheap. It would have to be something that really took us somewhere, that had some drilling potential, that expanded us, brought us something, you know, besides just a nice place to borrow some money and invest at a lower rate return.", "Duane Grubert \u2013 CRT Capital", "", "Finally, on operational question. In that, you are having really nice success with a lot of your oil completions out there. Is there some learning curves still to be forecast on maybe the completion side. So, I'll ask a very specific question. Do you think your completion are going to look materially different a year or two from now on oil price?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Well, there's \u2013 it's a good question. I wish I have a crystal ball to answer", "Joe Albi", "", "This is Joe. What we've seen historically on these programs is that there's a maturation in cost efficiencies and completion efficiencies over time and the more and more wells that we drill and complete, we're learning something new each time. We've tried different completion techniques that have seemed to improve our productivity over time but I think a lot of the results we're seeing are tied with to the rock as well. So, we'll continue to use science, micro seismic, altering our simulation designs, modeling them, seeing what we get and compare that to what we thought we're going to get and continue to enhance the program. In a kind of a top level answer, I guess, to your question is a new play, I think the chances of improving production into our cost, certainly, it's a lot better to walking into the play than as you get further down into it. Our West Texas, horizontal program, we've learned a lot and, I think, we've really come along way. As is the case, I guess, to some degree and Southeast New Mexico and of course, our Granite Wash program. We have technical specialist that do nothing bad. Design our fracs and monitor results and in fact we oftentimes, monitor and change our fracs on the fly, which I think is different than some other companies. But hopefully, that gives you an answer. Albeit maybe a little bit vague.", "Mick Merelli", "", "I think the other thing that's involved in that is that all of these plays, lateral length and geometry of laterals and all of that. Pretty much everything we've done has just been single lateral. And, I'm not sure that we have the potential to take exotically long laterals like we're seeing in some of these other place. But, those things will be things that we'll continue to look at and if they make sense, that's a potential protect [ph] that I think in these oil wells to, maybe, be beneficial to us.", "Tom Jorden", "You know, Duane, this is Tom, just my take on that. One of the things that you heard us talk about and we've moved towards in the last two years as more project drilling, a lot of horizontal drilling, but also projects. And the thing with projects is we do have the opportunity to try different things and learn from it and adapt within that project that has additional drilling. And you mentioned oil completion, for example, in a horizontal Wolfcamp play in Southeast New Mexico, we've had the opportunity to experiment with open hole completions. We've had the opportunity to experiment with case liners, cementing the liner in place. We've had the opportunity to experiment with open hole packer systems. And, because we have dozens and dozens of wells ahead of us in that program, we are able to optimize and learn. And I have great confidence in our drilling completion group. Everywhere we've given them a project, they've optimized. So, we'll continue to do that.", "Duane Grubert \u2013 CRT Capital", "That's very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions) Our next question is coming from Matt Sherwood of ZS Fund.", "Matt Sherwood \u2013 ZS Fund", "", "Strong quarter, congratulations on that. Just had a couple of questions. First of all, can you walk through the rationale? It seems like you've increased your drilling program pretty substantially, be at on the gas side at least? With \u2013 what you were talking about with the mid-Continent basis? Gas prices are really not any higher than where they were. Could you sort of, walk through the rationale?", "Paul Korus", "Well, with drilling programs, you really can't make decisions in real time.", "Matt Sherwood \u2013 ZS Fund", "Right.", "Paul Korus", "If you have ten rigs running in the Texas Panhandle, you're out six months in terms of permeating and things like that. So, really what drives us is a longer term view on gas prices. So, why are we active in the Texas Panhandle, why are we active in the Woodford Shale? It's because of \u2013 as we looked at cost and opportunities that we had under our control and match that up with a future price deck, the economics drove us to those places. So, it's a much longer term, time horizon that causes us to accelerate programs than it is anything else. So, we're not likely to just shut down a program or release rigs when we get some sort of dip in prices. But keep in mind that it's still \u2013 I mean, it's not all that bad out there in terms of prices. I mean, we're still getting $8 in the Mid-Continent. So, now you know, that's as of today.", "Matt Sherwood \u2013 ZS Fund", "Right. Can you sort of walk through, obviously, with the oil, let's say, at $20 an Mcf and gas at, as you said, $8, have you been shifting \u2013 obviously your production growth has been a little bit higher in oil. Have you been shifting resources towards oil?", "Mick Merelli", "", "We are \u2013 we're just victims of \u2013 or users of whichever way you want to look at it, of geologic risk and rate of return. Well, actually it is all about risk rate to return. So if you look at a \u2013 you know, if we look at the Granite Wash program, we can accept a lower rate to return out there, based on strip pricing and then with 750, $75, $6, $50 flat cases. Those are sensitivity cases, we just look at them on a risk adjusted basis and whether they're gas or oil, we take the best projects, and we just move through it. So, it is all about risk \u2013 it is more about risk and rate to return than it is anything else, and of course the big problem is whether you use for a commodity price forecast and in that regard, we run the strip and then we'd like to run some sensitivities to see which projects are more resistive to the lower prices.", "Tom Jorden", "", "I think there's probably maybe a bit of a misconception just from your question in, and from other on the call here today. Yes, if you look at our year-over-year numbers, we have a larger growth than our oil production, probably 13%, 14% than we do in our gas production which is still pretty good, 8% or 9%. But remember, we had some property sales last year that are affecting this year's production. If you narrow in and you look at our second quarter volumes relative to our first quarter volumes, you will observe that our gas production went up 14 million a day, and our oil production was roughly flat. So, if things keep moving around, it's the result of timing of activity in these programs more than it is some big strategic move to \u2013", "Mick Merelli", "", "We want more \u2013 we love what we're doing, I just want more of all of it, so \u2013", "Matt Sherwood \u2013 ZS Fund", "", "Yes. Just a final big picture question just on the buyback that was mentioned before, but it seems like you've \u2013 by the end of the year, you'll have a book value basic where your stock is again because of great earnings. What's your feeling on \u2013 I mean it's got to be frustrating that you do a good job, you earn good returns on your equity from your drilling programs, yet the market seems to value you at basically what you paid for everything?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Well, we have a lot on our plate. We've increased our capital program 40% to 50% this year compared to last year. We don't plan to shrink next year. All right. Now we always have the uncertainty of prices but we have many, many projects that are very solid at lower prices, so we don't know where cash flow is going to be next year but we do know that we $200 million cash right now, and this year we've been funding our program with cash flow, and unless there's some disaster out there that the futures market not telling us about, we're going to match up pretty well this year, cash flow and capital. But we have our eyes on some things where we're trying to expand in some of our existing core plays, and we could readily eat up the few hundred million dollars.", "Matt Sherwood \u2013 ZS Fund", "", "I agree. Well, keep up the good work on the exploration side.", "Mick Merelli", "", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our next question is coming from Andrew Coleman from UBS.", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "", "Good afternoon.", "Mick Merelli", "", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "", "I had a question on the reserves side, given how nice the production has been growing here in the last three quarters. At what point do we start to get a feel for reserve growth kind of getting over 200%.", "Tom Jorden", "", "In terms of production replacement?", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "Yes. Sorry about that.", "Tom Jorden", "", "Well, we have a long, long track record of not commenting on proved reserves during interim periods. So, we make general comments about we're having a good year but we're not going to get specific beyond that. We've never had year where reserves declined. We've always grown. We would expect that reserve growth and production growth will continue in similar paces just as they always have. And in our case, it's on a per share basis not just an absolute basis.", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "Right, yes. You guys are outstanding on a debt adjusted share basis getting close to, what I think, is about 15% which I think is solid growth here on the production side and just looking for signals as to what would move the reserves forward now. Can you guys give any color on that if you think your F&D cost would kind of change a whole lot versus last year? Is that something for later in the year as well?", "Tom Jorden", "", "I doubt that they would change a lot.", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "Great. I missed the breakdown you guys had read off earlier on the CapEx by region. Is there a possibility that you could go through that one more time?", "Tom Jorden", "", "Yes. So, with the new total being $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Now, our general expectations is that our mid-continent area would be $600,000 to $700,000; the Permian basin, $500,000 to $600,000; and our Gulf Coast area $200,000 roughly.", "Andrew Coleman \u2013 UBS", "Okay.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions)", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you everyone for joining us today. We have issued our financial results for the third quarter, of which a copy and the press release can be found on our websites and we'll be making forward-looking statements in today's call. So I'll refer to the end of our press release which does discuss this forward-looking statements.", "Here in Denver, on today's call, we have Mick Merelli, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration; Joe Albi, EVP of Operations; and Paul Korus, VP and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, our Vice President and Controller.", "And with that, we will go ahead and jump in the call. I will turn it over to Mick Merelli.", "Mick Merelli.", "Good morning. Thanks for joining in this on today's call. Looking back at the third quarter of 2008, we have seen quite a bit of volatility in both commodity prices and our stock price. Operationally, we had solid results with growing production. Our quarterly cash flow was $414 million, nearly as high as our record second quarter cash flow of $431 million.", "We realized oil prices over $114 a barrel and gas nearly a $10 an Mcf. Our production averaged 485 million cubic feet a day equivalent despite having 15 million cubic feet a day equivalent on average deferred in the quarter as a result of the hurricanes. So this would imply without the disruption from the storms, our daily production would have hit 500 million cubic feet a day equivalent.", "So we had a good third quarter, but now the landscape is changed significantly. These shifts started before the third quarter ended where we saw our gas realizations fall sharply by the end of September. We've seen particularly low Mid-Continent gas prices, and as we reported in our press release, low quarter-end gas prices resulted in us taking a full cost pool write-down.", "Through September 30, 2008 our exploration and development investment totaled $1.1 billion. For the full year of 2008, we expect to invest about $1.4 billion. That was then, going ahead we are reducing our operated rig count from third quarter high of 42 to something less than 30. We're still working on that. What we invest in 2009 will be impacted by many things but obviously the most important ones are going to be the commodity prices and drilling and service cost. We have lots of opportunities but what we have to do at this point is to test them for what the economics of the projects look like on a go forward basis.", "We will run flat price cases using current service cost and we'll stack up the returns and make the decisions on what we drill. We are still rolling up and evaluating our 2009 plans and I would expect that we'll keep within our investment next year will be something around our cash flow and that will probably start slower in the first part of the year but stay tuned that all of those things can change.", "So we'll maintain a disciplined approach, we will run all of our investments using a strip corrected appropriately for quality and location. We'll also run sensitivity cases we have in the past at $6 flat gas and $50 flat oil and those would of course be corrected for quality and location. We will constantly adapt our programs and we've been through this before and what we found is there always are things that work so that we'll have some level of profitable drilling investment.", "Right now because commodity prices are changing, the costs are changing. We are not too sure where those things are going to be, so essentially my message to you is we are slowing down a little bit while we are trying to understand where our best programs are and where we should differ and where we should move ahead.", "With that, I'm going to turn it over to Tom Jorden and he can give you some details on our drilling programs", "Tom Jorden", "", "Thank you, Mick. I am going to just give some highlights of our third quarter and then a little preview of what we're looking at in terms of our 2009 planning process.", "And the third quarter and really year-to-date, we've had a very active drilling program and we're seeing great results from a lot of our plays, in particular our horizontal oil plays in Permian Basin or horizontal Woodford Shale play in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma, and then onshore Gulf Coast in our Yegua/Cook Mountain program. They are also having another outstanding year.", "Year-to-date, we have drilled 376 grows, or 232 net wells for the nine months that ended September 30, 2008. We completed 95% of those as producers. Exploration development capital for the first three quarters of 2008 totaled $1.1 billion and we're on track and expect our full year 2008 exploration development capital projected to be $1.4 billion.", "As Mick said, we're in the environment now where we're seeing lower gas prices in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin. We're expecting to drop our operator rig count from the third quarter high at 42 to somewhere I would guess between 25 and 30 rigs by the middle of the fourth quarter.", "We're in a little bit of a shoulder here, where we are seeing last year's services cost with this years\u2019 prices. So we're trying to adjust our program accordingly. We are very committed to making good investments and making sure that wherever we deploy our capital, we're getting good rates of return under various prices scenarios.", "As Mick said, our downside case is a $50 NYMEX oil and $6 flat NYMEX gas price. We adjust that for local market differential conditions and we expect to see a decent return on capital with that and prices are getting uncomfortably close to that. So, we're making some tough decisions. We're lending some rigs down. We are absolutely committed to maintaining investment discipline through this environment.", "Our program year-to-date has split, were about 47% Mid-Continent and that would include our Mid-Continent and our Texas Panhandle program, about 36% of our total capital year-to-date has been Permian Basin, and then about 15% is onshore Gulf Coast and just a few percent into other opportunities.", "Looking into '09, as we pour our plans for '09, first and foremost, I want to underscore that we are dedicated going into the year to live within our cash flow. That\u2019s certainly going to be our target. So, we're probably going to be looking at cash flow that\u2019s significantly reduced from this year.", "I would expect our percentages to be close to what we did this year. Probably, you can look for a very solid Permian Basin oil program. We've got lot of nice horizontal programs that can stand some price sensitivity. Our Woodford Shale program in '09 will be an active and ongoing program. That program certainly can stand some price sensitivity.", "W still take geological risk. We are looking to grow our Gulf Coast program next year. Our Yegua/Cook Mountain program has had fantastic results this year. We have a couple of additional 3D [shoots] that are in the various stages of planning, and we look for a fairly active and aggressive onshore Gulf Coast program that will probably be a higher percentage of our total program, than the 15% this year.", "We're going to maintain a balanced portfolio of opportunities, and that includes both gas and oil opportunities. As I said, our horizontal Permian oil continues to be a real nice contributor for us and we'll see that continue into next year.", "We'll also have conventional Gulf Coast 3D targets as I've said. We'll have unconventional targets and the primary target there as our Woodford Shale in the deep Anadarko Basin. Horizontal programs are primarily our Bone Spring program, our Wolfcamp and Abo programs of Southeast New Mexico.", "So, we're in the process of going through our programs, looking at our costs carefully. Our teams are all looking at where they can cut their costs, where they can't. We are working with our vendors to try to get service cost down. I'm sure Joe will comment on that further.", "Now I'd like to turn to the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Joe Albi", "Thanks, Tom. Although, somewhat masked by the impact of hurricanes Gustav and Ike, as Mick mentioned, we really did have a good third quarter from our production standpoint.", "We ended the quarter with average net daily equivalent production of 485 million a day, which is 5 million a day higher than the revised guidance we've provided in our press release and follow-up call merely after the hurricanes where we had projected guidance of 475 million to 480 million a day.", "Our peak shut-in following the storms was approximately a 125 million a day and that happened or transpired on September 14th. We have most of that back on line by early October. I do have to command on our guys. They were pretty hard put  to get our production back on line and as such the storms only had an overall net impact approximately 50 million a day on a quarterly production, which is a bit less than we had anticipated immediately after the storms.", "As Mick mentioned when he start up the call here without the storms, we would have been producing around 500 million a day for the quarter and that would have allowed us to report yet another quarter of continued production growth. So we are definitely on the uptake from a production standpoint. We still have approximately 11 million a day of our non operated offshore production shut-in and majority of that is anticipated to be back online before the end of the year.", "Despite the hurricanes, our total third quarter production of $484.4 million a day was up 8% from our Q307 average of $448.5 million a day. We see nice production growth in both oil and gas. As compared to last year's third quarter, our net oil production has grown 10% from 20,537 barrels a day in Q307 to 22,607 barrels a day in Q308 and our net gas production has grown 7% from $325 million a day in Q307 to $349 million a day in Q308.", "During Q3, we continued to see significant production growth in each of the core areas that Tom mentioned. As compared to the third quarter of '07, our Q308 equivalent daily production increased 19% in the Mid-Continent, 14% in the Permian and 6% in the Gulf Coast. Our Texas Panhandle and Woodford programs were the drivers behind the 19% increase we saw in the Mid-Continent, while the 14% increase in the Permian, as well as our increase in total company oil production was driven by our Permian Basin horizontal oil plays.", "Our Permian oil production grew 37% from 9,557 barrels a day in Q307 to 13,078 barrels a day in Q308, an increase which lifted total equivalent production in the Permian region to 165 million a day to the third quarter which was a region record for the company. In the onshore Gulf Coast area, our net production increased 6% from 67.5 million a day in Q307 to 71.3 million a day in Q308. This increase being fueled primarily by the successes of our Yegua/Cook Mountain program during the early part of the year.", "Looking forward, for fourth quarter, we are projecting production guidance as we've stated in our release this morning, of 488 million to 498 million a day and this figure takes into account an estimated 8 million to 10 million a reduction for the impact of our hurricane related shut-in production and a reduced rig count during the fourth quarter.", "This ramps the Q4 results in a projected full year production for the company of 484 million to 487 million a day which is a respectable 10% increase from 2007 after we account for property sales. As far as '09 is concerned, we'll be at a better position to more accurately predict production guidance after we complete our planning process and see a bit more of how the commodity market behaves here as we close out the year.", "A few words on our exploitation program. With total capital spending of a $104 million down at the end of the third quarter, our '08 exploitation program looks to be on track to meet the lower end of the $125 million to $150 million range we mentioned in our last call. Through Q3, we've now completed a total of 243 significant exploitation projects, 60 of which are new wells and 183 re-completion and our work over projects.", "In the Permian area, the majority of our exploitation capital has been directed to our Southwest Westbrook field located in West Texas. Through Q3, we've spent $23 million in the field completing most of our planned 2008 development activity after now drilling 34 wells and performing 23 re-completions.", "As we move forward from here our focus is now on getting more water in the ground, in order to optimize flood conformance in those areas that we fully developed. Also in the Permian our New Mexico has team has done just a fabulous job of lowering LOE through compression and chemical program optimization and by instituting a proactive cost control program at the field level. The group has also had a nice impact on production by performing a dozen or so significant work over and/or re-completion projects since the beginning of the year.", "In the Kansas and Mid-Continent areas, we have drilled 17 wells and performed a 107 work over and/or re-completion projects representing $46 million in capital since the beginning of the year, $10 million of which has been direct towards our Walnut Bend field located just North of Dallas where we have performed 35 re-completions and 3 deepenings, $9 million has been directed to Southern Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle where we have performed 15 re-completion projects and $8 million has been directed towards the Panoma and Kansas Hugoton areas where we have drilled 16 wells and performed 44 re-completions and/or workovers.", "With the end of the year approaching, our production group is now focusing on our 2009 production and exploitation plan. The plan will focus really around three simple objectives. Number one, maximizing our operating income, number two, optimizing a reduced exploitation capital budget and three, accelerating our activity to get it done sooner in a year. Over the past year, the group has made great strides to improve base property production and at the same time lower LOE. That said, there is still much to do, when I will go in '09 will be the high grade and capture those opportunities.", "Just a couple of comments, I want to make on the cost side before turning the call over to Paul. First is on the steel market and pipe. After increasing approximately 125% since January, the steel market has remained relatively flat since September and, in fact, appears to be showing signs of softening.", "We anticipate [tubular] cost will probably remain fairly flat here during Q4, but we're seeing increasing evidence of supplier inventories and have seen drops in raw material costs, such as scrap metal, which is down 75% the last three months.", "With all that, we believe the cost of pipe is likely to come down in the first quarter. We're already seeing price are up for Chinese pipe and believe that the US mill are same to follow.", "Price drops for steel would be a welcome sign to us. We've looked into various programs and tubular costs alone have increased our well cost by anywhere from 4% to 5% since beginning of the year.", "A note that I want to make, a plug for our materials group, during the last year they have done just a great job of monitoring the market and keeping us right ahead of our rig schedule, while balancing our inventory of pipe.", "Our average onshore rig rates continue to hover around $18,000 a day, but we're seeing some initial signs of relief, albeit, small, with a few of our contractors dropping day rates by approximately 10%.", "We have  yet, however, to see any other significant cost reductions from our other service providers. That said, we're continuing our efforts to push down cost where we can and we're challenging our well designs to get cost levels back in line so that they can work in a lower product price environment.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. Today I thought I would just comment a little bit about our liquidity situation. Of course, a company with 12.5% debt-to-cap ratio is usually not one that you have to be much concerned about liquidity. But I do just want to remind everyone about where we are at.", "Our September 30th balance sheet shows that we had a little over $200 million in cash and no bank debt. So I did want to remind everyone that we did have a transaction in October, where we essentially use the bulk of that cash. But still we do have cash on hand and continue to have nothing drawn on our credit facility.", "On our credit facility, our borrowing basis is always calculated to be something in excess of $1 billion depending on the bank pricing that's been used. Besides of our note, however, that we entered into in 2005 is of $1 billion figure, which is always been the cap on the borrowing base. And the banks are in the process right now reaffirming our borrowing base of $1 billion.", "However, because we've also lived within cash-flow, when we set up that facility, we only ask for and paid for 500 million of commitments and we still have that. So even if something unforeseen would have happened where we needed to borrow our credit facility, we can easily borrow our $5 million overnight. So we're in very good shape.", "So some questions maybe about where we are going to end the year. We had little over close to $1.2 billion in cash flow through the first nine moths. Of course, those were very good prices.", "We've realized $9.79 for our gas in Q3. In Q4, given the basis blowout that we've witnessed in the Mid-Continent areas to a large degree and to some extent as well on the Permian Basin.", "We could have as much as a $2 differential from Henry Hub in the fourth quarter, which might put our gas realization around between 5 and 5.50 or so. With oil trading where it is recently like of hovering around 70ish in our standard $3 differential from there, we should still cash flow in the fourth quarter, something close to $250 million or at least $200 million to $250 million, which would add that where we for the first nine months.", "We should be above $1.4 billion cash flow for the year, which would mean we would basically have funded our exploration and development program and used our cash on hand to pay for the acreage acquisition that we did last month. We're in good shape for this year to end approximately with no cash and no bank debt.", "As we look ahead to 2009, and as Joe mentioned, we're in very early stages, but like everybody else we have excel spreadsheet too. We plug in strip pricing and then consider what might happen to gas price differentials next year versus this year, at $7.50 gas, even if we assume that our average differential doubles next year compares to what it was this year, this year should average $0.15 which is, of course, lot lower than the fourth quarter.", "So if you use a $1 differential, which still net 654 for our gas and our oil price would still hover around $70, and we'd still have $1 billion of cash flow. So that should fund a pretty healthy program. But as Mick mentioned earlier, that we may start the year in anticipation that the strip is too high, because we have a number of concerns about the level of gas production in the country and really the stickiness of the rig count that we haven't witnessed a reduction in country's overall rig count especially for gas.", "So we're going to start a little slower, maybe some that would analyze to 800 million. As the year unfolds if strip prices hold or get better, we have the flexibility due to increase it because we certainly are opportunity rich.", "This is the way we are approaching the world right now. As everyone said, stay tuned but we have never had a year where we did not grow production and, of course, is living within our cash flow. So the $64 question is, where will cash flow be and where will cost be? Because it's entirely possible that $800 million to $1 billion of investment could fund a level of activity that\u2019s not proportionately lower than what we accomplished this year.", "With that, we'll turn it back to the operator and entertain your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of [Gregg Brody] with JPMorgan.", "Gregg Brody - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon.", "Mick Merelli", "Hi.", "Gregg Brody - JPMorgan", "Just trying to figure out what the Mid-Continent base pull out might to do your end reserves in terms of, I know you are taking down, you are doing this bookmark, but how does it affect your proven reserves then at the end of the year?", "Paul Korus", "Well, we do not know where prices are going to be at year end. The way reserves work as well as the fuel cost ceiling test works is you have to use the prices on the last date of that period. So like at September 30, we were looking at gas prices in the Mid-Continent area of between 4 and 4.50. We had lower since then but now today, we are back up in that range. So I would be surprised if we in December, at that level of prices and so really when to expect significant impact on our proved reserves in the Mid-Continent area.", "Gregg Brody - JPMorgan", "Yes, that is helpful. I know you have been long-term believers in not hedging and obviously that paid off well this quarter. You have seen the affects of it this quarter. Any change in the thought process as you see prices come down, obviously there is not a huge opportunity to hedge but just going forward if you see the opportunity?", "Mick Merelli", "No, we do not know anymore about what future commodity prices are going to do and we do not know anymore now then we have know before and our debt is still low. If we run our data for whatever reasons and we would have to look at hedging but without that and the only reason for us to hedge with low debt is that we know something about the future and we really do not. We are still in the same position.", "Gregg Brody - JPMorgan", "That is consistent with what I thought, you will tell me before. All right. Thanks a bunch.", "Mick Merelli", "Boring but consistent\u2026", "Gregg Brody - JPMorgan", "That is it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Eric Hagen with Merrill Lynch.", "Eric Hagen - Merrill Lynch", "Good Morning and first off, just to commend you on your capital discipline and secondly, just a question on what you are seeing in the A&D markets and anything that interest you and if you were to participate in acquisitions, what regions might you be interested in? Would you stand the Mid-Cont and try to use these low prices till we get some bargains there? Or try to diversify outside of it?", "Mick Merelli", "We are really not seeing all that much right now. Of course, we are always interested. We are a company that every three or four years, whatever it has been, has found something to do. There is always a possibility. Right now, there is nothing on our radar screen that we are really that interested in, but we always pay attention to what might be an opportunity out there. It would be, more likely for us, it would have to be an opportunity that really fit us from a business standpoint. We are more interested in that than bargains that we do not know what to do with after we get them. So, we will be watching what is going on but the chances are we will not find what we want.", "Eric Hagen - Merrill Lynch", "So, Mick, following up on that question, would there be any chance for a corporate level transaction, may be a solid producer who has higher debt levels, a good inventory that you know, and some overlap regionally or is that just out of the question?", "Mick Merelli", "No, it is not out of the question but we just have to see. That is obviously an advantage, we are low debt and we are high cash flow. So, I mean, those kinds of things can happen but it would not be from a bargain type of thing we can get the reserves. It has to be something that really matched for us over the longer haul and if we find something like that we would be interested.", "Eric Hagen - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks, and once again, a good quarter.", "Mick Merelli", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question is from the line of Jeff Robertson with Barclays.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Capital", "Good afternoon. Tom, can you talk a little bit about, under normal basis, conditions and your different basins, can you indicate which place you think have the highest returns, as you think about allocating capital in 2009?", "Tom Jorden", "You bet, Jeff. No, first and foremost, Yegua/Cook Mountain has the highest rate of return. That is been a consistent theme of ours, for a number of years, that that is some 3D seismic, rifle shot targets, carries some geological risks. They are actually not that sensitive to changes in costs and changes in commodity price.", "Biggest problem of that play is dry holes. So, we do good science. We have a great set of prospects going into the remainder of '08 and '09. As I said, we are looking to significantly grow that program. So, first on our list we have Yegua/Cook Mountain.", "Some of our Mid-Continent programs will still look good under various sensitivities. The deep Woodford Shale has quite a bit of robustness to pricing and cost. So, we will look for a fairly active Woodford Shale program in the Anadarko Basin and, of course, I would say fairly active, I use that deliberately and will depend on our cash flow and just where our overall needs are in terms of preserving our land. The other recent transaction we did is by and large a land that is held by production that was important to us because of means of we conducted the timing.", "So the Yegua/Cook Mountain, the Anadarko Basin, Woodford Shale, our southern Oklahoma that is some of the fields we picked up from the Magnum Hunter transaction, Eola Robberson, Madill and Cumberland. Some of those economics looked very good under various sensitivities of cost and pricing. So I would look forward a fairly significant activity there.", "Then our horizontal oil plays in the Permian Basin looked good. We are doing everything we can to cut costs. They are certainly under a pressure with oil prices coming down and costs really have not a moderated yet to the extent that we expect them to.", "We are doing a lot of soul searching and rolling up our sleeves, trying to figure out ways we can cut our cost. Just some examples there, I was on the phone this morning talking to some of our guys who were limiting mud logs. When we do not need them, we are looking at smaller hole size, we are looking at less expensive service cost, we are eliminating logs and coring programs, where they are not necessary.", "So those programs I think you will see filling the capital need that we have. One of the nice things about our program now, is we really are opportunity rich. Prior to this moderation in pricing, we were fully prepared to fund program next year at current cost that would be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion based on in-house identified opportunities.", "So we are in process of high grading. We are going to pick the best opportunities and be prepared to accelerate or decelerate depending on conditions.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Capital", "Paul, did you say you will start the year on about $800 million pace? Did I hear that right?", "Paul Korus", "Yes, with the reductions that are underway right now, that is about where we would be moving into January.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Then lastly Tom, how long do you think it takes for service cost to catch up with commodity prices? Is it solely depended on the pace which you recall?", "Tom Jorden", "Joe is going to jump in here but my answer is too long.", "Joe Albi", "I agree with Tom and I am surprised it has not quite happened already. I think it is just a matter of time. If the lower product prices stay where they are it certainly will happen by itself. We are seeing it in the steel, we are starting to see prop become more available.", "There is a lot of horsepower out there for stimulation work. If that activity slows down in conjunction with the rig rate slowdown, those costs will come down. Day rates will follow soon. I think the days for a long-term rig contracts with guarantee day rates, those probably are starting to welter away and you may see more of our rig contractors if they do want term using a floating day rate, and once the term erodes, then we will probably be back to the old world where you can work on a day rate basis. So, we are just watching and waiting, but we are also, at the same time, I say that, pushing on these guys.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Mick Merelli", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate the interest, and if you have any questions, please call-in and we will be happy to talk with you and we look forward to seeing you or and/or reporting to you again in the fourth quarter.", "Thank you very much for joining us today.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Litangen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex third quarter 2009 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford; please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Litangen and thank you everyone for joining us today for the Cimarex third quarter results conference call. We did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website and we will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call, so I\u2019ll refer to the end of our press release for our forward-looking statements disclaimer at the end of the press release.", "Here in Denver on the conference call we have Mick Merelli, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration; Joe Albi, EVP of Operations; and Paul Korus, VP and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, our Controller. We will go ahead and get moving, and I will just go ahead turn the call over to Mick Merelli.", "Mick Merelli", "Thanks. Thank you for joining us today on our conference call. All of our areas are having really good years. In each of these areas, our teams have adapted by cutting our costs and hard grading our opportunities and we have drilled some really good wells. You\u2019ll hear more about that later. We generated cash flow of $181.7 million in our third quarter, which outpaced our capital expenditures for the period, which were $126.2 million.", "We exited September with borrowings under our credit facility of $156 million and a net debt to cap ratio of 21%. As we discussed in our last conference call, we reduced capital expenditures significantly in 2009 in response to high service costs and weak commodity prices. Our 2009 projected exploration and production capital investment of $500 to $550 million is over 60% less than what we invested in 2008.", "Our 2009 capital program is focused on three areas, our Mid-Continent gas resource, Cana play, our Permian Basin horizontal oil play, and our Gulf Coast Seismic Attribute play. I want to tell you a little bit more about those. Our Mid-Continent Anadarko-Woodford Cana play is relatively new to our company and it will have tremendous impact on what the company does and who the company is going forward.", "I want to make a few comments about the play. We think it\u2019s a very competitive play. We think it\u2019s one of the best plays, one of the best shale resource plays. In the reason for that is and in particular in regard to our company, but the first thing is the quality of the rock. It is thick; it has above average properties. The rock itself has properties that will compete with the best shale plays that we are aware of in terms of porosity, permeability, gas in place, TOC.", "That reflects itself and when we have a number of wells that have been on production for more than a year. As we look at those wells, what we see is, in the cases where we had some early mechanical failures in the real early wells and there weren\u2019t all that many of those, but when we take those wells out, what we see is very smooth, predictable hyperbolic declines.", "It gives us a lot of confidence about the early time prediction of these wells, that\u2019s important to us because the investment decision economics are driven by the first five or six years of the wells life and from what we\u2019re seeing, this rock is providing us predictable performance, we think, into that future. So we feel good about that.", "Obviously, the ultimate reserves, the EURs, and a lot are going to be influenced by terminal decline rates and all of those things and we\u2019ll contemplate those going forward, but the important thing is these wells are performing very well early time, the wells that we have that much a year over. On other points, with the quality of the gas, we have 1200 Btu gas and in addition to that, we have condensate in some of the wells, in a lot of the wells that are in the middle band of depth. Both of these things add to our economics on the wells. So it winds up being significant.", "We have good average, NRIs, net revenue interest, because of the way that we obtained the leases and because where we\u2019re out there, we have average NRI of something like 80%. Now, that might just be 5% better than what you see in a lot of plays, but that 5% is very important, particularly if production becomes as commodity prices get lower to make the difference in getting over to your cost of capital.", "It\u2019s in the right location for us. It\u2019s in an industry friendly state, has lots of infrastructure for service, and you can get the gas out and it\u2019s in one of our largest existing core operating areas. So we have a good organization to operate there. Our Tulsa office has more than 300 people in it. Now they handle more than just the Mid-Continent, but this play is in our backyard.", "Opportunity size, relative to our company, our 90,000 plus acres that are in or near the core area of what we perceive to be the core area of the play has potential of multiple Tcfs on 160 acre spacing and it will be a lot more if it winds up being on 80s and we don\u2019t know that, but Tom will be talking about that later.", "Our Permian, getting back to our normal business and the things that we\u2019ve done over the years, we have the Permian Basin oil projects. With oil prices improving and service costs have been falling, they seem to have leveled out just in the last few months. We\u2019ve begun drilling some horizontal oil project, because of this program, we\u2019ve grown our oil production to 30% of our total production and in the second quarter, it made up 53% of our revenue. We have a good generating team that generates our prospects. We have a large acreage position and we have a good inventory of horizontal oil drilling.", "In our 3D controlled Gulf Coast Cook Mountain Yegua play, we\u2019ve drilled the Two Sisters in the Garth discoveries and that was off a new 3D chute and they\u2019re great wells and respectively they\u2019re producing 40 million and 32 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Now Tom and Joe will cover each of these areas in a lot more detail.", "Looking to 2010, we have a large portfolio of opportunities that, even on flat pricing will make our economics. We have continued to restrain our spending in order to stay within cash flow to allow service costs to drop. We\u2019ve seen 20% to 30% reductions in costs, but having said that, these costs look like they\u2019re leveling out. So we don\u2019t really have a good reason to be holding back. I don\u2019t think, in 2010. We\u2019re going to have a more active program in 2010. We are finished waiting for costs to drop.", "As a part of our intention to ramp up activity in 2010, we\u2019ve hedged about half of our expected production. In our view, this is purely cash flow insurance, allowing us to better set an E&D budget and E&D kind of bottom of a range, which we could fund from our cash flow.", "With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tom Jorden to cover more detail about our drilling program.", "Tom Jorden", "Thanks, Mick. Good morning or good afternoon to everyone, depending on where you are, operationally the third quarter was a very good one for Cimarex. As Mick said, all of our core areas are performing very, very well. We have a great balance of opportunities with Mid-Continent resource gas play, our Permian Basin horizontal oil play, and our Gulf Coast seismically controlled exploration.", "We probably have the best opportunity set that we\u2019ve ever seen while we\u2019ve been together as a management team. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress this year in ramping our learning curve in our Western Oklahoma Cana Woodford Shale play. Our several highly profitable horizontal oil programs are continuing to grow in the Permian, and we\u2019ve continued to have outstanding drilling results in our Southeast Texas, seismically controlled Yegua and Cook Mountain program.", "That program, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve drilled two great wells this year, our Two Sisters No. 1 one which we brought on production in July at 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day, it is still producing at that rate and our Garth No. 1, which we brought online in October at 32 million cubic feet equivalent per day and those are 100% working interest wells.", "So I\u2019ll go over these in detail later in the call, but suffice it to say the Gulf Coast is having a very nice year. I\u2019ll begin the operational highlights with a quick return recap of companywide drilling activity. During the first nine months of 2009, we drilled 94 gross or 56 net wells, completing 94% of them as producers. Our reduced operator rig count resulted in drilling 76 fewer wells this year as compared to 2009.", "We\u2019ve talked about that in prior calls as a reduction to the downturn in the economy last year. We laid our rig fleet down. We\u2019ve been in the process this year of picking it back up. We currently have 11 operator rings drilling. That\u2019s five in our Mid-Continent region, four in the Permian Basin and two in the Gulf Coast. As we look at 2010, we are planning on increasing that rig count significantly, by mid January; we intend to have 18 operator rigs running.", "That should breakdown to eight Mid-Continent rigs, seven Permian Basin rigs, and three rigs in the Gulf Coast. As always, that\u2019s a number that is subject to change, up or down, but that\u2019s certainly our target. Capital expenditures for exploration and development were $126.2 million for the third quarter, bringing total exploration and development capital for the first nine months of 2009 to $366.9 million.", "Fourth quarter exploration and development capital is projected to be in the range of $130 million to $180 million for a full year 2009 investment of approximately $500 million to $550 million. We will now give you a summary region by region, starting with the Mid-Continent. In the Mid-Continent we\u2019ve drilled 52 gross or 23 net wells in the first nine months of 2009, completing 96% of those as producers and just to recap, the Mid-Continent for us is a number of different plays.", "Primarily it is our Cana Woodford Shale play, but it also includes our traditional Western Oklahoma tight sand play, our Southern Oklahoma, we have a number of fields there we exploit for oily reservoirs it also includes our Texas Panhandle. We are invested $180.7 million year-to-date in these Mid-Continent plays, which amounts to about 49% of our total capital.", "The majority of that drilling occurred in our Western Oklahoma Anadarko Basin, Woodford Shale Cana play where Cimarex has participated in 37 gross or 15.7 net wells this year. Currently, there are 11 gross or 6.9 net wells waiting on completion or in the process of being completed. We\u2019ve talked about that in the past we\u2019ve slowed our completion scheduled down while we\u2019ve done a lot of science this year. We currently have nine operated wells cased, ready to be completed.", "We are going to get those things completed just as soon as we can get frac crews mobilized and do so. Since the Cana play began in late 2007, we\u2019ve participated in a total of 67 gross or 28.6 net wells, of which 49 gross or 18.8 net wells have been brought on production and the remainder of those wells are either in the process of being drilled or awaiting completion.", "As I said, there are nine operated wells which have been on production for about a year or more. Those nine wells, on average, had an average first 30 day rate of 3.8 million cubic feet per day and we\u2019re still producing 1.7 million cubic feet per day on average 12 months later, which calculates to a first year decline of 55%. ", "Now, that average 30 day rate of our existing nine wells that been on for a year or more include number of wells for which there were significant mechanical problems. So, we are certainly getting much better with our completions. We\u2019ve run some nice wells lately and we are very optimistic about this play. In the core area where Cimarex and Devon kicked off the play and where the majority of the drilling has occurred, our average estimated ultimate recovery per well is 6.4 Bcf equivalent.", "That\u2019s our actual average based on our own well decline curve analysis. This average includes wells which we didn\u2019t get effective fracs off or had other operational challenges. If you look at all of the wells in our core area, you see a range that goes from the low side of 2.5 Bcf equivalent to a high side of 12 Bcf equivalent or better, with the majority of these wells hitting somewhere in the middle. So we are very, very optimistic about our own results.", "We had some very nice wells we brought online and as we get more and more production history, we are seeing that this play has a flatter decline characteristic than many of the Shale plays that are getting attention. Within the Cana play, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we have a fairly significant acreage block that\u2019s in the southern part of the play outside of the core area where we\u2019ve done most of our drilling.", "In our Southern area, we currently have a well drilling called the Calvert 116, and this is - Woodford Shale is approximately 150 feet thick as compared with 300 feet or more in our more heavily drilled core area. We don\u2019t have as much well control in this area, so to the extent that we have frontier areas in this play, this Calvert is certainly a frontier well for us. The only other well we have in the area is a well called the Petri 213, which we brought on production last February.", "This was when we were still struggling with our completion techniques and in completing the Petri well were only able to effectively complete three out of the nine hydraulic frac stages in the lateral. The well came on at slightly less than 1 million cubic feet a day, 30 day average, but oddly the well inclined or the production rate increased over time instead of decreasing and it hit a high of approximately 1.5 million cubic feet a day.", "So we\u2019re very interested in our results for the Calvert. We will follow it with another well in that Southern area. We are very optimistic that we will be able to make economic wells in this thinner area of the Woodford Shale. We currently have three operated rigs drilling in the Cana play and we will bring on an additional three rigs beginning in December of this year through the first quarter of 2010.", "As Mick said, this is a large resource for us and it promises to be an important part of our portfolio for a long, long time. We are also working on evaluating the appropriate spacing on which to develop the Cana Woodford. We are coordinating and participating in an 80 acre or 8 wells per section pilot project and possibly even going to a 9 or 10 well per section test.", "We currently expect to have this project completed by the first half of 2010, so we will drill these wells in the first and second quarter and be completing these wells in our 80 acre pilot program beginning in April. Everything we talk about when we talk about the resource potential of Cimarex, as Mick said, is based on 160 acre spacing, or four wells per section, so if this play and our pilot program gives us encouragement on 80 acre or 8 well per section spacing, it will be significant to Cimarex.", "We are very excited about this play. We\u2019re still learning a lot. There\u2019s a lot of very good challenging science going on here at Cimarex. What we learned in the core area we feel very comfortable about the potential resource and that we are comfortable saying the potential resource is larger than our current total proved reserve base. For the play, 2 to 3 Tcf equivalent is very real and hopefully, we could go higher as we continue to learn more.", "Moving on to the Permian Basin, our Permian focus for the last several years has been on horizontal oil opportunities. With improving oil prices and lower service costs, returns look very, very strong to us. We currently have four operated rigs drilling. As I said, we intend to go to seven operated rigs here in the middle of January, and those will all be working on oil projects, mostly horizontal.", "For the first nine months of 2009, we have drilled 35 gross or 26 net wells, 94% of which we completed as producers. We\u2019ve invested $108 million year-to-date in the Permian, which amounts to about 29% of our total capital.", "In Southeast New Mexico, we\u2019ve drilled this year 26 gross or 21.4 net wells, 5 gross or 4.5 net horizontal Abo wells, 17 gross or 13.6 net shallow Delaware wells, and 4 gross or 3.3 net Bone Spring wells in Southeast New Mexico. Our Abo play continues to look very promising to us.", "We\u2019ve recently brought on production our Midway 17 Federal 4H, that\u2019s a 100% working interest. Its first 30 day average, it was 280 barrels per day. Our Drumstick 7 Federal 1H well, again 100% working interest. Its first 30 day average was 230 barrels per day. I want to emphasize that we always talk about 30 day averages, because we find that number to be the more meaningful number.", "We don\u2019t typically quote IP or flush production rates, but it\u2019s worthy to note that our Midway well did produce well in excess of 500 barrels per day as an initial flush production rate. Other notable 30 day average rates from our Delaware wells, we\u2019ve drilled in 2009 include our Pintail 23-5, a 100% working interest well that averaged 275 barrels a day for its first 30 days and our White City 14 Federal No. 7 horizontal well, where we have an 87% working interest. Its 30 day average was 225 barrels per day.", "So this is a snapshot of what we consider to be our normal operating business in the Permian Basin. We have a number of different plays that we are currently developing. We have a number of different plays that are currently within development that we haven\u2019t tested or we\u2019re out leasing on. We have just a very, very nice portfolio of horizontal well plays. As I said, that would include our shallow Delaware play, our second Bone Spring in New Mexico, our Abo in Southeast New Mexico, third Bone Spring play of Ward, Winkler County in Texas.", "We run our economics on a $45 flat oil price, held flat forever, that\u2019s a NYMEX price and then we look at the local market deducts, that\u2019s our threshold. We want to see reasonable returns at those flat prices and we\u2019ve got a number of projects that look very, very nice to us at those oil prices.", "So we\u2019ve seen a little moderation in drilling completion costs. We\u2019ve got some great projects both currently under development and on the drilling board, and our Permian region is just really becoming a solid, very, very nice business for us. It\u2019s nice to have that oil in the current oil gas product price relationship. As I said, we currently have four operated rigs drilling horizontal oil wells in the Permian Basin and that\u2019s one in West Texas and three in Southeast New Mexico.", "I\u2019ll finish with our third core area, which is the onshore Gulf Coast. Onshore Gulf Coast, we\u2019ve drilled five gross or 4.9 net wells during the first nine months of the year. We\u2019ve invested $71 million year-to-date in the Gulf Coast, which amounts to about 19% of our total capital. Most of the activities then are Southeast Texas Yegua/Cook Mountain play where we\u2019ve drilled four gross or four net wells with a 75% success rate.", "The drilling has primarily been in Jefferson County, Texas, right near the edge of the city limits of Beaumont. As you know, in early July 2009, we brought on production in our Two Sisters No. 1, that was 100% working interest well, 75% net revenue interest and that came on at approximately 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.", "That 40 million cubic feet equivalent breaks down to 25 million cubic feet of gas and 2500 barrels of oil per day, gross. It\u2019s still currently producing at that rate. That\u2019s obviously a very, very nice well when we quote 40 million cubic feet equivalent, that\u2019s a 6:1 equivalence ratio of oil to gas and that 25 million feet a day and 2500 barrels of oil with the current relationship between oil price and gas price, that oil is really, really a nice product stream right out of that well.", "In October 2009, we brought on production another discovery, our Garth No. 1, there it\u2019s again 100% working interest and 75% net revenue interest. It\u2019s currently producing at approximately 32 million cubic feet equivalent per day and that breaks down to 22 million cubic feet a day of gas and 1700 barrels a day of oil, that\u2019s gross, so some very, very nice wells. We\u2019re also very encouraged how these wells have confirmed our seismic amplitude versus offset interpretation and we have a number of additional drilling prospects of very, very high quality, we\u2019re very excited about.", "We have two rigs running on this play in Southeast Texas in our Yegua/Cook Mountain play. They are currently drilling another prospect off this chute, we call it the Mekong prospect and we\u2019re currently drilling or completing the Jefferson Airplane No. 2 and Jefferson Airplane No. 3 wells. I have some timely information for you on the Jefferson Airplane No. 2 well. We logged it this morning, logged a very, very nice 130 feet of net pay. That well will be online here probably within a week to 10 days. Joe will talk about that, but our production group has raced ahead to get that well online, because we\u2019re in a competitive situation there.", "We\u2019ve got about half a feature that is shared with a couple of competitors across our lease line. One of our competitors has drilled two wells that are currently producing in excess of 30 million cubic feet a day. So we certainly think our Jefferson Airplane No. 2 well has that kind of potential. We have a 90% working interest in that well. We\u2019ll follow it with our Jefferson Airplane No. 3 well, which should be down here in the next couple of weeks. We think we have two more wells at least to drill within that same reservoir.", "Our Gulf Coast group is really having a very nice year and it has a great prospect set behind that will bleed into next year. So our three core businesses, as Mick said our resource play in the Mid-Continent, our Permian Basin in horizontal oil project, and our Gulf Coast seismically driven high risk, high volume play are all doing very, very well and had a very good quarter.", "Now, with that, I will turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Joe Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you all of you for joining our call. I\u2019ll quickly summarize our Q3 production results, along with our fourth quarter guidance and touch on where we\u2019re seeing service costs, and then follow-up with a focus with a discussion on the focus of our production operations group during the last quarter. For Q3, we reported average net daily equivalent production of 441.5 million a day. That\u2019s right at the midpoint of our projected guidance for the quarter of 435 million to 450 million a day.", "Although we\u2019re down 3% from our second quarter average of 454 million a day, the decline was expected and directly related to our cutback in activity in late \u201808 and early \u201809. That said, as you can gather from both Mick and Tom\u2019s conversations, our recent increase in activity and successes in South Texas are really showing up on the radar screen and helping to offset our production decline as we enter Q4 here. I will touch more on that in just a moment.", "The majority of our production drop from Q2 to Q3 came on the gas side with our oil production for the most part holding its ground. With third quarter total company oil production of 22,439 barrels a day, were essentially flat to our second quarter our second quarter average of 22,706 barrels a day.", "Our Two Sisters No. 1 well, which as Tom mentioned came on in July, it has played a key role in our oil production in the quarter, accounting for 1,820 net barrels a day during the quarter or 8% of our reported total. With the recent success of that well and the program, our regional distribution of oil has shifted and will continue to shift around as we progress here in Q4 and into Q1.", "At the end of Q3, our Permian regions still accounted for the majority of our oil production, producing 13,021 net barrels a day during the quarter, or about 58% of our total, while the Mid-Continent made up 22% and the Gulf Coast 18%, up from 11% in the second quarter, this, again, primarily a result of the Two Sisters well.", "Both Mick and Tom mentioned this oil does continue to play a critical role in our operations. On a six to one equivalent basis, oil now makes up 30% of our total company production, up from 28% a year ago, yet is generating 53% to 55% of our total oil and gas revenues.", "On the gas side, our slowdown in activity resulted in drops in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian areas, down 10% and 6% respectively from Q2 \u201809. Our Gulf Coast gas production, however, was up 31% from last quarter. Again, this was fueled by our Two Sisters well, which accounted for net gas production of 17.5 million a day during the quarter.", "Our total net gas production during Q3 was 306.8 million a day with the Mid-Continent representing the lion\u2019s share of production at 58%, followed by the Permian at 24% and the Gulf Coast at 15%. Well, during our last call, we mentioned that we were hopeful to be seeing signs of a production turnaround by the fourth quarter. We are seeing positive indications in that regard from each of the three core programs. In Cana, our equivalent net production averaged approximately 31 million a day in Q3 \u201809 and that\u2019s up from 11 million a day in Q3 \u201808.", "As Tom mentioned, we have planned increase in activity in Q4, not only with an increase in our rig count, but also an accelerated focus on the nine wells that have still yet to be completed. In South Texas, our Two Sisters No. 1 came on in July at a net equivalent rate of 30 million a day, and our Garth No. 1 came in October at a stabilized net equivalent rate of about 28 million a day.", "In addition to these completions, we have two wells currently drilling which are offsetting competitor discoveries, one of which, as Tom mentioned, logged to 130 feet of pay overnight and we had a little bit of confidence in this play to the extent that we had our facilities built and the wells are drilling. The facilities build offsite at a centralized location were hooked up to our gas sales lines.", "We are currently just boring our two phase line to get over to the centralized facility and we are hopeful that we can be on production within days or hours of removing or rigging off the rig that is on location. In the Permian, our third core area, our \u201809 drilling activity is at 11 million a day and keep in mind, when I mention that number, that during Q1 and Q2, that\u2019s where we really pared back a lot of rigs.", "As we move into Q4, that number should increase with our increased activity in the area during Q3 and Q4. So as a result, our fourth quarter guidance reflects the turnaround in our production and despite selling approximately 8 million a day of net equivalent production, our current modeling calls for Q4 guidance of 440 million to 455 million a day, which, after adjusting for property sales, represents a 3% increase from Q2 \u201809 using the midpoint of our guidance.", "We are fairly confident in the risking we have placed on our fourth quarter inventory, but the timing of drilling and completion of the wells in queue are going to end up playing a big role in our fourth quarter volumes and of course our 2009 exit rate. With our projection for the fourth quarter, our full year guidance computes out to 455 million to 460 million a day and that locks us into the upper end of our original beginning year 2009 guidance of 440 million to 460 million a day.", "As far as looking into 2010 is concerned, we are still in the midst of our planning cycle and we will be in a better position to more accurately predict our production guidance once we have completed our planning process, seen a little bit about how our fourth-quarter inventory falls out, which wells we get on when and at what rates and then of course see more of market conditions as we close the year to firm down our budget for 2010.", "On the service costs side, as Mick mentioned, we seem to have seen a bottom in some of our costs. We saw a number of our drilling and completion cost components certainly bottom out during Q3, but that said, we did continue to see further cost reductions in a small number of items such as cementing, directional work, surface rentals and pipe in particular. Steel prices have been on the decline since the beginning of the year and they dropped about another 10% during Q3 alone.", "These cost reductions, coupled with our continued operating efficiencies, they\u2019ve really allowed us to put another notch in our well cost. As an example, our current Cana AFEs are running around 7 million a day and that\u2019s down from about 8 million a day in the second quarter. Then the Permian, a typical Cherry Canyon horizontal well in the Delaware Basin, is now AFE at around 1.4 million a day down from 1.6 million a day in Q2.", "Our Southeast New Mexico Bone Spring reentry is AFE for about 2 million a day. That\u2019s down 20% from 2.4 million a day in the second quarter. So although costs are bottoming out, our efficiencies are helping to further reduce our total well cost. When you take a rearview mirror and look back, depending on the program and the well design, we\u2019ve seen our drilling and completion costs drop anywhere from 25% to 40% since the peaks we saw in 2008.", "Lastly, a few words on the focus of our production operations group during the third quarter. As we\u2019ve mentioned in our previous calls, with a reduced exploitation budget, the group has been focused on optimizing production and trying to lower lifting costs on our base properties where they can. Through Q3, the group performed 341 projects, which totaled $38 million with a strong focused on lift and low cost, high impact recompletions.", "Our emphasis on LOE continues to hit our bottom line. Through Q3, our own \u201809 production costs have averaged $46.4 million a quarter and that\u2019s down 15% from our 2008 average of $54.7 million a quarter. Driving those reductions, the bigger cost reduction components we\u2019ve seen 20% to 30% cost reductions in surface and wellhead equipment, water disposal, electricity and fuel, and well servicing.", "On a net dollars per Mcfe basis, production costs have dropped 11.5% from $1.23 per Mcfe in \u201808 to $1.10 per Mcfe through the first three quarters of \u201809. With $38 million of exploitation capital down through Q3, we\u2019re on track to hit the low end of our budget, beginning year budget of $50 million to $60 million, inclusive of non-op offshore platform abandonment\u2019s, which we\u2019re estimating to spend $12 million on during this year. Most of that capital has already been incurred.", "Through Q3, a good chunk of our expenditures went towards optimizing oil and gas production via lift from Plunger Lift to conventional rod pump and/or gas lift, where applicable. Our Q4 inventory includes a continued focused on those types of projects as well as a number of select recompletion projects in all areas, as well as a handful of low risk infill drilling projects in Kansas and West Texas; so, so far so good for \u201809.", "Despite property sales were at the upper end of beginning year production guidance, increased activity and recent successes in South Texas have reversed our production decline. Cost reductions and efficiencies have substantially reduced our drilling and completion AFEs and we\u2019ve done a good job optimizing production from our base properties while lowering LOE. So we feel like we\u2019ve made some good progress here in 2010 and now, we just need to take it the next step forward.", "So with that, I will turn the call over to Paul Korus, our VP and CFO.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. With our production poised to take an upturn here beginning in the fourth quarter, lower operating costs on track to have substantially lower finding costs in 2009, compared to what we\u2019ve had in previous years. We feel very good about how we\u2019re going to end 2009.", "From an earnings and cash flow perspective, those of you that watch the gas market closely know that Mid-Continent basis differentials have evaporated and in fact, for November midweek, Mid-Continent gas was actually at a small premium to Gulf Coast gas and of course, we continue to benefit from the high Btu content of our Mid-Continent sales and we benefit from the fact that we have a greater proportion of our production coming from the Gulf Coast with these big wells that we\u2019ve been drilling.", "So like I mentioned, we should have a very strong finish to 2009, but we\u2019re also very well positioned for 2010. As Mick, and Tom, and Joe repeatedly mentioned, we have a large inventory of things to do. We like that inventory. We like its diversity, but financially, we\u2019re also in good shape.", "Our bank debt post an October 1 property sale has been around $100 million to $120 million lately. That\u2019s about $100 million less than it was at the end of 2008 and so we have $700 million of unused commitments on our $800 million credit facility. So we\u2019re in great shape from that perspective.", "While we\u2019ve had several things that have contributed to ups and downs in our cash flow and our funding of CapEx this year, at the end of the day, you can simply look at it and say \u201cWell, we sold about $115 million worth of assets and we reduced our bank debt by about a like amount.\u201d So that\u2019s how you can kind of think about that.", "Then as we look towards our cash flow and capital expenditures for next year, we should benefit from the downside protection that we have in place in the form of our oil and gas hedges. To remind everyone, even though it\u2019s laid out in the news release and other places, we\u2019ve essentially put a $5 per Mcf floor under much of our Mid-Continent gas production and about a $60 floor under the bulk of our Permian Basin oil production. ", "Now, looked at another way, you can say that these volumes equate to roughly 1.5 of what our total company gas and oil production will average for this year and hopefully, that will be less than 50% of what we average for next year, because we should see a return to growth.", "So what all that means is that, if we have another year of gas prices or weak gas prices I should say, or oil prices disappoint we should still be able to fund a $600 million to $700 million capital program, which would be up some from this year, but the floors help us take it up even more with our cash flow and of course, we have the credit facility to use as well.", "Alternatively, our costless collar ceilings are high enough that, if the forward curve for gas or oil were to happen to materialize or what many analysts price forecasts are would happen to materialize, we could be positioned to fund $800 million to $900 million or perhaps even more and really prepare our production growth as we go forward.", "So with that, I think its time to turn it over for questions-and-answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "I had a question about the Cana step out well to the south I guess for Tom. I guess I know you talked about having one section of the Shale that you felt would be most productive and I was just wondering is that the part of the Shale that you see to the South and I guess do you feel like, by the end of this year, you may know whether the kind of Tier 1 acreages significantly bigger than that 30,000 acres you\u2019ve talked about in the past?", "Tom Jorden", "When you say section, you mean vertically a stratigraphic interval?", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "stratigraphic I thought you said one part of it was kind of more brittle and..", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. As we go south, the most brittle member is actually a different Stratigraphic portion of the Woodford, so we still are targeting the most brittle member as best we can identify, but it just so happens that, if you were later the logs down and correlate them, we\u2019re currently drilling the Calvert well up into the center where we\u2019ve done all the rest of our drilling. It is a little stratigraphically higher in this section. So we are proceeding on the same principle. There is a nice, brittle layer there.", "It really is a function of our ability to effectively stimulate and then what the recoveries are. It is thinner, and we don\u2019t I am speculating here, Ray I want to be very clear I am speculating because we don\u2019t have any real, results, but we don\u2019t really expect the area to the south to be as prolific as the area to the north because it is thinner. It is just a question, Cana we make very nice economic wells down there? We\u2019ve got to get a couple of tests down before we can conclusively or probably a couple isn\u2019t sufficient, but it will be a lot more than we know today. We are collecting data.", "Ray Deacon - Pritchard Capital", "I was just wondering that the other two Yegua and Cook Mountain rigs that you have operating I guess will those we will you be able to get news from those wells before year end or?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, we have two rigs in the Yegua and Cook Mountain, one of which well, they are both really drilling on the same prospect. One is the well I mentioned that we logged this morning. The second is a location just about 1300 feet north it is in the same reservoir and so we expect there\u2019s a very high probability of success there.", "We think both of those wells will be online here in the next well, the first one, as we mentioned, should be online in the next week or ten days and the second one is probably a few weeks behind that and we see both of those wells as having the kind of potential that our offset operator has and they have two wells making 30 million cubic a day.", "Mick Merelli", "That\u2019s a competitive drainage situation; that\u2019s why we have two rigs in the prospect.", "Tom Jorden", "We are probably going to have three or four wells in that prospect by the time we\u2019re done. Then we have lots of nice prospects in the Gulf Coast Survey. So we\u2019ll have at least those three rigs running for some time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "In terms of F&D costs, Paul, could you give us any sort of broad outline for that? As kind of a follow-up, in terms of booking PUDs with the Cana play now, do you think there\u2019s potential to book a reasonable portion of PUDs there?", "Paul Korus", "Eric, one, I\u2019m not going to let you pin me down on a number, but we\u2019ve had our challenges with finding costs in the past. We don\u2019t expect to have a challenge this year. Clearly, the Cana play is contributing. I mean, you listen to the drilling and completion costs, you listen to what we\u2019re adding in terms of reserves, understand that the acreage cost was incurred last year, not this year. So we benefit from that timing difference as well.", "The other thing you\u2019ve got to remember is, one other thing, is that the price of oil is twice what it was at the end of last year, and we had a lot of negative revisions, so we\u2019re going to get some of that back. That\u2019s going to help. Then yes, you will see us begin to add proven undeveloped locations, per the rules, probably a conservative interpretation of the rules, in the Cana play, which is also going to help. So we\u2019ve got a lot of things working in our favor, some of which may sound cosmetic, but some of which are very real, too. I mean we do have low costs in the Cana play.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "Then moving to the Abo, could you give us an idea of what a well costs there? Do you have an EUR estimate in that play yet or...?", "Tom Jorden", "Our garden variety Abo well is between $3.5 million to $4 million to drill and complete and our garden variety reserves are 250,000 to 300,000 barrels.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "I don\u2019t know. Have you stated how much acreage you have in the play yet, or not?", "Tom Jorden", "We have, and I just can\u2019t recall what the exact number is. We\u2019re probably 20,000 acres, maybe 18,000. If you want to call me, Eric, I can give you an exact number. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "Is that more of net or gross when you just off the top of your head?", "Tom Jorden", "I think that\u2019s net. I hate to speak off-the-cuff. I have those in my office; I just don\u2019t have them in front of me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Robertson - Barclays Investors.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Investors", "Tom, in the Cana play, can you talk a little bit about the 80-acre pilot that you all planned for the first half of 2010 in terms of what, if any, differences you\u2019ll make in well completions and also what kind of reserve expectations you would have for increased density spaced wells?", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, I can tell you what we\u2019re going to do operationally. We\u2019ll drill four wells. We have a partner that\u2019s going to drill five wells on their side of the lease line, so the way we\u2019re intending it, it will be a nine-well program, or coordinate the completions, we\u2019re still coordinate the completions. We\u2019re still in the process of formulating our plans. There may be some simul fracs in that. We will certainly frac them all and then flow them back, we won\u2019t produce, while we\u2019re completing.", "The big unknown is, are those going to be purely incremental reserves or will there be a fairly significant acceleration component? So we\u2019ll certainly monitor those completions with micro-seismic. For those of you that are, unfamiliar with that, that\u2019s a technique where we can actually monitor by putting geo-phones down-hole. They can actually sense and map the growing hydraulic fracture", "We try to see, to the extent that when we hydraulically fracture a well, does its fracture network interfere with adjacent wells or does it not interfere and thereby efficiently drain its own capture or drainage area.", "So those will be questions that we will be wanted to get answered and then the other question, Jeff, is going to be are the infill wells going to get the same estimate of ultimate recovery of the parent wells. While we get eight times a single well, or will there be some reduced multiple. Right now, we just don\u2019t know and until we do that pilot program, it would be just rank speculation.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays Investors", "Tom, just as a follow-up, on a pilot like that, how much time do you want to be able to evaluate the production before you feel like you have enough data to start making some determinations as to whether or not this is the right way to proceed or not?", "Tom Jorden", "That\u2019s a tough question and you\u2019ll get a different answer from anybody you ask, but you asked me, so I\u2019ll give you my answer. I would think, within two or three months of production. We\u2019ll know how these wells are trending. We really find that at a first 30 day average, if we look at the pressures of the well.", "We look at the rate of decrease of that pressure, that we can get a pretty good idea of what kind of well it\u2019s going to be after 30 to 40 days of sustained production. So with a project like that, when we get them all completed and online, I would guess within two or three months we\u2019ll be able to know something fairly definitive about the results.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Wei Romualdo - Stone Harbor.", "Wei Romualdo - Stone Harbor", "The working capital, is anything onetime in nature this quarter or do you just expect will give back some next quarter or will become a use of cash?", "Paul Korus", "It was very large this quarter. If you studied closely the statement of cash flows, there\u2019s a couple of things I want to point out to you. One is actually above the line of the changes in operating assets and working capital called a change in non-current assets and liabilities of $43 million, roughly. That includes a $50 million refund of tax payments that we made in 2008 in the first half of the year, when everybody in the industry was looking like they were going to have substantial taxable income for the year 2008 and of course, then the bottom fell out.", "So we got a refund of estimated payments we had made the prior year and then you see that, down below that there was quite a swing in other assets. Some of other current assets and payables, some of that is just the effect of changing prices, the effect of using up some of our current inventory of tubulars and those types of things, so a long way of saying pretty much onetime. We think that our changes in working capital will pretty much stabilize and probably round to zero.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Brody - JP Morgan.", " ", "Greg Brody - JP Morgan", "Just two questions for you. The first one, Paul, you were suggesting that your CapEx can move around based on cash flow. I was just curious what the 18 rig program meant in terms of CapEx for next year?", "Paul Korus", "We don\u2019t have that quantified yet, Greg. So I can\u2019t give you an answer on that on the 18 rigs, but we have a very long history, just look at our numbers for the last, since Cimarex was created in 2002. If you want to go back to predecessor operations, you\u2019re welcome to do that as well. Our capital expenditures on E&D and cash flow usually match up, within 10%, as close as we can get it, given the volatility that we have in prices and costs and those types of things.", "So we would generally expect the same thing to occur in 2010. However, if we have big disappointment in gas prices again or oil prices, we do have our credit facility. It wouldn\u2019t bother us to borrow $100 million on our credit facility if we needed to, because you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that we will, we\u2019re sitting here with total debt right now, which is going to be only about 85% of this year\u2019s, 2009\u2019s EBITDA, which is a very depressed level of EBITDA. So whether you want to look at debt to cap ratios, whether you want to look at debt coverage ratios, putting on another $100 million of bank debt would certainly not be a problem.", "Tom Jorden", "From an exploration standpoint, the 18 rigs is about $700 million of capital spending and so if we layer on additional obligations on our operations side and other expenditures, I would guess that it would be somewhere in the mid $800 million. It would certainly be a capital level that could sustain an 18 rig program, but as Paul said, that\u2019s a moving target and we really haven\u2019t finalized our 2010 plans; we are in that process.", "Paul Korus", "Then you have the other variable that if prices go up or even stay where the forward curve is, you are likely to see increases in service costs. If prices disappoint, you are likely to see further reductions in service costs. So, everything is related to everything.", "Greg Brody - JP Morgan", "", "Then just a final question, just in terms of acquisition opportunities is there anything out there that you\u2019re seeing that looks interesting. What does the environment look like?", "Paul Korus", "We\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at right now in each of our core areas, so we are not at all active in the acquisition market. That\u2019s not to say we wouldn\u2019t be receptive to something, but we are currently not active.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Coleman - UBS.", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "One was I guess staying on the M&A theme a little bit. You had in the release you had sold a small little chunk of assets there. It looks like the biggest piece of it was that field in Texas. Any chance you could tell us what the field was called?", "Joe Albi", "Yes, that was our Southwest Westbrook unit. Really, what it came down to is purchase this is Joe Albi that the purchase price incorporated a fair value for the upside that we saw in further development of the field. We saw there to be a fair amount of risk to that development as far as the results that we\u2019re going to be concerned that or were concerned, but the biggest aspect to it was that, from a rate of reinvestment standpoint, that field was making about $6 million a day. We are getting fair value for the upside with the purchase price and from a rate of reinvestment standpoint, it just told us to take the money and reinvest it into a higher rate of return oil projects.", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "Looking at the whole $117 million worth of properties of 28, was that a meaningful well count?", "Joe Albi", "Westbrook itself had a couple hundred wells to it.", "Paul Korus", "", "Yes, as a waterflood.", "Joe Albi", "As a big waterflood unit very old.", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "The rest of those properties that you sold throughout the year, it looks like you kind of like producing wells in the 12,000 range\u2026", "Joe Albi", "One was announced that operated waterflood that, again we got paid full value for the upside in the flood and I think it was making 160 net Mcf a day or something like that, and we got a very nice price for it. They are basically just not in our core areas. ", "Mick Merelli", "That\u2019s what it really gets down to, is that we have some assets that are in someone\u2019s focus area and they are not in our focus area. They see value in it that we either don\u2019t see or we won\u2019t exploit for quite a while and so, it just makes sense, at that point, to if the price is reasonable, for them to take that asset and for us to take the money and put it someplace where we are going to spend it.", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "Absolutely and then I guess the last question about that is probably because of its size, it\u2019s not going to have a meaningful impact on LOE, but theoretically, because it is a waterflood, it would be more expensive to operate.", "Joe Albi", "Relative to our total LOE picture, it\u2019s not going to drop our LOE significantly.", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "Paul mentioned that differentials had narrowed significantly there in the Mid-Continent I guess are you guys looking more a hedging basis to kind of protect some of that or and I guess as the outlook unfolds, how much stability would you need to have to put a few more rigs to work there?", "Paul Korus", "Multiple parts to the question; one, just because the basis converges in one month does not mean that the forward curve basis converges. So where the forward curve basis is right now Mid-Continent to Henry Hub is not a whole lot different than it was when we put our hedges on earlier this year.", "As it pertains to 2010, we consider ourselves done in terms of our hedging program for 2010 production. So the next question then is, \u201cWhen will we begin to hedge 2011?\u201d We have no current plans to do that over the next few months. So we can visit with you again about that when we release year end numbers in February, but between now and then, we don\u2019t anticipate doing anything.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Greg Vortalon - Decade Capital.", "Greg Vortalon - Decade Capital", "Tom, you\u2019d mentioned, in your prepared remarks, some commentary around improving completion techniques in the Cana. Could you elaborate on what that means?", "Tom Jorden", "We\u2019ve had quite a technical project going on this year on the proper completion techniques for the Cana play. It still is going, although we\u2019ve had some very good recent results. We\u2019ve experimented with various water volumes. It\u2019s a slick water frac, predominantly, various sand volumes.", "We\u2019ve experimented with how we pump those volumes, whether we pump them in sweeps or continuous ramp in terms of our propping. We\u2019ve experimented with acids of different types and natures and we\u2019ve experimented with polymers. Many operators in some of these plays will use a hybrid job between slick water and some kind of a gel, typically a linear gel. We\u2019ve experimented with all of those. ", "I will say our most recent completion is one where we have a little pre-pad of asset followed by some 100 mesh profit, and then our typical risen coded 4070.A volume that we settled on is somewhere between 250,000 and 350,000 pounds per stage, generally on the high side of that, usually about 400,000 gallons per stage slick water.", "Cimarex is currently not using any gel. We have it on location if we need it. We\u2019ve had a bit of a struggle from inception to date in the Cana play in that we were really having a hard time putting all of our profit away.", "We would have a well that may have anywhere from 9 to 13 hydraulic fracture stages, and we may have intended to be pumping anywhere from 180,000 to 250,000 pounds of sand per stage. What happens is, you\u2019re pumping the job, the pressure increases, the system locks up down hole and you can\u2019t get your profit away.", "Based on our completion study and putting a very good team together, both internally and in cooperation with our partner, we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we\u2019re fairly reliably pumping every stage we attempt and that\u2019s been a huge technical battle for us. We\u2019re very confident now that those nine wells we have shut in waiting on completion, we can complete them and effectively stimulate them.", "Our last couple of wells has been very pleasing to us. So we\u2019re still evolving; we\u2019re still debating the efficacy of these polymers. We\u2019re still debating the efficacy of the 100 mesh, but we think we have a formula that is working for us and we\u2019re continuing to study it. Is that a long winded answer to a very short question?", "Greg Vortalon - Decade Capital", "No, I appreciate it. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Switching gears a little bit down South on the Gulf Coast. I think, on the last call, you guys had mentioned that you want a little bit of time to study the Two Sisters reservoir and whether or not it was one larger structure that may need some delineation or there might be an adjacent structure. Can you kind of give your thoughts on what time has taught you about the Two Sisters?", "Tom Jorden", "Two Sisters has been a stellar well. I mean time has taught us that those kind of wells are wonderful. Our estimate of the volumes on that well is, it\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of probably 30 Bcf. Now, we\u2019re going to watch that and there\u2019s still tremendous variance on that. We do have plans to offset it and drill a second well in that feature.", "Then the big unknown is going to be, will that second well be in direct reservoir communication or will it tap new reserves, but we will have a second well in that feature. We intend on getting that well our current rig schedule and we will be visiting on this in Tulsa tomorrow, but our current rig schedule calls for that second well to be spend sometime here in mid November and should be online sometime around the first of the year.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. Gentlemen, do you have any closing remarks.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you everyone, for participating today on the conference call. If you have any follow up questions, please give us a ring and maybe hopefully we will see you in New York at the Banc of America/Merrill Lynch conference on Tuesday, November 17.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford, Director  of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sir. ", "Mark Burford", "", "Thank you and thank you everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter results conference call. We did issue our press release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website and we also posted to our website a presentation that has some statistics and we will also be referring to from time to time on today\u2019s call. That can be found on the same path also on the same link for the webcast on our website at the Investor Relations tab. ", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements. The risks associated with these forward-looking statements have been outlined in our earnings release and in Cimarex\u2019s SEC filings and we incorporate those to reference during this call. ", "On the call here today in Denver we have Mick Merelli, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Jorden, Executive Vice President of Exploration; Joe Albi, EVP of Operations; Paul Korus, VP and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, our Controller. ", "With that we will go ahead and just jump in and I will turn the call over to Mick for some opening remarks. ", "", "Mick Merelli", "", "Thank you all for joining us today I am just going to make a few brief statements and then turn the call over to the boys to explain the details. ", "2009 was a very, very interesting year for Cimarex. We started the year in a tremendous slowdown of activity. Actually after we got a quarter or so into the year we were probably at the lowest level of activity we have ever had at Cimarex in terms of number of drilling rigs operating. Then as we headed into the year we started to pick up momentum and by the time we got to the end of the year 2009 has wound up being probably one of the best, if not the best year, Cimarex has had. ", "In terms of accomplishments we invested $524 million in our exploration and development drilling. We added 312 Bcfe improved reserves from the drilling which is 185% of our production. So we have more than replaced our production with drilling reserves. Our year-end exit rate for the company was 486 MMcfe/d and that included 150 MMcfe/d of production that was attributable to our 2009 drilling program. ", "We had really good results from all of our areas. Again, we continue on with the same old story for us. We are rate of return driven. We are growth through drill bit driven. We have a nice blend in our portfolio of drilling opportunities. Our mid-continent counter resource play we have 94,000 net acres in that play. This has been a year of definition for us. It is continuing. So we have drilled more wells. We have learned more about the play. As Tom will explain a little bit later the play looks better. The longer we are involved in it the better it looks so it is continuing to improve. ", "Our Permian Basin horizontal oil project group is driven by 380,000 net acres of lease position. We have a nice mix of opportunities. We got down to zero rigs for awhile in that play. We started picking up activity towards the end of the year and Tom I am sure will talk a little bit about that. ", "Of course our Gulf Coast exploration has always been a good, profitable drilling program for us. But 2009 was really an outstanding year. ", "So as we look into 2010 we are entering 2010 with a large inventory of drilling projects that have good economics. They are actually resistant to some pretty low commodity price levels. I don\u2019t know if Tom is going to even mention it or not but we run everything on a downside case of $3.50 gas and $45 oil flat. ", "We have a nice group of things to drill in all of our areas heading into 2010. Right now we are thinking that is going to be somewhere between $700-900 million we are going to spend on our drilling program in 2010. That is just an estimate. So anyway, we head into the year with lots of opportunities, low debt and high production so we are really excited about what is coming up in 2010 and we are very proud of our results in 2009. ", "With that I will let Tom go ahead. Tom Jorden. ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "Thank you Mick. This is Tom Jorden. For those of you that are following on our slides on our website I am going to be on slide eight. Slide eight shows our core operating areas. As Mick said we have our mid-continent project, our Permian basin predominately horizontal oil and then our on-shore Gulf Coast. ", "Our 2009 end of year reserves were 1.53 TCFE of which 47% of those were mid-continent, 32% were Permian on an equivalent basis. Then 7% were Gulf Coast and 14% kind of western and other. This slide also shows our fourth quarter 2009 projection of 486 MMcfe/d and how that splits up. As you can see from the slide for those of you that are following along, 44% of it was mid-continent and 31% Permian. So mid-continent and Permian is our core modern risk drilling areas account for 75% of our production. Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter accounted for 25% of our production. ", "So although the Gulf Coast is only 7% of our reserves, in the fourth quarter it accounted for 25% of our production. That is a testament to the success we have had on-shore in southeast Texas with our geophysically based plays. I will give a little more detail on that in a minute. It also is a testament to rate of return and how high a rate of return those projects are even though they are a small part of our production base, huge, huge production and cash flow properties. ", "Moving onto slide 9, this shows our capital investment broken down by region and as a comparison between our 2009 and 2010 planned programs. As Mick said in 2009 exploration development capital we invested $524 million. 48% of that was in the mid-continent. 30% of that was in the Permian and 20% was in the Gulf Coast. In terms of activity level in aggregate in 2009 we drilled 110 gross and 67 net wells; 51 gross net wells in mid-continent, 22 net; 49 gross wells in the Permian basin, 36 net; 9 gross wells in the Gulf Coast, 8 net. ", "In 2010 we are planning an exploration development capital of between $700-900 million. That is a fairly broad range. We are going kind of steady as she goes. We are watching our cash flow. We are watching the available opportunity set. We are watching product prices and watching costs. We certainly have the ability to accelerate or decelerate that number based on the conditions. ", "Of that $700-900 million in 2010 we expect 52% of that to be in mid-continent and the bulk of that is our Cana play. 31% would be Permian basin and that is horizontal oil and then 16% of that capital will be Gulf Coast and that is the high risk, high potential geophysically driven program that is a continuity of 2009. ", "If you look at the midpoint of that capital range we are estimating about 110 gross wells; 45 net wells in mid-continent; 85 gross wells or 60 net wells in the Permian and about 15 gross wells, 12 net in the Gulf Coast. Total activity we are projecting for 2010 is 210 gross wells or 117 net wells. When you compare that activity to 2009 you see that is almost twice the activity and obviously it is not twice the capital. A big portion of that is costs have come down a lot in 2009. ", "Certainly if you look at the first quarter we had a lot of carry-over capital from 2008 where drilling completion costs were at historical highs and that certainly impacted us in 2009. As we have talked in subsequent calls and Joe may get into this we certainly have seen costs moderate and we are just flat out getting more value for our adjusted dollar today than we were in 2008 and first half 2009. ", "Moving onto slide 10 this is a summary of our mid-continent region. It is a summary of our reserves and our capital. It compares our 2008 end of year reserves with 2009 end of year reserves for oil and gas. As you can see in 2009 our oil reserves in mid-continent were up 40% from end of year 2008. Our gas reserves were up 18% from end of year 2008 and on an equivalent basis and this is 6:1 equivalent. Our aggregate reserves for mid-continent we ended 2009 with 730 Bcfe as compared to 609 Bcfe in 2008. That is a 20% increase in reserves out of our mid-continent. ", "The present value on a 10% discount is less than 2009 and that is a function of the prevailing price at the end of the period. Our production in the mid-continent was for oil we were down 9% in 2009 compared to 2008. For gas we were down 1% 2009 compared to 2008 and on an equivalent basis 2009 in the mid-continent we produced 218 Bcfe and in 2008 we produced 223 Bcfe so we were down 2%. That is by and large a function of our rig count. As a company we went from 43 rigs in the third quarter of 2008 to 3 rigs in February of 2009. ", "So we have talked about that in prior calls and as we have picked up the activity we have certainly seen that production curve change slope on the rest of that decline. We have a great position in the mid-continent. As the slide shows we have a 1,077,000 gross, or 690,000 net acres. That is up 7% on a net acreage basis from 2008. I will give a little detail on the Cana play. We certainly continue to acquire interest there and we are very pleased with our position. ", "In the mid-continent in 2010 we are projecting $410 million of exploration development investment. That is up from $251 million in 2009 and we invested $648 million in 2008. I have already gone over the planned well statistics. We plan 110 gross or 45 net. So it is a nice asset and it is one we are exploiting aggressively. ", "Slide 11 shows the hallmark of that asset is our Cana Woodford Shale play here in Canadian County in Western Oklahoma. The insert shows where that sits for those of you who are unfamiliar with it, we are sitting due west of Oklahoma City. In 2009 we drilled 46 gross and 20 net wells. We have 11 gross and 6.3 net wells waiting on completion at year-end. So we talked on previous calls we had a lull in our completions. We put a lot of science behind studying optimum completion techniques. We made tremendous progress on that but we are still working our way through that completion backlog. In 2010 we are expecting to drill 75 gross and 35 net wells in the Cana play. Our year-end 2009 proved reserves totaled 225 BCFE. ", "On slide 11 there is a table summary of some recent wells we have completed and we have had some very good results but we are still struggling through it. I really want to emphasize to the listener this is still early days in the Cana play. We have a lot of success to report. We have a lot of quandaries to talk about as well. This is still an area we are unsure what the ultimate sweet spot will look like. We are wrestling the science. But the table shows our recent wells the base 225. Our first 30 day average on an equivalent was 3.4 MMcfe/d. Again that is an average rate for its first full month of production. ", "The Williams 136 averaged 4.67 MMcfe/d. The Bessie 16 averaged 8.55 MMcfe/d for its first 30 days. The Calvert is our southernmost well and was a disappointing well to us although I will talk about that a little more in a minute, it averaged 714,000 cubic feet per day for the first 30 days. The Anderson averaged 5.77 MMcfe/d for its first 30 days. The Draper averaged 8.44 MMcfe/d for its first 30 days of production. ", "So we have seen a really nice string of recent completions. Very stout pressures. Good 30 day rates. One of the nice things about the Cana play is the liquids. As you can see from our table on slide 11 our yields out here it really is a function of depth and they vary from dry gas at the deepest depths to upwards of 50 barrels of condensate per million cubic feet at some of the shallower depths. So that liquid stream really is significant. ", "While we are on this map we talked in the past about the Calvert well. Our test in the southernmost part of the play. We hoped to have something conclusive to say. All we can say conclusively is we had some mechanical issues with that well. We lost some portion of the lateral. We didn\u2019t stay in the zone we wanted to. Flat out I have to say we are disappointed in the results of the Calvert but we have a huge asterisk near it and we don\u2019t know what to conclude from that. We are currently in the process of completing a well a few miles to the northwest of it called the Straight Arrow that hopefully will be a second point that will help us make some conclusions about the southern extent of this play. ", "So Calvert was disappointing to us but there were lots of mechanical issues on that which make us say we are not ready to make any conclusions based on that completion. Nonetheless, we have had very, very good results in the Cana play particularly the most recent wells we have brought on line continue to surprise us. This play is looking better and better to us. Our go-forward type curve is looking very stout. ", "I want to take a minute and talk about our natural gas liquids in the Cana play. Historically I think we might have confused some of our listeners with the way we handle some of our natural gas liquids. We are not changing our fundamental approach but what we are doing is where we can book those liquids as volumes we are booking those liquids as volumes. Where we can\u2019t we treat them as price. In some of our prior calls we have talked about a receive price and we have run that natural gas liquid stream into our received price. ", "The way it works is we produce oil at the well site and that falls out as condensate. Then we also have a high BTU gas stream in the Cana play. Much of that gas is 1,200 BTU, and again on slide 12 for those of you who are following along on the slide show. What happens is that gas goes to a processing plant and additional liquids drop out as natural gas liquids. We have typically expressed that in terms of a realized price. Those natural gas liquids can be extremely significant with that high BTU gas stream. ", "In fact, the liquid stream in total can be as much as a 30% uplift in the overall volume equivalency of the well. So we have looked at our contracts and where we can book those liquids we are booking those liquids now. Where we can\u2019t we will continue to treat it as a price uplift. Nonetheless I think it is important to the listener to note those natural gas liquids in the Cana play are extremely significant to us in terms of play economics and we are not typically a midstream processor but where we can take delivery of those liquids and book them we are booking them. ", "So we do receive economic value after processing. We have contracts that give us a percent of proceeds. In our type curve we are going to be showing you a wet gas type curve and a dry gas type curve. That will be on the next slide. Our current product mix if you look at the plan aggregate is about 65% gas and 35% oil and NGL. So this liquids is significant if you look at the play and it is worthy of a discussion and bringing it to your attention. ", "When we look at slide 13 I would point your attention to a type curve. This is not our go-forward type curve. This type curve is a composite of what we have actually achieved historically. So our go-forward when we drill a new well in the core of the play that is significantly better than this, but this type curve is when we look at the historical drilling in the Cana play and we say what have we actually done, this is the type curve on slide 13. ", "For those of you who are looking at this in color we have a daily rate which are the two curves that are declining. The light blue curve is a wet liquid stream. So this would be the gas that is actually measured at the well head. The dash curve would be the net equivalent curve after we have stripped the liquids out. So we have talked in the past about a 6.5 Bcfe type curve. When we really account for those liquids that are produced on average in the play that type curve becomes an 8.5 Bcfe. That is volumes we would receive if we had a percent of proceeds contract at the tailgate of a processing plant. ", "Our 30 day average we have talked about 4.4 MMcfe/d but that is at the well head, wet, high BTU gas. Once we process that gas we look at an equivalent basis of the liquid that gets stripped out we are at a 5.8 MMcfe/d tailgate gas. So the conclusion here is when you look at the Cana play and you say Cimarex, for the wells you have drilled now that you have been in the play for 2.5 years what is your actual average result? Our actual average result if we take all the sins, all the successes, our actual average well on that play is an 8.5 Bcfe well that produces 5.8 MMcfe for its first 30 days. ", "So the liquids in this play are very, very significant to us. They certainly make a huge difference in the economics. In fact as you compare the Cana play to other resource plays two of the significant differences that are often overlooked are the value of those liquids but also the net revenue interest we achieve in that play. Our net revenue interest in the play is typically 80% or greater. So the economics of this play are tremendous and as our results are improving they just get better. ", "One slide 14, in summary in the Cana play, certainly for Cimarex it is significant future drilling. We continue to acquire acreage. At year end we had 94,000 net acres. Today we have about 98,000 net acres in the larger Cana play. Our actual results are 6.5-8.5 Bcfe per well. Our average lateral length today is 4,000 feet on 160 acre spacing. If we go 4 wells per section we will have 1,200 gross wells to drill on our acreage position, 400-500 net wells. So for a company our size this is a significant play. ", "We are underway on an 80 acre pilot project. We are currently drilling and we will be completing and analyzing the utility of going to eight wells per section. Hopefully we will have something meaningful to say about that. Certainly by the middle of the year we anticipate completing those wells in the spring of this year and we should have some data to report on whether we think an 80 acre development is feasible. ", "At 160 acre spacing our net potential is 2-3 Bcfe. We think that is real. We think that is achievable and we are very, very encouraged by our recent results. As you can see our costs have come down. In 2008 we were at $9.5-10 million per well to drilling complete. Our current estimate is $7.2 million per well and we think we have significant operational upside around that number. So the Cana play has continued to be a very, very successful play for us. We are just delighted to have it. ", "Moving along to slide 15, when we look at the Permian basin this is a similar summary slide. Year-end 2009 compared to year-end 2008 our oil reserves were up 25%. In the Permian our gas reserves were down 2%. On an equivalent basis our equivalent reserves at year-end 2009 were 487 Bcfe, 2008 they were 442 Bcfe. So we grew those reserves 10%. That is a phenomenal testament to our group in Midland both the exploration and the operations group because if you recall in late winter/early spring our rig count in the Permian was zero. So they really picked up the pace in the latter half of the year and had a very, very nice year. ", "Again our pre-tax PV10 end of year 2009 is up from 2008 and that is again by and large a function of oil price where we ended 2009 compared to where we ended 2008. Our production in the Permian, our oil production was up 6%. Our gas production was down 11%. On an equivalent basis our production was down 3%. No surprise given the fact that our rig count went to zero during the course of the year. In 2009 we averaged 161 MMcfe/d out of the Permian basin. ", "We have an outstanding acreage position. We ended 2009 with 554,000 gross and 379,000 net acres. That was up 18% from year-end 2008. Then as I said earlier in 2010 we intend anticipate investing $250 million in the Permian basin. That is up significantly from last year and we will get a lot more activity done. We have some great projects in the Permian. ", "If I move to slide 16 it kind of summarizes where a number of those are. As I said in 2009 we drilled 49 gross and 36 net wells. We had some new projects come to the fore in the Permian basin in 2009. Our group in Midland was innovative. They developed some new horizontal oil projects that would lower costs in some of our historical plays and really opened up some new territory for us. In 2010 we expect to drill a total of 85 gross or 60 net wells and we have some significant drilling in some horizontal oil plays. ", "We have talked about our Bone Spring play. We have a Bone Spring play not only in Ward and Winkler County that we talked about repeatedly in the past. We have drilled close to 90 wells in that trend. But in Eddy County, southeast New Mexico, we have opened up a new bone spring, a little shallower bone spring oil play. It is working out very nicely for us. ", "We have our Abo play. We currently have two rigs running in that Abo play and that continues to show very, very nice results. Then we have some additional development in Wolf Camp and Cherry Canyon. We will have 4-8 rigs running in 2010. We currently have five and we anticipate ramping that up. ", "Also on slide 16 some example of some wells we have brought on in the fourth quarter. Midway 17 3H was an Abo well that came on. Its first 30 day average was 490 barrels of oil per day. We had 100% working interest. The offset well to that was the Midway 17 2H. It produced 310 barrels of oil per day for its first 30 days. Again 100% working interest. Very nice Abo well. Then these next two wells are in our southeast New Mexico Bone Spring play that is brand new to us in 2009 and 2010. Our Shooter West 31 3H is a well that came online in December. Its first 30 day average was 560 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Very, very nice well. Then the State 14 2H its first 30 day equivalent was 325 barrels of oil per day. So very nice wells. It is a great program in the Permian basin and it is certainly a core part of our diversified approach. ", "Then finally if I move to slide 17 it shows our Gulf Coast. In 2009 our reserves were up 42% from end of year 2008. That was oil. Gas was up 45%. If you look at our production in 2009 our production averaged 4,300 thousand barrels per day of oil. That was up 2% from 2008. Our gas production was down a little bit over the course of the year. Again that is by and large a function of our rig count. On an equivalent basis we produced 80 rig cubic feet per day over the course of the year 2009 which was down 12% from 2008. ", "We are in a very nice acreage position on-shore Gulf Coast with 219,000 net acres. That is down a little from 2008 but this is a trend where we use geophysics to identify a particular prospect and their rifle shot. So these big acreage numbers don\u2019t quite mean the same thing in the Gulf Coast as they would in the Permian or the mid-continent. In 2010 we expect to invest $130 million of capital. We will certainly get done everything we can prudently. We are going to roll in the Gulf Coast. 2009 we invested $106 million. So as you can see from a gross and net well count we expect to get about half again as much done in 2010 as we did in 2009. ", "Onto slide 18. This shows our Yegua-Cook Mountain program. This is certainly our crowned jewel of our Gulf Coast program. We have been operating here actively since 2002. Over the course of the last 8 years we have drilled 94 wells. We have had a 65% success rate and on this trend we have been profitable every year. It is 3D seismic driven. We have over 2,000 square miles of 3D data. As those of you who follow us know we have put a lot of effort into the geophysical analysis here. In 2009 we found ourselves in the best area yet. ", "Our 2009 discoveries were the Two Sisters 1, our Garth 1 and then our Jefferson Airplane 2 and 3 on the Beaumont Airport property. This set us up for a great year in 2010. 2010 should be just a seamless continuation of our success in 2009. ", "If you look at slide 19 this is a bit of a zoom in to what we call our River Fork project. That is in and near the city of Beaumont. This shows our 2009 discoveries. You can see our Two Sisters 1 well there we had a higher percent of that. Our Garth 1 well we had a higher percent of that. Our Jefferson Airplane 2 and 3 wells we had 96% working interest. Those wells the average of those four wells they IPd at over 40 MMcfe/d. That is not a typo. That averages 28 MMcfe/d of gas and 2,100 barrels per day of oil. So outstanding economic results. The gas alone is a nice result. If you add that to the oil and you can see why we are so excited about it. ", "We are currently drilling the Jefferson Airplane 4 and Nine Dragons 1. As slide 19 shows we expect to have a full developed program in 2010. In conclusion we have three core areas that all performed well in 2009. Our Cana play is working very well. We also have our Texas Panhandle asset we haven\u2019t talked about here but we have a rig operating there. We are very optimistic about that.  We have our Permian oil and then our on-shore Gulf Coast. 2010 should be a continuation of us having that diversified program, geographically but also product mix. ", "With that I would like to turn it over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations. ", "Joe Albi ", "", "Thank you Tom. I will briefly summarize our fourth quarter production results, touch on our 2010 guidance as well as our 2009 and 2010 production group focus. Then I will just follow-up with a few comments about where we see service costs. ", "For those of you following along on our PowerPoint presentation the first slide I will talk about is slide 21. On slide 21 it summarizes Q4 and our full-year 2009 production. As we discussed in our last call with our increase in activity and the success of our south Texas program the fourth quarter was likely to be a turnaround quarter for us from a production standpoint. You may recall we stated the success of the quarter really relied on the timing and drilling and completion of the wells in Q4 and that they could play a big role for us with fourth quarter volumes. ", "Well things definitely went our way. We ended the quarter with reported average net daily equivalent production of 467.6 MMcfe/d. That is 26.1 million per day or 6% from Q3 where we reported an average of 441.5 MMcfe/d. It also was well above our guidance for the quarter of 440-455 MMcfe/d. So we had a good quarter. With that strong quarter our full year production took a little bit of a bump from where we thought it would be at the beginning of the year. We averaged 462.9 MMcfe/d, down as expected from 2008 but it did beat our beginning year 2009 guidance of 440-460 MMcfe/d. ", "If we adjust for property sales our average 2009 production was down 3.6% from 2008. Hidden in all this is the good news that I will discuss here shortly. Our property sale adjusted 2009 exit rate surpassed that of 2008. ", "On slide 22 we have gone ahead and put together a listing of our production by region comparing Q3 2009 to Q4 2009. A couple of things I will just point out with the chart, as compared to Q3 we saw increases in both oil and gas production during Q4. With our total company net oil production averaging 22,900 barrels per day, up 2% or 500 barrels per day from our Q3 average of 22,400 barrels per day. Our total company net gas production was also up, averaging 330 MMcfe/d, up 8% or 23 MMcfe/d from our Q3 2009 average of 307 MMcfe/d. ", "If you look at the table our south Texas program was really the primary catalyst in both oil and gas production in the quarter. Our Q4 Gulf Coast oil production averaged 6,400 barrels per day. That is up 46% of 2,000 barrels per day from Q3. While our fourth quarter Gulf Coast gas production averaged 77.7 MMcfe/d up 50% or 25.9 MMcfe/d from Q3. On a net equivalent basis our Gulf Coast production averaged 116.2 MMcfe/d during Q4, up 49% from Q3 and represented about 25% of our total company production during the quarter. So you can really see the impact of our south Texas success with the wells we had online by the end of the year and our regional breakdown in the Gulf Coast.  ", "On slide 23, we went ahead and broke down our production by region for oil and for gas. Tom hit on our equivalent breakdown. I will just talk here real quickly on oil and gas. You can see on the oil side that the Permian still makes up the lion\u2019s share of our fourth quarter production representing 52% of our Q4 oil volumes followed by the Gulf Coast at 28% and mid-continent at 20%. ", "On the gas side the mid-continent dominates. That again is driven primarily by our Cana play. Mid-continent represented 54% of our fourth quarter total gas production followed by the Gulf Coast at 24% and the Permian at 22%. Cana continued to play an important role during Q4 on an equivalent basis adding 33 MMcfe/d to the bottom line on a [permanent] basis. ", "If we jump to slide 24 I will touch a little bit on our 2009 exit rate like I mentioned earlier. As you might be expecting our production growth occurred month to month during the quarter and resulted in a December exit rate of 485.7 MMcfe/d. Two drivers in this figure were our four new south Texas wells which comprised 94 MMcfe/d of this amount and Cana which comprised 37 MMcfe/d of that amount. On December 31 in Cana however our production was showing more growth. We are approximating Cana delivering 46 MMcfe/d on December 31 and over 50 MMcfe/d here in the first month of the year in January. ", "The good news about our exit rate is that we have made up the lost ground we lost in 2009 after significantly cutting back our operated rig count. In fact, adding back in 9.3 MMcfe/d of estimated December production that did not show up on our books would bring our December 2009 exit rate to 495 MMcfe/d which is 6 MMcfe/d higher than our December 2008 volume of 489 MMcfe/d. So with the cut back rig count and a budget 1/3 of what we had in 2008 we end the year in 2009 with a sale adjusted exit rate greater than that of 2008. ", "On slide 25, you will see a tabulation showing our production guidance for the year. I will touch on a few things with regard to this. I am guessing our revised production today may have been a surprise to some of you. With our increase in activity and continued success in both South Texas and Cana we anticipated and are seeing positive production growth for 2010. The acceleration in the completion of two of our wells in the Beaumont area; that being the Amazon Queen and the Jefferson Airplane 1, and our pickup of simulation completion activity in Cana, those two have helped really drive our revision to our guidance here for Q1. ", "We have upped it to 560-575 MMcfe/d. That is a projected 20-23% increase from Q4 2009 and likely a new record for the company. Now you might ask what happened in a matter of 10 days. Paul in the hall told me well maybe it was just a good couple of weeks. But it maybe was a combination of that but a couple of things happened over the last 9 days. First, we closed the books in January and we had a real good take of what February looked like. The biggest impact was our Jefferson Airplane 1 well that after revising our drawing plans on that well we moved the projected start date up. ", "We got her online earlier this week. We originally forecasted that well to come on in late March and April. Now at 26 MMcfe/d and 1,300 barrels of condensate a day you can see that can have a positive impact on our core. Our other Jefferson Airplane wells are in a competitive reservoir. We are now at three wells producing from that feature. We are maximizing production where we can. ", "So south Texas represents a good reason for it, but in addition to that in Cana a simulation completion program has resulted in three very nice wells we haven\u2019t touched on in the slides for Q4 that are producing upwards of about 8 MMcfe/d. As such, with the acceleration in Cana and the better well performance that we appear to be seeing at least on these three wells we have taken a little bit of risk out of our Cana wedge and front-end loaded the production. So as you can tell you can see it bump into Q1. ", "As you might gather from our revision to Q1 guidance, the timing and results of the south Texas wells can significant influence our production. Our current modeling for the full-year anticipates production declines of our existing wells while trying to best estimate the success and timing of our new completions. With the bump in Q1 we are also increasing our full-year guidance to 540-570 MMcfe/d and that would reflect the 17-23 [inaudible] increase over 2009 and again likely a new record for the company. ", "As most all of you know, Q1 is a tough quarter to try and project full-year guidance. As we move further into the year we will continue to refine our estimates for new well production declines and the production adds from our new wells. The projected timing and success of new wells will play a key role in our full-year guidance especially when accounting for some of these high rate south Texas producers like we have been so fortunate to hit. ", "From a product mix standpoint for 2010 with the help of increased Permian activity and continued increasing associated Cana oil and NGL production our 2010 product mix is projected to skew a little more slightly towards oil with a projected range being 31-33% on an equivalent basis, up slightly from our Q4 average of 29%. ", "I will jump to slide 26 and kind of shift gears to our production operations group. As we mentioned in previous calls, 2009 was a year of focus for us on our base properties. Our production group did an excellent job tending to just that; optimizing production for exploitation activities while significantly cutting LOE. In addition something I am very proud of from a safety standpoint we finished the year with no lost time or OSHA reportable accidents in the field and that is a feat that all of us are proud of.", "Over the course of the year the group deployed $58 million of capital, performing over 375 projects the majority of which being lift related projects directed towards optimizing gas and oil production primarily in the Permian and mid-continent areas. In addition, working from a high graded inventory we performed a number of recompletion projects, again mostly in the Permian and mid-continent. ", "Our look back economics indicate we spent our capital wisely. We met our expectations for production gains and all the while working with a significantly reduced budget. We spent $134 million in 2008 on exploitation activities as compared to the $58 million we spent in 2009. ", "By far the biggest impact we had on our base properties was our reduction in LOE. Reductions in well servicing, saltwater disposal, power and fuel, maintenance and compression we reduced our production cost on an absolute basis 18% from $55 million a quarter in 2008 to $45 million a quarter in 2009. These reductions carried over to our lifting costs with our 2009 average lifting cost of $1.05 down 15% from $1.23 average in 2008. ", "On slide 27 you can see an illustration that shows our lifting cost reduction by quarter. It happened slowly but over the course of the year these reductions started to hit the books. We dropped our lifting costs in Q1 $1.15 per MCFE down to $0.91 here in the fourth quarter of 2009 giving us an average of $1.05 for the year and we are projecting for guidance for 2010 a range of $0.90 to $1.10 and a true anticipated very good chance of falling in the low end of that range. ", "Slipping over to slide 28, looking forward into 2010 in our production group really no change from 2009. Continued focus on optimizing production, reducing LOE on our base properties, all in an effort to maximize our cash flow for reinvestment. For our year-end planning process we assembled a high graded inventory of exploitation projects and anticipate after reviewing it a budget very similar to that of 2009 in that $50-75 million range. We have a deep inventory of projects. Over 450 projects have been identified for 2010. Most of these again are lift recompletion and in-field drilling projects in the Permian and in the mid-continent. ", "Finally before turning the call over to Paul just a few comments on our overall perception of the service costs. There is no slide for this in the presentation. During Q4 we saw drilling and completion costs appear to bottom out. In general we are about flat from a cost perspective from Q3 to Q4 but we are starting to see some upward pressure in some service costs. Day rates are staying somewhat in check but we are seeing that market tighten especially when it comes to rig crew availability. Although [frag] costs have remained somewhat stable in our core areas like Cana, stimulation costs from more remote or less active areas are feeling some upward pressure.", "We have also seen total stimulation costs go up when we have been implementing larger jobs. In general though the efficiencies we have been able to obtain and other cost reductions we have found or put into place with that we have managed to keep our total drilling and completion costs somewhat in check in our four areas of activity. ", "At Cana our generic well is running about $7.2-7.5 million. In the Permian our shallow Delaware basin horizontals are running $1.5-1.8 million. Our Bone Spring, New Mexico re-entry\u2019s are running $2-2.4 million. Our Abo horizontals are running about $3.6 million. In the Gulf Coast our south Texas wells are AFE\u2019ing for $6.3-7.6 million depending on depth. These dollar amounts are not too dissimilar to where saw costs in November and December. ", "As we look forward into 2010 in summary, we are set up pretty darned well. We had a good, strong finish to 2009. The first quarter of 2010 is on track to be a record quarter of production for us. We have a deep inventory of drilling and exploitation projects which should allow us to finish 2010 with a strong, double digit production growth. All the while entering the year with reduced production costs and apparent stable market for development costs. Our challenge here is to be to capitalize on all of the above. ", "With that I will turn it over to Paul. ", "Paul Korus ", "", "Thank you Joe. The first slide I am going to cover is slide 30. Not particularly my area of expertise as most of you know but by default I am going to recap the proved reserves for you. ", "During the year, net of 169 Bcfe of production and 25 Bcfe of sales we still managed to increase our proved reserves by 190 Bcfe or 15% to 1.5 Tcfe. If you back out the 25 Bcfe of sales that we had, we actually would have recorded a 17% increase. Of course the year-end reserves are calculated differently this year than they have been in prior years according to the new SEC and FASB rules where we use a 12-month rolling average price for both gas and oil as opposed to year-end prices. ", "Had we used the year-end prices and had comparability to the way reserves were calculated in prior years our oil reserves would have been up by another 2 million barrels and gas would have been about 70 Bcf higher and our reserves would have rounded to more something like 1.6 Bcfe. But no matter how you look at it a very good year. We added 312 Bcfe from our drilling program and also had 74 Bcfe of net positive revisions. ", "The revisions if you look at gas separately from oil you will see a very small net number. We had significant positive revisions from performance but largely offset by a price revision. The rolling average price we used for the end of last year was $3.56 versus $5.33 at the end of 2008. The higher oil price based on the 12-month rolling average of $57.58 contributed to us getting back some of the negative price related revisions we had in 2008. As I mentioned, the rolling average price was $57.58 versus the year-end 2008 price of $36.34. Of course both of those numbers are way below the $93 we used at the end of 2007. So we haven\u2019t gotten all of those revisions back yet. ", "Production wise we have talked quite a bit about that already. Just to reiterate that we had a number of good things happen to us in December and January and in early February. Some may ask why do we make one estimate on February 8th and a fairly higher or significantly estimate two weeks later. Joe pretty much covered that already. We felt compelled to put estimates out at February 8th. In hindsight we should have waited. We had analyst estimates out there for 2010 production growth ranging from 0% to something in the teens. So we made our best estimate at the time. We got additional information and so we chose to update it because we think it is important. ", "You can tell from those estimates not all quarters may show sequential growth but frankly it may also be too early to tell that for sure. Our second half production is going to be highly dependent upon exploratory wells as opposed to developing wells that we will be drilling west of Beaumont. So as the year unfolds we will update our guidance and as certain new prospects are tested and key wells are drilled and evaluated we will continue to provide additional information. ", "Having said all of that, volatile prices could impact our level of activity. Uncertain weather, particularly down in the Gulf Coast with rain and mud can have operational implications and of course we always need to deal with operational risks. But we think we have accounted for those adequately in our guidance so far. ", "Quickly on our financials, a small decrease in production, 4-5% depending upon how you measure it. Obviously our oil/gas sales are only about half of what they were in 2008. So as hard as we work on production prices continue to swamp our operating results including revenues and cash flows. Basically the prices we received in 2009 were only about half of what we received in 2008 and you see that trickle through revenues and cash flow. ", "But we towed the line and actually under-spent our cash flow in 2009. Unfortunately with the write down in the first quarter reported an annual loss of about $312 million despite earning over $100 million in the fourth quarter. With proceeds from property sales and cash flow in excess of capital investment we reduced our bank debt by $195 million. We were at $220 million at the end of 2008 and we are only at $25 million at the end of 2009. ", "So our total debt was also then reduced by about $195 million and brought our debt to cap ratio down to a very comfortable 16%. Presented for you on the slide show are other credit statistics which clearly resemble those of investment grade companies. ", "With that I think it is probably time to turn it over to questions. You can see our capital structure hedges that we have. Operator we would be happy to take questions. ", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "I just wanted to dive into the Cana NGL volume versus price breakdown a bit more. On slide 12 it discusses the current production breakdown of 65% gas, 35% oil. Does that apply to the 33 million per day average in the fourth quarter or the 46 million of the rate and a current rate of around 50-55? ", "Mark Burford ", "", "The 55/35 split is actually based on where our mix in current drilling has occurred to date. As Tom mentioned, as we get deeper into the play we could see a lower oil yield and NGL yield. As of currently as our composition of production and our type curve on a historical basis if you look at it if you were looking at tailgate gas with NGL the mix would be 65/35. But that can swing over time. What we are trying to depict is if you drill deeper to the west we will have drier gas but if you go to the east we actually could have more higher liquid yield. The representation of our current mix of production where it is at is the 65/35. ", "Mick Merelli ", "", "I want to make a point. This is principally important where we are comparing Cana wells to other plays that are 1,000 BTU. That is really what it is about. The economics that we have always used have always had the value of the NGLs in there. So it is kind of a cosmetic problem that we are facing here. We are trying to get comparable volumes of 1,000 BTU essentially is what it is so you can compare Cana to other plays volumetrically. ", "Mark Burford ", "", "That\u2019s correct. That is what we are trying to make sure you understand. The liquid component plays a disproportionate part of the economics and volumetrics. ", "Joe Albi ", "", "There is a fine line between transparency and cosmetics here. We think this is more transparent for those that are modeling and have an interest in how this play could impact us. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "Along those lines with the acceleration of the plan for the Cana at one point you had been talking about a year-end 2010 exit rate of around 100 million per day. How has that changed with your revised plan? ", "Mark Burford ", "", "At the 100 million exit rate we have accelerated some of the completions and we have gotten a better rate for the first quarter but overall 100 million exit rate is about what we anticipate. Something probably a little better than that hopefully. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "The third and fourth quarter average realized prices were quite a bit better than Henry hub. Any sort of guidance to help us go forward on this sort of trade off between the price versus volume and how we are going to capture that and what the differentials or what the percentage realized prices might look like? ", "Paul Korus ", "", "Mark is probably more capable of answering but as we go forward and we have talked about now the impact here in Cana of reporting NGL as production volumes; the impact that is going to have of course is NGL are sold at a lower price per barrel than is oil. Oil differential might widen by $1 or $2. On the other hand, instead of recording those revenues in our gas price you will see our gas price differential narrow somewhat. But that is only in Cana. This whole NGL issue here to kind of frame it in terms others might understand it is kind of like an agent versus a principal. ", "In Cana we own those volumes through the end of the tailgate. The processor is only an agent. That is unlike what happens in the Gulf Coast in Beaumont where the processor actually takes possession at the well head and becomes the principle so we turn over title at the well head in which case that high BTU gas is going to continue or the NGL percent of proceeds that we get is going to continue to filter back in our gas price. So as our production mix is influenced by a lot of output in west of Beaumont you are still going to see us as an overall company have a very positive differential to benchmark prices. ", "Then of course we have to deal with the fact that mid-continent prices in February were actually higher than Gulf Coast index prices. So trying to predict basis differentials as the year unfolds, we will leave that up to you. All in all you are going to continue to see us as long as we have a lot of this Gulf Coast production we have a differential to Henry hub that is going to be $1 or more. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "On some of the recent Gulf Coast completions I want to make sure I have this straight. The Amazon Queen well came on at 26 million on gas and 1,300 barrels per day condensate. When was that turned to sales? ", "Joe Albi ", "", "The Amazon Queen came on in January and it was producing at those rates when we had some constrained production and unit difficulties on the Two Sisters well. Both those wells are going into a decline and are sharing an allowable and right now the Amazon Queen is making 16 million a day and the Two Sisters is making 25. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "Jefferson Airplane, has that well completed yet or do you expect to complete that soon? ", "Joe Albi ", "", "Jefferson Airplane 1 has come online here this past weekend and is currently making 26 MMcfe/d and 1,300 barrels of condensate. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "The number 4 and the 9 Dragons that are currently drilling what is the timeline for completion of drilling and then actual completion of the wells and turning those to sales? Any sort of estimate for those and also at what rate or size do you expect those to come on at? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "The Jefferson Airplane 4 spun over the weekend. So we expect 45 days more than likely to sales. That is a trouble free estimate and one of these days we are going to get one of those. The 9 Dragons and their immediate [liner] point so we probably have a few weeks left on that and that is a high risk exploratory test so we wouldn\u2019t be projecting a volume or a rate on that. We are crossing our fingers and hoping for discovered. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "The year-end exit rate of 94 MMcfe/d per day from that southeast program from what I am assuming is only four wells it looks like you are starting to see some declines at least in some of the initial wells that were drilled in the middle of the year. Is that fair? ", "Joe Albi ", "", "I would say that isn\u2019t a fair statement. Some of the Jefferson Airplane wells are going to decline quicker. We anticipate by the second quarter of this year they will start declining but what happened there is we had these wells coming on at various points in time during the fourth quarter. In fact if you look at our jump from Q4 to Q1 of about 100 MMcfe/d worth of production about 70-80% of that we anticipate is going to be coming from South Texas and the Beaumont County wells. ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "There is also an overprint there. There were some competitive reservoirs. We have some choices of pipelines to sell into. We talked about this NGL and in some of those pipelines we get a much better contract and more valued liquid stream. Remember this is very wet gas so there is a tremendous uplift in liquids themselves. So where we have competitive reservoirs we have chosen to sell into two different lines. One has a more favorable marketing contract than the other but because it is a competitive reservoir and it is a race for reserves we have gone ahead and decided to take that hit if you will. Where we are not competitive we are just taking our allocated volume in our highest value line and [inaudible] the oil back. So those wells are not producing; the Amazon Queen and Two Sisters are not producing at their capable rates. ", "Paul Korus ", "", "I will add one thing. Four wells that average 40 million a day, that is 120. Remember we only have a 75% revenue interest out there on average so that is the 90 MMcfe/d. ", "Bill [Metner] \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "I was coming up with 111 million net interest and comparing that to the 94 but it sounds like there are some other complications. ", "Paul Korus ", "", "And ups and downs. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose. ", "Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose ", "With the Cana program for 2010, six operated rigs right now. How many non op rigs do you have running and where do you see that going? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "I believe there are 12-14 rigs in total working in the play. We have interest in not quite every well drilled but pretty close to every well drilled. I will say that our six operated wells are generally fairly high interest, 65% or better and our non-operated wells are fairly low interest. That is just the way it is working. Typically our non-operated wells are 25% or less. So looking ahead we will participate in a lot of non-operated activity. It is very difficult to project that because where other operator\u2019s rig schedules we don\u2019t control, we currently have six operated rigs and some of those rigs are under long-term contract and those contracts expire this year.", "Based on prevailing conditions at the time we will make a decision as to whether to keep those rigs deployed or to release them. Not to totally hem and haw on your question but right now we are in a debate as to whether keep our current rigs or drop or add. We are really based on results and project price. What I am really telling you is we have a lot of flexibility. Our midpoint case for 2010 is 6 rigs and that is our expectation but it could go up and it could go down. ", "Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose ", "Whenever I am looking at my estimates the whole range of your CapEx it looks to me like you are probably going to be generating free cash flow for the year. Where do you think your first options are for deployment if there is an excess? Where does it start to go first? Or would you all just plan to hold onto the cash for now? ", "Mick Merelli ", "", "Right now that is an interesting problem. I don\u2019t know if it is going to happen or not. I think the most important thing is we have a deep inventory of projects. The way we run our economics on those projects are that we run it at the then existing strip and look at the rate of return. Then we run what we think is a low price scenario which is $3.50 gas corrected for whatever location and so forth and $45 flat oil. When we run that downside it is not for economics it is just to rank the inventory. A lot of our inventory we are going in right now gets over our hurdle record cost of capital by a few percentage points. That is again on that kind of a flat case held forever flat. ", "So what we are going to do is we are going to get as much of that drilling done as we can as long as that flat case looks like it makes sense. We have a lot to do. We won\u2019t be\u2026it is a case of capital. We can borrow money. We are low debt. We can keep moving ahead. We are going to try and get those projects done. The limitation there for us is going to be organizationally can we get that much done or not. It is a nice idea like running one year to the other and you have too much money this year and not enough the next. If we get a little ahead we have a big, big capital program. We don\u2019t understand our ultimate spacing in Cana yet. That could change things a lot. ", "If we wind up with a little bit lower debt or something going across the year it won\u2019t spoil. We have lots of opportunities. We are very opportunity rich right now. I am not trying to duck your question. I am saying as I see it we are not going to wind up with great piles of money left over and if we have a little bit one way or the other we will figure out how to take care of that. We have lots of opportunity. ", "Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose ", "To clarify, there is no Gulf Coast exploration success modeled into the production guidance, is that right? ", "Joe Albi  ", "", "There is forecasted Gulf Coast contribution to our drilling wedge based on the known inventory we have through June on a risk basis. ", "Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose ", "On these Gulf Coast wells I know whenever we first started drilling them there was a lot of talk about kind of what they expected the size of some of them are and how compartmentalized some of the wells were. Where do we feel we are now in terms of just size of some of these Gulf Coast wells at this point and how compartmentalized they are? ", "Joe Albi ", "", "We have talked about our Two Sisters Amazon Queen being in the 30-40 Bcf range and that is certainly where we see it today. We  are still collecting data and revising that estimate as we get more data. The Jefferson Airplane Complex is a little more vexing problem because we have our data but there are wells producing across the lease line. We think the overall feature will be a little bigger than that number but there is also probably going to be 10 wells in it. So it is a horse race. I think those wells will probably all be richly economic and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that whole feature went north of 50 BCF by the time it is all said and done. I am speculating based on early sign data on depletion to our reservoirs. ", "I will tell you for our prospect set going forward we have a few prospects that are in the high teens to low 20 BCF and then we have some features we are currently evaluating we haven\u2019t sized yet. We have a lot of opportunity. I think we will be busy. We currently have two rigs drilling that project and I think we will be busy out there for certainly most of 2010. We are talking about 15 gross wells and I think we will get that done. ", "Nicholas Pope \u2013 Dahlman Rose ", "In terms of production guidance again, I think you were saying that increase of 100 million you were saying 70 million from the Gulf Coast and 30 million from Cana. Does that imply you are all thinking mid-con and Permian are starting to grow slightly or where do you all see the more conventional assets growing from fourth quarter? ", "Joe Albi ", "", "That is a lot of questions. What I would say about the Permian is that just given the fact that we had limited to little activity last year and we saw somewhat of a production decline with current rig count as it sits now with the possibility of increasing two or some odd more rigs and improved economics and we will see if the Permian starts to grow again. In the mid-continent I think with Cana and deploying six rigs has all the chances in the world to continue growing too. Where you really stand with Q1 is South Texas. What you are seeing in that tail guidance as Paul touched on is it isn\u2019t that everything else is shrinking. It is that we have built in some production declines, in particular that Jefferson Airplane feature where we know we are in competition and those are big wells. So that is forecasted in our guidance and that is why our full-year guidance is lower than our first quarter guidance. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital. ", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "A follow-up on what Nick asked about the Gulf Coast, of the 12-15 gross wells you are going to drill there this year are those all exploration or are some of those development wells, for example, to develop the Jefferson Airplane structure? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "Certainly Jefferson Airplane I would say is development. Everything else we would term exploration. But it is important to understand we don\u2019t really have a basket where we call exploration and a basked we call development. We just have a risk profile. So historically, and I think this also speaks to some of this guidance issue, historically we have run a 65% success ratio in these Abo geophysically driven plays. Even though we think we see the signature of gas or signature of high geo or oil, 1/3 of our wells historically have been dry holes.", " In fact we have had really good years where we spent more on dry holes than we have on producers. So hence the risk. The thing that is kind of surprising us is we are having more success than we have modeled. On this project we have a good set of data logs. We really haven\u2019t drilled a dry hole yet. We have one well that is temporarily abandoned but I think we will probably re-enter it and we believe we just flat out missed the target given the missed image. So yes, to answer your question directly the Jefferson Airplane 4 I would term a true development well. The Nine Dragons I would term an exploration well and everything else out there an exploration well. ", "Now, based on our success that 65% risking is probably a little harsh for some of those. Our Two Sisters well, pre-drill we carried that as 50% chance of success. Here we are 8-9 wells into the project without a dry hole. So as we go deeper into that trend and one of the things that the next frontier is looking at deeper objectives, we are going to be right back there to that 50% risk. Until we get there and calibrate it, we really have to get down there, sample those rocks and understand the geophysical response and be prudent. ", "Again, speaking to our guidance that explains the disconnect. Joe has done a really nice job historically of modeling and risking what the exploration group gives him. We have surprised ourselves with our success this year. ", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "Can you tell us the chance of success you are using on Nine Dragons and your pre-drill estimate of the site structure and so on? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "Nine Dragons is run at I believe about an 80% chance for success. In full disclosure we had an offset operator drill a down bit well to us, down dip from the Nine Dragons location. They discovered 40 feet of gas on water and we think we are going to be 200 feet high to that on the same feature. But I have to tell you we have been surprised many times in this trend. We are really hesitant to start a $7-8 million well in this environment and an 80% chance of success is near gut certainty from our standpoint. [Inaudible]. ", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital", "", "Moving over to the Permian and the Eddy County Bone Springs play are you still competitively leasing acreage there? Do you have the bulk of your acreage put together? If you could you give us an idea of what your gross net acreage is in that play? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "I don\u2019t have that acreage number in front of me but if you want to call later we can get that to you. We are still leasing. We picked up a nice position at the estate sale yesterday in that trend. If you look at the land map out there it is a quilt patchwork of held acreage. There is very, very little acreage to just lease. We are typically it is hand to hand combat. We are typically getting deals and farm out deals, taking term assignments, going to estate sales as soon as acreage expires. It is really as competitive and tough a land environment as anywhere we operate.", "So it is not a situation where we are going to report to you that we have been actively leasing and we have put 100,000 contiguous acres together. It is going to be a deal where we may have 3,000 here; 2,000 there, 160 acres here. Through that we stitch together drilling opportunities. We anticipate having two rigs running in that play during much of the year and we are just pretty happy with the results we have seen.

It looks like just short of $2.3 billion in pre-tax PV10 which was just a hair above where it was last year? Am I adding right? ", "Paul Korus ", "", "You can actually look at our February 8th operations release. We have put those pre-tax PV10 numbers in there. 8.5 billion of pre-tax PV10 at the end of 2009. That is right. ", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "Did you also give what it would look like at current prices? ", "Joe Albi", "", "If you would have looked at the same pricing methodology here in Q4 that we did in Q4 2008 NPV would bump up to about $3.9 billion. ", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "I am still struggling with this competitive reservoir jargon. How does that impact what you can book? I assume you are talking about competition effects from the transients. Are you going to be able to book or were you able to book a full [inaudible] for some of these South Texas wells? ", "Tom Jorden ", "", "We are booking it based on our flat out estimate of what we think we will capture. Then on consideration of what is under our leasehold. I think we are able to book the volumes that we think the wells will produce. But that said, it is a horse race. If we don\u2019t produce them we are going to lose them across the lease line. ", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "Looking at my model, a little bit of free cash here for the year. Could you prioritize what you would be doing with that? I assume it is going to be picking up some more acreage, paying down debt and maybe increase the dividend. Is that fair? ", "Mick Merelli ", "", "In terms of where we commence drilling it is going to fall out pretty much if we find more ideas that are built around  a higher risk, higher return projects they get funded because they are almost bullet proof from a commodity price standpoint. That is where the money will go first. Then we have to see what happens in Cana. That is a long-term project for us. We don\u2019t understand the future in terms of spacing and how big a program that is going to have to be. So there is a lot of things up in the air. ", "Then the horizontal oil wells in the Permian they will attract a lot of capital. The answer is basically Cana is going to get a piece of it because it is a long-term project. The rest of it is going to compete on the basis of rate of return and how resistant it is to what the price volatility. Those projects are going to get funded. What we know about it right now is it is pretty hard to beat the Yegua-Cook Mountain economics from a rate of return from a financial standpoint. So it is going to get funded. I hope I haven\u2019t garbled that too much. ", "Andrew Coleman - UBS", "A modeling question for Paul is there no guidance on deferred taxes but should we think of that as trending up a decent amount here in 2010 in the higher CapEx? ", "Paul Korus ", "", "Well you make money and you pay taxes. So in the fourth quarter our provision was like $56 million of which $52 million was deferred. As we go forward into 2010 maybe 1/3 of it will be current and 2/3 deferred or 30/70 things like that. That has kind of been our historical average.

It just so happens the value of our unproved properties is about equivalent to our total debt outstanding so we are capitalizing virtually all of our gross interest expense. Not necessarily by choice but by rule. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Greg Brody - JP Morgan.

So the answer to your question is obviously we have the financial capability of doing some things and if we find something we really like and that probably means it drives our drilling program in the future, if we find something like that we would get out and get it done. But just to say now we are going to have a plan to spend so much money on acquisitions and so much money on drilling, our plan is the we are going to spend the money on drilling. In terms of whatever the market is out there, if we find some sort of an opportunity that we really like as we have in the past we would probably stretch to try and get it. So I don\u2019t know. When we find it, we find it. So far we haven\u2019t found anything like that recently.

We are not strategic enough to figure all that out. If it is out of one of our plays and we think we understand it and we like it we would do it. But basically what I am saying is we knew what we liked about [inaudible]. We knew what we liked about Magnum Hunter. We knew what we liked about the Woodford acreage. We really like that stuff so we stepped up and did it. So right now there is no one out there that we feel we like that much. So we will concentrate on our drilling program and just keep moving it ahead. It is a good rate of return.

We did some re-entry\u2019s and they came in better than modeled. Now the trend in aggregate is highly variable. It is not one big blanket deposit. It is sands that come and go.

So that works out 50% -- 56% gas and 44% liquids using a 6:1 conversion. ", "On a revenue basis, 32% of the revenues were from gas, while liquids accounted for 68% of the revenues. Production was up 1% over last year and flat with the fourth quarter. Joe's going to cover our production in more detail, but I want to point out just a couple of things. First of all, you know that we had some weather issues, us and many other companies. We had weather issues in the Permian and the Mid-Continent that hurt our production this quarter. But also influencing some of our production was an increased backlog of uncompleted wells. Joe will be addressing this later, but just what's really happened is we have about 31 wells waiting on completion. That's a little bit bigger backlog than what we're used to seeing. And one of the reasons for that is it's kind of a combination of 2 things. It's a combination in a couple of our project areas, both in Cana and in the Permian, where we have larger project areas. We tend to frac a well and we tweaked the frac, and then we decide did it work or not and what else will we do on the next one. Sometimes it kind of slows us down. ", "But what really slowed us down in addition to that was this year, we tried to -- we recognized that there was a potential for some improvement by using slow flow. The problem with slow flow is that it takes us longer to figure out whether or not the way we treat the fracs are working. So anyway, a combination of those things slowed us down and got us into a backlog. I think they feel pretty good about what they're -- where they're at with their frac jobs now, and they're going to pick up the pace next quarter.", "In the Gulf Coast, production adds from our drilling program are also delayed in quarter one. We drilled some dry holes and we drilled some producers. And our problem there is we never -- when we drilled and when we start the wells, we never know which way they're going to be. So it worked out that the main well's a dry hole, so it was one of the first wells we drilled. In addition to that, we took our rig, we had a mechanical problem at Jefferson Airplane, so we moved our rig over and sidetracked an existing producing well and took the rig out of our drilling order. I think Joe will be talking a little bit about the fact that we're going to add a couple of rigs and maybe go up to -- well, we will go up to 3 rigs in the Gulf Coast.", "In terms of our future forecast, we're forecasting solid production growth on both the Permian and Mid-Continent. And of course this will -- we still have Gulf Coast declines that we'll have to overcome.", "I guess -- I'll try to be a little brief here and turn this over to Joe. But really what we track and what we focus on so much is the drilling program and whether what kind of return we're getting on that program. Our first quarter capital investment was $337 million. It was funded out of our cash flow and cash on hand. That program looks very solid to us in terms of the return and the quality of the wells that we drilled. ", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe, and he can kind of take over for some of the stuff that Tom usually talks about, the production stuff that he normally talks about. Joe?", "Joseph Albi", "Thank you, Mick, and again thank you all for joining us today. As Mick mentioned, with Tom out of the pocket, I'll cover not only our operations update, but I'll hit on this year's joint program and capital as well as I go through and integrate the 2 reports we typically give you.", "Our first quarter production came in as anticipated, with average reported net equivalent production of 590 million a day. We came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance, which was 582 million to 602 million. As expected, our Q1 production was impacted to the tune of 10 million to 15 million a day from our early February weather-related shut-ins as well as about 4 million a day from our late 2010, early 2011 property sales. ", "Despite the weather delays, we saw year-over-year total company production gains with our Q1 '11 production of 590 million a day beating our Q1 '10 production of 584.5 million a day by 4.5 million a day. When comparing Q1 '11 to Q1 '10, a combined year-over-year production gain of 46 million a day from the Permian and Mid-Continent more than offset the sharp 41 million a day drop that we forecasted and actually saw in the Gulf Coast. Approximately 2/3 of our weather-related downtime occurred in the Permian. And despite the downtime, our Permian Q1 '11 average equivalent basis of 174 million a day was up 12% or 20 million a day from our Q1 '10 average of 154 million a day. All the while our Q1 '11 Mid-Continent average of 266 million a day was up 11% or 26 million a day from our Q1 '10 average of 239 million a day.", "As I just mentioned, the combined 46 million a day year-over-year increases in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, they offset the 41 million decline or 22% drop that we did anticipate and saw in the Gulf Coast, which fell from 190 million a day in Q1 '10 to 149 million a day in Q1 '11. The bottom line to our Q1 production is that despite the weather interruptions, the Permian and Mid-Continent programs continue to exhibit the consistent production growth that we've seen quarter to quarter, and they offset the decline that we saw in the Gulf Coast. This has been a pretty consistent story for us now for about a year and will likely be the same story here in Q2 with our Gulf Coast area net daily equivalent production projected to drop from levels of 149 million a day in Q1 to levels of 100 to 105 million a day in Q2. ", "Our high cash flow and high rate of return Gulf Coast program inherently brings a variable of uncertainty in the timing of production adds and drops. And we've seen these ups and downs in the Gulf Coast over the last few years. But as I'll go into in more detail, the real catalyst for Cimarex's long-term production growth is our multi-year inventory of projects in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We've seen nice production gains in both of these programs, and we expect it to continue.", "Well, let me jump into our exploration and drilling activity before ending with some additional comments on our production and our guidance. Overall, we drilled and completed 65 gross or 35 net wells during the first quarter, investing $337 million. Of total Q1 capital, 50% was invested in projects located in the Mid-Continent, 46% in the Permian and 4% in the Gulf Coast. ", "I'll briefly touch on each of the regions, and I'll start here first with the Permian. During Q1, we drilled and completed 26 gross or 19.7 net wells in the Permian and at quarter end, 18 net wells were waiting on completion, up from the 10 net wells that we had at year end. While Mick touched on this a little bit earlier, more so in the case in the Permian with our accelerated activity, a tight market for frac equipment and the bad February weather really slowed down our completion activity here near the end of Q1. As we stated in our last call, we were hopeful to see signs of the market loosening up a bit here into Q2, and we certainly have. We firmed up solid plans to add at least 3 additional fleets to the Permian in the May-June timeframe to catch up on our backlog with a minimum of 5 frac crews working in the area by the end of Q2. We contemplating a sixth. Our current frac schedule calls for us to significantly reduce our backlog of wells, waiting on completion here by the end of Q3. ", "Our Permian E&D capital totaled $154 million in Q1. That represents about 46% of our total company Q1 capital. For the full year, we're expecting to invest $700 million to $750 million in the Permian, which will represent about 50% to 55% of our total 2011 capital budget. As I mentioned previously, we continue to see solid production growth in the Permian. Our Q1 '11 production averaged 174 million a day equivalents, which on a BOE basis equates to 28,954 BOE per day, so 12% increase over Q1 '10. And the real driver of that growth has been our New Mexico second and third Bone Spring horizontal oil plays. We continue to see great results from these programs. During Q1, we drilled and completed 8 gross or 4 net wells with another 11 gross or 7.7 net wells waiting on completion. By year end, we expect to drill a total of 60 gross or 39 net wells in the play, investing nearly $200 million.", "Since we kicked off the play in mid-2009, we've drilled and completed a total of 36 wells. And those 36 wells gave us a first quarter gross exit rate of 6,800 BOE per day, which was up from 0 not quite 2 years ago. Our absolute EURs for the wells that we drilled and completed is 570,000 BOE, and that's comprised of 416,000 barrels of oil and 920 million cubic feet of gas, virtually the same number we've been quoting to you all for months now.  With these reserves, the 570,000 Mboe or 570,000 BOE, we're seeing very attractive rates of return. But our economics continue to be squeezed just a bit as compared to last year. Although we've seen some overall cost ability over the last 3 months, drilling and completion costs have moved up from last year primarily as a result of our increased frac costs. ", "Our generic second Bone Spring completed well now runs around $4.8 million to $5.2 million and that's up 20% to 30% from last year. But even with this cost creep, this play continues to be a great play for us. And we have a deep, multi-year inventory of future drilling opportunities.", "Shifting gears a bit, I have a few comments on our emerging Delaware Basin/Wolfcamp shale play. As we previously mentioned, this is a play which covers a very large potential area from southern Eddy County, New Mexico, down south into Culberson and Reeves Counties in West Texas. As most of you know, most of our activity to date has been focused right in and around the state line. During Q1, we drilled and completed 2 gross or 2 net Wolfcamp shale wells in the area, bringing our total completed, I'll call play concept well count to 8 producers. We have another 5 gross or 5 net wells which are waiting on completion and pipeline connections at quarter end. And we're currently working on infrastructure and markets for these 5 wells and anticipate having them completed and online here by late Q2, early Q3.", "One of the 2 wells that we drilled during Q1 was located in our White City area in Eddy County, New Mexico, and the other was a reentry further south in Reeves County, Texas. Our results continue to be encouraging, but we're still in the very early stages of evaluating the play. We currently have 3 wells drilling in the play with AFEs to drill and complete running in the $6.5 million to $7 million range. Today we seen no additional information which would have us depart from the average play production statistics we previously provided you. And those were an average equivalent 30-day IP of about 6 million a day composed of 50% gas, 32% natural gas liquids and 18% oil. ", "We a great acreage position in the play. It totals 125,000 net acres. Not only do we see the acreage as perspective in the Wolfcamp, which by itself has significant potential to Cimarex, but we also have exposure to the Avalon Shale and the Cisco/Canyon shales as well. Although our early emphasis has been on the Wolfcamp, we do have wells planned in the Q2, Q3 timeframe to test both the Avalon and the Cisco/Canyon intervals. By year end, we expect to drill a total of 25 to 30 wells in the play, and end the year with a 2011 drilling investment of approximately $200 million in the play.", "As you all know, the Permian is a hot area right now. Competition is fierce and costs are rising. Our plans are to continue to aggressively move forward, and we'll maintain a strong focus like we always have on rate of return and continue to test our economics with sensitivities using flat price stats to hydrate our portfolios. We have a great land position in the Permian. The basin's an integral part of our ongoing business, as you all know. We have a solid multi-year inventory of future drilling opportunities on our existing acreage. And you'll see us continue to add acreage when and where we can, only as long as it continues to make sense. The Permian team has done a great job of picking up activity and developing the program. We're really excited about its momentum and what the program brings to the table.", "Moving onto the Mid-Continent, during Q1 we drilled and completed 37 gross or 13.2 net wells in the area. And at quarter end, we had 32 gross or 13 net wells in the process of either being completed or awaiting completion. The majority of wells waiting on completion were in Cana. And similar to our plans in the Permian, we firmed up the addition of another fleet this month to catch up on our backlog of completions. With 2 frac crews working Cana starting here in May, our current frac schedule calls for us to significantly reduce backlog of our completions by the end of Q3.", "Our Mid-Continent E&D capital in the first quarter totaled $169 million or about 50% of our total company Q1 capital. And for the full year, we expect to invest $500 million to $550 million in the Mid-Continent, representing approximately 40% of our anticipated total company capital spending.", "As we've mentioned, our first quarter 2011 Mid-Continent production averaged $266 million a day. That's up 11% over our first quarter. And a main driver to this growth is our Cana/Woodford Shale play, which as most of you all know is in the Anadarko Basin. In Cana, we've drilled and completed 31 gross or 9.6 net wells. And at quarter end, we had 29 gross or 11.1 net wells waiting on completion.", "We currently have 9 and soon to be 10 here in June operated rigs working in Cana and we're drilling one well per section. We still anticipate being a bit over a year away from initiating our down spacing development, but we wanted to continue to evaluate optimal spacing and as a result, we've begun a 2-well pilot to help further evaluate spacing, which we hope here to have completed in the Q2, Q3 timeframe. Outside of that, we'll continue to drill on the core and on the peripheral of the bill to continue to further develop and test the play. Our generic Cana AFEs for the shallow and core areas have stayed somewhat flat over the last 3 months at levels of $7.5 million to $8.5 million, but they are up approximately 10% to 15% from the well cost that we saw in early to mid-2010. We're still leasing and hydrating our land position in Cana and hold a very strong land position with over 135,000 net acres, 70,000 of which we believe are located directly in the core. Cana continues to be a great play for us. We're very proud of it, and it's moving forward very nicely.", "In other areas of the Mid-Continent outside of Cana, we drilled 5 gross or 2.8 net wells during Q1, with 3 gross or 1.8 net wells located in Hemphill County, Texas, and 2 gross or 1.2 net wells located in Custer County, Oklahoma. ", "Two of our significant Hemphill County Granite Wash successes include our George 17-5H, in which we hold a 61% working interest, which came on during the quarter with a 30-day IP of 8.6 million a day. And our George 17-6H in which we also hold a 61% working interest, and it came on at 8 million a day. Of significant note, Custer County was the successful drilling of our Kephart 1-4, our Hogs bar or Hogshooter test, in which we hold a 91% interest. It came on with a 30-day IP of over 1,000 BOE per day, 71% of which was oil.", "Moving on to the Gulf Coast, during Q1 we drilled 2 gross or 1.8 net wells, testing the Kirby and the Yegua/Cook Mountain series, one of which was successful. Our first 2011 test, our Two Sisters #3 well in which we own 100%, was successfully completed in early January. And it came on at rates of approximately 9 million a day and 1,600 barrels of oil per day. Our second 2011 Gulf Coast test, as Mick mentioned, our Manion #2 was a dry hole. Our Gulf Coast E&D Capital in Q1 totaled 13 million or about 4% of our total Q1 capital. And for the full year, we expect to invest $100 million in the Gulf Coast program or about 8% of our total company capital. ", "We have a variety of identified remaining 3D prospects, a good mix of larger higher-risk projects and smaller lower-risk projects. Our original 2011 Gulf Coast plan called for us to run with a one-rig program and possibly add a second rig line from time to time during the year. But as Mick alluded to, we're stepping up the pace of our Gulf Coast program by adding a second rig in the next few weeks and a third rig here in June. To the extent the prospects that we have are non-contingent, you'll see us get them drilled as soon as we can. And as such, depending on our success, will either see us end the year with 3 rigs or not. I'll cover some of the other Gulf Coast items as I go over our second quarter and full year production guidance.", "When discussing second quarter full year '11 guidance, I think it's important to touch on a couple of factors which have implicated our guidance. First is our backlog of Permian and Cana wells waiting on frac. Mick touched on 2 factors really playing a role here, and I'll reiterate them. One was our desire to test and understand various completion techniques, and the other was a tight market for frac equipment. As you may recall, starting in the latter part of 2010, we purposely had a backlog of completions in Cana due simply to our desire to test and understand various completion techniques in order to optimize our completions. Post completion production performance, which is in essence time, is needed to evaluate results. Compounding that time necessary to evaluate are those instances where slow flow techniques are used to flow wells back. Well, 6 months down the road now we're feeling more confident about the completion designs we're utilizing in Cana and in the Permian oil plays and we're ready to speed things up. To do so, we firmed up the addition of at least 4 additional frac fleets to the 3 existing fleets we had working in Q1. With additional fleets scheduled to show up in the May, June timeframe, our current frac schedule calls for us to make a good dent in the backlog by the end of Q3, with forecasted associated production uplift beginning in late Q2 and into Q3.", "Secondly, as you all are aware, success in our Gulf Coast program can create significant periodic swings on our production, both up and down. As we've said before, predicting the timing and success of these 50% to 60% COS high-rate wells will play a sensitive role in our guidance projections, especially in the case of the single rig program where a well either hits or it doesn't.", "Third, the need to cut back on our existing Gulf Coast Beaumont area producers to protect them against sand flow has impacted our production as well. In our Jefferson Airplane area, despite cutting back the wells, by the end of the first quarter 3 of our 4 operated wells had ceased production. With this being a competitive reservoir, we made the decision to sidetrack our Jefferson Airplane #2 well with a rig we had working in the 2011 Gulf Coast inventory. We just recently submitted pipe on the Jefferson Airplane #2 sidetrack earlier this week, which frees up the rig to get back to work on our 2011 inventory. Our Gulf Coast program is now delayed, hence us adding 2 rigs to the program: one in May and the other planned for June.", "And finally, in addition to the 2 rigs we plan to add in the Gulf Coast, we have plans to add additional rigs in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, which should bring our anticipated rig count to 30 rigs in the Q2, Q3 timeframe. So with accelerated activity, both in rigs and completions, we expect continued strong production growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent during the second quarter with anticipated increases of 5% to 10% from reported levels in Q1. With the production cutbacks and delays we've mentioned in the Gulf Coast however, our Gulf Coast volumes are expected to drop 45 million to 50 million a day or 30% to 33% from Q1 to Q2, but it's a drop our Permian and Mid-Continent programs are projected to overcome, and hence our flat guidance of 580 to 600 here for the second quarter.", "Looking at our full year 2011 guidance, we expect continued strong production growth in the Permian and the Mid-Continent during Q3 and Q4, projecting approximate year-over-year production growth of 15% to 25% in these areas. Our current modeling predicts our 2011 Gulf Coast volumes will exhibit a year-over-year drop of $62 million a day or 35% from an average of $174 million a day in 2010 to $112 million a day here in 2011. However, our strong Permian and Mid-Continent production growth is projected to continue to more than offset that Gulf Coast decline, resulting in our revised guidance of 605 to 635 million a day, a range which equates to 2% to 7% production growth over our 2010 average of 596 million a day.", "The bottom line to our quarter is this: Nothing's changed in the way we think or what we do. We continue to stay focused on maximizing our return on investment through deliberate evaluation and execution. We have high cash flow, no significant debt, a deep inventory of drilling projects in each one of our core areas. We're seeing Q1 and Q2 production impacted by weather, production cutbacks in the Gulf Coast and delayed production adds in our Gulf Coast program, but we're teed up for production growth in the latter half of this year. We have an accelerated plan to catch up on our backlog of completions, and we've increased drilling activity in each one of our core areas. Most importantly, we have established momentum in our 2 long-term growth programs, the Permian and our Mid-Continent programs, the programs with deep multiyear inventories of drilling. And over time, the depth and consistent growth of these 2 programs will ultimately dominate the growth of our company.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. I just want to cover a couple of things from the release and the numbers that we've gotten some questions about, one of which is our production costs for the quarter, which increased $3.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 when they were $54.7 million to $58.5 million in the first quarter. Not a particularly large increase, about 7%. With all the activity in the industry, particularly in the Permian Basin, now services are tighter, costs have increased. That's a portion of it. It's very hard to isolate. But more logically, I think you can see the impact of just where we have more liquids, particularly oil, in our overall production mix. ", "If you think about where we were a year ago, when our gas production was 390 million a day, and that was 67% of our overall production. Now our gas production is 327 million a day, and it represents only 56% of our production. So as we become", "[Audio Gap]", "we're dealing with wherever you produce oil, you produce water. Those pumps require power and fuel, so those are additional costs. We incur trucking costs for saltwater disposal, as well as disposal costs. So some of it is really just the invisible hand of the economics allocating our capital more towards oil projects versus gas projects, which are inherently much lower cost. Just anecdotally for instance, if you look just at our Cana production from the Cana wells, our production cost is only $0.13 in Mcfe. Whereas if you look at and dissect our production cost in the Permian Basin, which is 50% oil, our production cost is $1.66 per Mcfe. So you can see how the blending of more Permian base production is leading to the higher cost. Having said all that, our margin in the Permian Basin is by far in excess of our margin in Cana, which is predominantly gas. So the bad news is production costs are up a little bit because we have more Permian activity. The good news is we're making more money because our operating margins are much higher in the Permian than they are anywhere else in the company. ", "The other thing that's gotten some attention is our tax position for the quarter, where we essentially deferred 100% of our booked tax provision for the quarter. That's new. I think everyone's, of course, aware that part of the stimulus legislation that we have -- had passed is what's known as bonus depreciation, which essentially allows the capital cost for equipment to be 100% depreciated in the year in which they were put in service. So it's a large acceleration of depreciation. So essentially our equipment costs are being traded the same way as our intangible drilling costs are this year. So as a result of that and with a larger capital budget overall, we do not anticipate at the present time that we would have a Federal tax liability for the year. And hence, we deferred 100%. ", "Obviously, there are many moving parts in tax calculations, the biggest of which is revenue. So it's -- the prices for gas and oil, as they go up and down, could have an impact on that as we move forward. Lastly, I just want to add, for any of our debt holders on the line, I hope you noticed that we were upgraded by S&P here recently to BB+. ", "With that, operator, we would be happy to begin to entertain questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Freeman. [Raymond James & Associates]", "John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "The Oklahoma Legislature recently approved the cost units facing Oklahoma. I'm curious if you have any plans in the Cana to do a 12 80 spaced long lateral well?", "Joseph Albi", "Yes, this is Joe Albi, John. In fact, Mark and I were talking about that this morning and expecting this question. We do have plans this year to test the concept in the southern part of Cana. And it probably won't be 12 80, just due to the sections that we'll be trying in. We don't see it as being something that we do in areas of the field that we've already developed on within a 640 with 5,000-foot laterals, but it is something we're also exploring.", "John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then moving to the Gulf Coast. Just want to make sure that I understand what's going on. Obviously, the declines there have been well documented the past year. But this quarter, despite some of the issues you all had, the mechanical issues at Jefferson and et cetera, your production was actually virtually flat from the fourth quarter after going several quarters with declines. So I'm just trying understand the reason for, I guess, the big acceleration and the decline from first quarter to second quarter?", "Joseph Albi", "This again is Joe. It's a combination of a number of things. First off, we had a one-rig line schedule working the Gulf Coast. We had one successful well at the beginning of the year, our Two Sisters #3 well. It was by no means as big as any of the other Kirby wells that we had. So it was not as good a well, and it has a steeper potential decline. We had our Jefferson Airplane wells that were exhibiting sand problems, and not knowing if it was beyond the scope of that competitive reservoir. There's a number of straws being yanked into that thing by 3 of those operators, and we are not the first to be having oil trouble, I might add. But we've taken a kind of prudent, proactive approach on our other South Texas wells just to be sure. We're pitching back our wells as we feel they're entering a certain phase envelope in the reservoir from a fluid standpoint, and you're seeing a little bit of that. We've got -- I've got a list of them here -- 6, 7 wells that we pinched back during the course of January through March that represent about 36 million a day of cutbacks. And what, in essence that is doing is it's differing that production. So if you look at our modeling, you're going to see that our Gulf Coast with the webs that we're throwing on top of it, it's going to drop for about 145 million a day here in Q1 to Q2. And then it's going to hold 100 for about the rest of the year. And so -- so you see a little bit of a cutback and a push out, if you want to look at it that way.", "F. Merelli", "It's pretty simple. You just -- you decrease the rate and you decrease the rate of decline. And so we just -- it produces -- it can produce that over a longer period of time. So it's going to break that decline rate.", "Joseph Albi", "And it's really just prudent reservoir management. The Jefferson Airplane deal may have been a fact that you had 7, 8, 9, 10 straws yanking on that thing so hard. That thing lasted about 18 months and it was making over 100 million a day at one time.", "John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yes. I guess I was looking at it from the opposite standpoint. I actually was really impressed with your first quarter Gulf Coast production despite all the issues you just went over. The production did a lot better than I thought, given the declines you'd had in the prior quarters. So I guess I was just trying to figure out why the production held up so well in the first quarter with all of those problems. And like you said, the one Two Sisters #3 you brought online, it's wasn't that big of a well, relatively speaking, than what you all have done in the past. So I guess I was just trying to get more color on the actual quarter why it did so well. I was on the opposite end.", "Joseph Albi", "It did well from a rate standpoint, don't get me wrong. And we had the benefit of that well from early January, when it came on. So it's on most of the entire quarter. But it's not as big a reserve well.", "John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then the last I had, I'll turn it to somebody else. The move to go from one rig in the Gulf Coast to 3 rigs, is that being driven by the prospects that you see or trying to offset some of these big decline issues that you're talking about right now?", "James Shonsey", "This is Jim. The way I'd answer that question would be I think we recognize we were behind. And the fact of the matter is we've either got projects that are either dependent or not dependent on another project. To the extent we have non-dependent projects, the sooner we get them done, the better. And it kind of smoothes out the volatility, if you want to call it that, in trying to project our guidance if you got 2 or 3 rig lines working. So it's simply a matter, in my mind, of accelerating those projects that we know we're going to drill anyway and just get them done this year", "F. Merelli", "And the other thing is, is that every time we drill a dry hole on the data set, we have to relook. Because we saw an anomaly, a seismic anomaly that we thought would produce. And it didn't. So they get a sonic log out of the dry hole and then they have to see what does that mean to that data set and what does it mean to the other prospects that we have out there. So that slows us up a little bit when we see one. We have to look at it and see if we can explain it. What does it mean to the other prospects? So it slowed us up a little bit. They looked at that, they've got a bunch of prospects out there, as Joe pointed out, that are non-contingent, and so we'll get in there and try to get them drilled now. But some of that delay is something and it depends on the reason that, seismically, what happened? What was the reason that the well didn't produce? And they have to take that apart and go through it. So every time we drill a dry hole, it kind of makes us look.", "John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Well, that's very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "You talked about the Permian frac availability loosening up a little bit so you could lock in some more frac crews to reduce your backlog. Can you talk about the pricing that you saw on those incremental crews?", "Joseph Albi", "Yes, this is Joe again. We virtually are seeing about the same prices across the board. And I think it's just a matter of more equipment being available right now.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So more equipment, but sort of flat price is what you're seeing?", "Joseph Albi", "Flat price. Where our frac costs are going up are when we're increasing stages or fluid or sand. And it has really nothing to do with vendor A being more than vendor B.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "All right. Going back to the Gulf Coast to the Two Sisters wells that you put on -- the 9 million, was that sort of a rate that you expected or above or below your expectations?", "Joseph Albi", "It's where we felt comfortable producing the well, given how the other wells have performed with regard to sand.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "But you didn't have a targeted expectation for that rig?", "Joseph Albi", "We targeted right around 10 or 11. So we held it there. And it was holding its own for a while, and we've recently pitched it back, as I mentioned, when it was going through its base.", "F. Merelli", "Another way to answer your question is that that well didn't look like a Jefferson Airplane, Kirby well -- it wasn't a thick Kirby. We weren't expecting one of those kinds of wells out of that well. So it was pretty much like we thought we'd find.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "How about the well that was the dry hole? What had you expected? Is that one of the bigger wells that you expected?", "F. Merelli", "We expected that we had a 40% chance of drilling a dry hole, and that's what we got. It probably would have been in the same kind of -- it wasn't. We weren't expecting big thick sands there. Those wells that come in for 9 to 10 million cubic feet a day and make all those of liquids and everything, they're tremendously economic, but they're just not quite as good as those other ones.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And this is the last question, your CapEx, you say, will be principally funded from cash flow. I sort of got the impression before that you are beginning to think that you would be willing to spend, I won't say a fair amount, but sort of meaningfully above cash flow. Are you beginning to rethink that maybe with the current commodity price volatility that you're seeing?", "F. Merelli", "Paul, you want to answer that? Go ahead.", "Paul Korus", "Well, where our expected cash flow is right now, plus the cash that we carried into the beginning of the year, we still think we can fund something in that 1.4 range. So we're okay.", "F. Merelli", "I think there's one thing that I need to clarify, and that is we like operating out of our cash flow, and it makes the drilling program look a lot better. And I have absolutely no reason -- if we find something we want to accelerate on, if we found some sort of deal out there that we liked, anything, we have such low leverage that that's really not any kind of a problem to us. And sometimes when I hear the question asked, I think that some people believe that we have some sort of rule around here that we're not going to expend our cash flow. And that's definitely not true. So it will depend on what we can get done. Now, frankly, it's booming along at about a $1.4 billion rate. We've got the organization stretched out pretty good. But if we find something that we really like, we'll extend that cash flow if we like the returns.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Hagen. [Lazard Capital Market]", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "A question on the Cana. There's been some good results out of the northwest portion of the play. Just to refresh our memory, how much acreage do you have there? And any plans to start drilling more out there?", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Eric, this is Mark. Our acreage is -- we probably only have -- it's a small portion, about 135,000 total acres in that play, probably only 10 or so, it's totally off the cuff here, that's in that Northwest section. We have more of our extensional area. We have more in the south than we do the northwest.", "F. Merelli", "Yes, we have -- we were involved in an acreage buy up there, but the term of that acreage is kind of going out. And so I don't know what we have up there, but we're probably not going to get to it because I think a lot of it goes out in 2011. And so that northwest extension of the Cana project, as far as Cimarex is concerned, probably has its limitations.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Just back to the Gulf Coast really briefly. How many additional wells do you think you can get drilled with the additional 2 rigs there this year?", "Mark Burford", "This is Mark again. With that couple additional rigs, actually, we're already planning to have one rig and maybe 2 during the year for our original plan.  They were scoped down with some of the sidetracking of the Jefferson Airplane well. That third rig actually keeps us on track for our original plan. So probably 10 to 12 wells this year, which we had not originally planned to do.", "F. Merelli", "The other thing, Eric, is that it'll be -- some of the -- a couple of these prospects could have development wells on them. So we don't know. We're just looking at them. But there's funny-looking thing that might accommodate 2 wells. So if we get into some of that, which we hope we do, then we'll get a little bit more done. But we don't know that until we get them drilled. So we're going to blast through the non-contingent part of the exploration program in the Gulf Coast, see what we got and go from there.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. And the last one I had is just on the additional rigs being added to the Permian and Mid-Continent. I was wondering if you could maybe break down one of those -- which plays those rigs might be going into. Is it an increase in rigs in the Bone Spring in the Permian, for example, or more Wolfcamp? And in the Mid-Continent, any additional rigs in the Granite Wash or over the Hogshooter?", "Joseph Albi", "This is Joe. You'll see us in the Permian. This is just higher level. Probably we'll be back up in the Paddock area. We're going to dedicate some rig activity to the Wolfcamp shale obviously in the Culberson area in Reeves County, as well as in the Culberson County. And then the third Bone Spring in Warwick in West Texas. So those are really the bigger areas. We do have some rigs that we're slating for saltwater disposal projects, to kind of follow-up on what Paul was talking about. Our saltwater disposal cost represented about $0.10 per Mcfe. And we've now got enough production out there we can justify the drilling if necessary and dedicate some rig activity there, too.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then in the Mid-Continent, is it additional rigs in Cana? Or will you be accelerating now in maybe the Hemphill County or...", "Joseph Albi", "We're going to add one more rig to Cana and probably an additional rig in the Texas Panhandle. And we'll probably throw a rig at Southern Oklahoma.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Just thinking about the Hogshooter. Do you have -- what is the acreage position that you have specifically over the Hogshooter?", "Mark Burford", "This is Mark. We talked a little bit about what the team sees as net acres in that area. It's a pretty small amount, but they think they have something like maybe 4,000 net acres or something. But it looks very encouraging as far as economics. That first well was a good well, but as far as extension of running room, it's not that great for us.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then -- you guys have been very gracious on the thoughts on the Gulf Coast and I think I got a little confused. What is the current rate of the Gulf Coast?", "Joseph Albi", "Today, we're running around 100 million a day.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "About 100 million a day. So that fed into your comments on restricting the rates on the wells and getting that 50%, 60% annual decline to smooth out a bit, and so that's why you came down and you kind of flatlined it through the rest of the year. Is that a way to think about it?", "Joseph Albi", "That's our hope, that's our current model. Of note, you'll notice that our full year guidance -- I think this is important -- a little statistic to throw out there. Our full year guidance dropped 10 million a day, midpoint to midpoint. Our Gulf Coast projection is 20 million a day below where we thought it would be when we first put out our guidance. So the Permian and the Mid-Continent have made up an additional 10 above and beyond what we had forecasted at the beginning of the year.", "F. Merelli", "And it's because we can't forecast it's sanding up and a lot of those other things that happened. We've got a lot of -- those are great wells and we love them, but they're hard to predict.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And given the competitive drainage situation, why can't you and the other guys that are producing do some type of unitization to not damage the reservoir? Or how does that work?", "F. Merelli", "Because we're competitors. And we like it that way.", "Joseph Albi", "Mick's answer was we're competitors. And the fact of the matter is that would be very difficult to build it. It started off as a war and it kind of ended as a war, but the irony is the last guy standing will probably be the winner. And a lot of us...", "F. Merelli", "Yes. Your suggestion is absolutely on point. But in practicality, in that part of the world, it doesn't happen. People just line up and compete.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "So the rate at which you produce this reservoir, given the condensate yields, if you pull too hard it won't lower the overall recovery factor?", "F. Merelli", "Not significantly. The thing that you can tell about what we're saying that we're concerned about and we have little devices that listen for sand grains, the problem is, is that sometime we get instead of one sand grain, we get a couple of yards of sand. But that's the problem. At sometime, and for whatever reasons, a lot of people have seen in that part of the world when that pressure comes down and you're at high rates, you can start moving that sand.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Petura, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. On today's call here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, EVP of Exploration; Joe Albi, EVP of Operations; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, VP and Controller. Mick is out of the office this week, and unable to make the call. But we did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. And we will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call. I\u2019ll refer you to the end of the press release for our disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. ", "As stated in our earnings release, we reported net income of $166.7 million or $1.94 per share for the quarter, which includes $0.16 per share in noncash mark-to-market gain on our hedges. This compares to second quarter 2010 earnings of $124.6 million or $1.46 per diluted share. Our oil and gas revenues in this quarter totaled $452.3 million, a 24% increase compared to $364.9 million last year. In the second quarter, cash flow from operations hit $343.4 million, 32% greater than last year's second quarter cash flow, $259.9 million. ", "Our higher earnings in revenues and cash flow largely reflect the 33% to 35% increase in our oil and NGL prices, and liquid this quarter did account for 45% of our equivalent volumes. So I hit a few \u2013 a couple of hitting notes, a couple of financial metrics there, but we'll go ahead and jump in to the meat of the call. And I'll turn over to Tom Jorden to cover our operations.", "Thomas Jorden", "Thanks, Mark. I'd like to take a few minutes to kind of walk through our drilling program area by area. We have a great balance of opportunities to our Mid-Continent, Permian and Gulf Coast. Currently, we have 27 operator rigs drilling. 14 of those are in the Permian Basin, 11 are in the Mid-Continent and 2 are on the onshore Gulf Coast. ", "In the first half of the year, we drilled and completed 148 gross or 80 net wells. And as Mark said, we invested $757 million in exploration and development. Of our total expenditures, 48% were invested in projects in the Mid-Continent, 46% in the Permian Basin and 6% in the Gulf Coast and other. We're looking at full-year capital to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And as we've said time and again and it bears repeating, that really isn't a budget. That's kind of a rough guide between now and the end of the year, and we make our investment-drilling decisions as we go along. So that second half capital will certainly be a function of our drilling results, cost of services and our opportunity set. ", "As we look at that full year, though, we're expecting roughly half to be spread between the greater Mid-Continent area, about $750 million; $750 million more than likely to be in the Permian Basin; and then the remainder would be Gulf Coast and other so very, very nice set of opportunities and a fairly balanced program. ", "Starting in the Permian Basin, we drilled and completed 71 gross or 56 net Permian wells during the first 6 months of 2011, completing 94% as producers. And at quarter end, we had 10 gross, 8 net wells, still waiting on completion. Our drilling was principally in the Delaware Basin of Texas and Southeast New Mexico, and mainly targeted Bone Spring, Paddock, Abo, and Wolfcamp formations. Permian exploration development capital year-to-date through the second quarter, as I said, totaled $345 million for 46% of our total capital year-to-date. And I will walk through area by area. One of the things that we've said in the past and will certainly be apparent here is that our Permian program is split between several different programs. ", "First is our Bone Spring program. Bone Spring formation is really multiple plays over a large area. In Central Eddy and Lea Counties, we have our second and third Bone Spring horizontal oil play. Those are sands that are more of a conventional target and that we map channels. They do have some aerial extent, but it's not what we classically think of as an area-wide resource play. You have to have a focused geological picture, and we're targeting these sand accumulations. ", "In Texas, we've got the third Bone Spring. That's a little more aerial extensive, that\u2019s sands, and we continue to realize great results from all of our Bone Spring drilling. Recent notable horizontal Bone Spring wells we brought on production, and these are 30-day average numbers, in the second quarter, we brought on our Irwin 13 Federal 2H well where we had 100% working interest. That well had a 30-day average of 810 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our KHC 33-24 2H well, a 96% working interest had a 30-day average of 750 barrels of oil per day, barrel oil equivalent. And then our Parkway State 17 Com 3H, where we had a 94% working interest, came on first 30 days at 710-barrel oil equivalent per day. So production from the New Mexico Bone Spring drilling over the last 2 years has gone from basically 0 in July 2009 when we kicked off the program to over 10,000 barrels per day gross, currently. ", "For all the wells we have drilled and completed in our New Mexico second and third Bone Spring play, the gross first 30-day IP has averaged 590 barrel of oil equivalent per day. And that's 400 barrels of oil per day and 190 barrel of oil equivalent per day. So it does make some gas and gas-associated liquids. Our gross actual EURs have remained consistently averaging 570,000 Mboe, thousand barrels of oil equivalent. And of that 570,000 Mboe, 400,000 barrels is actual oil and 170,000 Mboe of gas and gas-associated liquids. That's our type curve. We've talked about that quite a bit in the past. And that second and third Bone Spring, our type curve is that 570,000 Mboe typically comes on. Our type curve is about 600 barrel of oil equivalent per day for its first 30-day average. And those wells cost currently between $5 million and $5.5 million to drill and complete. So very nice type curve. We're achieving very nice results there. And as in so many of our plays, our type curve is grounded in our actual results. ", "We have a solid drilling inventory of 170 gross operated drilling locations in the New Mexico second and third Bone Spring and over 140 Texas third Bone Spring locations. So we would expect this to increase over time, especially with the first Bone Spring or Avalon potential over our acreage. And I just want to talk about that for a second. That potential we talk about is in New Mexico, and Eddy and Lea County is in the second and third Bone Spring. In and around our acreage, the Avalon, our first Bone Spring, is an emerging play. There are a number of operators aggressively drilling. We have tested a few wells, and we'll be talking about those in subsequent calls. But we see that as another significant objective that has potential through a large swath of our acreage. ", "I also want to say, before I move on to other plays, that the second and third Bone Spring play in Eddy and Lea County is our most active leasing area, really company-wide, on a dollar basis. In the first half of the year, we've been very successful in that play acquiring additional opportunity. We have committed or spent $52 million in the first half in that play and picking up additional leases. And that is for leases in hand that are committed about 16,000 net additional acres. And those are acres that are focused on ideas we really like. So this is a continuing opportunity set for us. We have multi years of inventory there, and that's been just a really, really nice play for us. ", "Well let's talk a minute about our emerging plays, in particular our emerging liquids-rich play. We're moving along with our evaluation of unconventional plays, liquid-rich plays in the Delaware Basin, targeting the Wolfcamp, the Avalon Shale and the Cisco/Canyon or Penn Shale. We have a large acreage position of 160,000 acres perspective for some or all of that perspective for the Wolfcamp, Avalon, Cisco/Canyon. This year, we drilled and completed 5 new horizontal Wolfcamp wells, which bringing our total Wolfcamp wells drilled and completed to 12 wells. ", "Our first 30-day production from all of these wells has averaged 6.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which comprised as 48% gas, 31% natural gas liquids and 21% oil. We're still really timing this play. We're still trying to evaluate what the play means to us currently and the future potential. We have a lot of wells that are still waiting on completion. We have a lot of areas of the play yet to be developed. As I'm sure Joe will talk about, we\u2019ve built an infrastructure in Culberson County that will allow us to further our drilling and completion in that area. We had to build a gathering system, and that's just nearing completion now. And that will allow us to test a lot more area of that play. ", "A lot of the wells that we've drilled to date have been concentrated in Eddy County and our White City area where we have approximately 60,000 net acres, and we've had very, very nice results there. Wolfcamp, one thing we can say is, particularly, as I move on to talk about Cana, the Wolfcamp has a steeper decline than our Woodford in Cana. There, we talk about a 55% year-over-year decline. In the Wolfcamp, we're observing a 75% year-over-year decline. But still, the wells are very profitable, delivering nice results. We're very, very pleased with what we see thus far. But again, I want to underscore, we're in the early stage of that evaluation. We have lots of objectives that have not been tested yet, and we're still trying to evaluate what it means to us. Like all of these plays, that 160,000 acres will have sweet spots. There will be areas where one or more of those objectives are perspective, and the others will not be. So we're still evaluating, but we're very pleased to report we're very encouraged by what we've seen yet so far. ", "And overall, looking at the Permian, before we move on, we have 14 operator rigs running in the Permian, 8 of those are in the Bone Spring play of New Mexico, 1 is in the Paddock play of New Mexico, 2 are in Eddy County, evaluating the Wolfcamp and that White City block. And then we have 3 rigs in the West Texas Bone Spring play. So we're very active in the Permian Basin. We're seeing good results from our drilling program. We have a great position and some great plays. And as we've talked about in the past, we have some of the most outstanding generators in our company working the Permian Basin. They continue to find new opportunities. We've been very aggressive acquiring additional leasehold. For those of you that follow the state and federal sales in New Mexico, we have been one of the most aggressive participants in those sales. So in this environment, we're able to make a very, very good return. ", "At the moment, we worry, as we always worry. We have cost creep and competition. We're seeing our cost go up, and we're seeing a lot of new entrants still into the Permian Basin. So we're seeing good returns in our Permian basin oil plays. But as always, it's about returns and we are forging ahead, cautiously worried about some pressures to our returns. ", "Moving on to Mid-Continent for the first half 2011. In the Mid-Continent, we drilled and completed a total of 86 gross or 32 net wells and completed 100% of those as producers. At quarter end, 22 gross and 8 net wells were waiting completion. Our Mid-Continent exploration development capital through the second quarter totaled $363 million or 48% of our total capital. Of course, the majority of that current-year drilling activity has been in our Anadarko Basin, Cana play, our Woodford Shale play, where Cimarex drilled and completed 71 gross and 23 net wells. At quarter end, 22 gross and 8 net wells were being completed or are waiting on completion. ", "Since the Cana play began late 2007, Cimarex has participated in 257 gross, 100 net wells. Of total wells, 214 gross, or 79 net were on production at quarter end, and the remainder were either in the process of being drilled or awaiting completion. Our net second quarter 2011 production from the Cana play averaged 115 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is a 53% increase versus the second quarter of 2010 average of 75 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Cana is a very, very active project at Cimarex, obviously, and it's also an active science project at Cimarex. ", "As much as we're forging ahead with hundreds of wells drilled, we still have a lot of questions that we have to answer. We're still investigating spacing. We're just now in the process of completing a pilot project. That's a 2-well pilot that we'll be able to talk about here shortly. We drilled 2 wells side-by-side and did a tremendous amount of science trying to map the fracture network and understand the actual drainage pattern. Within the core, however, and we define a core a lot of ways. But for the sake of argument, we'll define the core as that portion of the play that we think we can confidently say will be down-spaced, and we think the most likely down spacing within that core is going to be 80-acre spacing or 8 wells per section. ", "Within that core area, where we say the Woodford is 150 feet thicker, down to depths of 15,000 feet, we have 64,000 net acres. Now that's not the entire asset of ours, of course, but that's just the area we think fairly confidently we can say, we'll more than likely be down-spaced at 8 wells per section. Cimarex's asset within that area is 4 to 5 Tcf net of royalty. We have many years of future development. We're still expanding the play. In no way shape or form am I suggesting that we think our asset is confined to that core. In fact, we have 8 rigs currently working in the play, and 6 of those 8 are drilling outside that core, making very nice returns for us on areas that we'll be talking about on subsequent calls. We're still holding acreage drilling one well per section and increasing our understanding of that expanding core. Current AFEs are $7.5 million to $8.5 million at the core of the play, and Joe will give a little more detail there. So by whatever measure, Cana has been a very, very successful legacy asset of ours, and we'll be developing that for many, many years to come. ", "In the Mid-Continent, we have 11 operator rigs running, 8 in the Cana play, 2 are in the Granite Wash and 1 in the Texas Panhandle, 1 in western Oklahoma and 1 is working in southern Oklahoma. ", "And then finally, in the Gulf Coast, during the first 6 months of 2011, we drilled 3 gross or 2.3 net wells. One of which was successful. So we drilled a couple of dry holes. Actually, one of those dry holes was completed, but we stood out of the completion. Our Gulf Coast exploration development capital year-to-date through the second quarter totaled $39 million or 5% of our capital. We're drilling a well near the Jefferson County Airport, called the Jefferson Airport #5, and we're rigging up on the Pica 2 after recently finishing drilling the Amazon Queen #2 well. The Amazon Queen #2 is a smaller prospect, and we expect that to begin producing later this month. So the Gulf Coast is an ongoing part of our business. It's obviously gotten a lot of attention lately. It remains a high rate of return for us, a much, much smaller portion of our capital. ", "So overall, we like the balance of our program. We're achieving nice growth in our Permian and Mid-Continent. We see a rich and expanding opportunity set there. And Gulf Coast will continue to be that high rate of return program that will be a much, much smaller portion of our capital going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Joseph Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all of you for joining us on our call today. I'll briefly go over our second quarter production. I'll hit on our third quarter and full-year production guidance, update you on where we see current service costs and then finish up with a few comments about our recently announced sale of our Riley Ridge project. ", "Well, Q2 came in just about as planned, with reported average net daily equivalent production of 585.7 million per day. We came in just below the midpoint of our guidance of 580 million to 600 million, and down slightly from our Q1 '11 average of 590 million per day. Our second quarter numbers were impacted by numerous unanticipated pipeline maintenance and repair shut-ins in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, which reduced our quarterly production by approximately 4 million to 5 million per day. And accounting for these volumes, we would have been just about a bit above the midpoint of our guidance and almost exactly flat with Q1. ", "We set a few new records in Q2. Our reported Mid-Continent net daily equivalent production of 284.7 million per day was a record for the region and represented 49% of our total company production. As Tom mentioned, a significant subset of this production comes from Cana, which averaged a record 115 million per day in Q2, and again, that's up 53% from the 75 million per day that we reported in Q2 '10. ", "Our reported Permian net daily equivalent production of 182.3 million per day was again a record for the region, and it represents now 31% of our total company production. Combined, the Mid-Continent and the Permian now make up 80% of our total production. Our combined Mid-Continent, Permian oil and NGL volumes also hit an all-time high of 33,704 barrels a day, which now represent 77.5% of our total liquids, which is again a combined high for the company. With a strong contribution from both the Mid-Continent and the Permian, liquids now make up 45% of our total company production, which is the peak liquid ratio for the company. These new records really continue to demonstrate our business strategy and emphasis on long-term growth in the Mid-Continent and Permian, with a focus on oil and liquids-rich gas. ", "As we discussed during our last call, we expected Q2 to be somewhat flat to Q1, anticipating that 40 million to 50 million per day drop in our Gulf Coast production from Q1 to Q2. When the dust settled, we saw lead drop in the Gulf Coast production. But as we've seen in quarters past, the drop was offset by continued production growth for our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. As compared to Q1 '11, our total Gulf Coast equivalent production dropped 32 million per day, from 149 million per day in Q1 to 117 million per day in Q2. That's a drop of 21.5%. Offsetting this, our Mid-Continent volumes increased 19 million per day, from 266 million per day in Q1 to 285 million per day in Q2, a 7% increase. And our Permian volumes increased 8 million per day, from 174 million per day in Q1 to 182 million per day in Q2, a 5% increase from Q1. ", "As compared to Q2 '10, our Q2 '11 total company equivalent production of 585.7 million per day was virtually flat or down 1% from our Q2 '10 average of 594 million per day. Breaking down the numbers, we see the same story, significant but anticipated drops in our Gulf Coast production, offset by attractive year-over-year production gains from our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. Over the last 12 months, our Gulf Coast volumes have dropped 73 million per day, from 190 million per day in Q2 '10 to 117 million per day in Q2 '11. That's a drop of 38%. Offsetting this, our Mid-Continent and Permian programs reflect a combined 64 million per day increase, with our Mid-Continent volumes up 37 million per day from 248 million per day in Q2 '10 to 285 million in Q2 '11, a 15% increase. And our Permian volumes make up 27 million per day, from 155 million per day in Q2 '10 to 182 million per day in Q2 '11. That's a 17% increase. Combined, the Mid-Continent and Permian programs, which now make up 80% of our production, grew at a respectful combined annual rate of 16%. ", "With our focus on oil and liquids-rich gas, we continue to see our product mix move more towards liquids. Our Q2 '11 reported net gas production of 325 million per day, and combined oil and NGL production of 43,500 barrels a day puts our current liquid ratio at 45%. That's up 38% in Q2 '10 and 44% in Q1 '11. Once again, the Permian and Mid-Continent are the real drivers to our liquids growth, with our Q2 \u201911 Permian liquid volume now at 18,600 barrels a day. That's a 30% increase from where it was in Q2 '10; and our Mid-Continent liquid volumes now at 15,104 barrels a day. That's a 72% increase from where it was in Q2 '10. ", "I want to set the stage a bit with a few comments before touching on our remaining year guidance. First, during Q2, we added additional frac fleets to address our backlog of wells waiting on frac. We currently have 4 frac crews working the Permian and 3 working the Mid-Continent for a total of 7, versus the 3 that we had working in Q1 of this year. As a result, we ended Q2 with 16 net wells waiting on frac as compared to the 31 net wells we had at the end of Q1. Most of the accelerated activity occurred later in Q2, with associated production anticipated to show up here -- showing up and anticipated to further show up in late June and early July. ", "Secondly, we increased our operated rig count from 24 rigs in Q1 to 27 rigs at the end of Q2. And as Tom mentioned, we did this by adding 2 rigs to the Permian and 1 to the Gulf Coast, bringing our quarter end rig count to 14 in the Permian, 11 in the Mid-Continent and 2 in the Gulf Coast. ", "Third, as you are all aware, the success of our Gulf Coast programs can create significant periodic swings in our production, up or down. Our ability to accurately predict the timing and success of 50% to 60% COS high-rate Gulf Coast wells can and will have short-term impacts on our guidance. After our recent dry holes and experiencing mechanical problems on our Two Sisters #2 and Two Sisters #3 wells, which were on decline but adding 14 million per day in net production in June, we've reduced our current projection for 2011 Gulf Coast production from that of last quarter. The 30,000 foot view of our production should really be seen as having 2 different indistinct components. The first and most critical is our low to moderate risk programs; that\u2019s the Mid-Continent and the Permian. These programs bring us predictable, long-life production and a deep, predictable multiyear inventory of drilling projects. ", "As we've seen quarter-to-quarter, these programs are the underlying catalysts to our long-term production growth. The second is our high rate of return and short R/P Gulf Coast program, which inherently brings a component of uncertainty in the timing of production adds and drops. Our production can jump up or come down significantly in short order. This program really needs to be seen for what it is. That's a high rate of return cash flow investment. In essence, we're investing $1 today and getting $2 back next month. With short-term production profiles, the individual Gulf Coast wells simply cannot add long-term production. But from a different, perhaps more realistic perspective, the success of our Gulf Coast program over the last few years really has had an indirect strong contribution to our long-term production, simply by spinning off high rate of returns and cash flow, which has been redirected back into our longer-term Mid-Continent and Permian programs. ", "We recently took a look at our production growth since 2007 and saw some interesting results, which really helped illustrate this point. In 2007, we reported average net daily equivalent production of 451 million per day. Using our Q2 '11 total company production of 586 million per day as a reference point, we're up 135 million per day from 2007. Over that same time period, our Mid-Continent production is up $93 million per day, from 192 million per day in '07 to 285 million in Q2 '11. And our Permian production is up 38 million per day, from 144 million per day in '07 to 182 million in Q2 '11. Combined, the Mid-Continent and the Permian programs make up 131 million per day of the 135 million per day increase we've seen since 2007, with just 4 million per day coming from our Gulf Coast program. What does it mean? It means that Mid-Continent and Permian have really been the underlying drivers to our long-term growth, while our Gulf Coast program, with large production increases in late '09 and throughout 2010 simply generated significant cash flow, which we use for reinvestment. ", "Well, looking now to guidance for the last half of the year, we've updated our model to reflect our increased rig activity, our accelerated completions and a reduction in anticipated 2011 Gulf Coast volumes as a result of our recent dry holes and mechanical problems. With our accelerated activity, we're projecting our Q3 volumes to be up from Q2, with a guidance projection of 585 million to 610 million per day. Our revised full-year guidance range is coming in at 595 million to 610 million, which is down 10 million per day on the low end and 25 million per day on the high end from our previous guidance of 605 million to 635 million that we gave in our last call. The majority of this reduction is simply associated with our revised forecast for the Gulf Coast. ", "Our projected midpoint for 2011 gives total company guidance of 603 million per day. It represents a slight increase to 2010, with our Mid-Continent and Permian programs projected to continue to offset any forecasted decline that we see in the Gulf Coast, which we currently have modeled at 43%, from a reported average of 174 million per day in 2010 for the Gulf Coast to a current full-year projection, which would include the production in Q1 and Q2, to give us a full-year average of approximately 100 million per day for the Gulf Coast in 2011. ", "Well, a few words on our lifting costs before touching on our drilling and completion cost. A look at our financial, it shows Q2 lifting cost coming in at $1.14 per Mcfe, with our year-to-date number falling in at $1.12 per Mcfe. That's right at the midpoint of our 2011 guidance of $1.02 to $1.22. Since mid-2010, we've seen an increase in expenses due to a number of factors: general cost escalations, our shift towards oil activity, numerous lease maintenance projects, but more impacted by increased saltwater disposal and power and fuel cost, which have been directly related to our pickup in new well activity. We are beginning to see early signs of stabilization in op cost, and as such, we're keeping our 2011 guidance projection steady at $1.02 to $1.22. ", "We continue to see increased cost pressure on our drilling and completion costs, as Tom mentioned, especially on the completion side. Since the beginning of the year, we've seen fracture stimulation costs go up anywhere from 5% to 100%, with the biggest increases coming from the Permian. Increased Permian industry activity has, by itself, significantly increased the demand for frac services. Equipment is available as we've demonstrated by securing additional fleets. But the service and material costs are what are rising, and they\u2019ve risen somewhat sharply since the beginning of the year. ", "On the drilling side, we've seen cost increases in most all of our cost categories since the beginning of the year. But that said, we feel that the rate of cost increase may actually be slowing down, and we continue to stay focused on cost and design efficiencies where we can to help keep our cost escalations in check. As a result, we've seen anywhere from 0% to 10% increases in our core program AFE since last quarter. As an example, through operating efficiencies, we've kept our generic Cana AFEs, for the shallow and core areas of the play somewhat flat since the beginning of the year at levels of $7.5 million to $8.5 million. That's up \u2013 although flat for the last 6 months, we're still up about 10% to 15% from where we saw those costs in mid-2010. ", "Our recent New Mexico second Bone Spring horizontal AFEs have increased to levels of $5 million to $5.5 million. That's up from levels of $4.8 million to $5.2 million that we quoted in Q2, and this is due primarily to increased stimulation cost that are more directly associated with the change in completion design other than the change in service costs. ", "Our Paddock-Blinebry vertical AFEs have jumped a modest 5% to 10%, from $1.8 million to $1.9 million in Q2 to current levels of $2 million to $2.1 million here in the current month. And this is due primarily to overall cost increases. ", "As we continue to develop and refine our Woodford Shale play, we see our current AFEs running right now, $7.2 million to $7.7 million. This is up from the $6.5 million to $7.5 million range reported last call, and this is due primarily to increased costs associated with testing various completion designs. Once again, as we see this play, in particular, develop, we see it to have more of a chance to be like Cana, where various operating efficiencies will take root and we\u2019ll see those costs stabilize and/or reduce. ", "Same neck of the woods, Tom had mentioned a little bit about Culberson County and our attempts to put in our own infrastructure, and really just a simple comment here. There's virtually little if any infrastructure out there, from gathering to power, to saltwater disposal, what have you. That's the bad news. The good news is, this provides us with an opportunity to control our own destiny, and we're simply putting ourselves in a position to build the infrastructure and maintain optionality for markets. And by doing this, we'll have access to at least 3 markets and hopefully more to help get our product moved. ", "Before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to say a few words about the recently announced sale of our interest in the Riley Ridge project in southwest Wyoming to Denbury, a deal we closed on this past Monday. As you know, we've been developing this project over the last few years. And we had an anticipated plant startup date scheduled for fall of this year. Well, Denbury became our partner in the project last September after acquiring the interest of the majority non-operating working interest owner. And the sale of our 57.5% interest in the project simply made -- ultimately made sense from the standpoint of both companies. Where we saw a value in the project from the sale of methane and helium, Denbury saw value in methane, helium and CO2. This last Co2 source is an important part of Denbury's enhanced recovery strategy and was certainly a win for Denbury. A solid purchase price was certainly a win for Cimarex. ", "Selling a property outside of our core areas of activity for premium price and redirecting proceeds into our higher rate of return drilling program just simply made sense to us. Through the sale, we'll derive proceeds of $191 million, with $176 million paid at closing and another $15 million to be paid upon the successful startup of the plan. Net Cimarex hydrocarbon production of about 10 million per day was scheduled to occur in late fall, and that now is obviously and hasn't -- is not included in our guidance projections. ", "So in summary, Q2 was a very good quarter for us. Production from our long-term Mid-Continent and Permian programs continues to grow, setting new records for the company and exhibiting 15% to 17% annual growth. All the while, we're living within our cash flow and ended the quarter with money in the bank. Our shift towards liquids continues to hit the radar screen, with our Q2 '11 oil volumes now at a record level and the Mid-Continent and Permian liquids up a combined 46% from a year ago. These stats simply show our stripes, long-term growth in the Mid-Continent and Permian, with an emphasis on oil and liquids-rich gas. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. I'd like to recap a few things. While much has been made about our production being down 1% from a year ago and a 3% reduction in our guidance, I do want to point out that financially, things look much better. To remind everyone, Q2 this year versus second quarter of 2010, our revenues were up 24%, our cash flow was up 32% and our reported GAAP earnings were up 33%. We like those measures, and I think if we have successive quarters of those, we should be just fine.", "Part of what drove the increase in revenues, cash flow and earnings, of course, was prices but also the shift in our mix. Like so many others in the industry, our mix is changing. A year ago, we were about 37.5% liquid, 62.5% gas. Now we're more like 45% liquids, 55% gas. So we are certainly benefiting by having that alteration in our mix and enjoying the benefit of the higher liquids and oil prices, both of which have remained remarkably strong. In addition, during the first half, we invested $750 million, but yet had no change in our debt outstanding or shares outstanding. ", "As we look to our revised capital program for the year, as we mentioned in the news release, from roughly what used to be a $1.4 billion expectation to now what is approximately $1.6 billion, the increase is almost all in the Mid-Continent. That stems from the non-core drilling that we are doing in Cana. So on the old numbers, our Mid-Continent expectation had been about $590 million. That is now about $750 million. So that's an increase of $160 million. Our Permian Basin activity is remaining pretty much as expected. But with cost pressures out there, we're seeing our estimate go from what had been $710 million to now something more like $750 million, a $40 million increase. In the Gulf Coast, although it was only about $40 million of our total $750 million in the first half is still expected to be about $100 million for the year, and there is no change to that. ", "We will have higher land and seismic investment this year between regular leasing, as well as some acquisitions of improved via purchase and sale agreements. We were about $64 million, $65 million through the first half of the year, probably on track to see that number be about $130 million, $135 million by year end. With the $1.6 billion of capital, question in terms of how will that be funded. We've pretty much, all through the year, expected our cash flow to be about $1.3 billion. We're certainly on track for that, given that the first half of the year was about $650 million. So, so far, so good, we're on track. So with $1.3 billion of cash flow, we came in to the year with $100 million -- over $100 million of cash on the balance sheet. We've worked our way through that. But with our property sales, of course, largely dominated by the sale of the Riley Ridge asset of what should approach $200 million in total. Those 3 things add up to the $1.6 billion. So we're in very good shape financially from that perspective, and laying a lot of groundwork for what we hope is much stronger growth in 2012. ", "With that, operator, I believe we are ready to entertain questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bill Allman.", "Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "It's Joe Allman, actually, with JPMorgan. I guess a couple of questions. One, for Tom, in terms of your plans for the Avalon Shale and the Cisco/Canyon, could you just talk about what you're planning on doing over there over the 6 months or so?", "Thomas Jorden", "Well, Joe, we have a few Avalon wells that we're drilling and testing. And we're -- the Avalon is a big area. So there's hundreds and hundreds of square miles out here where you say Avalon. But I will say in Lea County, New Mexico where it's oily, we are drilling a few wells between now and the end of the year, and we're testing some completion techniques. And if we get the kind of success that we think we will achieve and that the industry has achieved, I think there's a real good chance that, that will kick off an additional drilling program for us in the Avalon. And then we have in the Penn Shale, in Eddy County, we have completed a well, and we're just watching flowback on that. I don't really have anything to say on it because we don't have any conclusions yet, but we're just testing the producibility of the Penn Shale with modern stimulation, Joe. As I said in the past, we've drilled a number of Penn Shale wells in years past, horizontal wells in and around our White City area, but we've yet to put a modern shale stimulation on it. So we're just doing our first one and watching the results. So the Avalon's a big area, Joe, and I would anticipate that we will be out drilling the Avalon. In 2012, I would anticipate that we'll have an Avalon program that we'll be talking about. But certainly, your question is between now and the end of the year, we're testing a few things and we're going get our own learnings under our belt and continue to study the industry.", "Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, that's helpful. And then looking at second quarter production, it appears that the Gulf Coast actually did not decline as much as you had modeled. I know it's very difficult to figure out where the Gulf Coast is going to go. And -- but so -- did the Permian production not rise as much? And with that -- and I think I heard you talk about pipeline interruptions. Could you just address that?", "Joseph Albi", "A couple of things there, Joe, on the -- first on the Gulf Coast production. I think the number we quoted was somewhere 100 million, 110 million or something like that in Q2, and it came in at 117 million. A couple of things happened there. Number one, right about the time of our call, one of our Jefferson Airplane wells #3 was down. And right about the time of our call, we were successful in restoring about 3 million per day worth of production from that well. So it came on and was not put into our guidance projection. Secondly, I think we'd mentioned that we are sidetracking our Jefferson Airplane #1 sidetrack well. That came on in about the middle of June and gave some second quarter contribution, and we kind of thought that might show up in Q3. We also had 2 wells, our Amazon Queen 1 and our Nine Dragons well that both, in essence, I'll call them, outperformed our forecast. So that said, that really is the reason for that. But when I look forward and I compare our plan for the Gulf Coast last call versus our plan this call, if I look at Q2 in our last plan, we outperformed it. But if I look at where our last plan called Q3 and Q4 to be, it was predicting right around 100 million per day. I don't know the exact numbers, but right around 100 million per day. Our current plan is predicting anywhere from 80 million to 90 million per day for Q3 and Q4. And really, that's a net result of the 2 dry holes that we had, where we had modeled some anticipated production from them. In particular, on the high side, those wells really affected our high side of our guidance. And then the Two Sisters 2 and Two Sisters 3 both decided, I guess talked to each other, and at the end of June, we lost one and then early in July, we lost the other. We're looking at remedial work to restore production there, and it doesn't look all that promising. One of them may present itself as a sidetrack candidate, where if we were to get back to it, it probably won't show up until later in this year and not give us much of a bang for our buck on production. So hopefully, that helps clear up a little bit on the Gulf Coast for where we see, and I really think that's important for you guys to understand how we're modeling that for obvious reasons, because that's the unpredictable one. In the Permian, there are a couple of things going on. One was the downtime I mentioned associated with plant shut-ins. That's probably close to 2.5 million per day worth of lost production, and we also had a handful wells that we shut in to -- in some of our frac projects to offset wells that we had shut in. So there's a little bit of influence there, but the biggest piece was trying to get a good, clear schedule on where we would have these fracs -- frac crews show up and when they'd show up. If you look at daily production, you're going to see that our Permian production really takes a nice bump at the tail end, about the mid to the tail end period of June. So it's really that accelerated activity in the Permian is not really starting to show its signs.", "Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Again, that\u2019s helpful, Joe. And I think you said -- did you say that you're guiding for a 43% base decline in the Gulf Coast?", "Joseph Albi", "Yes. I think the number I quoted there was that we'd end the year with an average of about 100 million per day.", "Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. So going forward, do you expect that the declines from the Gulf Coast will soften quarter-after-quarter? And just help us get comfortable with how to -- I know it's hard to forecast, but to better forecast Gulf Coast production.", "Joseph Albi", "Well, without mechanical problems and without additional drilling success, I would think you could presume that our 2012, maybe this will help you out, Joe, our 2012 production number might equate to -- with existing production, I'm just going to guess here and say, 45 million to 60 million per day. So that would be no new adds. And in general, I guess a safe number might be about a 50% production.", "Thomas Jorden", "Joe, this is Tom. We have 2 rigs running in the Gulf Coast. So it's very, very difficult to predict our exploration success. And obviously, we love what we're drilling or we wouldn't drill it. So I know it drives you crazy, but it's the nature of the beast. It's going to be hard to model, but as several people have said on this call, it's a real cash generator and helps us stay within that cash flow on funding these Permian and Mid-Continent programs. So we're going to continue to do it.", "Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "It's helpful. Is it reasonable to assume no new production adds?", "Thomas Jorden", "If that were reasonable [indiscernible] run it. No, it's not unreasonable, but I can't help your model.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Gil Yang.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Yes, this is a follow-on to that question. Can you -- I think you baked in sort of like a 65% success rate in your drilling program. Could you sort of update us on -- are you still using that success rate for the Gulf Coast?", "Thomas Jorden", "Well, Gil, this is Tom.  There were 2 rigs that are currently running. I can say one probably is drilling a prospect that's very oily has a little higher success in that because it's offsetting a look alike. And then another prospect we're drilling currently has fair amount of risk here. So our actual historical success is 66% is the number we quote. I would say our go-forward program is probably going to be a little less than that if I had to just put a geologic chance success on it, probably 60%. And that's going to be a mix of projects that are a little higher and a little lower. But I think 60% is probably a reasonable go-forward number.", "Joseph Albi", "And the targets aren't as big.", "Thomas Jorden", "The targets aren't as big.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. You mean as the last couple of years?", "Thomas Jorden", "As the last couple of years. We do have some nice targets, but they are riskier. But a lot of what we're drilling right now are smaller kind of base hits. And then as we said in the past, we're always working on additional shoots to beef up the inventory of the business.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "With a couple of wells that were dry holed recently, have you learned anything that makes you more concerned that the risk is higher for the these wells and it was not...", "Thomas Jorden", "No. Overall, no. We've been doing this for a long, long time, and sometimes you're going to cross an area and a program where your geophysical anomalies are well-calibrated. And sometimes you're in an area where they're not very well-calibrated, and other things can fool you. And we know the difference.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. In the Permian, you highlighted the Bone Spring wells and you got -- the one you highlighted, at least, got better from what you drilled in the first quarter. Can you maybe give us a broader perspective of what the quality of the wells were that you've been drilling in the second quarter versus first quarter? And what -- and I think you said there was 140 or so wells in inventory there.", "Thomas Jorden", "Well that's -- yes, the -- inventory is a funny thing in this play because we're -- we picked up, as I said, we've committed or picked up 16,000 net acres here. So far this year, and we're still actively acquiring land. So we quote -- I think recorded 140 wells. That's not a static inventory. It's one of the most dynamic inventories we have in the company. And that every week, we wake up and it's being added to not only by additional acres, but by additional zones that we didn't fully model. We've drilled some very good wells. I think what I could say in terms of the quality of wells is that we would strongly reaffirm our type curve. And our type curve is 570,000 barrels of oil equivalent and 600 barrels of oil per day for our first 30-day average.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. But the wells you've been drilling are the wells you were talking this quarter, for example, the 3 that you pulled out. Are those sort of above type curve wells or are they sort of -- are they type curve wells?", "Thomas Jorden", "Those are -- the wells I quoted, all 3 were above type curve wells that we brought on in the second quarter. But that -- it's a program, Gil, and we're not revising our type curve upward.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Well, so I guess the question I was getting to, if you're drilling, at least you're just certainly calling out the ones that are above type curve, as you get to those, say, 40 wells left in that inventory at some point of these 140, will those be necessarily below type curve?", "Thomas Jorden", "No, I think our inventory is in very nice perspective areas. In fact, a lot of the land we picked up -- I think a lot of the land we picked up has a fair prospect collection that may be above type curve. But we're not sandbagging. I mean, the type curve is the type curve, and we make it a capital decision. That is the economic parameters that we model. And we think that's what we're going to deliver, and the proof's in the pudding. I'd say that is our historical average. I would not take that 140 and downgrade it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Eric Hagen.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Just a quick question on Cana. What are the prospects for possibly accelerating Cana in 2012 as you finish HBP your acreage and delineate it better? So more specifically, maybe to accelerate infill drilling in the core as you feel more confident that you can develop it on the 80s. And if there is an opportunity, what do you think is the potential for adding rigs there? I think you're drilling with 8 now. Could that increase by 4? Could it double? Just kind of realistically, what's a possible range?", "Thomas Jorden", "Well, Eric, this is Tom. We are looking at that now; just what the potential is for infill drilling. In the core, that's a complex problem, because there are a lot of different operators that are at work in there and one -- no operator can operate in a vacuum. So what's going to happen in that core is when it does go to down spacing, you'll see a lot of companies go to down spacing. We don't have particular calendar plans for that. I don't know if it will be within 2012 in the core. But -- in direct answer to your question, we're currently modeling that and doing some what ifs, and we don't really have anything to say other than we're looking at it.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "How many years of drilling do you have left, Tom?", "Thomas Jorden", "Excuse me?", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "If you don't accelerate, how many years of drilling do you have left at the current pace?", "Thomas Jorden", "Oh we could -- I don't have that in front of me, Eric. I know if we just continue to drill one well per section at our current pace, that will carry us through well into the latter half of 2012. So we have the optionality to accelerate drilling. But I want to be clear to you, Eric, and to our listening audience, we watch those returns carefully. There are a lot of things that are -- it's not about production. I mean, production is important, but return on capital is ultimately more important to us. So it's a combination of optimum spacing. It's a combination of service costs. It's a combination of what we think are reasonable returns are, and all of those are in play. We're trying to optimize that program. We just, as I said, are in the process of getting data off the field of pilot project that will tell us a whole lot about downhole fracture geometry and what the ultimate spacing will be. I mean, we say that it's most likely 80 acres. There are some credible companies who are talking about spacing tighter than 80 acres. So we're trying to really dial that in before we get swept away with a big capital program that would be wasteful. We don't want that to happen.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And my follow-up was on the Gulf Coast. How many more wells do you plan to drill this year in the Gulf Coast? And based on -- and excluding Jefferson Airplane, which I think is really sort of an outlier, what do you think a typical successful well would add in terms of production volumes?", "Thomas Jorden", "There are a couple of questions there, and I'll let Joe chime in and help me here. But to answer your question of number of wells with 2 ridge running, we have 4 additional wells that we would expect to have completed and logged by the end of the year. And depending on our drilling time, that could be 3 or it might be 5. But right now, no drilling schedule. We're scheduled to have 4 additional opportunities tested by the end of the year. And these prospects are kind of all over the map. Some of them are higher potential, some of them are smaller. But the garden variety of Gulf Coast well, it's going to come on between 5 million and 10 million cubic feet a day and probably will be a 5 Bcf target ultimately. But it's very difficult in our program to talk about averages. Averages mean something in the Permian and Cana. They don\u2019t mean a whole lot in the Gulf Coast.", "Eric Hagen - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "No, I can understand that, Tom. And then heading into 2012, historically, have you always run a 1- to 2-rig program? I mean, do you think that -- is this rig more of a makeup rig? Or do you think you have enough targets to continue to drill with 2 rigs? Just kind of a -- maybe some insight into that.", "Thomas Jorden", "We haven't formed our 2012 plans yet. We're going to come together here starting in a couple of weeks and kick that off. I would say, right now, if we didn't have another 3D project to exploit, we would probably be looking at 1 rig in 2012 in our current inventory. But we're working on several additional 3D projects. Some of them are being acquired. Some of them are being reprocessed, and some of them are still being discussed. And this is our business. We do this all the time and if we can get additional 3D data in that had prospects and then we intend to do that, I think we'd look at recharging that inventory. But right now, I can't speak to that in any definitive term because we're still working on that.", "Operator", "There are no more questions from the phone line.", "Mark Burford", "Well, thank you, all, for joining us today on the call in this tough market.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to our host for today, Mr. Mark Burford. Thank you, sir. You may begin your call.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much, Lakishia, and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. On today's call here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, Vice President, Controller. ", "We did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. We will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call. Please refer to the end of our press release for our disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. ", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'll recap a couple of our financial items. Our statement earnings release reported a net income of $128.2 million or $1.49 per share for the quarter, and which is current -- which matches last year's third quarter, and current year earnings include the $0.04 per share noncash mark-to-market gain on our hedges. ", "Third quarter oil and gas sales revenues were $420 million, 15% greater than last year's third quarter, and cash flow from operations totaled $357 million, which is 20% greater than last year's third quarter. For the first 9 months of 2011, we had cash -- cash flowed $1 billion. Higher earnings, revenues and cash are a large result of our liquids production. Liquid this quarter made up about 45% of our quote on production on a 6 on an equivalent -- 6:1 equivalent basis and 67% of our revenues. ", "Realized oil prices this quarter are about 20% higher and NGL price were 36% higher over third quarter of last year. So with those couple of items, I'll now go ahead and pass this call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thanks, Mark. I'll hit on several operating results and give an update in this year's joint program. But before I go into region-by-region detail, I want to address a consistent theme we're seeing in all of our areas. As we track our rates of return from our drilling or reinvestment program, there's no other way to put it other than plainly. We're not very pleased with the trends in some of our results today. Our costs have continued to escalate, and I know that something you're hearing from a lot of our peers. But in addition to our costs being too high, one of the things we do as a company, we don't buy our drilling inventory. We invent it. I mean, we are first and foremost a team of -- teams of geoscientists that generate our drilling opportunity. And so it's very important that we track our progress, that we measure our results and that we make sure that our actual results are in line with our expectations as we make our investments. And we do that to calibrate our investments and to tune our program when it occasionally steers off-center. And we're seeing that in a number of our areas. Not only are costs too high, but we're in the process of reexamining and going back to the drawing board in a number of our areas because our results are not consistent with our pre-drill predictions. And we'll get into that in a little more detail and I would just think we'll have some questions on that. ", "So as we work on our 2012 and the remaining 2011 plans, we're challenging ourselves throughout the organization on how to innovate and improve on all aspects of our business. Our operating group is working very, very hard to study our drilling completion techniques and see how we can lower our cost structure. Our exploration teams are working very, very hard to throw some science at our problems to come up with unlocking the reservoir and just flat out improve our results. ", "We're now in the middle of our planning process for 2012, and we'll provide some 2012 capital and production guidance as we typically do with our fourth quarter release in early February. And the reason we're going to doing that in February is that we're still working through it. We're having a lot of debates internally on what place we want to emphasize next year and how we can improve our results. ", "We have a lot of really great projects, that said, and we'll continue to work to improve our returns. But we are getting fairly good returns in a number of our projects. We've had an active first 9 months of the year. We drilled and completed 242 gross or 138 net wells year-to-date. We've invested $1.2 billion on exploration development. Of our total expenditures, 47% were invested in projects located in the Mid-Continent area, and that's by and large our Cana play and Anadarko Basin. 46% of our capital has been in the Permian Basin and 7% in the Gulf Coast and others. ", "Starting with the Permian Basin. In the Permian Basin, year-to-date, we've drilled and completed 106 gross or 79 net Permian Basin wells during the first 9 months of 2011, and we completed 95% of those as producers. At the end of the quarter, 13 gross and 7 net wells were still waiting on completion. Our Permian Basin exploration development capital year-to-date through the third quarter totaled $543 million, or about 46% of our total capital. So as you see, we've ramped up our Permian program this year. It's a higher percentage of our capital. And that's where we're seeing some of the best returns in the company are in the Permian basin. ", "Starting with our New Mexico horizontal Second and Third Bone Spring play, where year-to-date we've drilled and completed 42 gross, 27 net wells. This year, we stepped into some new areas. We mapped some very thick Second and Third Bone Spring sands and our results, although still good, have not been to our expectations. ", "As we moved into new areas, we're starting to see our water cuts increase, and that's a bit of a challenge. One of the things you'll hear me say here this morning, I'll probably be willing to discuss a lot of problems and few solutions because we are throwing a lot of technology at this problem right now. ", "But we're observing flow similar in total fluid to what we've seen historically, but we're seeing higher water cuts. For example, in this play in 2010, our average water cut across the play was 46% for the wells we've brought on, but it's increased to 56% on average this year. And so what we're seeing is as we drilled a little thicker reservoirs, we're seeing a little higher water cut. We're going back to the drawing board on that and saying what petrophysically could we and can we do to anticipate that and attempt to mitigate it. Those will still generate very nice returns, but again, as I said at the outset, we look very carefully at our actual results and compare it to our pre-drill expected results and that's the shortfall. ", "The 30-day gross production from Bone Spring wells we drilled this year, we've had an average first 30-day production rate of 510 barrels equivalent per day, of which 83% of that is oil. ", "The average 30-day rate has decreased this year with the higher water. We're working hard to better predict this water cut and incorporate this in our pre-drill analysis. Now we get a lot of questions about our type curve in the Second, Third Bone Spring play. One of the things I'll say that we've learned is it's a fairly broad area. Our Second, Third Bone Spring play covers multiple townships of varying thicknesses and varying depths. So a single type curve, as we've discussed in the past, has probably been a wrong way to characterize the play. I would say for a range of results, we hear others talk about a range of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil, and that's about what we're seeing as a range. But certainly, our actual average results have come down a little bit from what we've discussed in the past and we're looking to see how we may high grade that and get back on track. ", "We do continue to bring on some very strong wells, however, such as in the Quail Ridge area, the Lynch 23 Federal 2H was 100% working interest well. It came on for its first 30 days at a 959 barrel per oil equivalent per day. And in the Chigrid [ph] area, the West Chigrid [ph] 32 Federal 1, where we have 75% working interest, came on at 755 barrel of oil equivalent per day. So this is a play we still very, very much like. ", "Another question that we get frequently is at what oil price will we still go and continue to go aggressively. And one of the things I always answer there is it depends on the lease terms. If we have a 75% net revenue interest lease, we can still generate acceptable returns down to a mid- to low-60s oil price. And as our net revenue interest goes up, obviously, that price can go a little lower. But we are slowing down a little bit, we're going to probably drop a rig or 2 and attempt to high grade our inventory. We have lots to do here. We have many years of inventory and we need to understand the science a little better so that our actual results are more in line with our pre-drill prediction. That's not say that we're going to lower our pre-drill prediction. We're looking to high grade and understand. ", "As we move into the Texas Third Bone Spring area, we drilled 12 gross and 9.8 net wells. On average, we've realized a 30-day gross production rate of 660 barrels equivalent per day, of which 74% is oil. And this average includes some really good wells, although that's a really good average. ", "For example, this quarter, we brought on the Intimidation 33-63. So while we had 100% working interest up and it came on at 1,339 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30-day average. The Pits R8, another well we had 100% working interest. We average for 30 days 1,140 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And the Lazy M 1-30, a well we had 99% working interest, averaged its first 30 days 932 barrel of oil equivalent per day. So very good results in that play and that will continue to be a major part of our program going forward. ", "We've talked in the past about some emerging plays, some emerging liquids-rich plays. We have a large acreage position of over 160,000 net acres perspective for some or all of the Wolfcamp, the Avalon and Cisco/Canyon Shale formations. This year, we've drilled and completed an additional 7 or 6.6 net horizontal Wolfcamp wells, bringing our total wells in the play to 14, or 13.4 net. So we have a nice high working interesting in that play. And our first 30-day production average from our horizontal Wolfcamp wells has been 6.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 46% is gas, 32% natural gas liquids and 22% oil. So that play continues to be very, very encouraging to us. That said, that's one that's challenged by drilling completion costs and we are working it hard to try to get our costs down. ", "We're also pursuing the Avalon and Cisco/Canyon in this area. And those are 2 additional objectives that stack for much of this area. We've brought on a very good Cisco/Canyon well this year called the Taos Federal 3H. It came on first 30-day average at 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day and that's in Southern Eddy County. The yield, however, that's oil that's produced and trucked off location, the yield was only 6 barrels of oil per million cubic feet, plus it was a wet gas stream that generated an additional 56 barrels of natural gas liquids per million cubic feet. So it's a very good well. In fact, it's an excellent well, but it's a gas well and it needs higher gas prices to make sense. ", "We're also testing the Avalon. We've talked about that and we'll continue to talk about that. We have a couple of Avalon wells in the oil window. We're currently drilling and evaluating. And we'll talk about that in subsequent calls. ", "I will say, one of the things we are observing that we're studying hard is we're seeing a little higher decline in some of these ultra-tight oil reservoirs than we had expected. I think that's probably true around the industry. And we have a lot of very, very dedicated bright people internally trying to figure out how to optimize that, how to tune up our stimulations and get a little more out of those reservoirs. As we work in our 2010 plans for the Permian, as I said, not to sound like a broken record, but we're challenging ourselves in how to innovate and improve. And we'll likely let a few rigs go. ", "You know our focus is on returns, not on top-tier growth, and we're trying to improve our performance. And as we've done in the past, sometimes we've made some of our best strides when we slow down a little bit and really focused on improving our results. So that's what we're focusing on today. ", "Moving on to the Mid-Continent. For the first 9 months of 2011, we drilled and completed 128 gross or 52 net wells, completing 99% as producers. At quarter end, 19 of those wells gross, or 9 net, were still waiting on completion. ", "Our Mid-Continent exploration development capital year-to-date through the third quarter totaled $557 million, or 47% of our total capital. So if you take that Permian and Mid-Continent, you'll see that's 93% of our total capital year-to-date. Majority of our Mid-Continent activity has been our Cana-Woodford play, where we've drilled and completed 108 gross or 40 net wells. ", "So as the Cana play began in late 2007, we've participated in 283 gross or 111 net wells, and of the total wells, 251 gross or 96 net were on production at quarter end and the remainder were either in the process of being drilled or awaiting completion. So we've got a lot of data on this play. That said, it's still one of our most challenging technical problems. ", "We focus most of this year's drilling on delineating and holding acreage outside of what we've discussed as our defined core. As we look to 2012, we're working on plans to shift back to the core and possibly begin an infill drilling program. That's where we find the best returns. We don't have an acreage exploration issue anywhere in the play that we can't manage. So next year, it's highly likely that a significant portion of our capital will be directed to a core infill drilling project. Again, we haven't finalized those plans. They're still actively being discussed, but it's fair to give you a little hint on what we're thinking. ", "Moving on to the Gulf Coast, our last area before I turn the call over to Joe Albi. This year in the Gulf coast, we drilled 8 gross or 6.7 net Yegua/Cook Mountain wells, of which 3 or 2.4 net were successful. So I'll just interject there, we're not having a particularly good year drilling in the Gulf Coast. It does tend to ebb and flow. We're still very dedicated to developing and high grading our prospect inventory and we have a lot of projects in the hopper. ", "Gulf Coast exploration development capital year-to-date to the third quarter total $69 million or about 6% of our total capital. So it's not a lot of our capital but it certainly is a program that has and we expect will generate tremendous returns for us. The Gulf Coast production drop has been masking our growth in the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent. We averaged 81.8 million cubic feet equivalent a day for the third quarter of 2011, a 51% decrease in the Gulf Coast as compared to third quarter 2010 average of 166.8 million cubic feet a day. So we're seeing the backside of the tremendous success we had bringing on some of these monster wells in 2009, 2010. But the drop really is a result of our lack of drilling success in this year's program and also a natural decline in these highly productive wells over the last 2 years. ", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Chief Operating Officer, to give you a little more color.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us on our call here today. I'll be summarizing our Q3 production. I'll touch on our Q4 and full year guidance, and then follow up with a few comments on service cost. ", "As we reported, our Q3 average net daily equivalent production came in at 592 million a day, that was about as expected. We're up 6.3 million a day from Q2 and just a bit below the midpoint of our guidance, which was 585 to 610. That said, our production was impacted by about 6 million a day from numerous pipeline maintenance and repair type shut-ins that occurred during the quarter, primarily in the Permian. Without the shut-ins, we would have come in at 598 million a day, which would have put us just above the midpoint of our guidance. ", "Once again, we also set a few new records in Q3. Our Mid-Continent net equivalent production of 303 million a day is a new record. And with it,  Mid-Continent now represents 51% of our total company production. Our Cana equivalent volume of 139 million a day is also a new high. Cana is up 66% from the 84 million a day we reported in Q3 of 2010 and now represents 23% of our total company production. ", "Our Permian oil production of 17,578 barrels a day is also a new record. As is our Permian net equivalent production of 206 million a day. The Permian now represents 35% of our total company production. ", "Our combined Mid-Continent and Permian oil and NGL volumes, or our liquid volumes, of 37,106 barrels a day is also a record. These 2 regions now make up 85% of our total liquids, which is also a new high for Cimarex.", "So I point out these new records primarily because they really emphasize and they focus our business strategy, and that's our long-term growth programs in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, as well as our recent, when I say recent, over the last 1.5 years emphasis on oil and liquids-rich gas-type plays. ", "As Tom pointed out, on an equivalent basis, Q3 was a repeat of what we've seen in recent quarters. Production increases from our Mid-Continent and our Permian programs offset by anticipated and expected declines in the Gulf Coast. As compared to Q2 '11, our total Gulf Coast equivalent production dropped 35 million a day from 117 million a day in Q2 to 82 million a day in Q3. That's a 30% drop. But offsetting this decline, our Mid-Continent production increased 18 million a day, from 285 million a day in Q2 to 303 million a day in Q3, a 6% increase. While our Permian production increased 24 million a day from 182 million a day in Q2 to 206 million a day in Q3, a double-digit 13% increase. Combined, the Mid-Continent and the Permian were up 42 million a day for the quarter, which more than offset 35 million-a-day drop that we saw in Gulf Coast. ", "In comparison to Q3 '10, our Q3 '11 total company equivalent production of 592 million a day was down slightly 1% from the 600 million a day we reported in Q3 '10. But as we break down the numbers, we see the similar story, significant but anticipated drops in the Gulf Coast offset by attractive year-over-year production gains in the Mid-Continent and the Permian. ", "Over the last year, Gulf Coast volume dropped 85 million a day, from 167 million a day in Q3 '10 to 82 million a day in Q3 '11, that's a 51% drop. But offsetting this, our Mid-Continent-Permian programs increased to combine 77 million a day, with our Mid-Continent production up 40 million a day, from 263 million a day in Q3 '10 to the 303 million a day we just reported in Q3 '11, it's a 15% year-over-year increase. ", "And our Permian production was up 37 million a day, from 169 million a day in Q3 '10 to 206 million a day in Q3 '11. That's a 22% annualized increase. Combined, the Mid-Continent-Permian programs, which now make up 86% of our total company production, grew to a respectable 18%. ", "Mark mentioned the value that liquids play to our cash flow. And our third quarter liquid mix of 44% was virtually flat to that of Q2. But with our focus on oil and liquids-rich gas, we're up 3 points from the 41% that we reported in Q3 '10. ", "As we mentioned earlier, the Mid-Continent and the Permian are the catalyst, really, to our liquids growth. Our Q3 '11 Permian liquid volumes are now at 21,499 barrels a day, that's up 31% from where the Permian was in Q3 '10. And our Mid-Continent liquid volumes are at 15,607 barrels a day, that's up 42% from Q3 '10. ", "As we've mentioned already on the -- excuse me, as we've reported today, our Q4 reported guidance was 588 million to 613 million a day. And what's built into that is really projected, continued growth in the Mid-Continent and Permian, offsetting an anticipated and expected 7 million- to 12 million-a-day drop that we foresee in our Q4 Gulf Coast production, which we anticipate will average at a level of maybe 70 million to 75 million a day during the fourth quarter. ", "We've also built into our guidance the continuation of some Permian plant and pipeline shut-ins that we've seen during the month of October, which we believe will impact our October volumes to the tune of 6 million to 9 million a day. ", "As we have scheduled, our Q4 guidance midpoint puts us around 600 million a day, which will reflect yet another quarter of sequential growth for us. ", "Our Q4 projection, now with this last quarter projected out, that calculates into a full year guidance of 589 to 595. So we're, in essence, flat to 2010, where we reported 596 million a day. ", "On the surface we're flat, but underneath the hood, you'll see that our 2011 Gulf Coast production is forecasted to drop by about 70 million a day, with our Mid-Continent and Permian programs forecasted to make up the difference. As we've alluded to earlier in the call, as far as 2012 goes, we're currently in the midst of our planning cycle and we're certainly going to be in a better position to project guidance once our budgeting is over and we get a better feel for the market. ", "Shifting gears a little bit to cost. No big surprises with our Q3 lifting cost. We came in flat to Q2 at $1.14 per Mcfe. We see LOE cost somewhat stabilizing, and with them doing so, we've kept our full year guidance at $1.02 to $1.22. I say that and we've got a strong emphasis in our operations group to continue our focus on fighting the cost increases that we've seen, especially in the areas of salt water disposal, in particular the Permian. We're also focusing in on the basics: chemicals, lease maintenance, power and fuel. ", "On the drilling side, drilling and completion side, we've yet to see any real significant cost relief in our drilling and completion cost. And as Thomas mentioned earlier in the call, they're certainly playing a role in the economics of our program. Most of these cost increases, as we've talked about last call, are happening on the completion side. And as we've mentioned last call, frac cost as compared to the beginning of the year have gone up anywhere from 5% to greater than 100%, but the biggest increase is being seen in the Permian. Now that rate of increase has slowed down a bit in Q3, where we've seen anywhere from flat to 30% increases as compared to Q2. And this is due primarily to not only job design but we have seen some service cost increases, again, more associated with the Permian. ", "That said, equipment is available. The costs to get to significantly soften, although we're seeing some early signs that they may be and we hope that to play a critical role in our cost reductions that  we hope to obtain here in the fourth quarter. ", "On the drilling side, the majority of our cost pressure once again seems to be in the Permian and I think that's indicative of the rapid rig count rate that we've all seen in the industry happen in the Permian. But in general, our drilling group has done a fairly good job of keeping our well cost increases in check. We just need to get the darn cost down. ", "Our Cana core wells are still running 7.5 million to 8.5 million a day. That's basically flat to where we were in January, and that's due to a lot of the efficiencies that we've derived or put together in that program. Due primarily to a change in our frac design, our third quarter, Second and Third New Mexico Bone Spring wells are running around $5.2 million to $5.5 million. That's up from the levels of $4.8 million to $5.2 million that we've quoted in previous calls. And as we move here into Q4, you'll see us look at different completion designs, which may mean more cost, and/or lateral length, which may mean more cost, but in doing so, we would be anticipating that we'd get obviously some offsetting production and economic value in doing so. So we'll continue to look at that as well. ", "Our Permian Paddock-Blinebry wells are still coming in around $2 million to $2.2 million, that's up 5% to 10% from late Q1, early Q2. And as we continue to develop and really try to refine our Wolfcamp shale play in more ways than one, just not only geologically but from a drilling standpoint and completion standpoint, our current AFEs are now running $7.5 million to $8 million, and that's up from $6.5 million to $7.5 million that we quoted at the end of the first quarter. ", "As we move forward, as Tom alluded to, our operation teams and exploration teams are joined at the hip, focusing on means to improve efficiencies and design where we can to offset these cost pressures that we've seen and get our rates of return up to where we need them. ", "We're going to work hard on not only cutting down drilling time through efficiencies but the completion costs make up a valuable portion of these wells, how we design those completions, getting those cost down are going to be key to us really enhancing our rate of returns. ", "So in summary, Q3 was another good quarter for us. We had continued production growth in the Mid-Continent and the Permian. Our guidance midpoint projects likely continued total sequential quarter-to-quarter company production growth in Q4. Our lifting cost, that remained in check, and we are going to continue to find out the cost pressures we've seen on the drilling and completion side. At the same time, we believe we're starting to see early signs of the market possibly loosening up a bit, especially on the frac side. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.", "Paul Korus", "Thanks, Joe. Just a couple of things. We cash flowed about $1 billion through the first 9 months of the year, and includes $44 million that we won't collect until early next year, the tax refund that we intend to apply for in the very near future or early next year. We -- our capital investment was $1.2 billion. So that was call it $250 million in excess of cash flow that the GAAP was funded with $200 million of property sales and dipped into the cash balance that we carried into the year. ", "Borrowing have collapsed and oil prices here in the remaining part of the fourth quarter. And combined with our expectations for where December bid prices might come, we're poised to cash flow something between $250 million and $300 million in the fourth quarter as well. So by most expectations, we should be close to $1.3 billion of cash flow for the year and which we anticipate then combined with property sales and cash, we'll fully fund our $1.6 billion program this year. ", "With cash cost, pretty much having leveled off in reasonable expectations. Prices next year, I think, most would expect us to be cash flowing in the range of $1.2 billion next year. So very similar to where we're at this year. So more likely than not, I would say our capital will come down from the $1.6 billion that it was this year. We'll probably round cash flow. But as Tom and Joe have emphasized, those plans are still being pulled together. ", "With that, operator, we would be very happy to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor Pickering Holt.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Tom, first of all, just really appreciate all the open dialogue this morning. I'm sure other companies face similar cost pressures as you guys but do appreciate the open thoughts there. My question is on the Permian. If you look at the amount of completions you guys had in Q2 and then you look at Q3, I guess we would've expected a bigger build sequentially, given you had a full quarter of production. I'm just wondering if there were some other infrastructure or other delays in your Permian over this third quarter that would have kept some of the production down?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Brian, this is Joe Albi. As I've mentioned earlier in the call, we saw about a 6, its a little bit high -- more than 6, but call it 6-plus million a day impact in our Q3 volumes with really through the most part I've anticipated from our forecasting standpoint, pipeline and plant-related type of shut-ins. And it was fairly consistent during the quarter. And those have continued into October. And in October, it even jumped up to about 9 million a day. Now most of those are behind us and we've tried to build that into our Q4. So you probably see our Q4 number a little bit impacted there. At the same time, it did have an impact in Q3. Tom has mentioned to some of the steeper declines. I think that's probably playing a role in the whole thing from the forecasting of the base standpoint. But overall, our programs are still generating some very healthy year-over-year type analyzed growth and it's something that we hope to continue, obviously.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then the -- on the plant downtimes, I'm sorry, I just -- I must have missed. That's in the Permian as well as in the Cana?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, most of that 6 million a day that I mentioned in Q3 came out of Permian. And the 9 million a day I referenced in October, specifically the Permian, and we had, I think, another 0.5 million a day in the Mid-Continent in October.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then I know you guys aren't there on 2012 guidance yet, especially on the CapEx side, but given the cost pressures that you guys have seen across the portfolio, is your -- are you aiming to be more CapEx flat year-over-year, down or up? Could you just kind of bread basket it for us?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Brian. This is Tom. I would say CapEx flat is probably going to be higher end of what we're looking at. And again, I reserve the right to later contradict myself. But the way we're currently looking at it, I think, that flat would be probably as aggressive as we'll be. And we're looking at our cost. I think we've said everything I would repeat, but I just want to say again, it's about returns. We're really looking at return on invested capital, and accelerating in a historical high-cost environment just doesn't seem to be very prudent to us right now.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I understand. But at the same time, is there internally or are you going to necessarily stay within cash flow?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, that's -- yes, something we're also debating. There's no -- I'll say this, we don't have any rule about staying within cash flow. If we think the returns are there and we have to tap our borrowing base and fund it, we would do that gladly. But it's really about where do we think we have returns and what level of activity do we think we can sustain with those kind of returns.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Amir Arif.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just had a first few questions for you. First of all, on the water cuts. Can you just give us a little more color in terms of this, is this something -- is it a trend you're seeing from like north to south or east to west or is this something that almost varies well-by-well?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we're -- I don't want to be coy because that's not my intent. We're just -- we're really kind of figuring this out right now. We did step out and drill some thicker reservoirs and we do see a little higher water cut in some of these zones that were thicker. Now is that on average and trend? Right now, I have just to tell you honestly, I don't know. We're having a serious roll up our sleeves session next week. We've had a lot of science being directed to this problem and we're in the throes of attempting to understand it. I'm fairly confident that we can high grade around it. Now that may mean that we drop a rig or a couple of rigs in order to get back to what we would consider to be our historical average. But whether it's a function of depth, thickness or core, other parameters, right now, we're just studying that and we don't have any answers for you.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so again, it is early days but is there a way for you to -- or do you think you can overcome it with your completion approach or is it simply -- certain areas will simply be that way and you just have to figure out which areas those are?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, I suspect we're going to overcome it by what we target.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you talked about potentially dropping a rig or 2 just because of the returns. Can you just give us a sense of what you think the returns are when you talk about the 46% water cut versus the 56%?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, what happens is returns on this play, as I said at the outset, there really is no average. And if we've erred in doing anything, we've probably talked about an average for a play that has no average. Now one of the things that isn't a good average is the particular lease that you're drilling on. We have a whole host of opportunities out here, very deep drilling inventory. Some of those are on new federal leases where the net revenue interest is 87.5%, and others of them are on leases where we had to take term assignments, or farm-ins, and we may have a low net revenue interest of 75% or less and may have other burdens like carries or back-ends. So the returns are really a function of the core lease. I can tell you that even with our results, we're still getting for a 75% net revenue interest lease, which is we would consider to be a stinky lease, we're still well in excess of better than 30% in our drilling dollar. If we go to a federal lease that's 87.5%, we are well beyond that. So what we're going to do, though, if we look at the lease that we think has steeper decline, high water cut and it's burdened to the extent that the returns fall below what we would consider to be acceptable levels, we're not going to drill it. Even though it will add to production and even though it can keep activity going, we're not going to be activity-driven.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. And just switching over to the Gulf Coast. Can you tell us what the exit rate was this quarter if the average was 82?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Joe is looking for that. I don't have that committed to memory.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "If I'm right, I think you guys were talking about 70 to 75 in Q4 was the average.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes. I'm going on a limb here because I don't have that monthly data in front of me. But wait a minute [indiscernible] I'm going to guess it's pretty darn close to that 80.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so it's not down to the 60 or 70s -- or below 70s level.", "Joseph R. Albi", "No, no, no.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then that's in same level. Then just on the Gulf Coast, I mean, when you factor in the pre-drill returns, where do you think you come out relative to the Permian? I'm just curious, like would you rather not be dropping a rig or 2 in the Gulf Coast instead of some of the other areas?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, our -- as we discussed before, our returns in the Gulf Coast pre-drill eclipse anything else we have. I mean, the Gulf Coast is an area of great geologic risk and there is still a relationship between risk and return. Our challenge in the Gulf Coast isn't anything other than drilling dry holes. I mean, these are risky locations. They can be greater than 50% chance of drilling a dry hole. They're not -- it's not pattern drilling, each one is unique. And there is a fair amount of dry hole risk. And although we have a couple of years of just drilling producer after producer, as we've said, we haven't forgotten how to drill dry holes. And we certainly confirmed that this year. We love the returns that this program generates. We're actively rebuilding our inventory and it will be a part of our program on an ongoing basis.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you like the returns even with, for example, like this year's 40% success rate so you think on the project economics...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, I mean, in this year we're not getting good returns in that program. I mean, this year our returns are not good. But I think if you look at any reasonable timeline average, you'll find it's one of our highest return areas.", "Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I missed your comment on the Mid-Continent site and the Cana. Were -- you mentioned you were going to be focusing more on the core. So are you thinking of potentially dropping a rig or 2 there too or...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "No, no. We're -- we currently have 12 rigs running in Cana. We lent a rig to the Mid-Continent so if you -- when that comes back, we have 13. If anything, I can tell you that our Cana team is lobbying for a continuation of that level of activity. So I would guess rolling into next year, we'll have somewhere between 8 and 13 rigs running in Cana. Initially, we had talked about maybe throttling back to 8, but they are lobbying pretty strongly that think they can keep 13 running with excellent returns and we're going to look at that.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Amir, this is Joe Albi. I pulled some data out here. It looks like we entered October somewhere around that 75-ish range. So that gives you a feel for how that compares to the 70 to 75 that I forecasted for Q4. So it's, in essence, saying a slight drop.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ryan Todd.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions for you. In the Permian, your net well completions went from 36 in 2Q down at 23 in 3Q and seems to be below the pace you need to kind of hit that full-year target that you guided to earlier. Was there anything in the quarter that happened from a completion point of view that -- and how should we think about Q4?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We're kind of looking closer, that's got to just be a timing issue.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, primarily completions.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. We did have our Wolfcamp program kind of on pause, but that would have -- I don't think that would be a Q2 to Q3 difference. Why don't you let us look into that, and if you want to give Mark a call, we can give you a little more color to that.", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Ryan. I don't know any trend that cause it to be off here in much quarter to quarter. Only -- what do we do is always capture the wells that we've drilled and completed in the quarter, and there's sometime bulges towards the end of periods that we catch up some completions or not.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It always does surprise me how that can ebb and flow just with the timing of where they fall. But I don't know if that's the answer to your question.", "Joseph R. Albi", "And we did pick up our Permian service unit activity late May, early June so that could have had an end-of-quarter impact.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. Is that sufficiently vague on our answer?", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's great. But realistically, you probably expect some amount of bounce back in Q4, is that probably right?", "Joseph R. Albi", "We're getting pretty caught up on our completions, particularly in the Permian where when we get a well down, we should be able to turn right around and get it completed. And at the same time, I'm telling you that the rig schedule's from our wells out there for us to complete. So it's never -- you'll never get to a point where it's 0 because the well gets down and you need to complete it. Then you throw on top of that some of the areas where we're drilling the infrastructure needs to be developed, and that may come into play too. So It's a little bit wild card there but we've made great strides from where we were at the end of Q1 with regard to our backlog.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. In the Cana, I know you've had a couple of operators this week say they were dropping rigs. So from -- I know you just talked about general rig count going forward next year. I mean, would you expect your non-op well cost to be down year-on-year in the next year? And would that free up some extra money for you were to run extra operated or...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's a great question. And I'll -- again, I'm going to say, there are a lot of operators in Cana and we're not omnipotent on what everybody's thinking, but I'll tell you from what it looks like from our standpoint. Cana has expanded to a much larger area than we first had described. Certainly both to the northwest and the southeast, that play has expanded multiple fold. And what looks like it's going to happen next year is a lot of that activity in the extended Cana is contracting. And we see activity actually increasing in the core. We've talked about infill drilling. I can tell you that we're aware of at least a couple other companies that are talking about doing a little infill drilling in the Cana core. And so the direct answer to your question is we're anticipating our non-operating capital to actually increase in 2012 as we participate with significant working interest in other companies' infill programs.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then one final question, I guess, is you talked a little bit about the Gulf Coast. Any -- how should we think about expectations for next year on how many rigs that we're on? How much capital you'll spend?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we haven't given it, obviously, any capital numbers yet, but I can tell you what we're doing in the Gulf Coast. We currently have 2 rigs running and at least one of those 2 rigs, once drilling the well it's currently on, we'll release it. So we'll have, as we get into the fourth quarter, we'll have somewhere between 0 and 1 rigs running when we finish our current inventory. We have acquired a significant amount of new 3D data through purchase and trade, and we'll get that out of processing. Our model is we get 3D data. We either purchase it, trade for it or we shoot it new. And we process it with the latest geophysical techniques, which are always evolving, and we generate prospects based on that newly processed data. We acquired a considerable amount of data over the last few months through trade and that will be coming out of the processing shop here in the fourth quarter. And we have 2 proprietary 3D programs currently underway. So what's going to happen in 2012 is we'll enter the year with a low level of activity. And then based on what we identify, we'll ramp up. Given the area we're working, our history, I will be extremely surprised if we don't ramp up fairly significantly. So our wild-guess number for 2012 is somewhere around the level we've been this year and that will be probably $75 million to $100 million in drilling capital in 2012. But not having the prospects yet identified, that is a guess based completely on our historical experience in the area. But that's what it looks like.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gil Yang.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the performance issues again? Sorry to talk about this more. But is it -- you said it's -- the results aren't matching your type -- your pre-drill expectations. Have your pre-drill expectations also, for those particular wells, are they also sort of -- have they deteriorated as well or your pre-drill expectations are the same as it's been for the last 2 years? Is that just the way...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "No, no, no. We're in the process of revising that now. What's happened, Gil, is our first 30 days, what we -- there's really a number of parameters that control our viewpoint of the program. As Joe said, our first one, what is the cost to drill and complete the well. And then the initial production rate, or our first 30-day average, is the number we dial in carefully and focus on, and then the decline of the well overtime. Our costs have gone up. Our first 30-day average really hasn't changed much. Our type curve trend has been somewhere between 550 and 600 barrel per day for first 30-day average. And year-to-date, we're north of 500 on that. So we're a little below average but really, when we say, \"Okay, what's gone a little haywire here,\"  our initial production is not it. Which is why it took us a little time to catch this because you had to watch these wells and see how they performed over time. If you only watched the initial production of the first 30 days, you'd high-five one another and go on. But we watched these wells carefully and we calibrate our actual results against our pre-drill estimates. And what we've observed is these ultra-tight reservoirs are declining faster than we modeled. And that's -- so if you ask, what's the disconnect from your type curve, I would say our cost are disconnect and our decline is a disconnect. We still argue about what the tail reserves are. But on a rate-of-return basis that first year decline is really going to control it. And our returns are still very good here. I mean, this is not -- we're probably being a little too dour in representing the play. It still is generating very, very good returns when the lease terms are acceptable. But on several or our marginal leases, because of this phenomenon, we're seeing our returns erode and we're adjusting.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Talking about the water cut issue, is the water cut problem a rate issue, is it an LOIP issue or is it a EUR issue or some of everything?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It's not a rate issue. Total fluid is about what you'd find, if you looked at 2 wells, the total fluid is equivalent. So it is a oil-in-place issue, I believe. And this is a very nuanced petrophysical problem. It's not something you can just lay a log down and say, \"Oh yes, look at that versus that.\" We have a fairly sophisticated petrophysical group that's dug into this and they think it's a predictable -- it would be unfair for me to say solvable because it's an oil-in-place issue. But I think we can predict it and target areas where we can get higher water cuts.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So being an LOIP issue, it's also an EUR issue?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. No, that's right, that's right. But, EUR, Gil, it's tough -- EUR is funny number on a reservoir like this with 6 months production. So there's a lot of argument.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And you guys have a strong balance sheet and you've been very disciplined about trying to spend more or less within cash flow. As you think about sort of pulling back, have you given -- or what kind of thought have you given towards using a strong balance sheet at sort of the bottom of the cycle, so to speak, to maybe high grade the inventory in a offensive way rather than defensive way?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we think about that everyday. And if you know people that are selling assets at reasonable prices, give us a call. I mean, it still feels like a seller's market out there, Gil. I don't know what you're seeing but we see these assets transact at fair premiums.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So it's still not -- it hasn't reached the point that you think it's really completely attractive?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, I -- let me just say, we haven't found anything we would want to stretch for. We look all the time, balance sheet is ready. And as we've discussed, an asset we would stretch for is one that we think has significant drilling upside that we can capture. But for the time being, we're still creating our own inventory.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Joe Allman.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So in terms of the Wolfcamp play, Tom, I think you mentioned there are cost issues there. But have you seen any performance issues with that play?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It's -- the play spans, I don't know how many miles it spans, but it's a big, big area. And yes, we do see differences in our results based on where we are in the area. There are some portion of the area that we're kind of struggling, making an economic well, and there's some portions of our area where we're making great wells. That average we quote of our 14 wells is an average that includes a high and low, that's a true average. But yes, we're seeing performance differences. And Joe, we're, again, I told you we'd discussed some of our thinkings on problems more than solutions. We are really, really digging into this. We just took a core in the Wolfcamp that our chief petrophysicist is here today analyzing. We just recorded our first microseismic job, finished last night in the Wolfcamp, so we can understand our fracture geometry. I mean, we are just very early time. And we're encouraged our results are good thus far. But I have to say, if we had to call Cana after just 14 wells, we'd have gotten it way wrong. So we're trying to build this thing as we fly it. We have 2 rigs drilling Wolfcamp wells right now. And I'm encouraged by the returns, but we're trying to really improve them.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And Tom, I think in that play you defined a core, so are you seeing a lot of variability within that core or is the variability -- is the core consistent and you are seeing differences outside the core?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, I don't know if we -- it's fair to say we've defined a core yet, Joe. I mean, we -- there are areas where we're getting better wells than others. And I'll say this, it's not a laydown to explain that difference. A lot of rocks look the same, a lot of the structure looks the same. It's not a depth difference. So we're kind of focusing on the next order. What's the stretch we're seeing? What is the fracture geometry? But I don't think I can honestly represent to you that we understand an area we can draw a circle around and say, \"That's the core.\"", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the rig count, I think, you talked about, for 2012, 8 to 13 rigs in the Cana-Woodford. And then I think you're running about 14 rigs right now in the Permian and where did you get...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We currently -- yes, we currently have 14. And we'll -- we're going to decrease that. I would say going forward, we'll be somewhere probably 9 to 12. But again, that's not a forecast. We're still arguing about that.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you. And will the drop be primarily from the Second and Third Bone Spring or...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We're -- there will be some drop there. We also will probably throttle back a little bit in the Wolf Camp and that's -- we want to give our operations group with the exploration group some time to get our costs down. We're drilling some really, really nice wells and if we could shave our cost, the returns would be something we'd be a little more excited about.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And Tom, are you seeing -- in terms of cost, are you seeing -- you focused on cost in the Permian really being the issue primarily, are you still seeing cost increases as of the past 30 days or 2 months, or I guess you're seeing it plateau for the...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Joe Albi said they slowed a little. But I want to be fair to our listeners and our operations group. Our problem in the Permian is a combination of costs and our performance. And I think we can make significant strides on both areas.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Joe, a little bit more flavor to there. I mean, as far as day rate increases, mboe increases, cement increases, rental increases, we feel a little bit more cost-pressured down in the Permian than we do, let's say, in the Mid-Continent. In discussions, I had yesterday with the gentleman heading up our fracs. He's starting to feel a little bit a lightening or loosening in some of the majors in particular, their willingness to kind of move a little bit on these fracs. To me, it's just a matter of time and it's when it happens. Completion costs make up such a big percent of wells we drill today as compared to years past. That's where the focus has got to be. And that comes down to the design. Are you overdesigning these things, under designing them, number of stages, prop type, gel or fluid type? How many pounds? How many barrels? And then of course on, obviously, the cost to get it off. And some of these companies perform better than others. Some of the majors, they give us a job down in 4, 5 days versus 7 on some of these longer days. So in my mind, we're not only on the completion side. That's where we got to focus, but also on that drilling side, we got to get those day time curves shifted to the left and improve our efficiencies there. We're also talking to our competition, trying to understand what they're doing, what we're not, what's working for them and what's working for us and trying to put it all together to better improve our overall program.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful, Joe. And then I know -- my question is what kind of spending do you think you need to keep production flat? And I know it depends on what you are going to spend your money on and service costs and everything, but what's your best guess at how much you need to spend to keep production flat?", "Paul Korus", "Well, that's a hard question to answer since we haven't completed, really, a lot of our 2012 forecast. What I will say there, Joe, is just based on some of the wedge volumes that we've put together for 2011, where we would anticipate our 2012 production to start at and end at, without any new wedge, is no different than what we've thought in years past, where an exit rate might drop around 30%. So 25%- to 30%-type drop, I'll let you guys do the numbers there as to how you'd put capital towards that. But that's about as far as I can go with that.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We'll do some work on that. We get asked that question a fair amount, and maybe on our next call, we'll talk about our plans, we'll discuss that.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then lastly, a question for Paul. Paul, any thoughts on hedging for 2012?", "Paul Korus", "We have no hedges in place for 2012, and have not had any active discussions about doing it either.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Robertson.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In terms of activity levels in the Permian, is -- do you think by running as many rigs as you have, you all got a little bit out ahead of your ability to maintain the kind of quality control from the technical teams that you generally like?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Boy, I'd love to be -- I'd love to say yes to that but that's not the case. I think that what happens, and it's just part of the business, this is not an excuse, I'm going to give you my clear, straight answer, Jeff. When your returns are great, you get a little -- you don't look as carefully at the numbers. I mean, about mid-summer, we took a close, honest look at our actual to expected numbers. We have a lot of machinery internally that calibrates our decisions. Our -- we run this company by doing good science, generating opportunity but also making sure that our decisions are well calibrated. When your returns, $100 in oil and a low-cost structure, our returns were so phenomenal that a lot of our operating groups weren't paying very careful attention to the calibration of our decisions. When the rate of return is north of 50% all in, it's easy to forget that, that's an important part of your business. As our cost increased and our results decreased a little, we had to kind of remind ourselves of first principles: understand your results, recalibrate them to your drilling decision and make sure you're making good decisions. I can't really chalk that up to activity and blame activity as much as I can blame the aura of success and what that does to our core discipline.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If you all reduce your rigs, do you think -- and then decide at some point, a quarter, 2 quarters or 6 months from now, that you want to increase, do you think there'll be -- given the Permian today, do you think you'd have any issues trying to get back some of those rigs if you let them go and let to other operators?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I think we can get them back. And -- but you know what, Jeff, even if I told you I didn't think so, we wouldn't do anything different. And one of the things that we're reminding ourselves is don't driven by that rig -- by that rig count. Be driven by the quality of the investment and the confidence you have that you're going to achieve the result that you predict. So I -- yes, I think we can get them back. I think that they'll be there and we've given our teams the mandate to figure this out and get back to full throttle.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Tom, I'll chime -- this is Joe, I'll chime in a little bit there too. We have -- the rig situation is tight. And, I guess, the way I'd explain it overall is, day rates haven't come down but there's no huge waiting lists like there used to be. We've actually moved some rigs from the Mid-Continent down to the Permian. I don't think it'd be an issue with the Permian to get a rig. But what I do want to emphasize is I see our regrouping there in the Permian, it's all about rate of return. We've said that over and over again and that's what it is for us. We still have a large inventory of opportunity in the Second and Third Bone Spring New Mexico program. All we're doing is recalibrating, taking a look at our current results. We're reevaluating, reshuffling and high grading. Now through that high grading process, all of a sudden more opportunity surfaced than we knew about. That could bring a rig back to work in a heartbeat. So I think it's after we go back and sift through our project inventory that we can better answer that. And that's really kind of underlying our fourth quarter budgeting process.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. We tend to be a dour group, but we have a couple of new opportunities in the Permian that we'll be testing here shortly. It has a tremendous running room. So we ought to end this one on the note that we love the Permian. It's generating some of our best returns. We have some of the best generating teams that I think work anywhere in the business. We have systems in place to give us the opportunity to have real returns based on real results, and we are -- we will come roaring back in the Permian with the existing opportunity set and new ones that we're working on.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Tom, you touched on my last question was going to be, if you all think about your 2012 Permian plans, can you give any color on, maybe in a percentage term, of what you might spend or what you might try to do on what you consider to be new ventures apart from some of the plays you all have discussed previously?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Jeff, at this point I really can't. I can tell you that there over the next quarter, we're going to test a couple of new ideas that have significant running room. But what that could mean in capital, it wouldn't have any meaning if I gave you a number because the concepts may not work.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I'll turn it back over to the presenters.", "Mark Burford", "Great. Thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate all the attention and appreciate your questions. I look forward to reporting back to you next quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings and Operations Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2011 results conference call. We have issued our financial and operating results news release, and it's been posted to our website this morning. We also posted in our website a presentation that we will refer to from time to time during today's call. And I will also point out that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, and I refer you to the end of our press release and our presentation regarding our statement regarding forward-looking statements.", "On today's call here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO. Paul will make some opening remarks around our financials, and then we'll turn the call over to Tom and Joe to go over the operations.", "Paul Korus", "Great stuff. Our earnings release detailed very positive results of operations for 2011 and a favorable outlook for 2012. Before turning the call over to Tom and Joe to describe these accomplishments and expectations, I'd like to briefly reiterate just a few financial highlights.", "First off, I need to mention ahead of our review of 2011 is challenged by the fact that it's often compared to our record results in 2010, a year in which we hit on all cylinders and set new highs for most measures. Not even Jeremy Lin scores more points each and every night. Still at 2011, we achieved even greater revenues in cash flow than we did in 2010. Our revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion versus $1.6 billion in 2010. Our cash flow from operating activities rose to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion a year earlier. ", "Our earnings were also strong. Once again, we exceeded the $500 million mark. In 2011, net income totaled $530 million or $6.15 per share. That compares to $575 million or $6.70 per share in 2010, a year in which we had substantially larger hedging gains and non-recurring income from the early extinguishment of some debt.", "As this usually indicates, the prices we received for our production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids had the greatest impact of anything on our financial results. In 2011, price realizations for oil and natural gas liquids increased by more than 20%. On the other hand, gas prices were 10% lower. During the year, our production and revenue mix changed as we came more tilted towards liquids output versus natural gas. In 2011, about 50% of our production was gas, with 44% being oil and natural gas liquids. Combining with the effect of prices, however, roughly 70% of our revenues were derived from oil and natural gas liquids, with less than 30% coming from gas. ", "The shift in our production mix is no accident. It reflects the choices we make for capital investment. So even though we may not always deliver as robust overall growth rates as some would like to see, we continue to make good profits and are able to do so without levering up our balance sheet or issuing equity.", "We had good growth in our proved reserves during 2011 and have an equally active capital program plan for 2012. With quality cash flow at a very strong balance sheet, we have a lot of flexibility for how we fund our 2012 program. ", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Paul. I'm going to be working off the presentation that's posted on our website. So if any of you have it up, I'll be starting with Slide 7. If you don't have it up, it's not really that important, but there are some figures in there that might help as I talk.", "In 2011, we invested a hair under $1.6 billion in exploration and development. We drilled 174 net wells, and as Paul said in this other release, we had extremely solid returns in our Permian and Cana programs. We grew our proved reserves to 2.05 Tcf equivalent, which is a record for us. Our Permian Mid-Continent reserves proved increased 26%, an all-time high of 2 Tcf equivalent. We added 587 Bcf equivalent from extensions and discoveries, and 45% of those adds were liquids, 55% gas. All in all, we replaced 272% of production. But the real story, and we'll get onto that as we give you a little detail, is our record 2011 Permian Basin and Mid-Continent production of 487 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Those 2 regions in aggregate showed a 16% production growth over 2010.  Those are our engines of growth. ", "On Slide 8, it shows our core operating areas, now many of you are familiar with this but just to recap, of that 2.05 Tcf equivalent, 98% are Mid-Continent and Permian reserves, and fully 89% of our production are Mid-Continent and Permian. So those are the engines. ", "On Slide 9, it shows us graphically. Slide 9 shows our proved reserves as they've increased the last few years. We have a very solid reserve base. As Paul said, our investments have pulled us towards liquids-rich areas. That's in part tactical, a little strategic, but it's mostly driven by the invisible hand of the disconnect between gas and oil prices, and we are just in a very nice position with one of the best Permian assets amongst our peers, and we can emphasize that oil production by simply shifting our weight. As you can see in 2011, we ended the year 41% liquids; 59% gas, that's a nice healthy growth; compound annual growth rate of 54% of liquids growth, and we ended the year with 82% proved developed reserves, 18% proved undeveloped.", "The next slide, Slide 10, shows our proved reserves by region, and this again shows the solid growth that we're seeing out of the Permian and Mid-Continent. We've been growing the last few years, a compound annual growth rate of 28%. In 2010, we did sell our Riley Ridge asset in Sublette County, Wyoming. That was 210 Bcf of proved undeveloped gas reserves. That's the gray bar there on your slide on 10. We replaced those reserves, and accounting for that still increased our proved reserves 9%. If net of that sale, if we get back that sale out, we increased our proved reserves 23%. So a very solid year on a reserve basis. ", "Moving on to Slide 11, and now, we'll talk about 2012, which is really the story for us today. 2012, we're going to -- we're giving you a capital range and that's because that we're in a rapidly changing environment. We have a lot of flexibility for 2012, we have a tremendous opportunity set, but we're going to say here this morning what we said for years. We are going to adapt and change to a very changing environment. So one of the things you'll hear us talk about are plans with Cana and plans with the Permian, and those are fungible. Right now, as everybody in the industry, we're watching gas prices carefully, we're watching liquids prices carefully. Depending on local conditions, we may switch some capital from Cana to the Permian or not. I mean, right now, we're seeing outstanding returns in the Permian, and our Permian group is hungry for more capital. ", "Our reserve and production adds from 2012 drilling are expected to be 40% to 50% liquids. In the Permian Basin in 2012, we're currently at 11 rigs and we're planning on averaging somewhere between 11, peaking out at 15 to 16 rigs. In the Bone Spring, we'll get over 60 wells drilled. And our unconventional plays of the Wolfcamp and the Avalon, we have plans for 30 wells. And on our Paddock play, vertical wells, we have plans for 50 wells. So very, very active Permian program, and I'll give you a little more detail that here in a minute. ", "Our Mid-Continent program is expected to average between 10 and 12 rigs for the year, and that would be split between our Cana-Woodford, where we're infilling the core, and we'll drill approximately 110 gross wells there. And outside Cana, we'll have about 20 wells in the Mid-Continent. So very, very active program. As we sit today looking at the landscape, our program is generating very nice returns. As we talked about in the past, we stress test our investments. We're still at a point where we think looking out at today's landscape, we'll be at that $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of 2012 investment.", "Moving on to Slide 12, this is just a little pie chart of that investment spectrum that compares 2011 with 2012. It shows that this year, we'll be approximately 94% of our total exploration development capital in the Mid-Continent and the Permian. And again, the Permian at 52% is showing $775 million of capital. I will say that our Permian region is, as I said a minute ago, is prepared to invest more if we choose to ask them to. Very nice returns.", "Moving on to Slide 13, and this is really the story for Cimarex here today and it's one I really want to bring attention to. Last couple of years, and I think a lot of people in the industry have looked at our Gulf Coast headwind and our production, and we're happy to say this morning that we feel that issue is fully behind us, that the underlying growth of the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent assets has stepped up the plate and are really showing themselves the engines of growth that we've all known they would be. Over the last couple of years, we've increased our Permian Basin and Mid-Continent production at a compound annual growth rate of 19%. Our guidance this year, and Joe will give you detail, is between 4% and 10%. We have fully overcome that Gulf Coast headwind and we really look for significant growth, or the opportunity for significant growth, for many years to come. I use the word opportunity deliberately because we haven't changed our DNA. We are still about returns, and we believe that production growth is a very nice consequence of making good investment returns. That underlying Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, Mid-Continent and Permian program is generating very nice returns, and it's just affably making this Gulf Coast issue not worth talking about. We still will have a Gulf Coast program this year, but none of that is built into our guidance. And it -- and we're at the point where we're growing this program where it's no longer the relevant issue it's been in the past couple of years.", "Slide 14 is really a nice evidence of the Permian oil production and what it's done in the last couple of years through our very active horizontal drilling. Compound annual growth rate last couple of years of 24%, and year-over-year 2011, 2012, we're expecting 26% to 32% growth in our Permian liquids.", "So moving on to Slide 15, I just want to give you a little bit of color in our Permian program. You can read that slide to yourself, but the -- really, summary is that we're expecting to invest, I would say $775 million to $800 million of capital in the Permian Basin. We will drill 150 gross wells and that's multiple projects. We're in the Delaware Basin with multiple projects, so just as we value diversity throughout our overall investment portfolio, we have a fair degree of diversity in our Permian. And I'd like to give you a little color on that.", "Moving on to Slide 16, I want to talk for a minute about our Bone Spring/Avalon play. Our second Bone Spring play of Eddy and Lea County, I just kind of want to brag on our team for a minute. In our third quarter call, we talked quite a bit about the wrestling match we had internally with some of our technical challenges. And I want to just compliment our exploration group, our operating group for getting after it, figuring that issue out, and they came back roaring with an absolutely outstanding fourth quarter. And that we are a geoscience-driven outfit that focuses on being good at the business. And we like to talk about results and not hype. And certainly, our third quarter call, we were in the middle of a wrestling match on our own results. And today, we're happy to tell you that it really does look very, very nice as a result of the great work our teams did.", "We have some highlighted wells in our second and third Bone Spring play. We're not talking about particular well results, but I will tell you that we brought on several wells on the equivalent basis that are well over 1,000 barrels a day, the first 30-day average. Our release has our absolute program, 30-day IPs of 597 barrels of oil per day. And as we said, there are some really nice wells in that mix. It's generating outstanding returns, and we have a very, very nice inventory of opportunities there. ", "We've also had some just absolutely lights-out returns in our third Bone Spring play in Texas. That's a play that, of course, a lot of our competitors are drilling, and that's gotten a lot of attention, and rightly so. We have drilled a number of wells that have averaged well over 1,000 barrels a day for their first 30-day average. I know that some of our competitors have released some results in that play, and we would just say to you that we see it as they do and that is an outstanding play.  We will have in that play, as we look at 2012, we'll have 3 rigs running and currently going to 4 rigs in that play, and that should be a very active investment for us for years to come.", "Moving on to Slide 17, just to kind of summarize that, if you look at our Bone Spring and Avalon play, we have significant future drilling. We're having very solid returns in that play, and the issues we discussed on our third quarter call, I will say, our actual to expected results are outstanding in the fourth quarter and moving into this year. That team has really dialed that in. We compete for our opportunity, that's why this issue is important to us. Although even at our -- the third quarter, our results were good, when we're going and competing for opportunity, good isn't good enough for us. We need to be able to predict our results and deliver what we predict. And they've really made some great, great strides in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that play, the second and third Bone Spring play in Eddy and Lea County between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. This year, we're currently at 5 rigs in the second Bone Spring play. We'll go to 7 rigs at the end of chicken season here by late spring. As I said in our third Bone Spring play in Texas, we're currently at 3 rigs, we'll go to 4 and then we'll have 1 or 2 rigs running in the Avalon.", "But let's move on. I'd like to talk about our Wolfcamp play. We've had some nice recent results in our Wolfcamp play. I am on Slide 18 for those of you that pulled our slide presentation down. We've had a really nice fourth quarter in the Wolfcamp play. We talked last year about some of our development being deferred because of the infrastructure. The slide there shows the trunk line, gathering line we had to build. We had to build roads, bridges, saltwater disposal. We had to put in a little processing facility. Our operations group did an outstanding job getting that online, it's just about complete now, and that allowed us to come in and complete some wells. As the results indicated on the slide there, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed 4 gross or 3.4 net wells. And of those wells, our first 30-day average, and this is an average, was 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And that's 38% gas, 31% natural gas liquids and 31% oil. So we're seeing that play, well over 50% liquids, just generating some outstanding results, our recent wells. As you can see from this map, we're still kind of sparsely sampling this area. So one of the things I would discourage anyone from doing is taking those fourth quarter results, dividing it by some acreage spacing and papering that area with it. But we're drilling our way to understand that. We are extremely encouraged with our recent results. I know there's been some press given to this Wolfcamp play in the Midland Basin. A lot of the people in the Midland Basin are really talking about the Wolfcamp being an outstanding play. I would just say we love this play based on our recent results. We see it as a significant part of our future going forward in 2012 and beyond, and we have an outstanding inventory. If you look at that 80,000-acre position, you have -- we don't know what the spacing is, but if it goes to 160-acre spacing, we've got 400 locations. If it goes to 80-acre spacing, we have over 800 locations. These wells are $8 million a copy. So this play alone is many, many years of drilling inventory at our current Permian Basin run rate. So again, it's a testament to our exploration operations group that built this play from scratch and we're very, very pleased with the results we have to report to you.", "I'd like to move on now -- before we go to the Mid-Continent region, I also want to tell you that we have drilled now a couple of Avalon wells in the oil window. We had talked about that play in the past. We're still in the process of evaluating that play. We know some of our peers are very excited about that play, and I will say that based on our recent wells, we're starting to share that excitement. We don't have yet 30 days of production on any one well. We have one well that's a few weeks of production, another well that's got a week of production. But I will share with you that our initial results are right in line with what the industry is seeing. That is a high-decline play, so those wells can and do come on in excess of 1,000 barrels equivalent per day. They do decline rapidly, but they do generate very nice returns at current costs. So we'll have the Avalon being a significant portion of our 2012 program. We'll have one rig running in the Avalon here through much of the year, and we're actually in pretty serious discussions about an 80-acre down-spacing project within the Avalon. ", "I'd like to move on, in the interest of time, to our Mid-Continent program, and again, I'm on Slide 19. Our Mid-Continent program, of course, is many different programs. We always talk about the Cana play, but I want to just say, again, we get asked a lot about new ventures. And one of our most active area of new ventures is in the Mid-Continent. We've added a lot of geological horsepower in the last year or 2, and we are working on some new concepts in the Anadarko Basin, which is a very multi-pay, rich basin. And I fully hope and expect in subsequent calls to be talking to you about new horizontal plays in our backyard in the Anadarko Basin. ", "And moving on to Slide 20, this is a little blowup of our Cana play. This is the area where we have 120,000 net acres. We've been transitioning into 2012. In 2011, we were testing the Cana D play. And that's the area, for those of you that are looking at the Slide 20, that's the area off to the West at about that 16,000-foot depth contour. And we had very good results, but not sufficient to really make a living at today's pricing. So we've moved back into the core and we're embarking on an infill project in the core, I'll give you a little more color there. But I think you would expect, as you look at 2012 for our Cana program to develop much greater capital efficiency. The returns in the core are very good even at today's market, and we've moved our activity for 2012 into the core.", "Slide 21 gives you a little bit of detail. On Slide 21, there is a stippled white row of sections there in the upper half of that slide. That's the area of the core in which we are currently infilling. We're going to 9 wells per section. We have 10 rigs currently running in that infill project and drilling 9 wells or the nominal spacing that people talked about there, a 64-acre spacing. That will be a significant contributor to our production this year, although as I'm sure Joe will talk about, because of the logistics of drilling all those wells side by side, there'll be some delay between when we drill and when we complete those wells. We're drilling those wells from pads. There's 2 wells per pad. They're costing us approximately $8 million per well, and we expect to deliver 6.5 to 8.5 Bcf equivalent per well ultimate production. So it's quite a project. There are a lot of infrastructure involved, a lot of planning, a lot of construction, but it really does look like a project that's potentially going to deliver outstanding returns to us even at today's market.", "So in summary, for the Cana-Woodford play, I'm on Slide 22, for fourth quarter 2011, our production there was 158 million cubic feet equivalent a day, which was a 59% increase over Q4 2010. We have significant unbooked potential on that core. We have over 730 net locations, 2,200 gross wells, a 4.5 Tcf equivalent of net resource potential. And as we represented in the past, we have $5 billion to $6 billion in future drilling capital and a large resource potential outside of our core. And we still are doing some science in that deep and hopefully, we can make that work.", "I want to end on the Gulf Coast. I'll use a poor analogy. The last 2009, 2010 were kind of binged exploration years in the Gulf Coast, and maybe you call 2011 a hangover year with that binge. We have that fully behind us now. We're still active in the Gulf Coast. We are in the process of acquiring, processing and evaluating at least 3, and possibly 4, 3D surveys. The one thing that we are committed to do is a little bit of planning in that program. We will very much endeavor to get that activity at a level that will space out and not give huge bowl of the swings on our production. But nonetheless, today's story is when you look at our underlying engines of Permian and Mid-Continent, that issue's behind us. I think you can look at Cimarex for what we are, a diversified company, great resource driller, healthy balance sheet and tremendous potential for returns that will, as a consequence, generate growth.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll summarize our Q4 and 2011 production, hit on our first quarter and full year 2012 production guidance, and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on our 2012 exploitation program and where we see service costs. ", "Starting first, I'm not certain of the number of the slides, but this is our Q4 and 2011 full year projection slide. We had a solid fourth quarter driven by Permian and the Mid-Continent. We reported average net daily equivalent production of 601.4 million a day. That was up 9.4 million a day from Q3, and it beat the midpoint of our guidance by approximately 1 million a day. We spent a lot of time talking about the Permian and the Mid-Continent, and once again, our production statistics reflect that. We set multiple new records in each one of the regions. Our Permian oil production of 19,123 barrels a day, it's a record. It's up 9% from Q3 and 24% from Q4 '10. Our Permian total liquids production of 22,889 barrels a day also set a record, up 7% from Q3 and 25% from last year. Our Mid-Continent gas production of 219 million a day set a record. We're up 4% from Q3 and 12% from Q4 '10. As did our Mid-Continent total liquids of 16,252 barrels a day, which was up 4% from Q3 and 24% from a year ago.  ", "The driver in the Mid-Continent here was Cana, where record fourth quarter equivalent production of 158 million a day was up 13% from the third quarter and a strong 59% from Q4 '10.", "So as a result, we set record marks for our equivalent production, both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with our Mid-Continent equivalent production of 309 million a day, up 17% from a year ago, and our Permian equivalent production of 215 million a day, up 18% from a year ago. So combined, the fourth quarter Permian and Mid-Continent production level of 531 million a day was up 17% over the last 12 months.", "So we close the books with our 2011 production coming in at 592 million a day. That's right at the midpoint we provided last call and virtually flat to 2010 after accounting for property sales. But as we mentioned last call, on the surface, we may be flat to 2010, but underneath the hood, our Permian and Mid-Continent production grew at 16% and offset the 70 million a day year-over-year drop that we saw on the Gulf Coast.", "Hitting on production, Q4 production by region, you can see that our Permian and Mid-Continent production has now grown to the point where the 2 regions make up the lion's share of our production, quite evident when looking at the geographic split of our Q4 production. Combined, the Permian and Mid-Continent now make up 88% of our total liquids and 89% of our gas. On an equivalent basis, the regions now represent 88% of our total company production, with the Permian accounting for 70% of our oil and 51% of our liquids, and the Mid-Continent accounting for 65% of our gas and 37% of our liquids.", "Looking forward into 2012 with our guidance, as Tom mentioned, we truly see 2012 to be the year that we get the headwind of our Gulf Coast production declines behind us. Our current guidance model calls for continued strong production growth in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with little or no new well contribution from the Gulf Coast in our models. As a result, we project the Permian and the Mid-Continent to grow at a combined rate of 19% to 25%, with the Gulf Coast projected to just make up less than 6% of our 2012 production.", "With our emphasis on the Permian and the Mid-Continent, we anticipate continued liquids growth from the 2 regions, with combined oil volumes anticipated to grow at 20% to 27% and combined NGL volumes forecasted to grow at 37% to 44%. And as a result, as we've mentioned earlier in the call, we project our 2012 total company liquid percentage to come in at 46%. 2012, that's a 2-point increase over our 2011 level of 44%.", "Timing-wise, as Tom mentioned, with production from our Cana infill project expected to come on in late Q2, we're forecasting modest production growth during Q1 and Q2, with accelerated growth projected in the last half of the year. As such, our Q1 guidance fell at the level of -- fell in at the level of 595 million to 615 million a day, and our full year projection came in at 615 million to 650 million a day. I might mention, it's part of that infill project to lever it a little bit. We're drilling these wells in the Cana infill area and we're waiting to frac them until we have a number of them drilled for a variety of reasons. And to give you an idea of what would be waiting on completion as the result of that infill project, we're anticipating that there'd be 15 wells during the May to July time period that are on our frac schedule that are associated with that program. So normally, they would've been completed in a much more accelerated manner, and as a result of our planned scheduling, they'll transpire later in Q2 as far as the completions are concerned.", "Shifting gears to our production group focus and the operations group in general, the group put forth another solid year for us in 2011, with a strong focus on the base properties. We did a great job optimizing production and maximizing net operating income, all the while putting $65 million of net exploitation capital to work, performing over 375 projects. The majority of our exploitation capital went towards recompletion activity in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, numerous saltwater disposal projects, primarily in the Permian, and infill or replacement well drilling activity in the Permian and in South Texas. The remainder of the capital was directed to a variety of workover, lift and facility projects throughout our operating and nonoperating areas. And overall, the group just did a nice job of optimizing production and net operating income during the year, all the while putting our exploitation capital to work wisely.", "For 2012, our production operations team will remain focused really on 4 simple objectives: Maximizing our net operating income with an emphasis on LOE reduction through saltwater disposal; ensuring takeaway capacity in our core plays by constructing infrastructure as needed, Tom elaborated a little bit on what we've already done in the Permian there; thirdly, effectively deploying our exploitation capital; and then as we strive for each and every year, maintaining our focus to improve our operating capabilities in the field.  ", "With our year-end planning process, our production operations group put together another solid inventory of exploitation projects for 2012. We've identified over 400 projects with more than $80 million of associated capital. The inventory was cold and high-graded, resulting in our targeted 2012 capitalized budget of $60 million to $75 million with more than 300 associated projects. Our 2012 focus in the Permian is simply SWD, with the remainder of our workover recompletion, lift and infill drilling activity staying fairly consistent with what we've done over the past years.", "Looking at our OpEx, with Q4 lifting costs coming in at $1.18 an Mcfe, we finished the year with an average lifting cost of $1.14. That's about at the midpoint of our 2011 guidance, which was $1.02 or $1.22. As compared to 2010, we saw a considerable cost pressure in virtually all cost components on the LOE side during 2011, but especially the aggregate cost to dispose of produced load water from our new wells. With our focus on SWD projects in 2012, our 2012 lifting cost guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 is simply just built around the midpoint -- a midpoint equating to our average lifting cost over the last 3 quarters.", "On the service cost side, completion costs continue to play a vital role in our total well cost. Completion costs now make up approximately 50% of our total well cost for our horizontal well. As we've mentioned before, we've seen frac cost go up significantly over the last year. That's a result of both the design changes and service cost increases, especially in the Permian. As compared to 2010, our total company average frac cost was up 20% in 2011, with Cana up an average of 8% and the Permian up over 40%. That said, we are seeing relief in service cost, particularly in the Permian, and we'll continue to alter our frac designs where we can to help control these costs.", "On the drilling side, with continuing efficiencies and with market costs appearing to be somewhat flat over the last quarter, we've done a good job of funding the completion cost increases that we've seen to keep our total well costs somewhat in check. With good focus on program efficiencies, especially in our infill program, our Cana core wells are still running about $8 million. That's basically flat to the levels we saw a year ago. Our Permian Paddock and Blinebry vertical AFEs, they've crept up a smidge. They're running right now about $2.2 million to $2.4 million. That's up 15% to 25% from Q1 '11, and primarily the result of increased frac and facility costs as compared to last year. ", "With the drilling of slightly deeper wells and changes on our frac design in our New Mexico section, the third Bone Spring program, those wells are running around $5.8 million to $6.3 million. That's up from levels of $4.8 million to $5.2 million that we saw at early 2011. We've made great strides in our West Texas third Bone Spring wells with stimulation design changes. We've trimmed those AFEs to levels of $7.5 million to $8.5 million. That's down considerably from the $8.8 million to $9.2 million levels that we saw in early 2011. And as we continue to develop and refine our Wolfcamp shale play, especially on the completion design side, our current AFEs are running around $8 million to $8.5 million. That's up from the $6.5 million to $7.5 million that we quoted last year.", "So as we move forward, our operations and exploration groups are obviously going to continue to work together to improve the efficiencies, take it to the next level, work on drilling design and completion design where we can, and ultimately, just like to keep these well costs in check. In all, with the momentum of a great quarter behind us, we're really looking forward on this and to making 2012 really our year for the Permian and the Mid-Continent.", "So with that, operator, I think we'd like to turn the call over to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "The -- in the past year -- excuse me, your decision to spend relative to your cash flow levels -- sorry, you really haven't had a policy of not outspending cash flows, but if I look at 2012, it appears that you guys are kind of pulling a little bit harder on the outspend. And I'm just wondering, you certainly have the liquidity to fund that. But just what gives you guys confidence, as you look forward, in terms of why to outspend? Is it confidence in your inventory? Is it just cheap cost of debt, desire to bring forward the inventory? If you could provide some more color on that, that would be helpful.", "Paul Korus", "Hi, Brian, Tom is pointing to me to answer your question. At 2011, we had the opportunity to sell some assets that didn't have a long-term future for us. So we were able to fund the 2011 program with cash flow and property sales. We came into the year with, also with $100 million of cash. And as we move into 2012, we look at our opportunity set as providing very good returns in the price environment in which we find ourselves, as constructed as well. I mean we could clearly spend much more on gas-oriented projects if all we wanted to do is grow our volumes faster. But we remain very conscious about returns. So our returns are good. If we feel very comfortable continuing with the level of activity into 2012 that we finished 2011 with, we don't know what cash flow is going to be. We all have price forecasts. None of us are likely to be right. So we'll see what happens as the year unfolds. With the current sentiment -- well, at current prices and current negative sentiment on gas, if we use forward curve or your price forecast or anyone else's, we would come up short of our planned capital program. But we have -- this is why you have big credit facilities in place. And it's why you want to always maintain access to capital markets, in our case, particular, maybe debt capital markets. So we're very confident with what we're doing. Our policy has never really been to stay within cash flow. That has been our history, but not necessarily our policy. Our policy has been to fund good ideas that we could execute on effectively and efficiently, and that's essentially what our 2012 program is.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Brian, this is Tom. I do want to touch on that, and that's a great question. I will tell you that we debate that every day around here, what should our proper level of activity been -- be and have been. We -- as we look into 2012, it's really obviously all about Permian and Cana. And those are 2 different issues. Cana, we embarked on this infill project last fall and we had at regular roll. We moved 10 rigs in, in a line, and we had some decisions to make. When we first started, we said, well, let's commit to absolutely infill 3 sections, and we had 7 lined up, ready to go. And one of the nice things about our program is we have some flexibility. Of our rigs, we only have a few that are under any term contract and they all go away this year. So we would have and do have the flexibility to ramp that program down and kind of decelerate slowly. So we're still -- the guidance range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, some of that involves, hey, what if we slowed down a little at Cana, and we're debating that. Right now, looking at the markets -- and we run those sensitivities aggressively. We've run sensitivities at a horrible gas price, ethane rejection, I mean you name it, we run it. We think that program generates really nice returns today, and that's a testament to Cana. And then the other issue is the Permian. The Permian is just lights out. There's no question that that is generating outstanding returns at today's cost and today's pricing environment. We have the opportunity and we like activity. We are a high-volume outfit. We always have been. And one of the reasons we like activity is guess what? When we're active, we generate more opportunity. We have an active year, we look up and we have more years of inventory than we did when we started because our generating teams, through their own activity, find more things to do. So we have kind of given Cana the mandate of you know what, we're going to go forward and kind of steady as she goes, and we have some flexibility there. Permian, we said, get her done. Those returns are great. As Paul said, that's why that balance sheet is there, and we're very, very pleased with the returns we have going into 2012.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Well Tom, I tell you, I'm a fan of activity as well. It seems like over the last -- since last quarter, that is, the confidence in the Permian has really improved. I mean you talked a lot about it in the call. But it seems like the readthrough on that is that you're just more comfortable with the overall inventory and portfolio in the Permian. And so, I know you just gave 2012 out, but does that reflect then that your view is you have the inventory now in place to really have that high sustainable liquids growth over a longer duration, more so than just the 2012?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, I think that's absolutely true. Now we don't like to issue 5-year plans. We've never seen any that's ever worth the paper they're printed on. And of course, prices, costs, I mean, I'm giving you all the standard disclaimers here, but we have multiple years of inventory. Our second, third Bone Spring play, this is our best play, has currently 3 to 4 years at our current run rate. If we never generate another idea and we had our only current land on that play alone, we have 3 to 4 years of run rate at our current drilling pace. And we're -- it's our most active lease play. We're continuing to generate activity aggressively through additional leasing. And then, of course, at Wolfcamp -- and we own -- Wolfcamp is still early. I mean my enthusiasm is because that's what I'm paid to do. I believe in our staff and I believe in our internally generated ideas and I've always liked talking about good results. But we're going to see. If that looks like what it's evolving into, that in and of itself is many, many years of drilling and it's very liquids-rich. So the Permian is a sustainable business for us. It's not something where it's a -- we're not having a going out of business sale with high activity in the Permian. It's sustainable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Your proved developed proportion of reserves went up. Is that just from the sale of Riley Ridge, which is a PUD?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "There was nothing really else going on?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "No, absolutely not. And everybody has their own philosophy. We try to give a lot of transparency to our assets, and we think we've got lots of things to do for many years to come.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. Can you talk about -- you''ve talked a couple of times about reconsidering the capital allocation between Cana and Permian. Can you talk about the contractual obligations for rigs and other equipment services that would either allow you to do that or prevent you from doing that or create sort of timing issues surrounding that?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Gil, this is Joe Albi. As Tom mentioned, our rig commitments are really far and few. There are 4 rigs that we've got some type of commitment to with Cana. Those all edge off by the -- or fall off at the end of the year. And everywhere else, it's well to well. So I hope that gives you an idea of what we're contractually obligated to do there. On the service cost side, the only other type of commitment we have is for one of our frac services providers, and we've got about another year left on it. It's kind of one of these deals that we've committed to some capital level of expenditure, and if we don't meet that every month, that we can move that into the next month. So it doesn't really force us to do anything.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "If -- to keep that one crew busy, how many rigs would you need to run?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, right now, we've just got one frac crew working in Cana.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. And that's the one that's under that obligation?", "Joseph R. Albi", "That is correct.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But how many rigs would you need to run to keep that crew busy?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Oh well, they'll knock off maybe one a week. So you get 4 completions a month out of them.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. But I just -- I'd chime in, when we made that commitment, that's a crew that we could -- it's a [indiscernible] the Permian. So that's not it. We don't view that as a -- that would not be a factor in any decision we made.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got you. Okay. I think, Joe, you mentioned that the waiting on completion backlog should rise about 15 by the middle of the year. Will it stay 15 or will it go down, or how does it go once it gets to that 15?", "Joseph R. Albi", "No, that was just Cana. And if you bear with me a second, I can give you a better idea for that. I think total company, we should be upwards near 25-plus. And then, of course, we'll whittle that down as the infill project matures.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, we're -- again, we have some complete flexibility and it's driving our team crazy. Because our flexibility has keep those 10 rigs running, infill all 7 sections and then go to another row that we have ready to go. So we could just keep infilling Cana until the cows come home here for years to come. But we do have flexibility. We're watching these markets like everybody else is. And we're going to react depending on what the gas and natural gas liquids price dictate. We're not going to destroy capital to keep rigs busy.", "Joseph R. Albi", "And if we get backlog like we did before, we'll just pawn some additional frac crews. So part of the science of the infill is the completion and understanding how to frac in those wells not just individually, but multiple wells.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So what you're saying is that, that backlog rises or falls based on what your -- whether now you step on the gas in the Cana or not from the current plan, right?", "Joseph R. Albi", "I'd say that's a safe assessment.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Gil, you know us. I mean we're going to do what makes sense to us, and I hope everybody hears that loud and clear, that these plans we're reporting are great, but we're -- our only commitment to the shareholders is we're going to make what we think are best decisions for long-term interest of the shareholders.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And the last question is just can you talk about how we should think about the Gulf Coast in terms of -- I know that there's no Gulf Coast growing success in the current guidance. Can you give us some sense as the timing of when the seismic is going to be done, when the inventory will be in place, when you start drilling and how we should think about this potential success rates of those first wells and the new seismic shoot?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, Gil, this is Tom. I -- we tell you that we have a lot of new data coming in and it'll be second half this year before we even have the opportunity to talk about any kind of go-forward in inventory. So I think we've done exactly the right thing, and that's we haven't guided any Gulf Coast production. So we'll know when we get that in, what happens. And I would expect we're going to have inventory, I would be surprised if we didn't. But one of the things that we're going to try to do is space it out a little bit. I mean, we -- I mentioned binge exploration. We've always kind of been a; let's-get-it-done-as-soon-as-possible outfit, and not that we're changing our stripes there, but we're going to try -- I like the fact that we're having a few programs come in that will give us the option to kind of, assuming we have the kind of inventory we're planning, we don't have to get them done all along. So we can space that out, so it will be more manageable in terms of production. But that said, I think I'll just -- you're being horribly redundant. I mean  the thing that we're all kind of excited about is we see this permanent Mid-Continent growth kind of makes this issue, to us, kind of irrelevant in terms of the kind of lower print that may have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You all are talking about 19% to 25% production growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent in 2012 over '11 and drilling essentially the same number of net wells at roughly 165 in '12 and 164 last. You mentioned operational efficiency several times in your all's comments in different plays. Can you just talk about how much of that higher production growth rate on the same well account do you think you pick up from operational efficiencies versus maybe drilling different targets than you were in 2011?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, this is Joe. Built into all this, when we look at 2010 to '11 and '11 to '12, there are some timing issues that come into play. In particular from '10 to '11, if you remember, we had a huge backlog of completions in the Permian. I think we got up as high as 30 wells waiting on frac by the middle of the year. And then, of course, we pushed that hard at the end of the year. So when you -- those production results occur at the end of the year and then averaged out over the full year,are a number. I would answer this question, and Tom, chime in too, that the types of wells that we're drilling, the targets that we're drilling, the IPs that we're seeing, we're seeing some better results in the Permian. Cana is coming in as expected. It's more of a timing issue on when we anticipate the wells will be drilled and completed, and then, of course, coming online. I mentioned in my section of the call that we were, I guess, tail end loaded with accelerated production growth in 2012. Our current model is saying that maybe our exit rate, midyear, might be 6 and a quarter, 625 million a day, and with that growing hopefully to levels over 650 million a day-plus at the end of the year. So that gives you a feel for how it's hitting our model as far as it being our equivalent production estimates. I don't know if that helps you out at all, trying to understand how we've modeled it. I wouldn't say it's the type of well that we're drilling other than we are drilling some better wells in the Bone Spring area, the capital efficiency that comes into play, in particular in Cana, where we've kept our well costs in check, and we're going to optimize our drilling and completion dollars, especially the completion dollars, trying to figure out what kind of bang for the buck are we getting on our fracs to try and keep that in line.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Joe, the part of that, just going back into the core of Cana instead of doing more of the step-out drilling and getting more out of the rigs that you're working with?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, I think most of it's associated with pad drilling. You put 2 wells on each pad, we're consolidating services where we can, we're consolidating equipment where we can. You've got reduced move[ph] charges because you're not moving[ph] from well to well. Our facility costs are lower. We've utilized biofuel on 6 of our rigs. That's knocking off about $300,000 a month of our drilling and completion costs with 6 rigs on biofuel. So there's a number of things that we're doing there that program drilling really allows us to do and take full advantage of.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Jeff, one thing that we talk about, everybody in the industry's aware of this, when you go to a more liquids-rich program, it doesn't necessarily show up in an Mcf equivalent rate, but it sure shows up on returns. And when we look at Cana core, our -- we haven't talked a lot about Cana deep results, but we have good results. I mean we had, on average, with 19 wells we drilled, 15 of them operated that are currently on line, we were averaging 4 to 5 million cubic feet a day held flat on a slowback for 3 months or more. We're slowbacking those wells, choking them back to try to manage that downhaul reservoir pressure. So they were very, very nice wells. The problem with it is that it's methane. There's almost no liquids uplift there. So as we go to the core, we're seeing kind of comparable rates, but we're also seeing yields of anywhere from 10 to 35 barrels of condensate per million, condensate that is trucked off as oil, and then anywhere from 86 to 111 barrels of natural gas liquids per million. So the rates on an Mcfe basis don't necessarily show the difference in the return. And so it's much more capital-efficient.", "Joseph R. Albi", "But that really surfaces -- this is Joe, that really surfaces in the Permian program, too. We're directing more capital into an oil and liquids-rich area down there, and it's the same deal. An Mcfe in the Permian is not like an Mcfe in a dry gas area.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then last question, on your -- do you have any material acreage dollars in the 2012, $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion capital number?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We do. I will say, in 2011, for us, we spent a lot of money on acreage. We spent actually about $189 million on acreage in 2011. And that's, for us, at 15% of capital or a little less than that. That's a pretty aggressive year for acreage. We would like to do that or close to that this year. Mark's looking at the numbers. What do you have modeling?", "Mark Burford", "It's about $140 million for this year.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. And so what will happen there, a lot of that 2011 was our pushing to Cana deep. We spent a lot of money putting the Cana deep position together. We would like to see a very aggressive acreage year, Mark's carrying $140 million, and I would say, I would expect the lion's share of that to be Permian and other new ventures. And new ventures could be Anadarko Basin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions for you. In the Permian, can you talk a little bit more about what changed in the Bone Springs wells that you've been drilling relative to the 3Q call and the results that you've seen?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, yes, this is Tom, mister dour from the Q3 call. The thing that I -- Chris, we never get a do-over in life. But one of the things I will say is even in the Q3 call, our returns in our Permian were very good. And I probably should have stressed that a little more. It was our actual results to our expected results. And so what changed is our teams really tore into that. We did a lot of petrophysical work, some geochemical work, and identified some more subtle trends that we had -- kind of we've been kind of drilling our way into and we really tore the wells apart, built some water saturation models. The operations group did a great job of getting some saltwater disposal in place that will allow us to make money moving this water instead of hauling it and really drilled some nice wells. We are not here today talking about individual wells, but I will say, we did drill some wells in the fourth quarter that averaged, for first 30 days, averaged over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And that's through that science, we moved into some areas that we think are just better. So that said, we upsized our fracs. We had some nice results in the Wolfcamp once we completed our wells. So there were so material changes in our program. I mean we're always focused on getting better at the business, and in the third quarter, you kind of caught us in the middle of it. And I will say, today, we are better at the business.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's great. And if we look at the Permian overall, I know you talked about the line that you installed there down the Culberson County. From an infrastructure point of view, do you see any potential bottlenecks on the system anywhere in the basin? And if so, what regions do you think are going to be tightest, both for you, and I guess, for industry in general?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe, Ryan. We've put in about -- I think at the end of the year we had over 67 miles of infrastructure, mostly pipeline in place in the Permian. Our goal was simply to control our infrastructure, obviously, and give us some market optionality. We're worried about takeaway capacity on the Permian as I know all of our competitors are. We've put in our own tap into an El Paso line that we will be JTing our own production. That gives us a little bit of a reservation, if you -- capacity, if you want to call it that. And we're also working with the likes of, I won't name names, but other processors to understand what they have coming around the corner in the area and what capacities they currently have to try to ensure to the degree that we can that our volumes are moving. We see the El Paso tap as kind of being our safety net where we may not get as a good recovery out of our JT, but we certainly will be able to move the gas.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I mean I know trucks were -- at one point early in 2011, there was kind of tightness in trucking and then had loosened up. Does that kind of remain not much of a concern these days, or is that still a concern as well?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I want to give kudos to our marketing and operations guys who've done a great job there. We find ourselves up with a couple of purchasers, where there's scorecards in place, certain processes in place to ensure trucks are available. We've put a deal together for the piping of some oil out of the West Texas area with some commitments on their part, to the hauler's part and ours, that we will both perform. That has certainly helped. And that really picked up in Q4. We had a little bit of a problem with the weather in December, and then we made all that back up just tremendously here in January. So the guys have done a great job there.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. Then one more, if I could, on Cana. The range that we see in the production guidance for 2012, is that primarily driven by potential for flexibility around that Cana program? And if you decide not to go forward with kind of the next leg of drilling there, pad drilling in Cana, does that take production to the low-end of the guidance range or how should we think about that?", "Joseph R. Albi", "We've built out around the current 10-rig program. So to the extent we accelerate or decelerate, it would affect those numbers. But if we decelerate, as Tom mentioned, we'll be moving that capital elsewhere.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. And because of the delay on those completions, that really would not impact 2012 significantly.", "Paul Korus", "And more impact...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "In 2013, right. If we were to keep going, almost by the middle of third quarter, anything we do from then out shows some 2013 production just because of the -- there's a natural delay when you drill these wells side by side. You have to get a certain bank of them drilled before you complete them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So just to clarify and following up with Ryan's first question, so what is it that explains the higher IP rates on average for both the Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? I mean, is it geography? I mean, did you just drill in different locations where you got better rock or is it more fracs or longer laterals? I mean what is it really?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, well it's -- there are -- that's 2 different areas and there's 2 different answers. In the second Bone Spring, it's -- a lot of its geography, we, through our analysis of the petrophysics, stayed out of some of the higher water-cut areas. We also upsized our completions. And so that -- some of it is geography, targeting what we saw as richer areas, and some of it is upsizing our completions. So it's a combination of both. In the Wolfcamp, some of it's just the real estate. I mean we're drilling our way through and we've tried targeting a couple of different stratigraphic intervals. One of the things that we see in that Wolfcamp play is -- and we talked about this in the very beginning. We don't understand the variation until we get out there and drill it. There's not a lot of wells to key off on, where we have mud logs. And so one of the big variables is going to be yield, how much condensate are you going to make, what's the natural gas liquids yield. And so we're out there drilling and testing the area, and we're finding that, I think, we're identifying a couple of sweet spots out there. So, Joe, it's kind of a combination of both, operational efficiencies and real estate.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And so in the third quarter, when you talked about different issues, you talked about, I think, some lower EURs than you previously have modeled. I think you talked about water handling and that caused the cost to go up. I think more water than you had modeled. And then you just talked about general cost pressures. So could you just address those issues and do you see all of them resolved, or which ones do you see resolved and which ones are still unresolved?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. The water issue is -- if you drill into an area with high water cut, you're going to make water. I mean if somebody has a way to fall -- fix that, give me a call. But you can mitigate it by saltwater disposal. And in the third quarter call, we were in a situation where we're paying at times, $4 a barrel to haul water and that could just kill your economics. So we've gotten saltwater disposal wells in, and we've also, by this petrophysical work we've done and working with our operations group, have a plan in place where we can go in and target these high water cut areas, but have a disposal well ready so we're flowing back into a saltwater disposal well. But I'm looking at a -- right as I answer your question, I'm looking at kind of a highlights reel of the fourth quarter in that second Bone Spring. And I will say that our water cuts vary from 29% upwards of 65%. So even at 65% water cut, you can make a nice living if you can dispose that water efficiently. So I wouldn't say we've solved the water issue and that we're still going to make a fair amount of water in that play, but we've done a lot in terms of fixing the economics of it.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of service cost pressures, I think on the third quarter call, you talked about service cost pressures especially in the Permian. And if I'm hearing you correctly today, you're talking about costs going the other way in the Permian.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, that's a tricky question. This is Joe. With regard to fracs, the frac has a number of components. You've got your service costs, and that can be affected by the cost of their personnel,  number one, and to some degree, our efficiencies in getting a job pumped. If it takes us less time to pump a job, the service cost is less. On the service cost side, we have seen the per unit cost go down. You've got the other 2 ingredients. You've got fluids, and those can vary by the degree to which we use more fluid and the type of fluid that we use. And then on the prop side, what type of prop do we use? We've worked very hard to use white sand where we can, and for the most part are using it in virtually all of our operations. That's helped cut our cost down on the prop side. But if we run more stages, we're going to run more -- we're going to pump more prop and more fluid. So overall, I'd say, as a company, that quarter-to-quarter, we've seen our overall total company service costs go down. And the fluid and prop costs are probably in that flattish range as a result of how we may or may not have changed our program design.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And Joe, just speaking specifically to the Permian, so you're seeing the, that overall costs go down there as well?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, right now, it's starting to soften on the service side. The biggest controlling factor there is do we pump x number of stages or y, with y being more than x, the total volumes pumped. I want to elaborate a little bit too on what Tom said about the SWD issue and how that affects not only our lifting costs, but the economics of these wells and particularly, the Permian. We really got going on that, I'd say, in late Q3. Some of the results of those SWD projects we'll see in our lifting costs being reduced from current levels on the SWD side. But our real goal is to get out ahead of this thing so that those costs never even hit the books and that we're paying virtually little, if any, dollars to dispose of any of the produced load water that we see from our new wells. We have identified, at the end of the year, 17 different SWD projects that entail about $40 million worth of capital that we're trying to undertake that hopefully we'll have done here before the end of the year. Some of them have already been completed. But we're really emphasizing that, and that is really having an impact in our overall rate of return in the Permian, number one, and that, number two, we hope to have it show up in our lifting cost.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Joe, this is Tom, and we -- you know us well. I mean we'd rather talk about results than promise, and we're really happy to be here this morning talking about real results. We haven't had our last problem solved. We're a blocking and tackling outfit. We try to do good science, be good at the business, but we certainly like where our Permian and Mid-Continent assets are sitting right now. We're having really good results. And I think that the program we've outlined here today has a great promise to deliver those results. And another thing that we're really pleased to report to you is we have flexibility. If there's ever a time in our business where I've looked out at the future and thought that the boundaries are broader than I've ever see. In terms of up and downside of people's forecast, we have flexibility, so to be able to react, to run for daylight or pull in a little bit, depending on market conditions. So we'll continue, hopefully, to report good results, but we've had some very, very nice results in both the Permian and our Mid-Continent programs.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just one more, and I think this is for Joe. So, Joe, In the Gulf Coast, basically, your guidance is suggesting that you're going to be down about 50% from the fourth quarter production level to the average of 2012. So that's all that midyear. Is that -- are you guys just being conservative with that?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, Joe, we've got -- we're always fighting some of the same old things with mechanical issues or sand flow or what have you. But what I have attempted to do, both approaching it from 2 different angles, is look at potential risked contribution from new wells without a lot of mechanical issues. And what is that number for Q4, what is it if you just assume nothing and, from the new wells drilled and no mechanical issues, and we still come around that same darn level that we've quoted in our press release. So I really don't know how to say any more than that.", "Paul Korus", "It's our best estimate.", "Joseph R. Albi", "[indiscernible] Yes.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Anyway, but I guess it's interesting that the production, even though you've -- it would seem to me that you've gone through the steepest part of the decline and the decline would lessen, that the number suggested is going to be down 50%. And that's 50% from fourth quarter to maybe midyear.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, that's what we're modeling. Most of that solved the Beaumont stuff. And we've got some assets that are fairly longer live. I guess you want to call that for the Gulf Coast that eventually, that will tail off and that decline won't be as severe. But in our minds, the point of the matter is, hey, it's less than 6% of our total production in 2012.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, do you have any closing remarks?", "Mark Burford", "Oh, yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Appreciate everyone's participation in the call, and we look to continue to report good results in the future. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Bishonda, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Earnings and Operations Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Bishonda. I appreciate it. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Here in Denver on today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller. ", "We issued our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what is to be discussed. You should read our disclosure on forward-looking statements in our 10-K, other filings and press releases for risk factors associated with our business.", "And with that, I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon, at least for us. First quarter 2012 is a good quarter for Cimarex. We reported net income of $106 million or $1.23 per diluted share, and our cash flow from operations this quarter was $303 million, which continues to benefit from strong oil and natural gas liquids revenues.", "First quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 603.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day or a barrel of oil equivalent just over 100,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day. Our first quarter 2012 Permian and Mid-Continent volumes hit an all-time high of 554.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 26% over the same period in 2011.  That growth includes a 50% increase in Permian oil volumes over the first quarter of 2011 to a record 21,800 barrels of oil per day this quarter. ", "Overall, oil production also reached an all-time high of 29,562 barrels per day, and that is just a consequence of the strategy we've talked about in the past of emphasizing that Permian Basin and growing our oil and other liquids production. That liquids production accounted for 47% of our equivalent volumes this quarter and comprise 79% of our $411 million of oil and gas and NGL revenue.", "Oil price realizations increased 9% this quarter to $99.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 34%, averaging $2.92 per Mcf. Driving our growth are continued good results from our drilling programs. We have a great inventory of strong projects. In the first quarter, we drilled and completed 73 gross, 40 net wells, investing $400 million on exploration and development. Of that total, 50% were invested in projects located in the Permian Basin, 48% in the Mid-Continent and 2% in the Gulf Coast and other.", "What I'd like to do now is give you a region-by-region walk through, and I'll start with the Permian. There, we drilled and completed 39 gross, 27 net wells during the first quarter of 2012, completing 95% of those as producers.", "Permian first quarter exploration development capital was $201 million or 50% of total capital. So as you can see, we're on a run rate of about $800 million in the Permian, and we'll see what we do going forward depending on our cash flow, our results and costs.", "And our New Mexico horizontal second and third Bone Spring play, that's our most active play. Year-to-date, we drilled and completed 13 gross, 6 net wells. And our per well 30-day gross production from the 2012 Bone Spring wells averaged 590 barrels equivalent, that's a Boe per day and 87% of that is oil. Throughout our presentation, you're going to hear us talk about 30-day averages. We think that's the meaningful number in some of these wells. From time to time, I'm going to sprinkle in some instantaneous 24-hour rates, but it's the 30-day rate that we look at and that's one we encourage you to look in the measure of the well.", "And getting back to second and third Bone Spring, we're continuing to see very strong results in this program. We're very pleased with our recent wells and how it's trending. And that's a number of reasons, all of which are testament to our exploration and operational folks.", "Of note, we've upsized our hydraulic fractures, as has many of our competitors. We've gone from 5 stages to 8 stages per lateral, and we've also done some geoscience we've talked about in the past, and we're seeing lower average water cuts. So really getting that program, delivering some nice solid performance.", "Coinciding with these results, our future inventory continues to grow. We see somewhere between 150 and 200 future New Mexico Bone Spring drilling locations on our current land position, and that land position is always increasing. It's a very active lease play for us. This account has a potential to grow significantly as we continue to drill and gather more data.", "Moving on to the Texas Third Bone Spring play. There we drilled and completed 5 gross, 5 net Third Bone Spring wells in the first quarter. The wells brought online had per-well 30-day average gross production rates of 800 barrels equivalent per day, 82% of which were oil. So these are very, very nice wells, cost a little more to drill and complete, but very, very nice results.", "This program is also proceeding with a solid inventory of future drilling locations, which our current count is near 100 wells on our current acreage and, as before, has the potential to grow significantly with more drilling and more leasing.", "And then moving on to our Wolfcamp play, we're continuing to evaluate multiple shale intervals in the Delaware Basin. The majority of our drilling, of course, is focused on the Wolfcamp. We talked about that now for a few of our quarterly calls. Most of our Wolfcamp drilling has been our southern Eddy County New Mexico, a property we call White City, and northern Culberson County Texas. In the first quarter of 2012, we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp wells, bringing total in the play to 20 gross, 19 net wells.", "Our first 30-day production per-well, this is averaging all of our wells, is 6.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that's comprised of 3.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day -- or excuse me, 3.1 million cubic feet per day of gas, 250 barrels per day of oil and 340 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. Or to summarize that, that's 47% gas, 23% oil and 30% natural gas liquids.", "So that Wolfcamp play to us is significant in scope. We're currently still delineating it. We have hundreds of locations. As we said in the past, we represent this as very early time in this play. We're still doing a lot of experimenting, both testing the play laterally throughout our acreage, but also vertically. We're testing a section that's 800 to 1,000 feet thick in gross interval, and we're experimenting with different landing zones. But overall, we're very, very pleased with our results in that Wolfcamp play at this point, and that looks to be a major contributor to the future of Cimarex.", "Also in the unconventional arena, where there's the Avalon Shale, and as we've discussed in the past, we're also drilling some Avalon Shale wells, especially east of us in Lea County where we began the oil window of the Avalon Shale. We've brought on 2 Avalon wells in the oil window this quarter. One was the Tristy Draw 36 State 1H [ph], where we had 100% working interest, and the Howard 5 Federal 4H [ph] with a 94% working interest. They had 30-day equivalent IPs. And again, this is a 30-day average of 500 to 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 70% of that was oil. But I'd also add -- they both had peak rates, their 1-day peak rate on both those wells were above 1,000 barrels of oil per day. So very, very nice wells.", "Again, it's early time for our understanding of Avalon, but it looks like it has significant potential for us for hundreds of future locations, significant potential for reserves and production upside, but we're still learning our way forward in that Avalon play.", "Moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first quarter, we drilled and completed 33 gross or 12 net Mid-Continent wells. Mid-Continent first quarter exploration development capital was $180 million or 48% of our total first quarter capital. Now the bulk of that is Cana, or Cana-Woodford play. And at quarter end, we had 39 gross or 18 net Cana-Woodford wells waiting on completion. ", "At year end 2011, there were 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion in Cana. Our waiting -- our wells waiting on completion have increased as a result of commencing of infill development during this year. And we've talked about this in the past calls, but we are infill drilling in Cana, and the methodology there is we're drilling somewhere between 80 and 95 wells side-by-side east-west. We get the bulk of those drilled case and then we come in later and start our completion episode, completing them simultaneously. So that's as planned. We have quite a backlog of wells waiting on completion in Cana. We'll see those come on in Q3, and that's exactly as designed.", "We currently have 10 rigs running and -- or excuse me, today, we have 9 rigs running in the Cana core. We just moved the rig to the Permian. And our returns in the core are still good. They're not great, but they're good. If we look at that infill project going from east to west, where the eastern portion is the most liquids-rich portion, the western portion is the driest portion, our return on drilling investment varies from 49% after-tax in the liquids-rich portion to 20% after-tax in the drier portion, and that's our current strip price. So still acceptable returns in the Cana-Woodford. However, we're getting better returns in the Permian. So as we've talked in the past, for the remainder of the year, we'll be shifting some of that capital to the Permian.", "We have a lot of flexibility in our Cana investment. We have limited lease expirations. We have very limited rig or other service commitments. So what we're planning on doing is throttling back to Cana a little bit while we watch these gas prices. We're going to go back to 7 rigs in the greater Mid-Continent area. We will probably take from time to time anywhere from 1 to 3 of our Cana rigs in western Oklahoma to test some new emerging ideas. We've talked in past calls about the western Oklahoma, Anadarko Basin being a very active generation program for us. And we have some things lined up that will be from time to time borrowing rigs from Cana in this low-gas environment to test some concepts that are oilier in Western Oklahoma.", "And finally, just wrapping up, talking about the Gulf Coast. In the Gulf Coast, we participated in just 1 gross or 0.5 net wells that was operated within our Yegua/Cook Mountain fairway in the first quarter, and that well was unsuccessful and was a dry hole. We're in the process of shooting and acquiring new seismic data, and we expect to be recharging our inventory and back to drilling in the second half of this year.", "So overall, we're seeing our program, the flexibility we baked into it in past years, having a liquids portion, having a high-quality Cana-Woodford program, also having a number of different plays. We're getting some benefits in that. And that even in this rather hostile gas environment, we still have a lot of opportunity to choose from that gets us acceptable returns. Obviously, we're trying to live within the guidance that we've talked about in the past, and we're committed to do that. But we're very pleased with our results thus far and very optimistic about our deep inventory and the opportunity it brings us.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll summarize our first quarter production, update you on our Q2 and full year guidance and then finish up with just a few comments on our current service costs.", "Well, Q1 came in for us just about as planned. We reported average net daily equivalent production of 603.5 million a day. That was up 2 million a day from our Q4 '11 reported figure of 601.4 million a day and fell just about at the midpoint of our guidance, which was 595 million to 615 million a day.", "Our production during the quarter was slightly impacted by some pipeline and facility shut-ins in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Those shut-ins impacted our production by approximately 6 million a day. And without them, we would've come in, obviously, at the upper end of our guidance.", "With our continued focus on the Permian and the Cana, we once again set a few records during the quarter. Tom mentioned a few, 4 of them all mentioned. Our Q1 Permian oil production of 21,800 barrels a day is a record, that's up 14% from Q4 '11 and 50% from Q1 '11.", "On the equivalent basis, our first quarter Permian production came in at 240.3 million a day, that's also a company high, up 12% from last quarter and 38% from a year ago. And although we were impacted to the tune of about 3 million a day in facility shut-ins during the quarter in Cana, our Q1 equivalent net Cana production of 161.3 million a day is also a new record, up 2% from Q4 and a respectable 56% from Q1 '11.", "As Tom mentioned, driven by the Permian, our total company Q1 oil production of 29,562 barrels a day was a new record. That's up 8% from Q4 '11 and 10% from last year. While our total company liquid production of 47,249 barrels a day also set a new high mark for us, up 6% from last quarter and 8% from a year ago. During Q1, liquids now make up 47% of our total production, that's up 3 points from the 44% that we saw one year ago.", "As compared to 4 '11, on an equivalent basis, our Q1 total company production of 603.5 million a day was up 2 million a day, with the Permian being up 25 million a day, the Gulf Coast down 21 million a day and the Mid-Continent down slightly at 2 million a day. And this, again, as I mentioned earlier, primarily result of the pipeline at facility shut-ins that we saw during the quarter. ", "As we mentioned during our last call, we now see the headwind of our past Gulf Coast declines to be behind us, and it's reflected in our year-over-year numbers. As compared to Q1 '11, our Q1 '12 total company production was up 13.4 million a day, with the Permian up 66.6 million a day, and the Mid-Continent up 47.8 million a day. That's a combined increase of 114.4 million a day, which more than offset the 101.3 million a day drop we saw in the Gulf Coast over the last 12 months.", "So as we look forward into Q2 and the remainder of the year, as we mentioned when we first issued our 2012 guidance, the significant portion of our anticipated 2012 production gains were projected to occur in the latter half of the year. And Tom alluded to this, this is driven primarily by our Cana infill well frac schedule. ", "Well, that picture hasn't changed, and as we modeled at the beginning of the year, our Q production -- Q2 production is forecasted to be relatively flat to Q1 as a result of basically 2 items: Number one, our anticipated Gulf Coast production decline, albeit a relatively small drop of 8 million to 10 million a day from Q1 to Q2; and two, the buildup of our completions that we have with the Cana infill project.", "As of March 31, we had 39 gross or 18 net Cana wells waiting on completion, with our infill frac activities slated to begin here in late May and then continue to the end of the year. So with this frac schedule, the production adds associated with the infill project are really projected to make an impact on our production in Q3 and Q4.", "With knowledge of some significant Q2 pipeline facility shut-ins and likely at a rejection associated with our processed gas in Cana, as many of you have written or read, we've reduced our second quarter guidance by approximately 10 million to 12 million a day, which resulted in a projected Q2 guidance range of 580 million to 680 million a day for the quarter.", "Incorporating our new Q2 estimate into our full year model, results in a revised 2012 guidance range of 612 million to 613 million a day. The current full year model calls for a Gulf Coast production to drop to levels of 25 million to 30 million a day by Q4, with combined Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent volumes to be in the range of 625 million to 650 million a day, up a respectable 18% to 22% from our Q4 '11 combined Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 531 million a day.", "So outside of the external impacts on our Q2 production, the bottom line to our guidance is basically that we're about where we thought we'd be at this point in the year. Adjusting our Q2 guidance for the 10 million to 12 million a day of shut-ins and possible ethane rejection puts Q2 right in line with Q1, which is how we modeled it at the beginning of the year, with the impact of our Cana infill program and increased Permian activity projected to boost our Q3 and Q4 volumes.", "Shifting gears to our OpEx. Our Q1 lifting costs came in at about 23 per Mcfe. That's up slightly from Q4 and at the upper end of our guidance. The primary component of work here was our slightly higher workover activity during Q1 as compared to quarters passed, with our first quarter workover component of $0.04 per Mcfe from Q4 '11. So with Q1 coming in at $1.23, we bumped our 2012 lifting cost guidance up slightly to about $1.15 to $1.30. ", "On the service cost side in general, during Q1, we saw our drilling cost components remain relatively flat, while completion costs appear to be softening a bit. And that's driven primarily by frac service cost reductions and overall prop cost reductions with the use of white sand. Only where we've increased fracture upsizes have we seen completion cost increases.", "In Cana, through drilling efficiencies gained by pad drilling, such as mobilization and facility cost savings, utilizing biofuel for -- power for our rigs, installing pipeline infrastructure for water sourcing and disposal and by consolidating our services and equipment, our current Cana core infill AFEs are now running $7.6 million, and that's down from levels of $8 million just 3 months ago.", "Our current Permian AFEs have remained fairly well in check since our last call, with improved drill time efficiency, our Paddock-Blinebry vertical AFEs are now running $2 million to $2.2 million, that's down slightly from Q1 and back in line with equivalent costs a year ago. Our 8,000 to 9,000 foot TVD New Mexico second Bone Spring wells are running $5.8 million to $6.5 million, that's flat with the numbers we gave you in Q1, but up 15% to 20% from Q2 '11, and that's, as Tom mentioned, to us increasing our frac size in that program basically going from 5 stages now to 8.", "Now as we drill a little bit deeper into the basin and approach TVDs of close to 11,000 feet, we'll see some of these second Bone Spring wells get closer to a $6.8 million to $7 million range. The heart of our activity today has been in the 8,000 to 9,000 foot range.", "Our current West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs of $7.5 million to $8.5 million are again flat with Q1 yet down considerably from where they were a year ago at about $9 million. This primarily a result of us changing our completion design going to cemented liners, fewer stages and using white sand. And our current Wolfcamp AFEs continue to come in at $8 million to $8.5 million, right on track as well with the estimates that we provided last call. ", "So in a nutshell, for us, Q1 came in about as planned. Adjusting for known Q2 pipeline facility shut-ins, our second quarter looks relatively flat to Q1. Our model continues to call for strong Q3 and Q4 production growth from the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Our service costs appear flat with signs of softening on the completion side, and our program efficiencies continue to improve our total well cost as we've evidenced with our Cana infill project.", "So with that, I'll turn that -- I'll turn the call over to Paul, our Senior VP and CFO.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. Consistent with our track record, our earnings release is probably once again noteworthy in that it doesn't contain any surprises. Our operational and financial results were good and generally in line with guidance and other expectations. I would say that the earnings and cash flow numbers were very clean, so I don't think they require any further explanation.", "However, I would like to comment and update you on the right side of the balance sheet. Subsequent to quarter end in early April, we issued $750 million of new 10-year Senior Notes priced at par to yield 5 and 7.125%. We used the proceeds to repay our old $350 million of 7.125 % Senior Notes that were due in 2017 and to repay bank debt that we had outstanding at the time. I probably should add in case any investors are on the line, thanks very much for your participation in that offering. ", "Pro forma for the new notes, we have nothing drawn on our $800 million bank credit facility and approximately $150 million of cash.", "Our credits stats after the offering remain strong. Pro forma for the new offering, our debt-to-cap ratio is about 19% and total current debt and projected debt outstanding at the end of this year remain below 1x to our EBITDA or any other measure of cash flow.", "We -- our capital projection for the year remains $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, midpoint of $1.5 billion. We think we're very well positioned to fund that with cash flow derived from production this year, proceeds to this offering and perhaps drawing on our credit facility to the tune of $150 million to $200 million by year end.", "With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mario Bizara [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "Just wanted to get some color on the Texas Bone Springs. It's just going back sequentially for the past few quarters, you're seeing steadily improving average 30-day rates. I know you commented briefly about using more sand, and what exactly are you guys doing or have you changed in your drilling techniques over the past 6 to 9 months to drive this improvement?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Sure. This is Tom. I think primarily, we're in a better area. We've -- for the past couple of years have been a little bit of a tug-of-war on leasing. And there's a part of the play we really like that we haven't aggressively drilled in because we were in lease competition and wanted to not race market players. And that has kind of come to an end, and so we're drilling in some areas that are a little thicker, a little higher oil cut and just better quality rock than some of our prior results. That and the upsized completion, I would say, explains our increasing results.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then you mentioned about looking to still acquire land here. I mean, with the recent debt offering, you still have a pretty solid debt to cap around 19%. What's your appetite for making an acquisition in this market that could be comparable to what you made with Magnum Hunter a few years ago, which got you really a significant position in the Delaware Basin?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, I would say our appetite is strong, but it's about returns to us. And we look at a lot of water package, I assume you're talking about Permian in particular, we look at water packages in the Permian that we like, and we are unwilling to pay what the successful buyers are paying because we don't think the returns are there. Now maybe we're just not seeing it fully, but we see it as we see it. So we're about returns. We love the Permian, but we're generating very nice returns on our internally generated opportunities, and we're able to increase that. I'll answer you straight on, though. We would love to find another opportunity like we had in 2005 when we bought our land to that 370,000 net acre position in Permian. This is -- these transactions today, it's very difficult for us to justify with our return metrics.", "Unknown Analyst", "Would you consider a new play or are we really just concentrating in the Permian and the Mid-Continent here?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, of course, we consider a new play. We would love to find something that we think generates significant drilling opportunity and would give us another core business area. So yes, we are opportunistic for that. I wouldn't say that we wake up every morning and go look for it, but they tend to kind of find us. And it's one of the strong reasons why we we're trying to preserve some flexibility with our balance sheet in case that were to happen.", "Paul Korus", "I'll add -- this is Paul, I'll add that in the meantime until the right opportunity comes along, we have -- we can be patient and selective because we are already long drilling inventory in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent area.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then just since talking about the drilling inventory, just last question here. You mentioned about maybe borrowing some rigs in Oklahoma to possibly expand on your drilling inventory. How long or far away are you guys from disclosing a new position or a new play within your current acreage position?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I don't think you'd see us come out with some huge threshold announcement. It's not the -- western Oklahoma is our oldest operating arena. And it's also one of most competitive land arenas that we compete in. But I wouldn't expect to see us come out with some new stealth play where we're going to say we have hundreds of thousands of acres. That said, in western Oklahoma, a 20,000 to 50,000 acreage position in the right play can be extremely meaningful to company our size. But I think we're probably targeting something along those lines. We're currently leasing in a couple of areas. But it's very, very difficult, and it's part of our business as usual that we use every day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just had a question on your guidance. If we look at your production guidance for the year, what are the implications in terms of rig activity? I know you mentioned dropping from 10 rigs to 7 rigs in the Cana or in the Mid-Continent region. How many rigs is that emission going to in the Permian?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we're currently running -- depending on when you quarry us between 13 and 15 rigs in the Permian. And we have the opportunities lined up to increase that, and we're talking about that. As I said earlier, though, one of our disciplines is our -- these low gas prices have some impact to our cash flow and we're trying to manage our capital program with some discipline. And we had a little bit of additional capital in Cana. You know there are a lot of companies infilling out there, and we have a little more non-operating capital in Cana that we initially planned for. And we're going to stay flexible. We'll be probably somewhere between $600 million and $800 million in the Permian this year, and it's going to be a function of our results, rig availability and our cash flow.", "Joseph R. Albi", "With regard to guidance, this is Joe Albi, with the rig, any type of rig transfer occurring for the most part, in the second half of the year, our 2012 modeling really didn't change, especially considering Q3, Q4 production as from Cana and the Cana infill project, we're basically in complete mode there where any slowdown in drilling activity would more affect the first part of '13 than '12. And on the other side of the coin, moving those rigs into an area like the Permian, we might be able to realize some oil production in Q4 relatively quick. So when we tinkered with those sensitivities in our modeling, 2012 didn't change much.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I assume, I know you talked about ethane rejection right now in Cana. How long of a period of ethane rejection are you modeling in there?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, that was a topic of conversation between Mark and I, and all we feel comfortable with is just trying to predict about as far as we can see pass our nose. So we only incorporate in what we thought we'd see in Q2, and that was only for the Cana portion.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, if I could switch over briefly, we've seen a lot of attention in the Midland Basin around the emerging plays decline and then the north Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp obviously. What are you seeing -- are you looking at equivalent zones in the Delaware Basin? And what are some of the other horizons that, I guess, you have your eyes on right now?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, yes, this is Tom. Obviously, our Wolfcamp play in the Delaware Basin is the direct equivalent to the Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin. They also pursue a deeper shale, which would be the equivalent of our Penn Shale. We're pursuing that. Midland Basin is different, but it does -- we don't play that. We don't have a big position, although we're studying it pretty hard. I think critical difference is as normally pressured whereas we're overpressured. But we're pretty pleased with our own Wolfcamp so we don't feel a need to race over there and pay top dollar for a big acreage position. We like what we've got at Delaware.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "On this ethane discussion, can you remind us, one, how much ethane do you guys produce specifically out of Cana? And then what percentage of the Cana barrel is ethane?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Brian, this is Joe Albi. Here's how I'd look at it as far as how it translates into guidance. And if Mark wants to chime in, please do, Mark. But what we modeled was an impact of about 5 million to 5.5 million a day worth of volumes on an equivalent basis that we'd see as far as a reduction is concerned. When we look at the specifics of it, in Cana, about 24% of our wet gas stream or produced wellhead gas stream is dry, 76% is processed. We look at a May Mid-Continent price of $1.87. Had we not had ethane rejection, we would have received at the wellhead $2.82 -- excuse me, $2.97 in Mcf. And with rejection, it's $2.82. So it's hitting us to the extent of about $0.15 on a wellhead Mcf. But on the other side of the coin, we have a little bit more residue coming off the back side of the plan. So our residue with rejection is about, for 1,000 Mcf into the plant would yield $8.62 per reservoir volumes versus $8.02 had we not had the rejections. So we see about 7.5% increase in our gas, and I think that may help you translate it into Mcfes, which is how we try to look at in our model. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add anything?", "Mark Burford", "Yes. I guess, we just throw you a question, Brian, of our Cana NGLs in the first quarter produced 6,700 barrels a day of NGLs in Cana. So about all those NGLs, almost nearly half of that barrel is ethane.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right. My point was more on if you look at the NGL realizations in Q1 at about 36%, the volume impact of rejection is one thing. But by the same token, what are you guys thinking then going forward in terms of actual realizations versus WTI for your NGL base?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe again. Mark and I looked at that this morning and, I guess, the best way we'd answer that is based on the one other time that we saw rejection, which was August of 2010. We might say that might move a couple of points. So like 36% to 38% or something like that.", "Mark Burford", "Yes. We have a 34% of WTI in the first quarter, Brian. So yes, if you do your 4% uptick in our realization, WTI is probably reasonable.", "Joseph R. Albi", "And that's a guess, Brian. That's a market in itself.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right, exactly. The -- on the Permian, what -- just on average, can you guys provide kind of that same breakdown of ethane for an NGL barrel?", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Brian, I think roughly the ethane barrel is similar, so half of that's staying there also in 25% propane heavier.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "And then the Wolfcamp's our biggest probably contributor. I think that is half.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last for me. The Permian, I guess, with some down -- some infrastructure downtime recently, it seems like the differentials are widening and maybe they're starting to narrow now. But can you guys comment at sort of the same commentary, I guess, on the NGL realizations going forward, but what should we expect from the Permian on the oil side?", "Joseph R. Albi", "As far as receipt price?", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right. What kind of differentials? I mean, you guys gave some pretty good guidance on expenses, but I'm just looking for more details on the actual realizations side as it relates to crude?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Okay. So for -- as an example, the differential that we were seeing between Midland and Cushing in 2011 was running around $0.50, $0.70. In Q1, we saw that on an average basis increased to $1.48. In April, we're guessing, with the preliminary data that we have, that that's probably somewhere close to $3.85 to $3.90 differential. And in May, probably the high $5, $5.85, $5.90. And June, we target somewhere maybe $5.25. So when you compare Q2 differential to where we saw Q1, we're seeing about a $3.50 difference between Q1, obviously on the lower side, and that represents about 75% of our oil. Now we are seeing the reverse, obviously, with Louisiana with our LRS differential. But unfortunately, it's a smaller percent of our volumes now. So we're seeing about a $6 increase there but that's about 5% of our volumes.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And that -- do you think that's transitory in the second quarter? Meaning as you go third and fourth quarter, the realizations should improve? Or do you think the run rate that's kind of there?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we -- I mean, at some I'd love to hear your thoughts on. But we're hearing the bottlenecking, we're hearing the basin pipeline expansion taken out of the equation. We're hearing that turnaround season's over, that ought to help. And a general line coming on in '13 ought to help. We've got a West Texas Gulf expansion. It should add another 100,000 barrels of takeaway at the end of the year, and then there's always talk about rail. So this is definitely anomaly when you look over time that we've seen something like this. Our hopes, obviously, are that it's not at the end of the second quarter.", "Mark Burford", "And if you were to ask a commodity trader, if you went into the over-the-counter derivatives market to try to swap or hedge something near -- in that case, it says it does return to normal by September or October.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Duane Grubert.", "Duane Grubert - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Can you talk a little about the Gulf Coast reduction in activity? You're still spending about $80 million there. So I'm wondering, have you cut back on your internal personnel that are looking at the Gulf Coast and were truly winding it down? Or is it more that last season's batch of wells weren't so hot and we may still be surprised by a good batch this year?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Brian, this is Tom. That $80 million of plan capital and it'll be -- if it comes to fruition, it'll be back-end loaded to the second half of the year. We're in a rebuilding phase. We've got 3 to 5 new 3D programs that are going to be coming into our shop here between now. The first one hit our shop a few days ago. Between now and middle of fall, we'll have 3 to 5 new programs. And it's a constant rebuilding of the inventory, and this is being -- since 2002, when we first played the Gulf Coast, we get new data, we analyze it, we would look for anomalies, we come up with a prospect inventory and we'd get at it. What you're seeing here is because of some permit delays on some federal level [ph]. We lost about a year of debt cycle. So we have a -- probably at least until Q3, you're going to see a level of activity. No, we have not -- in fact, we're increasing our staffs with a little more horsepower, and we'll look at this Gulf Coast data. And I would expect this to be at temporary level. But that said, as you've heard us say in the past, we have no Gulf Coast inventory. It is always build-it and drill-it type deal. So until we get those data sets interpreted, get them analyzed, we wouldn't be able to say anything definitive about where our upcoming inventory is. That $80 million is our best guess for money we set aside.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no more questions at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Very good. Thank you for everyone for joining us today on the conference call. I look forward to meeting you in person in the next coming conferences in -- over the next quarter.

My name is Tony, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings and Operation Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Burford, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much, Tony, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. Here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller.", "We did issue our financial and operating results and news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosure on the forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for risk factors associated with our business.", "Thank you very much for joining us, and I'll just go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. We had a solid second quarter even with falling commodity prices. As you saw from our release, we reported net income of $64.3 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Our adjusted cash flow from operations this quarter was $240 million, and that's down from $340 million last year.", "Our second quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 590 million cubic feet equivalent per day, that's up slightly from a year ago of 585.7 million cubic feet equivalent. We continue to see strong growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, which, combined, averaged 547.7 million cubic feet per day -- cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 17% over last year. And that includes a 37% increase from Permian Basin oil volumes, which averaged 21,694 barrels of oil per day this quarter. Our total company oil production grew 8% to 28,000, 686,000 -- 28,686 barrels per day. Liquids accounted for 46% of our equivalent volumes and 80% of our 343 million of oil, gas and NGL revenue.", "We saw a decrease in oil, gas and NGL prices this quarter compared to last year, and that didn't surprise anybody. Oil price realizations decreased 12% to $87.81 per barrel. Natural gas prices fell 49%, averaging $2.42 per Mcf. And NGL prices fell $0.36 to average $29.02 per barrel.", "What we can control is going very well. We're seeing excellent results in our Permian drilling program, and our Cana team is doing a fantastic job, making returns in a difficult natural gas and NGL environment.", "And I just want to say to underscore that, for those of you who have seen our production table and our area-by-area break down, we've had a tremendous headwind to overcome this year with our Gulf Coast decline, and we've talked about that, ad infinitum in past calls. And I just want to tell you how deeply proud we are here in the executive team of our organization, that's picked up the pace, and the fact that we've overcome that decline in the Gulf Coast is really a testament to our engine of growth we have in that Permian and Mid-Continent program, both our exploration team, our operations team working together, our marketing team. We've had a lot of very difficult challenges so far this year with plant downtimes, and Joe will get into that in some detail. Our core focus is on execution, being good at the business and working our way through the cycles.  And we're very proud to report the way this organization has responded to the cycle we're in so far this year.", "In the first half of this year, we've drilled 160 gross, 91 net wells, investing $782 million on exploration development. Of our total expenditures, 52% were invested in projects located in the Permian, 44% in the Mid-Continent and 4% in the Gulf Coast and other.", "And now, we'll move on and give a region-by-region summary, and I'll start with the Permian, which of course is our largest area. We drilled and completed 94 gross or 64 net Permian Basin wells during the first 6 months of 2012, completing 95% of those as producers.", "Permian E&D capital for the first half was $409 million or 52% of our total capital. Year-to-date, 2012, in our New Mexico Bone Spring program, we drilled and completed 31 gross, 16 net wells, and we're continuing to see outstanding results in that play. Per well, 30-day gross production from the 2012 Bone Spring wells averaged over 600 barrels equivalent per day, 87% of which was oil. We're drilling some of the best wells we've ever seen.  Not only are we drilling some very nice wells, we're certainly in the process of, I think, demonstrating to people that we've overcome some of the challenges we had in the last year with high water cuts. A lot of these wells are in extensional new areas, and we're very, very pleased with the results we're seeing out of that program.", "Our team has done a great job in this program, maximizing well performance and stepping out in some of these new areas.", "Moving onto the Texas Third Bone Spring. Our Texas Third Bone spring drilling this year has totaled 19 gross and 12 net wells. The per well 30-day gross production rate in this year's wells have averaged 850 barrels equivalent per day, 79% of that being oil. Really nice results out of that program.", "And then finally, in the Permian, I'd like to update you on where we are in our Wolfcamp play. We're continuing to see strong results from our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp shale drilling. And as we've outlined in the past, our Wolfcamp play is focused in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico, we call that our White City program, and Northern Culberson County, Texas, where we have approximately 80,000 net acres. Year-to-date, we have drilled and completed 6 gross or 5.9 net horizontal Wolfcamp wells, bringing our total wells in the play since inception to 24 gross or 22.7 net.", "Our per well first 30-day production from the wells brought on this quarter averaged 6.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 1,120 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That stream out of the Wolfcamp is comprised of 2.6 million cubic feet a day of gas and, of course, I'm quoting the 30-day averages of our first quarter. So the average is 2.6 million cubic feet a day gas, 345 barrels per day of oil and 335 barrels per day of natural gas liquids, or that's 39% gas, 31% oil and 30% NGL.", "We've done a lot of experimenting, both regional and stratigraphically, to see if we can increase that oil yield. I will say that our most recent wells are seeing a fairly significant increase in our oil yield. Our play average is about 55 barrels per million. Our recent wells are coming in at about 70 barrels per million. We're still de-risking our acreage. We've yet to fully define on that play. We're still drilling one well per section, and so there's a lot we don't know about that play.  We don't know the full regional extent. We don't know the yield breakdown once we have our acreage entirely de-risked. We also don't know how many wells per section ultimately this play will generate for us. But what we do know is we're seeing very nice results, we're getting reasonable returns even at today's costs and commodity pricing environment and we're very excited about this play for what it will be for us in 2012, 2013 and as a legacy project for Cimarex.", "Our per well first 30-day production rates in all the wells we've drilled to date, and that's from soup to nuts, short laterals, long laterals, high costs, bad completions, good completions, 30-day average for everything, no holds barred, 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And again, that's comprised of 2.8 million cubic feet equivalent gas, 270 barrels per day of oil and 350 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. So that's 43% gas, 25% oil and 32% natural gas liquids.", "So again, we don't know the scope of this play. We certainly think it has many, many years of drilling potential for us as we de-risk our acreage. And then, we need to ultimately determine our spacing, whether it will be 80-acre spacing, 160-acre spacing or some other number, as yet, we don't know. But certainly, that play has earned a slot in our highlights reel.", "Moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first half of 2012, we drilled and completed 64 gross or 26 net Mid-Continent wells, and our Mid-Continent first half exploration development capital was $345 million or 44% of our total capital. And essentially, all of that activity year-to-date has been in our Cana-Woodford, where we've drilled and completed 60 gross or 25 net wells. At quarter end, there were 57 gross and 24 net Cana wells waiting on completion, and that compares with 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion at year-end 2011.", "So we're building a little bit of a backlog in Cana, and that's purely a function of our infill development program, and that our drilling is outpacing our completion. That increase on waiting on completions as compared to year end is something that will be with us for a while as we're completing these wells. Frac-ing in our infill row started on May 23, flowback of the first well began in late June and first sale started mid-July. So we don't yet have 30 days of a flowback on our infill program.", "So we're now in the manufacturing process in Cana. We have a frac crew working continuously, working their way down the 7-section infill row that we're currently completing and we're completing a frac job every 3 to 4 days. It's a great project. We've put a lot of energy into infrastructure, both from gathering systems, water, water disposal. And I'm sure Joe will talk about that in some detail. And we're still seeing reasonable returns. At current costs and current strip pricing, our returns -- when we quote returns on an infill project, it's an east-west row. All of these infill rows will be east-west, and so east-west in the core Cana goes from a more liquids rich to a drier portion. So the liquids rich has the higher rates return, the drier portion has a lower rates return. And in that row, those rates return vary from 18% to 40% after tax on our drilling dollars, current cost, current pricing.", "So we're still seeing successful rates of return at Cana. It's turning into a manufacturing project. We currently have 7 rigs running in Cana. As we've talked in the past, we're planning on redirecting some of those rigs to some other oilier or Mid-Continent plays that we're testing. We're still in a bit of a state of flux. We moved some of our Cana rigs to the Permian as we redirected our capital. Our current plan, if things unfold as the way we currently see them, is we would ramp down our Cana fleet to 4 rigs and exit the year with 4 rigs, working on that infill row in Cana or additional infill drilling in Cana.", "We also are experimenting with long laterals in Cana. There have been a number of long laterals drilled by the industry in the Cana core. We have a history of -- there are currently 3 laterals by other operators they are currently producing. There's one flowing back, and then there are spattering of others. We have drilled our first long lateral. We are waiting on completion there. We didn't get the entire lateral length down, so we're still -- don't have anything definitive to say in our opinion of the role of long laterals in Cana, but we are experimenting with them.", "Elsewhere in the Mid-Continent, we're quite pleased. We've talked in the past about some emerging plays in the Mid-Continent. We'll be testing some ideas. We've got some ideas that we are in process of testing and in a talk going on in Cleveland. We have some other ideas we haven't talked about and we'll be testing them soon. And hopefully, in the next call or 2, we'll be able to give you some results and what kind of exposure those may have for us going forward.", "In the Gulf Coast, we began prospecting on a new 3D shoot that we recently got off the field. We have some new data in our processing. We're trying to see what kind of inventory we'll build. We don't have a definitive look at that yet, so that will be an update for further calls.", "So just in conclusion, as we look at our results today, where we are, where we're going, it's been a solid first half. We focused on execution. We're very pleased with where we are. We're right on target to deliver the guidance that we've promised. And I just want to reiterate again that we're very proud of the operational and overall performance of our organization as they've had to overcome a fair amount of headwind this year.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you all of you for joining our call today. I'll quickly touch on our second quarter production, hit on our remaining year guidance and then I'll finish up with a few comments on where we see service costs.", "Despite seeing higher pipeline and facility shut-in volumes than we expected, our second quarter average net daily equivalent production came in at 590.1 million a day. That's about as expected and right at the midpoint of our guidance that we issued of 580 million to 680 million a day. As you may recall from our last call, our Q2 guidance incorporated a reduction of approximately 10 million to 12 million a day for what we saw as anticipated Permian and Mid-Continent pipeline and facility shut-ins, as well as the likely ethane rejection during May and June for our processed gas out in Cana.", "When the dust settled after we closed the quarter, our plus or minus 3-million-a-day estimate for the Q2 impact for ethane rejection was right in line, but our facility shut-ins ended up being slightly higher than we anticipated, primarily in the Permian. And as a result, our production was negatively impacted to the tune of 17 million to 19 million a day during the quarter versus the 10 million to 12 million that we have predicted. Nonetheless, we came in right at our midpoint. And when accounting for those shut-ins, we're about flat or possibly even a little bit higher than where we would have been in Q1.", "We continued to set new records in the Permian, although 12 million to 13 million a day of our second quarter shut-ins did happen in the Permian. Our reported net equivalent Permian production of 247 million a day is a new high mark for the region, as is our 28,011 barrels per day of total liquid production.", "As compared to Q1 '12, our second quarter combined Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent production of 547.7 million a day was down slightly, 1%, and this is due to the pipeline and facility shut-ins that I mentioned, the ethane rejection and our planned deferred completion of our Cana infill wells.", "All the while, our Gulf Coast production of 42.4 million a day came in a little bit better than we had expected, down just 6.8 million a day or 14% in Q1.", "But despite the shut-ins, we continued to demonstrate significant year-over-year production growth in the Permian and the Mid-Continent. As we compare ourselves to Q2 '11, our combined Q2 '12 Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent net production was up 80.7 million a day. That's up 17% from Q2 '11, with the Permian up 65 million a day and Cana up 41 million a day, both of which are 36% increases.  And both are directly related to where the focus of our capital has been over the last year.", "Outside of the ethane rejection and larger-than-expected facility shut-ins during the first half of the year, our 2012 production has really been performing quite well, and in essence, hitting our plan. As we mentioned when we first issued our 2012 guidance and we reiterated again last call, the significant portion of our anticipated 2012 production adds were projected to occur in the latter half of this year, And that's driven primarily by our Cana infill well frac schedule. As we mentioned last call, as of March 31, we have 39 gross or 18 net Cana wells waiting on completion. And as Tom mentioned, at June 30, this figure had grown to 57 gross and 24 net wells waiting on completion just in Cana.", "Although we initiated our infill frac operations in late May and in essence completed 6 of those gross wells, 2.4 net, by the end of the quarter, our production adds from these wells were really not anticipated to be seen until the Q3 timeframe.", "So really, nothing has changed in that regard. The only items that have played a significant role in our year-to-date production as compared to our beginning year guidance really have been just the facility shut-ins and the ethane rejection that we've experienced. The impact of these 2 items were more pronounced in Q2 than Q1. But over the first half of the year, they've averaged about 11 million to 13 million a day that didn't show up on the scoreboard.", "So looking forward, our current full year guidance model does incorporate the Q1 and Q2 impact of the shut-ins and ethane rejection. And we also incorporated an estimated 8-million- to 9-million-a-day reduction during Q3 for a projected ethane rejection from Cana during the quarter. With continued anticipated production growth from the Permian and Cana, our modeling continues to support the full year guidance projection we issued last quarter, which was 612 million to 632 million a day, and our Q3 volumes are projected to average 610 million to 640 million a day, a significant jump-up from Q2.", "Our projected third quarter combined Permian and Mid-Continent volumes of 575 million to 590 million a day reflect a continued year-over-year increase in production with an estimated 18% to 21% increase from where we were in Q3 '11. And again, that's simply a direct result of our activity in those 2 areas.", "With our focus on oil and liquids rich gas, we anticipate that we'll close the year with liquids averaging approximately 48% of our 2012 total company production, and that's up from 44% that we reported in 2011.", "And another note I want to point out, as implied by our guidance, we're also projecting a strong exit rate for 2012, which certainly will springboard us into 2013.", "Shifting gears to OpEx. With the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year, LOE has become an even more important focus for our production group. Our immediate focus has been on reducing SWD costs, primarily in the Permian, and to implement measures to reduce workover costs company-wide.", "In conjunction with that, we've put some capital into infrastructure costs that Tom briefly touched on future benefits of those, and our LOE really will never be seen. And that's some of the benefits that we'll get out of putting in our own saltwater disposal facilities, our own trunk lines, our high-pressure and low-pressure gas service for gas lifts, central delivery points, common points of compression, getting out ahead of the infrastructure for power to reduce our power generator costs and so forth and so on.", "So a lot of those will show up down the road. We won't see it yet, but overall, when we look at the lifting cost figure from this point forward, we are anticipating to see future improvements.", "So as a result, our Q2 lifting costs came in at $1.16 per Mcfe. That's down $0.07 or 5.7% from Q1. With our continued focus on cost controls, like I've measured, and as well as the reduction we saw in Q2, we've slightly revised our full year LOE guidance down to $1.15 to $1.30 per Mcfe simply by just lowering the upper end of the range that we issued last quarter.", "Finally, on the service cost side, we've seen the majority of service costs, such as rigs, mud, directional, cementing, bids, et cetera, stay fairly flat over the quarter. And for that matter, over the last few quarters, as far as the rig market is concerned, 1,500 horsepower top drives continue to appear to be in demand, but we see the market showing some signs of softening.", "A rig may become available and may be available for a short while, and then it gets picked up, but it's not as tight as we saw the market a quarter ago.", "In Cana, we continue to see the benefits of our program drilling efficiencies with the average days to TD for our Cana core wells now running about 40 days as compared to 50 days in 2011 and the 64 days we saw when we first began the program in 2007 and 2008. And that's a real testimony to the improvements we've been able to make where the efficiencies are associated with program drilling.", "Despite slightly larger fracs, our current Cana core AFEs are running about $7.5 million. That's down about $100,000 from the number we gave you last quarter and it's at or below the levels that we saw over a year ago.", "With our infill efficiencies that we're just starting to see, we're projecting that some of our recent faster drilled Cana infill wells may come in well below $7 million once we've finished our completion work.", "So we're seeing tremendous improvements through efficiencies in Cana. As far as the Permian is concerned, although availability for nearly all tools, services and equipment can be a challenge and require a good planning. Really outside of trucking for heavy equipment, we haven't noted any significant changes in cost components. And as such, our Permian well costs remain relatively unchanged from last quarter.", "Our 8,000- and 9,000-foot TVD Second Bone Spring New Mexico well with a 4,700-foot lateral are still running around $5.8 million to $6.5 million. That's flat with our Q1 estimates. And as we've talked about before, as TVDs approach 11,000 feet going deeper into the basin, that generic well will run closer to $6.8 million to $7.1 million.", "Our generic West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs are running about $7.5 million to $8 million. That's down $1 million to $1.5 million from where we were at the end of last year and the beginning part of this year due primarily to the program efficiencies we mentioned and also our completion design changes that we've made in that program by going to cemented liners, fewer stages and using white sand in our completions.", "In our current Wolfcamp, AFEs continue to come in around $8 million to $8.5 million. That's right on track with the estimates that we provided last call.", "So in summary, we had another good quarter. Our Q2 production came in as planned. Our full year guidance remains unchanged and our Q2 LOE reduction is certainly headed in the right direction, with our drilling and completion costs remaining in check. So as we move in to the second half of the year, our teams simply will just keep their focus on maximizing production and improving our LOE and well costs where we can.", "So with that, I think now I turn the call back over to the operator for any questions that you all may have.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's right.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brian Lively.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to start just by clarifying the ethane commentary. I'm not sure if I missed this, but for your Q3 guidance, how much ethane have you backed out for potential curtailment there?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Brian, this is Joe Albi. The modeling that we're using is approximating about an average of 8 million a day of a reduction for specifically ethane rejection. And the only place we're seeing it is at our Cana processed gas that is tied to a Conway price.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's understandable. On the Permian side, I think you guys have given 600,000-barrel recoveries for the New Mexico Bone Spring and something like 730,000 for the Third Bone Spring. Can you update, based on the new well data, what you're seeing from an EUR standpoint and maybe add some commentary on the Wolfcamp?", "Mark Burford", "Brian, you're right. We have given those numbers in the investor presentation. Those numbers are reflecting some of the wells in the second quarter, and we are incorporating some of those, Brian. So I don't think our averages will change materially from what we have described in those averages there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Brian, this is Tom. We are you seeing an increase on our EURs in both plays based on, I think, better geological targeting, better stratigraphic targeting and better completions. So our recent wells, depends on the average, I'm looking at a table here, that's in our investor material. But if you look at our average from 2009 to the third quarter 2011, in the Second Bone Spring, we've increased our average 50%. I mean, we're currently at a tight curve that's 600 or better Mboe in the Second Bone Spring. And then, likewise, if you look at a period of time from 2006 to the third quarter of 2011 and you compare that with the third quarter 2011 to current, we've had a 60% increase on our Third Bone Spring EURs. And there's a fair amount of variance in those EURs, as you know. But we're certainly seeing, I would say, 700 to 800 Mboe in the Third Bone Spring play per well.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And then I think that you guys had some commentary in the past about possibly targeting some of the oilier Avalon intervals. Can you provide an update on that? I mean, have you all tested any of those wells yet?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. We've drilled a few Avalon wells. We brought a few Avalon wells online this year in Southern Lea County, and they're okay wells. I mean, we're not talking about specific wells there. We have a great exposure to the Avalon play, but we currently don't see us competing for capital with some of our other opportunities. We have a fairly tremendous inventory of Avalon opportunities. Again, we know probably less about it than some of the experienced operators, but we have some pretty good exposure. We just don't model it right now competing with capital with some of our other opportunities.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Ryan Todd.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. On the -- as you ramp down to a 4-rig run rate in Cana, which I'm assuming is that 4 rigs and 1 frac crew on your infill pads, what's the right way to think about the run rate on CapEx of that level in Cana?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "This is Tom. We're -- right now, of course, Cana is not just Cimarex. And so with 4 rigs, there's a pretty good chance that we may have as much or more non-op capital as we do operating capital. Right now, we're carrying as a placeholder for 2013. If we exit with 4 rigs and we stay with 4 rigs, it looks like we'll be at about $350 million for Cana. It could be as low as $250 million, so I'd give you a range of $250 million to $350 million. And the swing there is how much outside operating capital we're exposed to. We certainly like what we're seeing at Cana, so we're staying in everything. And we're not setting in stone that we'll be exiting with 4 rigs. It's just what we're looking at as we look to the remainder of 2012 going into 2013. I think you can expect us to be much closer to cash flow next year than we have been this year. This year, we spread a little to really, quite frankly, overcome that Gulf Coast headwind, which was a decline both in gas and oil production. One of those Gulf Coast wells were pretty oily. So we're in an outspend situation this year to try to catch that, and we've done a nice job. And so next year, we're still putting our plans together. But if we go with that 4-rig program in Cana, the direct answer to your question is we we'd be between $250 million and $350 million bold net exposure, and that swing is on outside operated.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate that clarity. I mean, is it right to think of it, from a completion level, the fact you alluded to completion program that you started in late May will continue at a fairly steady pace for the 12 months following that through...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, so we will be completing wells through May of 2013 on our current infill program, completing continuously.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just broadly, if we look at the Permian, you obviously have --  I mean, you've spoken and given some good color in terms of downtime that you had in some of the facilities in the Permian in the quarter. More broadly on your infrastructure in the Permian Basin, what are you seeing right now across your areas on infrastructure? Potential bottlenecks or sources of concern over the next 18 months?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, this is Joe. We do have concerns about takeaway issues and it's not so much the immediate capacity or processing availability of that. As much as there's NGL takeaway capacity, we're aware of the certain infrastructure that's contemplated by the industry to remedy that. But that's like 2013 and into '14, and then downstream of that, you've got the petrochem side of it. So we can't control any of that. What we can do is what we have been doing, and that is to put in our own infrastructure, process our own gas if we have to at the same time that we're working with other processors out there to try to firm up capacity where we can. That's kind of a vague answer, but the bottom line is there is short-term capacity that we see. The disruptions that we have seen have not necessarily been due to us not having a market as much as it has been due to the patchwork on the processors and gather site to increase capacity where they can.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Mario Barraza.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Just want to dig a little deeper on the Wolfcamp shale wells on the Delaware Basin. I know you've only drilled a few, but the oil cut looks to be significantly higher. Do you have any idea on what percentage of your acreage here might be perspective for this higher oil cut?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, this is Tom. We haven't de-risked enough our acreage to say. I mean, one of the things we do know is, in general, it's getting oilier as we go to the east on our acreage, and yet there are some other factors in the play there. I wouldn't just simply say east is good. East is also a little deeper, maybe a little higher water. So there's a lot of factors in play. I don't have, and I would -- I don't have an answer to your question on how many -- our perspective for high oil cut. But I will say with all the wells we've drilled, our average has been about 55 barrels per million. So we're seeing good oil cuts throughout much of the play. And then there are a lot of things we're experimenting with. This is a section that's 600- to 800-feet thick, so oil cut varies east to west, but it also varies with depth. It varies with stratigraphy, and we're playing around with that. And I will say some of our higher oil cuts are functions of, I think, some real creative success our teams have with addressing those questions. But how it's going to average out to all of our acreage, it would be foolish for me to try to even answer that question, and we're too early to know.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And then on the cost side, I appreciate all the color you guys gave. I guess, where do you think in the Delaware Basin kind of on the Wolfcamp where you -- I know we're early here, where ultimately would you like to get your well costs to?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Again, this is Tom. We're very optimistic on the cost side, and our drilling completion group has really been focusing on that lately. Some of the lessons, learnings from Cana where we replicate the same wells over and over. It's all about efficiency, running new ideas, sharing information on any advance. A lot of our learnings in Cana, we're directly applying to the Wolfcamp. We've put that infrastructure in place. We're ready to roll to drill the same type of well over and over. And that when we give our operations group that opportunity, every time they'd have that opportunity, they've shined. And I'm very optimistic. One of the things we have seen over the last quarter is our well costs are holding flat and in the Permian, that's a wonderful thing to say. They had been increasing, creeping up over time. So to answer where do I want them to be, we're currently at, a, in some change on the Wolfcamp. I would certainly look for a 10% or better reduction on that. Joe, you're going to want to be the one to make that happen, what's your answer?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, I certainly agree with what Tom is saying, and I think the best model is Cana by itself. When we started that project in 2007, 2008, when they really kicked it off, we have data that we prepared back then saying, \"Hey, here's this program, 4 years from now, where do we think it can be from just a drill-time standpoint?\" And we had projected that we could get our time to TD down by 60% or 40% to 60% of the days that it was taken. [indiscernible] numbers there that basically did just that. So 4 years later, we were successful in reducing our drilling time by 40%. That alone, on the drilling cost side, gives you an idea, a ballpark of the cost reduction, I guess, that could come out of that, especially when you take our total well costs and you say about half of them are on the completion side. So maybe 40% of the drilling cost side will get you right about to the number Tom's talking about.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "If you look at it, and we're seeing these improvements now, they're showing up in performance first, and then from that will come costs. Same thing we saw on Cana. In Cana, we saw tremendous improvements with our days drilling, and those improvements lead cost improvements. But if you look at our Wolfcamp drilling from inception to date and you line up our wells, you had a 40% reduction in drilling days. So we're absolutely moving in the right direction. I think, as Joe has talked, this infrastructure we put in, in the Culberson County has been exactly the right move for us. We have a nice consolidated asset and we are well positioned to do what our operations group does well. And then you give them something that's repeatable, concentrated and let it rip. And I really do expect these costs to show great improvement over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Cameron Horwitz.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Can you just remind me how much acreage do you have in Reeves County? And do you guys have any plans to drill any Wolfcamp test here over the next year or so?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We do have a fair amount of acreage in Reeves County, I don't know the answer.", "Mark Burford", "Cameron, this is Mark. I think we talked about Third Bone Spring acreage, which is a lot of it being at Reeves County. It's about 35,000 net acres in the Third Bone Spring position we have there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We also have some acreage aside from that that's in more of the Wolfcamp Fairway, and we're talking about that now. There are some drilling by others out there that we don't have to always do the first tear [ph] on the campaign. So there's a fair amount of activity out there that hopefully we'll be able to leverage. But we have drilled some initial wells, kind of in the Central Reeves County that produced a little more water than we were expecting. And again, this is a fixed section, so there's a lot of variables that you can fix that. And so that's a long winded way to say I don't have any acreage and what we're going to do with it. But we do have a position in Reeves County.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "No, that works.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We're focused on Culberson, but I will say that just, parenthetically, we have a lot of opportunity. We talked about moving this organization to cash flow, that's going to be a bit of a shock to a lot of our teams because we have a lot of opportunity. And so one of the things that I'm asking you to one of our operating groups to present is what's your minimum capital, the whole acreage and not let things we like expire. And so they've been sending me that list as we look at the years ahead. And that was the first thing Permian said. And some of this Central Reeves acreage, it may change because we may want to get out there and drill it and save it and then they may look really good to us. So it really is a debated point here that's influx.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And also staying on the Wolfcamp, is the longest lateral you drilled that 4,500-foot or if you guys tried some longer laterals there yet?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We've not tried a 2-section lateral. I think our actual longest lateral is a little longer than that because those are big sections. Those are not 640-acre sections. They're -- I forget how many acres they are. I don't think they're quite 700, but they're larger sections so you can get a little longer lateral. We've not yet drilled a multi-section lateral. We have a couple of them on the books. I think we'll probably get 1 or 2 done this year. And right now, they look expensive, but they also look like they may be exactly what this play needs.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Sure. So there's no reason why you couldn't extend those in terms of looking at -- I guess in the Bone Spring, you got some geologic risk when you extend. But here, you could see this going up to maybe 8,000-foot laterals?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We could. It becomes a land challenge at that point. You certainly have to control enough of the adjacent sections to make that worth a headache, but that's absolutely on our shortlist of play development ideas.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just last one for me, jumping on the Bone Spring. I mean, you said in the past, you guys have been pretty aggressive or at least trying to be aggressive in terms of adding to your position. How do you think your inventory trends from here? I mean, can we expect any kind of upgrade to that 200-plus locations that you guys have been put out there over the next year or so?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, again, this is Tom. Of course, we've had that number for about 5 years running. We continue to recharge. I will say, it's getting extremely competitive land-wise. At the most recent federal sale, we had a block or 2 where we thought -- we really like them and we thought we were putting extremely aggressive bids on, which we were, and we were not the high bidder. People are paying prices for this acreage, and I would consider everything goes well money. If everything goes well, you get exactly the model that you're predicting, which is a fairly aggressive model. You have no operational issues, no cost overruns, no production delays. If everything goes well, you'd get a reasonable return. But that's a very difficult bill to foot for us because we've got enough experience in the business to know you'd better offer a little windage [ph] if you're looking for a return on your investment. Not everything goes well. So we have a lot of ways to acquire acreage in that trend. We have a very aggressive team in Midland that is a great set of dealmakers. They do section-by-section deals. Part of that land is controlled by people that don't have the stomach for a deep horizontal well. They may control the land because of shallow production and they're amenable to a conversation about market. So we're continuing to work it. We're continuing to add opportunity. Will we have a material change in our 200- to 300-well inventory? I can't promise that. All I can say is that we get up every morning and work on it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There seemed to be no further questions at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Great. Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate the team for joining us, and maybe Tom and I can see you down in Houston at the Tudor, Pickering Conference or Paul might see you in New York at the Tuohy Brothers Conference next week.

And for those of you on the East Coast affected by super storm Sandy, we sincerely hope things get back to normal for you, and that we really appreciate you also taking the time to join us today.", "Here, in Denver on today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; Bill [indiscernible], Vice President of Exploration and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller.", "We did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "So with that, I'll go ahead and just turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. I do want to echo Mark's remarks for those of you living on the East Coast, certainly, our hearts go out to you with everything you're fighting and appreciate you joining us this morning.", "We had a solid third quarter, reporting net income of $84.3 million or $0.97 per diluted share. Our adjusted cash flow from operations this quarter was $291 million, down from $357 million last year third quarter, but up from the $240 million in the second quarter of this year. And as those of you that have read our release, this release is all about execution.", "We're pleased, very pleased with our organization, with the way it's developing the promised results. We have a number of very exciting things going on. But just as a preamble, we're very pleased and proud to deliver the results we promised, and we think that will be an ongoing story from Cimarex.", "Our third quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 635 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's up 7% from year ago of 592 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And it's up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We're seeing strong growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, which had a combined average 599 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that's 18% over last year.", "That growth includes a 42% increase in our Permian Basin oil volumes, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil per day this quarter, so very, very nice Permian and Mid-Continent results.", "Our total company oil production grew 23% to 32,456 barrels per day. Liquids accounted for 49% of our equivalent volumes and 79% of our $397 million of oil, gas and NGL revenue.  So we're seeing an increasing liquids component to our overall production stream.", "Gas prices were lower this quarter compared to last year. Realized gas prices averaged $2.79 per Mcf this quarter, and that's 39% lower as compared to the third quarter 2011 price of $4.57 per Mcf. sequentially, for the second quarter, gas price improved by 15% from second quarter 2000 [sic](2012) price of $2.42 per Mcf. We've all been encouraged and heartened by the recent uptick in natural gas prices.", "Realized natural gas liquids prices were flat Q2 to Q3 at $28.29 per barrel but were down 34% as compared to the third quarter of 2011 price of $43.11 per barrel. And realized oil prices were flat, around $87 to $88 per barrel from this quarter, last year third quarter and the second quarter.", "In the first 9 months of this year, we've drilled 253 gross, 138 net wells, investing $1.2 billion on exploration and development. Of total expenditures, 52% were invested in projects in the Permian Basin, 44% in the Mid-Continent and 4% in the Gulf Coast and other.", "Now, I'd like to give you a region-by-region breakdown. Of course, our regions are the Mid-Continent, which would be Cana, Woodford Shale, Gulf Coast and Permian Basin. And I'll start with the Mid-Continent and save Permian Basin for last.", "So moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first 9 months of 2012, we drilled and completed 119 gross and 49 net Mid-Continent wells. Our year-to-date Mid-Continent exploration development capital has totaled $530 million or about 44% of our total exploration development capital.", "Most of this year's Mid-Continent drilling activities has been in the Cana-Woodford shale play. Year-to-date, we've drilled and completed 113 gross or 47 net Cana wells. At quarter end, we had 54 gross, 24 net Cana wells waiting on completion. This compares with a total of 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion at year end 2011.  So the increase in wells awaiting completion is the result of commencing our infill development drilling in 2012.", "Our operated Cana drilling infill has been along 7 east-west sections or along 7 miles in the core. Along this 7 section row, our infill drilling and completion activity has been progressing from the Eastern, liquids-rich side towards the West, drier side. We started our frac-ing on May 23. Our flowback began in late June and the first sales were in mid-July.", "Our overall production volumes have exceeded our risk wedge and we're on target. We are always fascinated by Cana. Cana continues to be one of our most detailed science projects. We continually analyze the data. We're looking to see how we can optimize it and try to explain and improve.", "One of the things I will say that we've seen this year, year-to-date is some of our early flowback wells are below our type curve. And that's been something we've been working on diligently. Overall, we've been exceeding our risk guidance and our risk production wedge, where we think we can do it a little better.", "Our infill wells have flowed back at a little lower rate, but they're delivering higher oil yields and flatter decline. So we've been digging into that problem. We think we have it solved. We've tweaked our completions. We think we can actually remediate and improve our existing wells. But as always, just when you think you're in a production mode, you'd still have a lot of science to do. So Cana continues to be a great project. It's delivered our promised volumes and we're very optimistic going forward.", "We've been talking about bringing our Cana rig count possibly to 0. We're tempering that, we're going to exit the year with 4 operated rigs in Cana. We're still seeing very good returns in Cana. We're seeing our cost come down, and we'd like to keep those 4 rigs running and that would give us a little optionality to gas prices.", "We'd like to get into the winter. And before we drop our Cana fleet, just see how gas prices stabilize. So we'll exit the year and be at least into early February with 4 operated rigs in Cana.", "And now the Mid-Continent, we've got a couple of rigs working in some oilier Anadarko Basin targets. They're new concepts that we're testing. And we're hopeful these could be, all these and even say significant incremental investments for 2013 if they work out as planned, but it's too early to discuss any of those results.", "Moving on to the Gulf Coast. In the Gulf Coast, we began prospecting on some recently shot 3D, so now we have some new data, we're back to prospecting. We're currently building our inventory. We don't have any granularity to discuss on that. We'll have a definitive look soon, but we expect to be drilling some of our new prospects in 2013.", "Moving on to the Permian. At Permian, the Permian, we drilled and completed 131 gross or 88 net Permian wells during the first 9 months of 2012. We completed 96% of those as producers. At quarter end, we had 18 gross or 11 net wells waiting on completion, and our year-to-date Permian exploration development capital has totaled $631 million or 52% of our total exploration development capital.", "Very, very active Permian program and our team, both exploration and operations, marketing, they're working together, firing in all cylinders and really getting after it, very proud of the results we're posting in the Permian. Our most active Permian drilling program is our New Mexico second Bone Spring horizontal oil play. This year, we've drilled and completed 48 gross, 24 net New Mexico Bone Spring wells, and we're continuing to see excellent, excellent results in this program.", "The per well 30-day gross production for the New Mexico Bone Spring wells drilled this year has averaged over 630 barrels equivalent per day. That's 30-day average, and of that, 86% is oil. The team has done a great job in this program maximizing well performance, stepping out into new areas and I'll add, also being opportunistic in capturing additional opportunity.", "Moving on to the Texas Third Bone Spring, we drilled this year 28 gross, 18 net wells so far. We're in an outstanding area, bringing on really strong wells. The wells we've drilled this year have had per well 30-day average production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels equivalent per day, 80% of which is oil. And that was our 30-day average, it's not instantaneous rates. A couple of our wells had 30-day rates in excess of 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is a great program, and our team is doing a great job.", "Finally, in the Permian, I'd like to discuss and give you a little update on our Wolfcamp program in the Delaware Basin. We're seeing very solid results from our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp drilling. We've primarily focused our drilling in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico and Northern Culberson County. We have increased our leasehold in this area, something we haven't discussed before. We had the opportunity to pick up an additional 28,000 acres in the heart of our play. That was a $21 million purchase. And that brought our overall position to over 100,000 net acres in the area we're currently developing.", "Now we have an additional 32,000 acres that could be extensional. There've been some additional activity in Reeves County that sets us up. We're testing the Wolfcamp and the Reeves County, and that would be directly additive to that position.  So we're very, very bullish on this play and when they're finished, I think you'll see why.", "This year, we've drilled and completed 11 gross, 10 net Horizontal Wolfcamp wells, bringing our total wells in the play to 29 gross, 27 net wells. So very high working interest. Our per-well first 30-day production rates on all wells drilled to date have averaged 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The equivalent production is comprised of 2.8 million cubic feet a day of gas, 275 barrels per day of oil and 330 barrels per day of NGLs. So assuming full NGL recovery, that's 43% gas, 26% oil, 31% natural gas liquids.", "So this play certainly is susceptible to all 3 of our commodity pricing, gas, oil and natural gas liquids. But at current strip pricing, we're seeing very, very nice returns in this play. We're also seeing our costs come down. We've talked about wells costing $8 million to $8.5 million. Our most recent costs there are $7.6 million and moving downward.", "We're very excited to be adding this additional acreage to our position, not only as the Wolfcamp perspective, but our current viewpoint in this position is that it more than likely will become a multi-pay zone, multiple objections, like so much of the Delaware Basin.", "But first, starting with the Wolfcamp and I'll move on to other potential, of our 100,000 acres, if we said 80,000 of it would be developed for the Wolfcamp and we think based on our current viewpoint, that's a reasonable statement. At 160 acres per location, at $7.6 million a well, that project would generate, just the Wolfcamp, $3.8 billion of future investment potential, net to Cimarex.", "If we were to go to 80-acre spacing in the Wolfcamp, and although we haven't tested it yet, we're early time. We don't have a pilot project yet, I think most of us would be surprised if it weren't 80-acre development, that would be $7.6 billion net to Cimarex of future development.", "And then we add to that other locations. The Second Bone Spring is prospective over much of that acreage. We've recently had some offset wells being drilled in the Second Bone Spring that had very, very nice first 30-day oil rates. We're completing our first Second Bone Spring well here imminently, in fact, we'll be on it Monday. We have a second drilling with encouraging results. And based on shows in some offset wells, we're very optimistic. Our current position, we'd have at least 125 Second Bone Spring wells. And on top of that, we have the Delaware, a third zone that's yet to be tested. It does produce in the area, and we've had excellent shows.", "So we like Culberson County. It's a nice add to our Permian program. It has capital investment in and of itself, sufficient to keep our Permian program alive at our current rate for many years to come.  So we're very encouraged by that.", "Overall, I'd just finish the Permian by saying our Permian program is doing very well. I think that was obvious from the numbers we posted this morning. We have a huge inventory in future drilling and an extremely talented exploration and operations team. And that last point is really the main one. Our program is homegrown. We didn't buy it, we generated it and built it. And our team is the one that makes that happen, and we're very, very proud of what they've been doing.", "So in conclusion, as we look at our results to date, it's been a solid year so far. We're focused on execution. We're on track to deliver the guidance we promised. And I want to reiterate that we're proud of the operation and overall performance of our organization.", "We're still pouring over our 2013 plans. We don't have any particular detail yet. I will say that we're opportunity rich. We have some great projects, with good returns. In 2011, we invested $1.58 billion. This year, we expect our capital to be similar, at about $1.6 billion. Both years we're a fair bit ahead of our cash flow. Last year, in 2011, most of the shortfall was funded by the Riley Ridge property sale. This year, we funded most of the shortfall with debt, which has increased $400 million to $500 million. That certainly hasn't impaired our balance sheet. We've put that capital to use on great array of return projects. And we think it served our shareholders.", "For 2013, we're planning on decreasing the amount of capital funded by debt. I would expect that we would limit our borrowings next year to no more than $100 million to $200 million. We're looking and discussing the potential sale of some noncore mature long lived oil production in areas that we're not currently investing and which we don't see drilling and exploration upside.", "This wouldn't be a material amount of production. Again it's, at this point, conversational. Probably something less than 3,000 barrels a day. But we can put those proceeds to work on a drilling program, chasing much stronger returns.", "So very nice quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all of you for joining our call today, especially those of you, as both Tom and Mark mentioned, back East and the situation back there.", "I'll be touching on our third quarter production, update you on our fourth quarter guidance projections and then follow-up with a few words on our operating and service costs.", "Starting with our Q3 production, our third quarter volumes came in, as stated in our press release, at 635.1 million a day. That's above the midpoint of our guidance of 610 million to 640 million a day, up 7% from our Q3 '11 average of 592 million a day. And it set for us a new high mark as far as equivalent production for the company.", "The big driver to our growth was our increased oil production, which grew 23% over Q3 '11 to a record 32,456 barrels per day. As compared to Q2, during Q3, we saw less downtime associated with plant facility shut-ins or maintenance, as we had in the previous 2 quarters. During Q3, we saw approximately 4 million to 6 million a day of downtime versus the 14 million to 16 million a day that we saw in Q2. We did see some ethane rejection, particularly in Cana during July and August, which impacted our Q3 volumes by approximately 4 million a day for the quarter.", "But beginning in September, we saw the ethane recovery pick back up, and given current market conditions, we do not anticipate further ethane rejection for the remainder of the year.", "This was a quarter of records for us. With us setting 19 new internal benchmark records. At the total company level, we set new high marks for equivalent, oil, NGL and total liquid production. In both Cana and the Mid-Continent, we set record marks for all product categories, gas, oil, NGL, total liquids and equivalent volumes. And in the Permian, we set new high marks for all production categories but gas. And when the dust settled, our total company Q3 liquid production mix came in at a record of 49% liquids.  All of this pointing towards a strong evidence of our focus on an oil and liquids rich gas activities in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent.", "If we dig a little bit deeper into the details, our Q3 '12 Permian net equivalent volume of 274 million a day was up 11% or 27 million a day from Q2 '12. And 33% or 68 million a day from Q3 '11. Oil growth was the real driver here, with our Q3 Permian oil coming in at, as Tom mentioned, 25,000 barrels of oil per day. That's up 15% from Q2 and a very healthy 42% from Q3 of last year.", "We're drilling some excellent wells in the Permian, and it's showing up in our numbers, with strong production adds from our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring wells, as well as our Wolfcamp program.", "In the Mid-Continent, our record equivalent volume this quarter of 324 million a day was up 8% from last quarter and 7% from Q3 '11. Our Cana program continues to drive the increases that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent. With third quarter equivalent volumes averaging 184 million a day, we were up 28 million a day from last quarter and a very attractive 45 million a day from Q3 '11.", "In a nutshell, our Q3 production tied very closely to our model, with volumes ramping as we had projected in the second half of the year as a result of strong production adds from both the Permian and the Mid-Continent.", "As we look forward, with anticipated continued strong production growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, our model is now projecting Q4 for us to see average net daily equivalent volumes in the range of 652 million to 677 million a day. That's up 8% to 13% from Q4 '11 volumes and projects into a record exit rate for the company.", "With this projection, our resulting 4-year 2012 production guidance equated to 620 million to 626 million a day, gave us a midpoint of 623 million a day, which if you recall last quarter's full year guidance of 622 million. We're now looking at slightly higher midpoint, up 1 million a day from last quarter's guidance.", "At a midpoint of 623 million a day, we'd fall in the 5% to 6% production growth range over our 2011 volumes.", "Shifting gears over to OpEx, with the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year as we've talked about in previous calls, LOE has been an important focus for not only our production group, but our drilling and exploration teams as well.", "As we've mentioned in our previous calls, our primary focus has been in reducing the saltwater disposal cost, particularly in the Permian, as well as to implement measures to control our workover costs companywide. Well, with our cost control efforts showing up on the books, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $1.07 per Mcfe. That's down $0.09 or 7.8% from Q2, and it's a $0.07 lower lifting cost than we had in Q3 '11.", "We'll continue our focus on LOE, and as such, as we look forward into Q4 with our projected volumes, we have been able to revise our full year LOE guidance downward to the range of $1.11 to $1.16. We're very proud of the progress that our production exploration drilling, the permitting teams have done and with regard to saltwater disposal costs, they've certainly made a big impact in our net income statement.", "On the service cost side, in general, we're seeing most drilling-related costs be staying somewhat flat. But we are starting to see some evidence of a slightly softening market. As far as rigs are concerned, 1,500 horsepower top drives are still in demand but some recently quoted day rates for new rigs have reflected up to a 5% drop from the rates that we've seen in prior quarters.", "Our completion costs are seeing a similar type of market, especially in the Permian, where improved pump time efficiencies and competition amongst various vendors have helped to reduce our frac-related service costs.", "In Cana, our improved drilling efficiencies continue to benefit the program. Our current Cana core AFE of $7.4 million is down $100,000 from the number we quoted last quarter, $200,000 from the quarter prior and $600,000 from where we began the year.", "In the Permian, second and third Bone Spring programs, our drilling and completion costs are again staying fairly flat. Depending on debt, our 8,500 to 11,000-foot TVD second Bone Spring wells with 4,000-foot laterals, continue to run in the $6.5 million to $7.1 million range, while our 11,500-foot TVD West Texas Third Bone Spring wells with similar length laterals our AFEing in the $7.5 million range.", "In the Third Bone Spring program, as you may recall, we're down about $500,000 on our AFEs from where we began the year. In our Wolfcamp program, our current completed well AFEs are now running closer to $7.5 million to $7.7 million, as Tom alluded to. We're proud of getting that number down from the $8 million to $8.5 million level we quoted last call  and it's basically as a result of improvements in both drilling efficiencies and design.", "In addition to our gained operational efficiencies, just as an example, we now have 1 rig in Culberson running on dual fuel, burning both natural gas and diesel, and we'll soon be taking that number up to 2. Each rig will therefore, equate to about $60,000 per well in reduced fuel costs with the implementation of that system.", "So in summary, we had another good quarter. Our Q3 production came in a bit better than planned, setting numerous records along the way. Our projection for Q4 results in a slightly higher projection for Q2 -- or for 2012 production than our last estimate. Our efforts to reduce LOE are reflected in a significantly reduced lifting cost. And with service costs flat, we're making good strides to further reduce our overall drilling and completion costs.", "With that, I think I'll turn the call over to questions. Paul had thought most of the material he'd be talking about would be included in the discussions we've already had. So we'd turn the call over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Mario Barraza, Tuohy Brothers. Could you guys just talk a little bit more about looking ahead to '13? What are you really looking for in the next few months on the Cana side, where you're thinking of holding the rig count firm at 4 rigs? What kind of gas price are you thinking about to keep it at 4 rigs or what else would you like to see if you were to pull back further?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Mario, this is Tom. What we're looking for right now is a little bit of flexibility. I will say that we're very pleased with where Cimarex is in terms of an asset mix. We're seeing, as always, a fair amount of volatility in the commodity, and we're not sure where it's going to go. There are reasonable viewpoints out there that, with a little bit of winter, we could see significant strengthening in gas prices, and of course oil is anybody's guess. So we like having that flexibility. We have projects in Cana that are generating very nice returns. In fact, I will say the section that those 4 rigs are moving to generates returns in the mid-30s, after-tax at current costs and current commodity pricing. So those are acceptable to us. They're good rigs, they are performing rigs, and it gives us a little optionality to get into the winter and see what gas prices are before we laid our rig fleet down. So what we're looking for, first and foremost, are returns, but our decision to keep the 4 rigs running at least through, I would say, late January, early February, is to give us a little flexibility so that we wouldn't stop, start and be herky-jerky with that program.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And Cana, you'd hinted that or you'd said that some of the Cana wells were tracking a little below your type curve. What did you encounter with the first batch of wells and how have you tweaked your drilling and completion techniques to get an improvement in the production rates there?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, they're completion techniques, not drilling techniques. They are underperforming our type curve. We've been studying it. We think we have the answer and we are implementing them now in some wells we complete. So we'll have some more detail in the next few weeks as to whether that is indeed the case. We're remediating some of our existing wells. It's still in the throes of technical discussions and I don't want to get too granular on particular details and what we're doing, but we have made some adjustments. And we think we have the problem fixed but the proof will be in the flowback.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions for me. In terms of the Cana, could you talk a little bit about the, I guess, the returns that you're currently looking at in the Cana versus your Wolfcamp wells? And how you think about that capital allocation? So as you're running these 4 flex rigs in the Cana, how did that compete for capital against your Wolfcamp position heading into 2013?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Matt, this is Tom. I will say that the projects that we're moving those 4 rigs on are competing heads-up. They're nice fairly liquids rich and compete nicely with the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp we're seeing currently, we're in a little bit of a depressed oil and natural gas liquids, but still we're seeing roughly a 30% after-tax on that Wolfcamp well. And we've got a fair amount of upside there as our drilling costs come down, and our results continue to be high-graded. But also in that Culberson County, we do have a lease exploration issue that we're managing through. It's not severe, but we like it enough that we're going to hold every acre that we control there with very few exceptions. So Culberson's going to see a fair amount -- we'll probably have 2 rigs running. We may go to more but no fewer than 2 to 3 rigs running continuously on that play through 2013. So my short answer -- actually, that's a long answer. But that section that we're putting those 4 rigs on competes heads-up. But for the rest of Cana, it's held by production. I think if we don't see any relief in some of our product pricing, we're more likely to slow down further in Cana, possibly, and going to 0  operated rigs.", "Paul Korus", "It's Paul. But we'll also have a significant non-operating expenditure next year in Cana.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes.", "Paul Korus", "Production adds.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. No, we'll have a very active program Cana next year. The situation, and we've described this in the past, there are a lot of operators working in Cana now and we have a significant exposure to non-operated interest. So that gives us -- it's good news, bad news. The good news is we'll still have a significant Cana position and we'll have the opportunity to move our swing capital to Permian.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then I guess, just in regards to the second and third Bone Springs, as we think about your rig count there, as we head into 2013, can you talk a little bit about your inventory visibility and kind of should we think about that as a relatively flat program or could that potentially accelerate further?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We haven't forward [ph] our 2013 plans or at least, they haven't gelled. I will tell you that I would expect our second and third Bone Spring programs to be roughly comparable to what we did this year. And so that -- just those 2 programs alone would probably be somewhere in the $450 million to $650 million of drilling, and that's about flat to what we did this year. But again, we're still working through our 2013 capital plans.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just a last question for me, in terms of the Cana itself, just wanted to -- if we could get an idea of kind of where the backlog on the uncompleted wells will be at year end? And how you guys are thinking about just working down that backlog over time?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. Our current frac schedule, we're looking at both us, as well as operator and then and then as a non operator. But right now, we're looking at ending the year, getting into 2013 with a total of 21 net wells that would still be in need of frac, and 18 of those would be our operated wells and then 5 non op and again that's a projection based on an ever moving frac schedule. But as of the end of this quarter, to just give you an idea as of September 30, we still had 28 Cana net wells waiting on frac, and that number is not moving down a heck of a lot by the end of the year because we've got continued drilling through the end of the year and then as we then take those 4 rigs down south to another section, we'll slowly catch up on this. So our current schedule called us to be in that late second quarter timeframe by the time we were done frac-ing most all of the Cana wells.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions for you. On the -- I know you haven't come out with the 2013 capital budget yet. I know you've talked at various times in the past about keeping flexibility around the range of maybe in the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion type of range. When you look at cash flow and you're willingness to outspend with the balance sheet by $100 million to $200 million and then the potential for an asset sale. I know, you're preserving flexibility. But is it safe to say that at this -- I mean, in the current environment you're probably leaning towards the higher end of that range?", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Ron, this is Mark. Yes, that'd be correct. If we have cashflows in the $1.2 billion and we're talking about $1 billion as part of that $100 million to $200 million and at that point further property sales, yes, we'll be in the upper end of that range of the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. So yes.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But Ryan, a budget has a loose guideline, and we will adapt depending on our own success, market conditions and other factors.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then one more, if I might. In the Wolfcamp, I know you had talked about potential for 2 to 3 rigs there, as well as some of the leaseholding requirements. Is there an upper limit in terms of how many rigs that you think you could run there? And how -- what's the infrastructure looking like out there in Culberson County? And are there other bottlenecks that we should be aware of?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We're in pretty good shape there. I mean, there are always bottlenecks. And any Permian operator, certainly in the Delaware Basin, will tell you that you have to manage carefully both your oil, gas and natural gas liquids takeaways. We do have, though, the infrastructure built. Our operations team has done a fantastic job of putting in an infrastructure that gives us flexibility. We could handle more activity than I quoted. Whether we will or not, we'll see. I mean, certainly, if we have some really nice results in that second Bone Spring. We have the potential to accelerate that. And so I don't think we're constrained. That said, we have so much opportunity around our organization that our challenge, it's a wonderful problem to have, but it's a difficult problem because you can't do it all. I mean, we really do want to preserve the flexibility of our balance sheet, and if there were to be some downstream opportunity that we don't foresee.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And can you remind me -- I think you may have said it earlier but did you say how much of the 100,000 acres you feel like you have in the core there in the Wolfcamp, the second Bone Spring is prospective across how much of that?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, I didn't quote acreage. I did say we have about 125 locations, and those are on maps we've made with thicknesses mapped, where we think it could be prospective. And that's -- we're excited about that. We need to test it. One of the things we don't know, we do have some -- there's been an offset [ph] operator that's drilled a well, that's come in very oily with great rates, and we're very excited about it because it sets us up. But this is a big area. And gas-oil ratios change. Before we just move in a rig and drill all those, we need to sample it, understand where it -- does it get gassy, does it stay oily, a lot of unknowns there, but it sure looks something to be excited about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coleman with Raymond James.", "Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just had one question on the [indiscernible]. Kind of looking at your gross completed -- or your gross wells for the quarter, it looks like it took a step down in the Permian there in the third quarter from the second quarter. I guess what's driving that? Do you have a lot and will that I guess have some pull throughs into the fourth quarter as you finish the year?", "Mark Burford", "Yes. Andrew, it's Mark Burford here. We do have  some -- but there's always some fluctuations in the number of [ph] wells because [indiscernible] any one period. And even like in the Paddock program where we have a rig and a completion crew that can add a lot of net wells in a short period of time. But we went from 27 in the first quarter, 37 in the second, and 24 in the third. But that run rate in the 20s is probably the way you would expect, but there's going to be always fluctuations, Andy, from quarter-to-quarter, which is depending on the rigs and smaller wells like the Paddock and whatnots.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "And frac schedules.", "Mark Burford", "And frac schedules, right.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no additional questions.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate it and we look forward to reporting back to you again next quarter. Thank you.

My name is Kayla, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Energy Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Kayla. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. In Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President, CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and Jim Shonsey, our Vice President and Controller.", "We issued our financial and operating results in the news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss, and you should read our risk disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "We have also posted a copy of the year-end investor presentation on our website, which we'll also be referring to, from time-to-time, on today's call.", "So with that, we'll go ahead and jump into the call, I'll turn it over to Tom Jorden.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. It's a pleasure to be releasing our fourth quarter and full-year results this morning. We had a very nice year in 2012, and I really want to give credit to our organization across the board, for executing and performing on target with the plan we laid out this time a year ago. We had some headwinds to overcome, as those of you that follow us, in the past years. Very pleased that the underlying growth of our asset base is showing, and that Cimarex is on firm footing today and -- as we march through an uncertain future, so we've never felt better about the position of the company.", "I'm going to be walking you through our results and will be referring to the slides that are posted on our website. I'll start with Slide 4, and will just be letting you know when I move a slide.", "So to start, we had a solid fourth quarter, reporting record production for the quarter of 677 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that was 13% greater than our Q4 2011. It's a very nice growth. We grew fourth quarter oil 28%, to another record, 35,099 barrels per day. Very, very nice oil growth.", "Our full-year 2012 production averaged 625 -- excuse me, 626.5 million cubic feet equivalent a day or 6% greater than our 2011 production. Oil was the biggest driver of that growth. Oil production for 2012 averaged 31,463 barrels per day, increasing 17% over 2011.", "Our oil and gas sales for 2012 are relatively flat, with higher production being offset by lower prices. Gas prices fell 35%, natural gas liquids prices, on average, dropped 28%, and oil was down 4%.", "So we reported strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and net income of $353.8 million or $4.07 per diluted share. Another metric that speaks for who we are, we ended the year with no bank debt and only $750 million of senior notes. As of year end, our debt-to-total capitalization was 18%.", "And I just want to say at the outset, something we've said from time-to-time, we're not averse to borrowing money. That balance sheet is there to weather the commodity cycles and provide flexibility, but also there for opportunities. So even though we're classically a low-debt outfit, I wouldn't want to surprise anybody, we see that balance sheet as flexibility, and for the right opportunity, we'll tap it.", "Moving on to Slide 5. We had a good year, adding significantly to our proved reserves. Very, very good year to the drill bit. We replaced 330% of production from extensions and discoveries. Proved reserves grew 10% to 2.3 Tcf equivalent. But if you exclude the property sales that we closed on in December, our reserves grew 13%. Oil reserves grew 18%, excluding property sales. We added 757.3 Bcf equivalent from drilling, and of those additions, 51% were liquids.", "We invested $1.6 billion in exploration and development. We drilled 192 net wells and realized very solid returns in both our Permian and our Cana programs.", "Overall, we had very strong execution in our key plays. We're very, very pleased with our core Mid-Continent and Permian programs, the execution we saw in 2012, the execution we're seeing as we look ahead to 2013 and also the investment returns that those plays offer us.", "We had continued strong results in our Permian and Bone Spring plays. And John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration, will be giving you quite a bit of color on this, but we're increasingly excited about our Culberson County play. Both the Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring look attractive to us in that play. We've got the Wolfcamp in Reeves County, that's a new add for us, in addition to our core plays of the Second and Third Bone Spring.", "The Permian also continues to develop new targets, some of which we haven't disclosed yet. And overall, it's a very, very nice place to operate, and we're seeing improving costs and operations performance.", "Slide 6 shows our core operating areas. Year-end 2012 reserves are 2.3 Tcf equivalent. As you can see, 68% Mid-Continent, 31% Permian. And our fourth quarter 2012 production at 677 million cubic feet equivalent per day was 52% Mid-Continent and 43% Permian.", "Slide 7 shows our growth in proved reserves from 2009 through 2012. We have a very, very solid proved reserve base. Our PUD percentage is still a very low 20%. One of the things I'll say about our reserves, they're solid, they're real. We do look-backs every year, back to the history of Cimarex in 2002. Our reserves have stood the test of time and we feel very, very confident in laying these reserves out to the investing public.", "100% of our proved undeveloped reserves are currently in Cana.", "As our investments have been pulled towards more liquids-rich areas of our portfolio, that's resulted in solid liquids growth. As you can see, we're currently 55% gas, 45% liquids. We've seen a nice compounded annual growth rate of 42% of our liquids, going back to 2009, and we expect to see that liquids growth continue as we continue to emphasize the Permian basin.", "Moving on to Slide 8. Slide 8 shows our proved reserves by region. And we'd have -- we've had solid reserve growth in our core Permian and Mid-Continent areas. They have increased to the compound annual growth rate of 22% over the last 4 years. But more than just growth, that increase is a result of solid returns in our capital investment program.", "As you know, we understand the challenge to grow, but mostly, we view our mandate as the challenge to reinvest our cash flow at high rates of return, and growth is a natural outcome of that. So we're very pleased, as we show you our production reserve growth, to be able to stand before you this morning and tell you that, that's an outcome of some investments that are very attractive to us, and we have a very nice investment portfolio that we're prosecuting in 2013 and beyond.", "Going on to Slide 9. Looking forward into 2013, we're moving into this year at a very active drilling pace. And as we always say, we'll be carefully watching our returns. We've given our activity guidance, our investment guidance of between $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, but we're going to keep our hand closely on the throttle. Depending on our own results, our opportunity set and commodity prices, that could be accelerated or decelerated. We certainly have the flexibility, based on the environment we find ourselves in.", "We'll have a very active 2013 Permian program nonetheless. Our Bone Spring programs in New Mexico and Texas are performing very well. And again, John Lambuth will give you some color on that. And as I said a moment ago, we're getting very bullish on the Wolfcamp. Very pleased with our recent results. There've been some industry results that have confirmed what we've always known about the Wolfcamp, and it's rightly getting a lot of attention in the Delaware Basin.", "In the Mid-Continent and Cana, we're seeing very good results in our infill drilling. One of the things we'll do, however, we'd like to manage our total capital to be in that $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, as we currently model it with our current model for our cash flow. So Cana is an area where we'll be adjusting our activity. And again, John will cover that in more detail.", "Finally, in Slide 10. As we look at our capital investments over time, the Permian, in 2013, continues to get a slightly larger share of our total capital, over what it did in 2012. We currently project the Permian to be getting 55% -- excuse me, got 55% in 2012. We're projecting it to be 62% this year. The midpoint of our capital at $1.45 billion is down about 10% from last year. But again, we're going to see how it goes. Our cash flow is a certain and critical part of that equation and our results are a critical part of that equation, as are our costs of drilling and completing these wells.", "But the good news is we're seeing solid returns in all our areas and lower capital, a result of wanting to keep our capital closer to cash flow.", "Slide 11. There's a little pie chart that shows you our capital investments. We're currently running -- today, we have 15 rigs in the Permian, but we'll say, as we move through the year, we'll be between 11 and 14 rigs. We'll drill 150 gross or 105 net wells in the Permian. Those will be spread throughout our programs. In Cana, we'll continue our Cana infill development, and John, once again, will give you some color there. One of the things we're seeing in Cana, as a little bit of change from prior years, we're seeing more demands from other operators. So although our operated activity may decrease, it's being taken up, by and large, by outside operated activity.", "And then the Gulf Coast. We're working on some new 3D data sets, and we expect to spend a small amount there this year, drilling 6 to 9 net wells.", "Onto Slide 12. Slide 12 showcases the underlying growth engine of our company, and that's the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent. And you can see our production growth. Our investments are delivering that strong growth. For 2013, we expect continued predictable growth for Mid-Continent and Permian. And this is not growth for growth's sake. We're seeing solid economics in our Permian, and liquids-rich gas in both Mid-Continent and Permian, and 40% to 50% of our drilling results are liquids.", "So we're seeing very, very nice returns in that Permian and Mid-Continent program. And that is -- has indeed, I think, become apparent to all, that's the engine of our growth.", "Slide 13 showcases our Permian oil production and how that's grown over time. And that's driven by outstanding results in our Bone Spring drilling program in both Texas and New Mexico. The growth in 2013, excluding the impact of our year-end asset sale, is 8% to 12%.", "So overall, we're seeing very nice results from our program. Again, I'm very proud of our organization and the way we've executed in 2012. We're firing on all cylinders as we enter 2013. With a healthy balance sheet, a fantastic inventory and good prospects for very nice returns on capital, we're looking forward to making 2013 again, a year in which we execute on target.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration.", "John Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I'm going to give you an update on our 2013 exploration drilling program. I'm going to first start with our most active region, as Tom mentioned, Permian Basin.", "I'm on Slide 15, for those of you following along with the presentation. You will note that for 2013, our total expected capital investment will be approximately $900 million, which is just a little bit of an increase over 2012. You will also note, though, that the number of gross and net wells is down relative to 2012, with 150 gross for '13 relative to 182 for '12. The primary driver of that is just our overall portfolio, the type of wells we'll be drilling. Where in '12, we had quite a large inventory of shallow Paddock-Blinebry wells, we really don't have much of an inventory of those left for this year, thus, for the same capital, you get fewer wells because the overall portfolio is slightly more expensive.", "Going onto Slide 16. As Tom mentioned, our bread-and-butter play has been the Bone Spring. In 2012, we drilled 107 gross, 60 net Bone Spring wells, with 64 in New Mexico, 43 in Texas. We continue to have very strong performance from this program. In New Mexico, our average 30-day IP for the 2012 wells was 640 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with those wells being primarily 90% oil.", "In the Texas part of the Bone Spring, where we're mainly targeting the Third Bone Spring sand, the 30-day IP rates were 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 85% of it being oil.", "We continue to see great results in both of these plays, and we expect that this will continue throughout 2013.", "Of course, as we drill these wells, we learn and we try to look for areas to expand into, and we've done just that by moving into Culberson County. We have a couple of recent wells we're going to talk about, that have us very excited about the potential with our acreage there.", "The first well is the Owl Draw 12 Unit 12H well. That well had a first 30-day average of 665 barrels of oil per day or an equivalent of over 1,000 of oil equivalent per day. We then followed that up with the Alysheba 17 2H. It had very similar results of 645 barrels of oil per day and over 1,100 barrels equivalent per day, wet gas plus oil, when we combine.", "What's really exciting about this is that, in Culberson, we're actually slightly shallower than what we typically drill in New Mexico. And thus our well costs are even little bit less than what we usually experience in those other plays. So the type of returns we're getting from this play are very, very good.", "When we look at this play and look at the totality of our acreage, we can put a wide range of potential locations here. In fact, the numbers range from 100 to 200. But the simple fact is we really don't know until we drill more wells and we get a very better idea of how we define and de-risk this play.", "It is this encouragement that is leading us to maintain an approximate 2 rig schedule in Culberson, targeting this Second Bone Spring interval.", "But of course, our acreage in Culberson was initially driven by our Horizontal Wolfcamp play. In 2012, we drilled 15 Horizontal Wolfcamp play, bringing the total number of wells we drilled within this White City Culberson area to 33 from its inception. As most of you know, we have been the leading driller and industry maker for this area.", "We continue to see better and better performance from these wells as we try to continue to change the recipe in terms of frac-ing, fracture stimulation, and where we land our laterals. Please keep in mind that the Wolfcamp in Culberson is upwards of 600 to 700 feet gross thickness. So it's taken us a while to find that magic landing zone relative to frac to get the best performance, but we're definitely starting to see that.", "As we show on Slide 17, from first quarter to fourth quarter 2012, we've been able to increase our liquid yield from 59 barrels per million to 97 barrels per million. That is definitely having a big impact on the type of rate of returns we can expect from these wells.", "As you go to Slide 18, you see then over the last 3-year period, what our Horizontal Wolfcamp production looks like. You will note a couple of things: first off, we made a major investment in a new pipeline within Culberson County, we call Triple Crown. That pipeline, which was completed in late 2003, gives us the flexibility for multiple outlays for the -- for taking our gas to market.", "That has also then enabled us to go out there and increase our drilling activity, which you see, resulted in a nice increase in production you see in 2012. We fully expect to see that continue to increase as we go into '13.", "On Slide 19, you see, based on the most recent wells in terms of the average, we are presenting to you our type curve, essentially what we expect these types of wells to make. You will note that the 30-day average is 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with an EUR range of 4.5 Bcfe to 5.5 Bcfe. Although in this case, this particular type curve is a 5.4 Bcf equivalent. The makeup of that hydrocarbon is 47% gas, 30% NGL and 23% oil.", "If you now go to Slide 20, and I use that type curve, along with our net revenue interest of 75%. And then finally, our most recent AFE for a completed well being $7.2 million, you will see that, with a forward strip from February 11 of '13, we are able to generate in the low-30 type of internal rate of return for this type of program. This really is exciting for us because, as you recognize, this shale play is rather extensive over this acreage, and thus great potential is there for us. I'm sorry, that's an APAX [ph] rate of return.", "Furthermore, then, in summary for Wolfcamp in White City and Culberson, along with our improving results in terms of the production we're seeing, we're also seeing a nice decrease in our well costs over time. In 2011, our average well cost was around $10 million. 2012, it decreased again, down to around the mid-8s. And now for 2013, we're seeing somewhere in the mid-7s, a nice decrease, which again only helps with the type of returns we'll get from these wells.", "If we look again at our total acreage position and just look at the overall potential, then we've shown you a table of what the future may hold for us in this play. Now I must emphasize strongly, we have not yet drilled a downspacing pilot to determine what our ultimate spacing will be. With that said, on the conservative side of just 160 acres, or 4 wells per section, based on our current acreage position, we would have 500 net wells with a reserve potential of 1.7 to 2.1 Tcf. And that would require a capital investment of $3.6 million. Obviously, if we could prove via a downspacing pilot, even tighter spacing, essentially going down to 80, that would result in the doubling of those numbers. Again, we need to, at some point, plan a spacing pilot, but as of right now, we're still in the mode of HBP-ing in our acreage in order to secure our acreage position.", "But as Tom mentioned, that's not the only place that we are drilling Horizontal Wolfcamp wells. We do have a significant position at Reeves County, approximately over 35,000 acres. We have drilled 2 wells now on that acreage position. We are in the early parts of flowback on those wells. What I can tell you is we are very encouraged with the results we're seeing, so much so that for this year, we plan to drill approximately 3 additional tests in the immediate area to better define the opportunity there.", "I'm now on Slide 22. I'll be stepping to the Mid-Continent region. On that slide, you will see that for 2013, our estimated capital investment will be $450 million as compared to $673 million for 2012. As you know, for Mid-Continent, the majority of that money goes to Cana-Woodford. In regards to the change in capital, from $673 million to $450 million, you need to keep in mind that in 2012, for that program, over 37% of wells we drilled were one-off or exploratory wells, to better define the Cana opportunity for us. 63% were infill core drilling. When we look at our 2013 program, over 90% of the wells that we will be drilling to participate in, are infill core programs. That is where we're going to get our best rate of returns and that is where we're focusing our capital on.", "From the inception of this play, as you see on Slide 23, we have drilled or participated in over -- approximately 492 wells, through the first -- fourth quarter 2012. We have a very strong land position of 120,000 net acres, of which, as we show on the display there, we have delineated what we call a gas-rich down-dip area, up-dip liquid-rich area. Within the liquid-rich area, we have 75,000 acres, of which almost all of them now are in a held-by position status. So we really are not driven anymore to go out to drill wells to hold acreage, it's just a matter of maximizing our opportunity in terms of picking the best rate of return.", "As we go to Slide 24 then, we are doing just that with our infill drilling program. We are essentially carrying forward into 2013 what we are doing through the majority of 2012. We have 4 operated rigs, currently. We -- for full development in Cana, we are drilling 8 new wells per section, in addition to the existing parent well. That results in 9 wells per section. We plan for 2013 to have 125 gross wells, that's 35 operated, 90 non-operated. I will point out that, for 2012, we participated or drilled in 128 gross wells. So there's not that large a difference between '12 and '13 when it comes to Cana infill development.", "On Slide 25, you see a display or graph of our net production from Cana-Woodford for the past 3 years. You will note, in the first 2 quarters in '12, there was a slowdown to -- in fact, a slight decrease. And that was due to the fact that, to start the infill development program, we need to develop a sufficient buffer space between our actively drilling wells and the frac fleet. Once we accomplish that, we then immediately start to develop, or frac-ing wells, and then you see that nice ramp-up in production in the last 2 quarters there.", "It's that type of production growth again, we'd expect in '13 with this infill drilling program.", "So in summary for Cana-Woodford, we exited fourth quarter 2012 with net production of 215 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was a 30% increase over fourth quarter 2011. And at the bottom, I still want to point out, there's still great potential here, even though we've already embarked on an infill development program. To date, we have 1.1 Tcf of equivalent gas proved for Cana. And yet, we still show a risk upside within that liquid-rich core area of 3.3 Tcf, which would equate to 660 net wells and close to $5 billion of capital. So total risked resources for Cana, as you see there on that slide, is 4.4 Tcf.", "Finally, on Slide 27. A quick word on our Gulf Coast program. As those of you who follow us know, Gulf Coast is our higher-risk, greater-reward opportunity region. It is a region that is entirely dependent upon 3D seismic and the attribute work we do with that to pinpoint our drilling locations. In 2012, we made a major investment in a number of new 3D surveys, in order to replenish our drilling inventory.", "That data has been acquired, processed, it is in house. We are currently rebuilding that inventory and hope to be drilling again in the second quarter of this year. But I want to emphasize, unlike the other regions, we do not think of Gulf Coast as a rig line, as much as it is of capturing good opportunity. We hope that there will be 10 gross, 7 net wells there. But again, it's all about the quality of the opportunity we have, and if it's good, we will drill it, if not, then we won't reach that number.", "With that, I will hand it over to Joe Albi, who will talk about the productions for Cimarex.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thanks, John. I will be going over our fourth quarter and 2012 production statistics. I'll hit a little bit on our 2013 guidance and then just a few comments on where we ended the year with LOE and where we see current service costs. For those of you following along, I'll start here on Slide 29.", "And to echo Tom's earlier comments in the call, we really did have a great year. We had some strong October and November new well adds that helped prop our fourth-quarter volumes up to a level of 677 million equivalents a day. That was right at the upper end of our guidance of 652 million to 677 million, and up 13% from where we were in Q4 '11 at 601 million a day.", "All the while, we set a new record in the fourth quarter for total company production, and the driver to that growth, as we've alluded to already in this call, was our increased oil production, which grew 28% over Q4 '11 to a record of 35,099 barrels a day in Q4.", "Also helping the quarter were minimal production disruptions for plant turnarounds, ethane rejection and other downtime, which, those of you following us for a while have known, did impact us a little bit more, earlier in 2012.", "We dig deeper into the numbers, we continue to see production growth from our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. Our record fourth quarter Permian net equivalent volume of 292 million a day was up 6% or 17 million a day from Q3 '12, and up 36% or 77 million a day from fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our oil growth was the real driver here, with our Q4 Permian oil volumes averaging 27,091 barrels a day, another record for the company, and up 42% from fourth quarter last year. We're drilling some really great wells, and it's showing up in our numbers, with some strong adds from really virtually all our programs in the Permian. Our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring plays, as well as our Wolfcamp program.", "Our fourth quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 351 million a day was also a record for the company. It was up 8% from last quarter and 11% from a year ago. Cana continued to drive the increase, with record fourth quarter volumes of 215 million a day, that's up 31 million a day from last quarter and a respectable 57 million a day from Q4 '11.", "With that, Cana now represents 32% of our total company production. So in a nutshell, Q4 came in, I'd say, as modeled, but I'll say it came in on the high end of our model, reflected significant increased volumes from our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. And as a result, our full-year 2012 equivalent production came in at a record 626.5 million a day, which was up 6% from our 2011 average of 592 million a day.", "And driving the year-over-year growth was really 3 important factors: a 43% increase in Permian oil volumes; a 15% increase in our total liquid volumes; and a 21% increase in our combined Permian and equivalent -- excuse me, Mid-Continent equivalent volumes. Definitely, a good year.", "Shifting over to Slide 30, where we look at production by region. Big obvious thing pops out here, and that is we've seen a nice increase in our total liquid production over the last few years. Our Q4 liquid volumes averaged 57,217 barrels a day. Looking back 3 years ago, that's 2.5x the 22,935 barrels a day we averaged in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "The catalyst to the growth has been the Permian, which accounts now for 61% of our total liquid production. That said, we're also seeing nice contribution from Cana, which is the backbone to the 35% of the total company liquids comprised by the Mid-Continent.", "The Mid-Continent still represents the lion's share of our gas production at 69%, and our total company equivalent production of 677 million a day is now nicely balanced between the Mid-Continent and the Permian, with the Mid-Continent representing 52% of the total and the Permian at 43%.", "On Slide 31. Looking forward to our 2013 production guidance. We're projecting our 2013 equivalent daily volumes to average in the range of 675 million to 705 million equivalents per day for the year. That's up 8% to 13% over 2012. Built into this estimate is the $294 million Permian property sale that we closed on at the end of the year, which reduced our net volumes by 2,550 equivalent barrels per day, 2,000 barrels a day of which was oil.", "If you're looking at the table in the presentation, you'll see our projected 2013 oil growth to be quoted at 1% to 5%. But if we exclude the impact of that sale, in essence, we're projecting 7% to 11% oil production growth, and so we have a very good chance for a second year of double-digit oil production growth here in 2013.", "Although our Gulf Coast production is modeled to contribute only 3% to 4% of our total company production, we do have some drilling planned for the program this year and have incorporated a modest, I'll call it, heavily risked drilling wedge of 5 million to 10 million a day for the year, which has been built into our modeled projections.", "Hence, from 30,000 feet, what we're projecting is for 2013 to look quite similar to 2012. Strong double-digit Permian and Mid-Continent production growth in the range of 11% to 15%, with an emphasis on liquids, which as modeled, would bring our liquid percentage up to 51% by the end of '13.", "Our first quarter guidance of 614 -- or, excuse me, 642 million to 667 million has been reduced by about 15.5 million a day, for a recent property sale, as well as some weather and other facility shut-ins that we experienced in early January. In essence, after accounting for the property sale and the shut-ins, we're projecting Q1 to be fairly flat with our strong Q4 '12 results.", "Shifting gears over to operating expense on Slide 32, as we talked about before in our previous calls, our production group has put a great deal of energy into fighting the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year in LOE, in particular, in the area of SWD and more specifically, in the Permian.", "In addition, we've undertaken measures to control workover costs company-wide. Well our efforts are showing up in the financials, with a Q4 lifting costs coming in at $1.06 per Mcfe, that's down another $0.01 from where we were in the third quarter of 2012 and we're down $0.12 or 10% from Q4 '11. Our Q4 '12 lifting cost is the lowest lifting cost we've seen since late 2010.", "Looking forward into 2013, we've projected our full year ROE guidance at $1.05 to $1.17, and hoping to fall in on the lower end of that range.", "Just a few comments on service costs before I turn the call over to Paul. On the drilling side, similar to what we discussed last quarter, we are seeing most cost components remain relatively in check, but we are seeing continued signs of a softening rig market, as evidenced by recorded day rates down anywhere from 3% to 5% from last year.", "Our biggest cost savings continue to come in the form of drilling efficiencies and lower per unit frac costs. An interesting observation, when we compiled our frac statistics at the end of the year, our total company frac statistics show we pumped upwards of 20% to 30% more sand and fluid in 2012 than in 2011, yet our overall frac costs were down 18%. And that's really a combination of pumping more white sand, reduced service costs and additional horsepower on the market.", "Looking more specifically at individual well costs, in Cana, our drilling efficiencies and lower frac costs have brought our current AFEs in the core infill program down to about $7 million, total well cost. That's $400,000 lower than what we quoted last call and down $1 million from where we were a year ago, so it's paying off in Cana.", "In the Permian, our Horizontal Second Bone Spring wells continue to run in the $6.5 million to $7.1 million range, while drilling efficiencies in our West Texas Third Bone program have brought total well costs down to $7.2 million -- around $7.2 million. That's $300,000 lower than the figure we quoted last call.", "And finally, our Horizontal Wolfcamp wells are running $7 million to $7.5 million, total well costs. That's down from $8 million to $8.5 million, the levels that we saw about 6 months ago.", "So all in all, we're quite excited about where we are. Our production and our reserves are trending up, while our lifting and well costs are trending down. We've got a deep multi-year inventory of drilling projects in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, probably the richest inventory XEC ever had. And all those are very good reasons to find ourselves in a pretty good position here, starting out in 2013.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Korus.", "Paul Korus", "Thank you, Joe. If you'll page forward to Slide 34, I'm a little brief, I only have one slide.", "Despite the fall in gas and oil prices during 2012, we had reasonably good earnings, driven by nice growth in production and proved reserves. After investing $1.6 billion in 2012, we ended the year with $750 million of debt. That was inched up, if you will, from about $400 million at the end of 2011.", "So still plenty of capacity on the balance sheet, but please do recognize that our prior tolerance of note debt has at least evolved into a tolerance of some, albeit still low, amount of debt.", "We had -- as we mentioned repeatedly, we had good growth in production of 6%, which actually met the midpoint of our very original guidance for the year. And we increased our proved reserves by 10% to 2.3 Tcf, adding 750 Bcfe of reserves through new drilling, which was more than 3x our production for the year. And we had good finding [ph]  costs and good rates of return doing it.", "So as we look to 2013, our expected capital, at the present time, gives a very narrow range for us of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. But as Tom mentioned, please appreciate that we reserve the right to increase it some or decrease it some, as the year evolves.", "Still, at the tight range that we're giving, our expectations are for double-digit growth in production and reserves in 2013.", "Those are my comments. Kayla, we would be happy to entertain questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Phil Jungwirth from BMO Capital Markets.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the oil production guidance for 2013, 32,000 to 33,000 barrels a day, it seems to be a little bit lower than the 4Q average, even adjusting for the assets. So can you address why this would be the case? And is it mostly just conservatism on your part, given that greater allocation of capital is going towards the Bone Spring and you've seen better results there?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Phil, this is Joe, I'll answer that. Yes, if you look at the slide, it says, hey, without the property sales, we're showing 1% to 5% growth. When we throw those back in there, 7% to 11% growth. Our projections do incorporate risking. And if we're off, I think what it's basically telling us is that we've got a very strong chance of having another year of double-digit production growth. There's a couple of other things that are at play here, too. At any one given point in time, new wells make up 40% to 50% of our total company production. And those new wells, even these permian wells, they can come screaming off pretty hard. So we're always constantly fighting the snowball effect of new well decline, which can impact the rates of production growth and certainly have an impact on what ends up being the final product of our modeling. But as Tom alluded to earlier in the call, as those of you who've known us for all these years, we are focused on rate of return. And it's all about rate of return. And to the degree that production is a byproduct of that, so be it. Obviously, we want our production to go up. That year or -- all that said, our model is really showing that we have a very, very good chance of another year of double-digit production growth. And we're really pretty pleased with that. Being able to have double-digit production growth is not something to not be proud of. So that's, I guess, our answer to that question.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, this is Tom. If I could just follow up that up. Joe has done this for a long time and he's gotten quite astute at making these models. Our business units send in what they think they're going to do and they time it out, and Joe takes that and looks to see what historically they've done. In the oil patch, things tend to go more wrong than they go right. You have delays in timing, you have delays in equipment. And so Joe factors in what he thinks is our historical average and he risks those business unit models down. That said, the business unit modelers are getting better and better at it. They're going to challenge him and if all goes right, we're going to beat that number. But we'll just have to see as we go through the year.  It'd be nice to have a year where all goes right, but it would be our first.", "Joseph R. Albi", "The other thing I want to add because I'm guessing we'll get the question, is on Q1, with our guidance being lower than Q4. Well, a couple of things at play there and this is also impacting our total number. But the Permian Basin sales that we closed on at the very end of the month last year, took about 15.5 million a day off our first quarter production. We also had a number of freezing issues and pipeline issues, and particularly in Culberson County, in early January, that hurt January to the tune of about 16 million a day, that built into that number. We also had a handful of good strong fourth quarter wells that came on in October and November that were on a very good screaming decline here in November and early January that we were fighting. And all of that, when you add it all up says, hey, we're going to be at about flat with Q4, which was strong quarter for us. We were at the upper end of our production guidance. All that said, the model is also saying that we anticipate production to start picking up here pretty quickly in February, and our early indications are that production is doing just that. And when you take a look at our production guidance for the year, and you look at 675 million to 705 million and you compare it to where we were in Q1 or what we're given guidance in Q1, hey, it smells an awful lot like what we told you guys last year. We're going to be kind of flat for the first half of the year and we expect to ramp up here at the end of the year and, lo and behold, that happened. And that's what we're modeling this year. We're going to have a little bit of a delayed start here in the first quarter, primarily as a result of the property sale. Our model is saying that, come around second quarter, we're going to start to see some real nice production growth. And ultimately, I hope, allow us to talk quarter-to-quarter about continued record numbers. So kind of a long answer to your question but I thought I'd knock off the second question because I thought it was going to get asked.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Here's a third question on the guidance. On the NGL production growth of 33% to 39%, is any of that driven by a change in processing contracts and then reporting the NGLs as opposed to leaving it in the gas stream?", "Joseph R. Albi", "No, most of that is all due to the existing contracts, which have already been modified. Most of the old contracts that could be rewritten or revised, all that's been done. So anything really showing up now is all through new adds.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then final question here, I appreciate all the Wolfcamp disclosure. It looks like there could be some variability in the GOR as you move from the south to the north. Is that the case or am I just drawing some conclusions from 2 wells here?", "John Lambuth", "I don't know. You should -- this is John Lambuth. I don't know you should draw any conclusion from just 2 wells. I would say, clearly, based on how we understand that formation, there is variability. But we tend to think as more of an east-west trend than north-south. But again, we still get surprises as we continue to drill this. But I would say not north-south necessarily, just based on those 2 wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But we also see a primary variability, stratigraphically. And that's a complex system.", "John Lambuth", "It is, and that's something again, I want to emphasize. It's a very thick shale and we have really honed in on a particular interval, where we're getting our best results. And you would expect us  then to get much more consistent results as we go forward, because that's the interval that we're primarily going to be drilling in.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "And we're obviously -- our excitement about the Wolfcamp comes through in our comments. But we're really early times here and, with the interval as thick as it is, we have a lot of that stratigraphy we haven't tested. So we're, as yet, uncertain as to what our ultimate spacing will be, either laterally or vertically. I mean, there's an argument that says 8 wells per section is not adequate to fully exploit this resource. But the truth of the matter is, we don't know, and we really would like to get data rather than speculation.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Mario Barraza here. Just want to dive a little deeper on the Second Bone play on the Texas side. Last quarter -- are we still thinking just over 125 well locations is a comfortable count for this point? I know you guys said right now, 100 to 200 locations. But what percentage of your acreage in Culberson do you think this is prospective?", "John Lambuth", "Well, this is John Lambuth, again, and I guess, I would say 100 to 200 locations. I mean, we are very, very early. If you think we're early in Wolfcamp, we're very early in this play. We have 2 very good, very exciting wells that we wanted to tell you about. We have very limited well control. Basically, our well control in that area is our Wolfcamp drilling. It helps define that shallower Second Bone Spring. But unlike the Wolfcamp, there's quite a bit of stratigraphic variability in the Second Bone Spring, so with each well we drill, we learn a little bit more, some to the negative, some to the positive. All I can tell you is, just looking at our acreage position and the current wells we have, we see definite potential and it's in the range that I just mentioned. This year will be very important for us because we have a lot of wells. We will be drilling to test it and further define it. So maybe during the course of the year, we might be able to give you a little bit better update. But we're just being honest, this is how we see it right now, based on the limited well data we have.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "This is Tom, if I could just follow-up on that. We've long recognized the potential of Second Bone Spring in Culberson County. This is not news to us. The reason that we haven't talked about it prior to the last call or 2 is because we expected it to be gassy. Based on our overall trend in the basin, we looked at that and this part of the basin and thought, it's probably gassy. We had good shows and we drilled through it, but we hadn't tested it. And these first tests, ours and there are some offset operators, have really surprised us pleasantly. We really didn't expect the Second Bone Spring to be as oily as it is. I mean, these are fantastic oil wells. And so when you ask what controls these 100 or 200 locations? We have that sand map throughout this Culberson block. We have very good shows when we drilled through it. We're just hesitant to get too out in front of ourselves and say how oily or gassy it is, and that's the main controlling factor. Is it going to continue to be oily or will there be pockets of this land where it's a little heavier gas? So that's why we are not waving the checkered flag just yet, but we're very, very encouraged by the results we have, limited though they may be.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay, appreciate that color. If I can shift gears towards the CapEx budget for this year. On the last call, you talked about -- you were going to exit the year with 4 to 5 rigs in Cana, but if gas prices stayed depressed, you might -- you were considering shifting out, possibly some rigs and transferring some more CapEx dollars to the                                                                Permian. What's kind of the price lever you're thinking about for -- where would you pull back on the number of rigs in Cana?", "John Lambuth", "Well, this is John Lambuth, again. I really couldn't pick a particular price. Again, it's going to be a matter of rate of return. And that's going to be dictated by the type of section we have an opportunity to drill. Again, the yield, the NGL mix, really dictates that rate of return, more than the gas price even. So we're constantly monitoring both our results to make sure we're hitting our expected volumes and our drill costs. Right now, we're very encouraged, I mean, very encouraged with what we're seeing coming out of Cana but, that said, we're always keeping an eye toward gas prices. And yes, if it drops to a level where we don't see it to be economic, we will slow that down or even shut it.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, it's Tom. It's really a function of how much money we want to borrow this year, more than anything else. Our cash flow is what it is, and we're trying to allocate it. Our returns in Cana are quite good. Our returns in the Permian, in general, are slightly better, and it's a function of how much money we want to borrow.", "Paul Korus", "It's Paul. I'll just add that, whether we run these 4 rigs through roughly the middle of the year or whether we run them all through the year, it's only about a $50 million swing. So it really won't move the needle that much in terms of capital or production volumes in 2013, because the wells drilled in the first half will be frac-ed in the second half, roughly. It would have further implications for 2014, perhaps, in terms production volumes. But it's not a needle mover.", "John Lambuth", "I mean, I would just say, again, I would emphasize, we're getting some really great results and they're really making it hard for us to not want to go ahead and get those rigs going. I'll leave it that way. I mean, really good results so far as we start this year.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But we have not made a final decision. We currently have 4 rigs running at Cana, and we've not made a final decision.", "John Lambuth", "That is correct.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jeff Robertson with Barclays.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Tom, in the Wolfcamp play in Culberson County, can you talk about where you think you'll be with some of these questions, just around stratigraphy and spacing, by the end of the year? By the end of 2013, that is?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, there's really 2 issues, Jeff. And I'd invite John to chime in here. One is, we're still sampling real estate. If you look at our current penetrations, although we think we've got a lot more than we know, there's still a lot of that area that's very finely sampled. So we need to just sample the real estate over that acreage block. We don't currently have planned this year a spacing pilot. Now that's something else that we're still kind of arguing about, because that's -- our experience in Cana is that, that's something you want to know as early as you can for full development. But right now, we don't have a spacing pilot planned for the Wolfcamp. And so we don't know yet what the spacing will be, both laterally and vertically. So your question is, what are we going to know by the end of the year? I think under our current plan, we're going to know the liquids yield and the producibility of that rock over a wider area than we've currently sampled, but in our current plan, we probably won't know any more about spacing than we do now.", "John Lambuth", "This is John Lambuth. I agree. I mean, the only thing I'd add, besides just the overall productivity of these wells is, again, we're very excited about what we're seeing with our drilling complete costs and, really, right now, as we look at these wells, that really is going to be one of the bigger drivers to the type of rate of returns we get. And so far, we're very encouraged by what we see going on in regards to those costs, both from the drill side, but especially on the completion side, is something Joe alluded to earlier. We're definitely seeing a decrease in our completion costs, and that really is very impactful for these wells.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Second question on that play. I think you said there are several different zones within the Wolfcamp. Is all of your drilling going into what you think is the same Wolfcamp interval?", "John Lambuth", "This is John Lambuth, again. Early on, we were, how do you say, all over the court? I mean, trying to understand, optimally, where we should be. It's fair to say, going forward, we've kind of honed in on the particular interval. We break it up into A, B, C, D and E. In our case, we have a particular interval that we now feel really good about and that's where you'd expect us to put the majority of our wells going forward.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "If I might add to that, Jeff. Some of the new drilling you're seeing over in Reeves County is in the shallow-most stratigraphy in that Wolfcamp. That's something that we haven't sampled in Culberson County, and there's a -- it looks interesting to us, we don't have a well in it. And it might be additive to everything else were doing and it might not be either/or, it might be additive. And please take that with a grain of salt, don't run out and update your model on that. We just don't know. I mean, we're just -- it looks to us like this Wolfcamp is going to be a legacy asset that can stand tall next to Cana for the future of Cimarex. That's the message this morning. The detail, whether it's $7 billion, $10 billion, $15 billion of future capital, we just don't know. But it's here to stay and we like it.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "One last question. Is there the ability to increase acreage in the play, in the areas that you think are promising?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we did increase acreage in 2012. We made a couple of acreage acquisitions that we talked about. It's getting skinny on the broad brushes. But we still get up every morning, and we wrestled home some things and we're continuing to do that. But I wouldn't want to start from scratch today in that part of the real estate, that part of the world.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to, I guess, get a sense on when, during the year, do you think you'll have enough information or insight into some of these new opportunities? And the results seem very encouraging, rates of return seem very equivalent across different plays and competitive with existing development opportunities. I'm just curious when we might start to expect to hear decisions on increasing capital or drilling additional wells?", "John Lambuth", "Well, I guess -- this is John Lambuth. What new -- which ones you're referring to, just specifically, so I can....", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Well, I guess, the Second Bone Spring opportunity in Culberson, in particular, and then the Wolfcamp Shale, over in that same general vicinity, seemed like the 2 areas, at least where results could be supportive.", "John Lambuth", "Well, I would just say, in Culberson, I think we're pretty set on that 1 to 2 rig schedule for this year, as we continue to identify the opportunity there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "For the Bone Spring, in addition to the Wolfcamp.", "John Lambuth", "For the Bone Spring, in addition to the", "Wolfcamp, you're absolutely right, Tom. That all -- like we say, that's always subject to change based on performance. But right now, we think that's the adequate rig schedule and capital we need to fully define that opportunity. Clearly, by the end of the year, we'll have a much better understanding of it. In terms of Reeves County, all I'll say is, we really need some more well performance and perhaps even a couple more wells, before even we're ready to talk about it. We need time there. Again, I'll just say we're encouraged. But we need a couple more wells, and we just need to see some more consistent performance, and then we'll probably be in a better position to talk about it.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And I guess with respect to the Horizontal Wolfcamp that's been focused in New Mexico, 33 wells drilled to date, how much of that acreage has been held now? And what is required, I guess, through this year, to be able to -- this year into next year, to lock up more of that acreage?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, in the New Mexico, in that Wolfcamp trend, it's by and large, I won't say 100%, but it's almost all held. We have a couple of obligation wells that we drill every year but other than that, we don't have any kind of an acreage exploration that's driving our New Mexico portion.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And there's one last one for me. I believe you all have been working on some other shallow liquids opportunities, or other Mid-Continent liquids opportunities. Any update on any of those new initiatives?", "John Lambuth", "No, no new update as of today. You are right in that there are a couple of plays that we have been pursuing. We still have some more evaluating and drilling to do in those plays. We really can't add any color to that today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A question -- I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to follow up on the guidance for this year. The 60 million cubic feet a day that you talked about that was affected by shut-ins in  Culberson County, is that just 60 million cubic feet a day in January or is that across the entire first quarter?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. That, for the most part, those were very mature properties with very shallow declines.", "John Lambuth", "So it came from the shut-ins, Joe.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Oh, for the shut in. I thought -- the freeze-outs [ph] , for the most part, appear to behind us. We will have, in the Culberson County area, probably in the first part of Q2, some work done to high-grade some of our pegging facilities and improve some of the line itself. So there'll be a little bit of downtime there, but it looks like the freezing issues in January are behind us.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But it's just January. It's built into our Q1 guidance.", "Joseph R. Albi", "So if you were to divide it by 3, I guess, if you want to take a look at that.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then on the -- how would you describe -- I mean, can walk me through to the state of infrastructure, I guess, as you look forward over the course of 2013? I mean, how much conservatism did you build into the numbers from potential infrastructure downtime? I guess, I'm still having a little bit of a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that, for 18 months, you've done kind of 2,000 barrels a day sequentially each quarter, Permian oil growth, and it seems to have flattened off.  I'm just trying to figure out is that -- how much that it's infrastructure downtime conservatism you're building in versus anything else?", "Joseph R. Albi", "There's maybe, if you were to take a look at the Permian, I'll just tell you in equivalents, I don't know how it's going to answer the oil side of it. But I venture to say that we, just on base properties, have integrated somewhere the range of 7 million to 10 million a day of a risk in our base property production that you could attribute to being directly associated with downtime, because that's about what we saw last year as an average. Second quarter last year, I think, we had a 14 million a day impact for the quarter, and most of that was in the Permian. And let's face it, the Permian is a tight deal out there. And we're constantly finding it. We had a few wells here in Q1 that we delayed fracs on, waiting to get the connections put into place. So I guess, if you're looking for a number, that'd be about the number I'd give you. Other than that, I always take a minute when I answer this question this way, too. What we're trying to do with our guidance, heck, the majority of that number is coming from new wells, and we're trying to predict when we're going to drill, and when we're going to hit the good ones, what they're going to produce, and for the most part, I'm really pretty amazed, as close as we all get playing this game, when you're trying to project what you're going to see. So we inherently put, maybe, a 70% to 80% risk into our region on risk numbers, based on history. And that's kind of how we end up where we end up. We look at capital utilization, how well we spent money and added production and so forth, and then come up with our final number.", "Mark Burford", "Ryan, this is Mark. I have one other thought to add to that discussion, is that, as you pointed out in the slide, for the guidance slide, we talked about oil growth, excluding property sale, being 7% to 11%. And the risking that Joe is alluding to and then further risking, if you take our risked/unrisked team's wedge, as Tom alluded to, probably be adding a few thousand barrels a day to these numbers. And if we add that back into these guidance numbers, it'll probably be close to 20% growth year-over-year in oil. So we definitely have tried to build in some uncertainty with the infrastructure, uncertainty in well timing, all those factors that go into guidance. But definitely, there's a lot more upside in these numbers if we hit our plan, but we know historically, there's always timing -- issues with timing, infrastructure, and those things. And so we try to build in, we think, would be a reasonable amount of conservatism for the numbers we can think we can reasonably achieve.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess, one last thing for me from an  infrastructure point of view, as the pipelines come in, connecting the Permian to the Gulf over the course of the year, I mean, how do you -- you've obviously seen the differential come in quite a bit up to this point, I mean how do you view that playing out over the rest of the year? Do you see upside in terms of potential to narrow that differential or maybe even go at a premium to WTI at any point? Or...", "Mark Burford", "WTI premium -- WTI, no, Ryan. We don't see that potential occurring. We're grateful to see it tightening to where it's gone. But I mean, we've -- when we look at the forward curve, I'd say it's still at around $1 range, that's -- we look at our models, and we don't assume it to go to premium, but we don't also assume to buying [ph]  back out like we saw early late last year and early part of this year.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Great. Thank you all for joining us on the fourth quarter conference call. I look forward to reporting to you next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Jared, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Energy First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Burford, you may begin.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Jared. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. On today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and John Lambuth, Vice President of Exploration.", "We issued our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I do need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business. And with that, I'll just go and turn the call over to Tom and let him jump into the details.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone, and I want to say we appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to go over the highlights for the quarter before turning the call over to Joe and John for a more detailed look at our operations.", "Cimarex reported this morning a very solid first quarter in line with our expectations. Production average 661.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 10% from first quarter 2012. Our oil production grew 12%, which is actually 20% after adjusting for the property sales. Our first quarter oil volumes averaged 33,154 barrels per day. So we're seeing some very, very nice growth in our oil production.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $409 million, funded with internally generated cash flow and $120 million in debt. We expect the bank debt will reach roughly $300 million by the end of the year, and that, of course, is up from 0 at January 1. And that says, our opportunity set continues to exceed our projected cash flow. In total, Cimarex will spend about $1.5 billion in 2013 on high rate of return projects, primarily in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin and the Cana-Woodford shale.", "John and Joe will give you a flavor of that in detail but we see an outstanding opportunity set and great flexibility as we prosecute it. Our Permian program continues to provide great returns, and that's where we'll invest $900 million or about 64% of our total capital this year. Results have been particularly noteworthy in Culberson County, Texas, where we believe the Horizontal Wolfcamp can provide decades of drilling opportunities for Cimarex. In addition, we see encouraging results in the Second Bone Spring in Culberson County. We also see potential in other zones in the stacked pay opportunity and believe this area is on its way to becoming a legacy asset for Cimarex. We're very proud of the work that our teams have done in Culberson County and are extremely optimistic about the development potential, multi-zone.", "For the rest of 2013 and into 2014, our Permian program will focus on holding our Culberson acreage. A lot of that acreage is term acreage, and we're on a program to make sure that every prospective acreage gets held by production. So we'll de-risk the acreage as we test other areas and other zones. We're still currently identifying economic sweet spots for potential future infill development. And as John will show, it's a big area. We still have a lot of drilling to do. And as we drill our way forward, we're finding new sweet spots we didn't anticipate. We'll also be doing an evaluation of multi-zone stack lateral development, and that's especially in various ventures of the Wolfcamp shale, along with the Second Bone Spring sand. We're at very early time there and need to have some field experiments before we can definitively comment on ultimate spacing.", "And then finally, we'll develop our infrastructure and takeaway strategies to accommodate our growing production. We've put a lot of energy into that in Culberson County, and we're in a commanding position there when it comes to infrastructure. And there are opportunities elsewhere in the basin, and we'll be attacking that. So a good quarter, good execution out of our organization. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I'll touch on our first quarter production, update you on our second quarter guidance projections and then follow up with a few words on operating costs and service costs before handing the call over to John. As Tom mentioned, our first quarter volumes came in at 661 million a day, that's a good strong quarter for us. We're above the midpoint of our guidance of 642 million to 667 million, and up 10% from where we were 1 year ago in Q1 '12. If you adjust for our 2012 year end property sale, which took about 15 million a day off the books, we were up 12% from Q1 '12. We saw solid production growth during the quarter despite incurring some downtime associated with plant facility shut-ins, freeze offs and some pipeline maintenance, which equated to about 7 million a day, and most of which came from the Permian.", "If we dig a bit deeper into the details, our Mid-Continent region continued to set records for all product categories, whether it be gas, oil, NGLs, total liquids and equivalent volumes. Our Q1 Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 361 million a day was up 15% from Q1 '12, and 3% from last quarter. Cana continues to drive the production increases that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent, with our first quarter volumes of 229 million equivalents a day, up 42% or 68 million a day from a year ago and 15 million a day from last quarter.", "In the Permian, our Q1 '13 net equivalent volume of 275 million a day was up a strong 15% or 35 million a day from Q1 '12. Our Permian oil production averaged 25,832 barrels a day, that's up 18% over last year. As compared to Q4 '12, however, our first quarter equivalent volume was down 17 million a day, and this is more or less a direct result of our Permian asset sale on December and the downtime that I mentioned we experienced during the quarter. As we move into the second quarter, however, we've made up that gap. We're seeing a nice, strong upward trend in our Permian production.", "Looking at our guidance, we've made no changes to our previously announced full year guidance range of 675 million to 705 million a day. That represents an 8% to 13% increase over 2012. And when adjusting for the December 2012 property sale, we're really projecting a true apples-to-apples increase of 10% to 15% over last year. If you look under the hood of our projection, however, you'd see that we've changed our projected commodity mix. As a result of lower processing yields and new markets, primarily in the Permian, we've lowered our projected NGL volumes for the year. However, offsetting that drop is stronger performance we're seeing from our oil projects, also in the Permian, which, in essence, have kept our total equivalent volume projection unchanged. Where we had originally projected a 1% to 5% increase in our oil production during 2013, we're now projecting an increase of 8% to 13%. In total, we expect liquids to represent about 50% of our production this year, that's another gain in our total liquid percentage, up from 48% last year.", "To help get us to our full year projection, you've seen our Q2 guidance range of 667 million to 692 million a day, and what that's really reflecting is that ramp up of production I just mentioned from Q1 and most of that coming from the Permian.", "Shifting gears to our OpEx. You may note that our Q1 LOE came in at $1.17 per Mcfe, that's up $0.11 from the fourth quarter and slightly above our 2012 average of $1.13. A couple of factors are coming into play here. We're seeing some increased compression costs, we've had increased power cost on our new wells, some higher chemical costs during the quarter associated with our early quarter freezing issues, just to name a few. But the largest factor was our increased workover activity, primarily in the Permian, which, by itself, added $0.10 per Mcfe over our 2012 average.", "As we may have talked about before, as part of one of our 2013 company goals, our production group has put a strong emphasis on stepped-up well reviews and lease inspections to optimize the production from and the appearance of our wells. The attention that we're giving the wells comes at a cost, however, and as a result, we've revised our full year LOE guidance up just slightly from $1.10 to $1.22.", "Just a few comments on service costs before turning the call over to John. On the drilling side, we'd characterize the market as stable with current day rates about where they were last call. But that's down about 3% to 5% from where they were in Q4. That said, however, we're seeing the benefits of some nice cost reductions, primarily in the Permian. The reductions that we've seen on the drilling side have been, I'll call them, performance-related rather than by market. With enhanced use of the PDC bits, tweaking our fluid designs, employing more use of downhaul motors and rotary steering technologies, we've cut down on our drilling days. On the completion side, we've realized some nice reductions as well, not only to a competitive market, but through more efficient operations, in addition. As a result, we're seeing meaningful cost reductions in our Bone Spring program, with our generic New Mexico Horizontal Second Bone Spring AFEs now running $6.3 million to $6.9 million. That's down about $200,000 from the numbers we've quoted last call. And our West Texas Second Bone Spring wells are now running $5.7 million, with them seeing the same benefits as well. The same goes for our West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs, which are currently running around $6.4 million to $6.6 million. That's down $600,000 from our last call. We've really made some great progress in that program. Our Wolfcamp Horizontals are still running around $7 million to $7.5 million, about flat to where they were last call. But remember that those numbers are down more than $1 million from where they were 9 months ago. In Cana, our program drilling efficiencies continue to shave dollars off our AFEs, with our current estimates now running $6.9 million, down $100,000 from, again, what we quoted last call, which was 500 -- and we're $500,000 down from where we were 6 months ago.", "We are very, very excited about the improvements we've made in our drilling program. Quite proud of our drilling team to accomplish what they've done, the results of which are certainly helping the economics of our program. All that said, we'll stay focused on demonstrating further improvement to get things better yet. So in summary, we've had another good quarter. Q1 production came in strong. Our guidance remains unchanged and continues to reflect an 8% to 13% increase in our production, and our drilling costs are certainly headed the right direction. So with that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John A. Lambuth", "Thanks, Joe. I'll cover some of the specifics of our Permian and Mid-Continent drilling program. It's been a very busy first quarter for us. We drilled and completed 87 gross, 47 net wells during the first quarter.", "I'm going to start first with an update on our Mid-Continent region. This quarter, we drilled and completed 52 gross, 20 net wells, essentially all of which were in the Cana-Woodford shale play. We continue with our infill Cana core drilling. This brings then our total well drilling in Cana to 532. We currently have 4 operated rigs working in Cana. We're still on track to drill and complete approximately 35 operated wells, and we will participate in 90 outside operated wells, with the majority of them being drilled by Devon.", "Our drilling and completion capital is still projected to be around $350 million for this year. Certainly, a bit higher first quarter gas prices are a relief, and they are helping our Cana's projected returns, as are some of the cost reductions in our drilling completion that Joe just mentioned. Our Cana program is performing well, and we're working to minimize those costs and increase productivity to enhance our returns there.", "Moving on to the Permian. The Permian region was our most active region as we drilled and completed 35 gross, 27 net wells during the first quarter. All of these were completed as producers. Our drilling has focused in the Delaware Basin of Texas and Southeast New Mexico, targeting the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations. Nearly half of our first quarter drilling was in our New Mexico Bone Spring program where we drilled and completed 18 gross, 11 net wells. We continue to have very strong results in this program. Our per well 30-day gross production from these wells averaged over 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the majority of that 89% being oil. We also have had another solid quarter in our Ward County Texas Third Bone Spring program where we have drilled 7 gross, 6.5 net wells. These wells had a per well 30-day average gross production rate of over 970 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 77% of which was oil. For both of these programs, again, as Joe just mentioned, we're seeing significant reductions in our drilling and completion costs, which just leads to even better rate of returns that we're experiencing there.", "We've also had an active Texas Bone Spring program -- sorry, as Tom mentioned, Culberson County, as well as what we call White City or Southern Eddy County has become a key area for us. We continue to have success drilling both in the Wolfcamp C and D intervals, as well as Second Bone Spring wells. And we see additional upside in the Wolfcamp A and the shallower Delaware sands. We drilled and completed 3 Wolfcamp and 3 Bone Spring wells this year. We now have 4 Bone Spring wells drilled to date in Culberson County, which have had a per-well 30-day average gross production of over 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% is oil. I'd like to mention here that of these 4 wells, one was a very significant step out to the Southern area in Culberson, away from where the existing wells have been drilled. That well has done a nice job of proving up additional areas for us to drill in Culberson.", "The Wolfcamp wells now total 34 gross, 32 net in the area, and our per-well first 30-day production rates on all of the Wolfcamp wells drilled in the area to date have averaged 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, comprised of 43% gas, 27% oil and 30% NGL.", "In addition to the Wolfcamp C and D interval, as well as the Second Bone Spring, we think there are additional opportunities on our Culberson acreage in both the Wolfcamp A interval as well as the shallower Delaware sand. We, in fact, plan to drill a Wolfcamp A test in Culberson later this year.", "Some other things we're looking forward to trying include a dual completion of the Wolfcamp C and D. The Wolfcamp interval is the very thick interval, and we are fairly confident that the C and D are not basically communicating with each other. So we plan to drill a stacked lateral, one in the C and one in the D, to verify that indeed we get a unique reserves with each zone. With those results in hand, we will then plan our infill development program sometime probably in early part of next year.", "Finally, a quick word on another area where we're drilling, Wolfcamp test, which is in Reeves County. We have one well that has been on production for a while now, and its results are extremely similar to other operator wells in the area. We're very excited about it. We have also now drilled a second well and have just finished completing it. It is just now in early stages of flowback. And we're now in the process of drilling our third well. We're very excited about this area so far, although there's still a lot to be determined based on future drilling as to how good it will eventually be for us.", "Finishing up, I just want to say that we are off to a great start this year. Our teams are always focused on maximizing returns on our drilling, and they are doing a great job. Looking forward, we have a very significant opportunity set. Quite frankly, our prospect inventory has never been as rich as it is right now. In the Permian region itself, as we sit here today, we recognize between 200 to 300 Bone Spring sand locations, with further upside available for us in the Avalon on the same acreage. When we look at the Wolfcamp in Culberson White City, we see several thousand potential locations, that, of course, depending on our ultimate spacing that we determined based on our infill pilot, as well as whether or not how many stacked laterals we are able to drill within that interval. We, of course, also see potential for the shallow at Delaware and the deeper Cisco/Canyon shale wells as well. We have huge amount of future drilling inventory in the Permian, not to mention the thousand of wells we have still yet to drill in Cana. Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mario Barraza.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Just can you talk a little bit more about the Culberson County area? Where do you feel -- I know it's early days, but where do you feel these potential 5 zones could spread out? Do you think they're prospective across the entire 100,000 net acres you have here?", "John A. Lambuth", "Potential, yes. Can we definitively say that at this point? No. Obviously, future drilling will dictate that. What we do know is we certainly have established a good program in the Wolfcamp C and D today. Likewise, we here recently with the results have established at a very good 8 tack [ph] rate of return program in the Second Bone Spring. How far does it go? Well that's just a matter of further development drilling, stepped out drilling, which we have not achieved just yet. So the potential is there, but can we quantify that on all the acreage? At this point, I guess, I'd say the jury is out, but the potential is definitely there for a majority of those intervals.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Mario, this is Tom. I don't think all zones will be prospective everywhere. So we're currently delineating and, of course, this is a big area and a very thick section. That Wolfcamp alone is 6,800 feet thick. We have the Second Bone Spring and then we have the Delaware above it. So given that area and that stratigraphic column, we have a lot of delineation still to do. Certainly, the C and D are fairly well calibrated, where we drilled it and we're still defining it. So we see the C and D as prospective overall, say, much of that acreage although that's still being defined. Whether that will support stacked laterals or not, we need to experiment. And then we haven't tested the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. We haven't tested the Delaware at Culberson County. So not to be vague with our answer to your question, we certainly see -- it's not hard to do the arithmetic and get thousands of locations even on the down case here, but we're still defining the potential, and we don't have a lot of granularity as to how they will sum up.", "Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "No, I appreciate that, the color you can provide today. And then Culberson isn't extremely populated. Do you guys have -- if you were to further accelerate the activity there heading into next year, are there any material infrastructure investments you still have to make here?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Again, this is Tom. We've made infrastructure investments there over the last few years, and we got ahead of that, we saw the potential early on, and we are in very good shape from an infrastructure position. We've got our gathering system, we have a little processing plant we put in. We have multiple outlets for wet gas stream. There's still some infrastructure to be built as we keep pace with our drilling program. But we've got the infrastructure there that allows us by and large to control our own destiny. And so it was a very fortuitous decision we made 2 or 3 years ago to get ahead of that program and build that infrastructure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ryan Todd.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A question for you on CapEx. How should we think about CapEx and sensitivity to cash flow? So if commodity prices hold at current levels, should we think of the $1.5 billion number as a cap or would you consider spending more if you could still keep your borrowing under a certain limit?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Ryan, this is Tom. We have flexibility there. We've not made any rules. We've provided guidance, but we've also been very clear saying that we're going to make decisions as we move forward. We have tremendous opportunity, not only in the Permian Basin which is, of course, the major focus, but we have some emerging opportunities in the Mid-Continent that we may want to fund this year. So our intent is certainly to stay within that capital guidance that we've laid out. But if we think we can get a great rate of return and it has downside protection to some commodity sensitivity, we wouldn't hesitate to go beyond what we've announced.", "Paul Korus", "This is Paul. Similarly, 3 months ago, we said our number would be 1.4 to 1.5. All we were simply doing there was allowing for weakness in the gas market in which case we might have tweaked back to 1.4. But I'll tell you, our number has always been right around 1.5, we just gave ourselves that flexibility back then. Where we sit today, we've kind of eliminated the down side case, and so our best estimate now is 1.5. If there's any bias, it would be higher. And by the same token, we gave wide enough production volume guidance to handle any of those cases. I mean, you can kind of drive a truck through our production volume guidance for the year. And that, of course, gives us plenty of wiggle room for things to go well. But it also allows for situations like well freeze offs, which we did experience. We are going into the suburb where we've seen ethane rejection and things like that. So we -- that's why we choose to give wide guidance as opposed to very narrow because a lot of things happen. And that way, we won't have to change guidance if they do.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's great. And you've seen some great -- I mean, it sounds like you've seen some great progress on reduction of well costs there. I mean, should we think of that as being -- are those well costs at the point now where they're below your official budget where you started the year and should we think that, for example, in the Permian, if you still spend the $900 million, that there could be upside to the actual number of wells drilled over the year?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Ryan, the upside, there's a little bit of cost in there, and Joe went over that. But one of the things we're finding is we're drilling our wells much faster. Now generally that will translate into cost savings. But when you think about the components of drilling a well, you have your tangibles, your intangibles and your completion costs, and so drilling them faster doesn't really save on tangibles or completion costs. So what we're finding is that when we look at the Permian, we're drilling these wells significantly faster than we modeled. So we're getting a lot more done with the same rig fleet, and that's putting a little upward pressure on our capital, not downward pressure. So yes, we are seeing some cost savings, but mostly, we're seeing drilling time reduction. And so if we keep our current fleet and don't adjust, we'll probably be on that higher end.", "Joseph R. Albi", "And this is Joe. What I might add to that is for the same dollars, we'll drill more wells. So the positive side of that is more wells, more reserves, more production that comes along with it which affects our cash flow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Magner.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Just I wanted to, I guess, follow up on the Cana program, with the rally we're seeing in gas prices and cost savings that you alluded to. Just curious where you are on decision, what to do with those rigs for the second half of the year.", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John Lambuth. As I said, we are at 4 rigs right now. But that said, in the immediate near future, we'll be going down to 2 rigs. But to be honest, that reduction in rig has more to do with just the overall infill development that's ongoing there. As we stated, there's kind of a ballet going on between us and the other operators to line up our sections in kind of an east-west sequence. And so right now, we don't want to keep the rigs because we get too far ahead versus what the other operators are doing. So the prudent thing for us is just to pull back a little, again, to work in concert with the others, and so that's what we're going to do for the remainder of the year with those 2 rigs. More than likely, as we enter next year, you'll probably see us come back with a couple of those rigs back into the program.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And is there a plan to move those rigs to other opportunities in Mid-Continent or shift them over to the Permian? Has there been some discussion about that throughout the year?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, we have sent one of the rigs down to the Permian. These rigs, we really, really like, as Joe mentioned, they've really done a phenomenal job for us in terms of drill rate, number of days. And so one of those rigs is moving down to the Permian, especially to help us with -- that rig's really built for longer laterals. So it's going down there to assist us with those type of wells. The other rig is one that we have released.", "Joseph R. Albi", "So what I might add there is that most -- all of these rigs that we've had in Cana, we've run for quite some time. So we've developed some efficiencies, we know how they work, they know how we work, to the extent we can keep them in our program, working within our budget, and as you mentioned, move them down to the Permian where we might take a 1,500-horsepower rig and put it into a situation -- or hydrated rig and put it down there where, even at a higher day rate, it's outperforming some of the other rigs, we're going to jump on that.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I just wanted to clarify, the guidance for the year, did that include the potential, I guess, drop down to 2 rigs or was it a drop of all 4 rigs, and a shift for the second half? I just want to sort of be clear on what was included and how the current plan is.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe, again. What that incorporates is our current projection for all of our rig activity. So to the extent we're going from 4 to 2, it's certainly in there.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. I'll just comment that regardless of 4 or 2, any of the wells we drill now in Cana don't even show up in this year's production. Basically, those wells will end up getting completed early first quarter. So really, it has no impact on this year's production guidance.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's correct. That have more of an impact on '14.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just on the plan to drill a dual stacked lateral, can you just talk about the impact on overall well costs relative to drilling 2 separate laterals. And any associated risks with that type of a well design that we should keep in mind?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, this is John, again, and maybe I wasn't as clear as I needed to be. But those will be 2 independent wells, just side-by-side, where one would target the C zone, the other well would target the D. We're not talking about 2 laterals out of 1 bore hole. They will be 2 independent wells targeting each independent zone. Is that clear?", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Yes, that's helpful. Okay. I'll leave it there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gil Yang [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "Just going back to well cost, and I apologize if you have addressed this. But if you look at your -- in the presentation, if you look at the E&D budget versus the net wells. The wells are more expensive in the Permian this year than last year. Is that just the budget, and we should expect that those well costs should be down from it or...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, there are a couple of elements there. One, we're drilling more long lateral horizontal wells. So our well complexion is more expensive, we're drilling more Wolfcamp wells. We've got a very active Third Bone Spring program, and those are a little more expensive wells. We're also drilling few Yeso wells this year. So those -- if you look at our well count in the prior years, they've had a fair amount of those $2 million, $2.2 million vertical wells. And there are very few of those in this year's program. So a lot of that difference in average well costs is made up by the types of wells we're drilling, not necessarily a change in cost.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got you. Okay. So the change in cost you're talking about is sort of apples-to-apples cost changes and this is a mix issue that the wells themselves are...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's right.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes, okay. Got you. And then just following up on in terms of the Permian. In Culberson, do you have any drill to depths -- or hold to depth issues that will induce you to drill to the deeper horizons first?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, that's certainly a part of our overall strategy there. And one of the things that we did, we got it down in the Culberson. When we started putting this acreage together in 2006, at that time, our primary objective was the Penn Shale or locally it's called the Cisco Canyon. And that's a nice productive interval. We drilled some wells, made some nice completions in that, both in Eddy County, we have fair amount of experience. But it's dry. Although it's an economic objective at current cost and current gas prices, it's not something we're pursuing. So then we've moved to the Wolfcamp, and on our drill to hold, we're holding at least to the basin of Wolfcamp. And we're looking at lease by lease. Some leases hold the entire Wolfcamp, some leases, it's depth drill. And we've got a fairly complex analysis on where we need to drill. But we're definitely attempting to hold the deepest producing Wolfcamp horizon and everything shallower. So that does color our drilling strategy. We get asked a lot, why don't you guys do Wolfcamp A? Well, we are, but we're kind of fitting that in with wells that are targeting the D and C to hold those deep rights.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. So in some cases, you need to drill the Wolfcamp E to hold the whole thing. But in some cases, if you drill the Wolfcamp A, you can hold A, C, D, E?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's correct. Now we don't have -- we only have 1 Wolfcamp E test in Culberson County. That was a vertical test for a conventional reservoir, and that was unsuccessful. So currently, our deepest horizontal objective is the Wolfcamp D.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And with your Penn drilling, Penn Shale drilling, did you hold a sufficient amount of acreage or is that pretty de minimis?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Not in Culberson County. That's de minimis.", "Unknown Analyst", "So overall, how much is held by production at this point?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "For Penn Shale or for overall?", "Unknown Analyst", "Probably just overall. For the Wolfcamp, ultimately which you're targeting now.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, we don\u2019t have that. John is guessing 1/3. I don\u2019t -- we don't have that number readily available but we can get that for you.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, I can tell you that we are on a capital program, that we've identified the minimum amount of capital we have to send in Wolfcamp drilling, and we're on a path to hold everything or essentially everything that we see as prospective. And that minimum amount, I think, was 125 million this year. It will be between 225 million and 250 million next year. And then it steps back down to the 100s for the year following. So without inordinate amount of capital, we're going to be able to hold all those Wolfcamp rights.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. So it's not going to govern your CapEx program at the levels we're at?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I'm sorry, Gil?", "Unknown Analyst", "So it won't govern -- it won't moderate or attenuate your program, given where we are today?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, it's -- yes, I wouldn't say it will moderate or attenuate, it certainly is an overprint. And right now, we have 2 rigs drilling Wolfcamp wells. With those 2 rigs, we can get this done. We will add a rig or 2 next year. But we did add, in addition to our 2 Wolfcamp rigs, we brought in 2 additional rigs to drill Second Bone Spring wells in Culberson County. And that was completely additive, that was without regard to the acreage holding to depth, and that was just because those Second Bone Spring wells are delivering lights out rates of return. But we're going to get those Wolfcamp rights held just fine.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Gamble.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I wanted to focus on the production side for a minute. I think Paul had alluded to it, the continued wide, I guess, train-size gap you've got for loan in high end of production. Is it safe to assume that with the...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That was a truck, that was not train, that was a truck.", "Paul Korus", "It was a truck.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "A truck, sorry. I'm sorry, Paul. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. We'll call it truck-size hole. At $1.5 billion and with all the success that you've been having, it seems like you're saying that the upper end makes more sense than the lower end, is that a fair assumption at this point?", "Paul Korus", "We make no such assumptions. Like Yogi Berra said, forecasting is difficult, especially when it has to do with something in the future. And we don't know what's going to happen with ethane rejection over the upcoming months. And that always has an impact on our NGL volumes, we get a little uplift in gas volumes. But net-net, it's a negative on production volumes. We don't know whether we're going to experience that in 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months. It's not predictable.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And that production gap right now includes how much rejection over the next few months?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. What we built into it is about 10 million or 11 million a day potential ethane rejection here during Q2. Now we don't know what it's going to be in Q3 so we didn't model that. But the other thing Paul is alluding to is there are some risks with takeaway capacity, particularly in the Permian that we're concerned about. We're seeing lower recoveries from the processing facilities that we're sending our gas to. We hope that, that's alleviated come Q3 with additional NGL takeaway coming into play from Sandhills. So all that being said, we're trying to forecast what we know right now with regard to recoveries in ethane rejection. To the extent it improves, I guess, it could bump the number up a little bit. But we're kind of modeling the world as we see now, and that midpoint of that range that I will call the Nissan small truck can drive through, that we feel like we can certainly attain.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "But you're never going to drive Nissans in Texas, come on now.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, they're smaller trucks.", "Paul Korus", "And in the Permian, as Joe mentioned, when the recoveries go down or one of the processors we go to is at capacity, one of the very smart things that has been done is that we have another outlet for the gas, for the wet gas. We may all end up regretting going to 3 stream reporting someday as an industry because these processed volumes of NGLs can really change, whereas our produced in metered volumes do not. So we may take a wet gas stream to a market because we can when we're shut out of capacity to process. Our produced volumes on a wet gas basis remain the same. But the way we count production from a reporting purpose, the way we all model it and what not, look different. So again, there's so many moving parts that -- my goodness, it's only May. To leave enough room or a wide enough production volume guidance is what we think is appropriate to do. As we get to the latter half of the year, as always, we'll tighten it down some.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And then one other clarification point on that, you mentioned the 7 Mcf that was down during Q1. I'm assuming that a part of this ongoing saga that is downtime and what's up and what gets rejected, that 7 has carried over into Q2 to some extent?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. What we've seen, and I don't have the numbers right handy right in front of me now, but as you may recall last year, in particular in the Permian, things are getting tight. So we have seen 3 million up to 15 million a day type impacts on a particular month due to either turnaround or takeaway issues. The first quarter was really hit a little bit harder with the weather, and we have a lot of freezing issues, in particular on the Triple Crown facility that came into play there. So to the extent it's incurred, we don't necessarily sit up there and say, okay, let's just subtract 4 million or 5 million a day here or there. We're trying to forecast what we know we're seeing consistently, and we're not counting on bad things to happen, we're also not counting on great things to happen.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great. And then one more for me. Different topic, on the AFEs. Now correct me if I'm wrong, you rolled through them pretty quickly, but the best quarter-on-quarter change was in the Third Bone Spring's number down to 6.4 to 6.6 on AFEs. Was there anything specific that caused that 600k improvement quarter-on-quarter that either could potentially be rolled into the other wells or any other zones or was that just happened to be a great quarter?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe again. There are things that we're doing in the Third Bone that we certainly hope to carry forward into where I'd say our next viable target is, obviously, the Wolfcamp. Without getting into the specifics of it, it really just means cross-pollinating technologies between the different groups in our drilling department, whether it be in Tulsa or the Permian, but be a little bit aggressive with our use of PDC bits, motors, our hole design, we're testing different fluids. And to the extent they work in one program and we're in the same darn area, I think you'll see us trying to apply it elsewhere.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Portillo.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a few quick questions from me. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of clarity on your Wolfcamp C and D results, if there's any difference in the liquids yields that you're seeing at this point. And as you move forward with that drilling campaign, is there a preferred interval that you're targeting from here?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. Yes, so far within Culberson County, between the C and D, we do see a difference in the liquid content. And that as we move up in the section, from the D to the C, we definitely get richer in terms of our condensate NGL. Going forward, we still have our very -- and we will still make very good rate of returns in the D. And so as someone mentioned earlier, in terms of HBP in our acreage, we're always cognizant of making sure we're at least holding the deepest interval by HBP for future drilling. Furthermore, because of that change we see going from D to C, that kind of gives us encouragement in what we potentially might see when we finally get this A test done later this year. I mean, that has the potential to be even more liquids rich interval, but that said, we won't know until we actually get that well drilled.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "As we think about kind of the wells we've seen so far, kind of in the 45% gas range, could you give us, I guess, maybe just a little bit of color around what the gas to liquids yield might be on the C? Just trying to get a better sense of what the liquids yield.", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, of course there's a wide variation, it's a big area. But on average, in the D, I would say, we're seeing condensate that comes in between 80 and 100 barrels per million. Our recent wells are probably in the higher end of that range out of the D. We have some C wells that are significantly higher than that. In fact, we have a C well that's 200 barrels per million condensate. So we see much richer stream out of the C. That's also a reason why we suspect that they are independent reservoirs. They are 150 to 200 feet apart and that stacked lateral will be a really seminal test for us because we're strongly suspecting that they'll be able to be developed as completely independent horizontal targets, but we don't have that experiment yet.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just on your Wolfcamp A result, you mentioned that the initial well result there was very encouraging. Could you give us some color on how we should think about the IP rate? I think you guys have a 30-day IP there. And maybe how we should think about the liquids yield on the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Again, this is Tom. I was expecting earlier in the call we'd be grilled on the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County. So here's what we'll say about it. First off, this is a very competitive area. It's a big area and it's a competitive area. And so we're still out there competing for opportunity, and we're probably going to disappoint a lot of listeners in that we're not going to give granular detail on individual well results. A lot of other companies are and we listen to those carefully, and I will tell you that we're seeing results that are very consistent with what's being discussed in the industry. Wolfcamp A is an emerging target in Reeves County, we're very high on it. We are in the midst of a competitive leasing environment, and it's a major focus of ours. I will also say that we have plans to spend at least $160 million a year drilling Wolfcamp A targets over the next 2 years. And obviously, it's high in our list. But we're just not, at this point, it's just not in the interest of Cimarex shareholders for us to be giving detailed well-by-well results at this time.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And then just my last question on your emerging liquids plays, I was wondering if there's any update there. Or how many wells have you guys have tested and maybe when we should expect to get some color on the results you guys have seen?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. Really no update, per se. I mean, we continue to look for new opportunities, as we've said. But just like we just had a discussion on Wolfcamp A, typically we're fairly conservative in talking about new plays, and we just don't have anything to say about any new opportunity for us right now. Are we pursuing them? Absolutely. We have a number of things in the hopper that we're looking at, formulating plans, potentially drilling, but really nothing that I can give any color to today.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, I'll probably go a step further there. We had a couple of projects which we talked about in vague terms. One, I'll tell you, we think is not going to work. The second one, we're currently in the process of drilling in. It's our third well on the play, and we'll say a little more about it in the future.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gail Nicholson.", "Gail A. Nicholson - KLR Group Holdings, LLC, Research Division", "I just was kind of curious on the longer lateral that you're drilling in the Permian. If you could give any color on what you're seeing there and is that kind of, I guess, the way you're going to kind of drill these wells in the future.", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. Well, we're very early in terms of our long lateral drilling. We have a number of examples in some of the different intervals. And although we are encouraged by what we see out of those, there are some things we have to overcome. Cost. Drilling longer laterals, it definitely takes more money. But that said, we definitely see for a number of plays where longer laterals is probably where we are headed. Now again, that's also a matter of acreage, what we have available to us, where we can drill those longer laterals. But I would say, it would not surprise me in the coming year or 2, that you're going to see more and more of our program go -- head more toward those greater than 5,000-foot type laterals. I think that's a fair statement.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We just don't know yet. We did drill a long lateral in Culberson County, a Wolfcamp D lateral. The Delaware Basin is different than the Midland Basin. And certainly, we're well aware of the long laterals in the Midland Basin and the logic behind those, cost savings improvement that they observe. Delaware Basin, we're deeper and we're more pressured. And both those work against long laterals. Our long lateral in Culberson is kind of a betweener, as far as -- it's a good well, but does it justify taking that risk to drill a long lateral? We're kind of on the fence there. We do have a long lateral in Reeves County that we haven't completed yet. And we just don't know. So we're very much interested in looking at long laterals as a way to increase our returns. But it's a little more complex than that because we are deeper and more pressured and that can lead to mechanical problems and there can be a situation where you say it's just not worth messing with.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeb Bachmann.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "It's just a quick one for me on kind of looking forward towards year end. First, looking back at year end '12, you guys didn't have any PUD bookings in the Permian, and looking forward to the end of this year, just wondering kind of what's your philosophy is regarding that. I don't believe you have a down spacing pilot in the Wolfcamp yet. But looking at the Bone Spring, just kind of any color you guys can provide on that.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. I'd say we'll give you the same answer as I believe we gave last call. Cana, by far, has lent itself to the PUD bookings because we felt very comfortable in the pilot project that we have done and with our infill projects. So it lent itself to PUD bookings. We don't know the spacing on the Wolfcamp. I'll just take it as an example that we'll drill down to. So without a pilot, you won't see us just jumping out and booking a bunch of PUDs there. To the extent the Bone Spring is call bookable, those locations are kind of one leads to the next to the next to the next. And with that, it doesn't lend itself to a broad booking of PUD reserves. If we can get a pilot under our belts in the Wolfcamp, I certainly see us being in a position where we're going to feel comfortable doing that. And then most importantly, we're very strict about the 5-year rule with the SEC. What we book, we want to make sure we can drill within the 5 years. So to the extent it plays into our overall budget, it's going to have a role in their decision as well.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Jeb, what we will probably do here, as we get into the year, in the Permian, we'll probably do exactly what we did at Cana. Rather than go aggressive on PUD booking, we'll choose to be just more forthcoming of the inventory as we see it. And then let the investing public value it as they will. But we do take a fairly conservative viewpoint on actually booking PUDs, as Joe mentioned, for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the 5-year rule. But we'll be more forthcoming, I think, on what we see our future investment potential.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "And Tom, do you guys have an idea yet when you'd actually drill that down spacing pilot in the Wolfcamp?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It won't be this year. This year, what we are hoping to do is, one, get a Wolfcamp A and get a Wolfcamp C, D stacked lateral. But while we're -- I'd like to say next year, it will be on our list. We fully recognize that it's to our benefit to understand that spacing early on the play, not later. But right now, Jeb, we don't have it on the docket. It's not on our rig schedule.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cameron Horwitz.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Tom, I know you don\u2019t want to get into specifics on Reeves. But can you just give us the -- where you guys are in terms of HBP-ing that acreage and what you have to do to maintain that? I think you were at 35,000 acres there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we've only drilled a few wells. So you can kind of do your math there, that 160 million a year is to hold our acreage. So we're going to get after it, and our plan today is to hold that acreage primarily with Wolfcamp A drilling. I think that answers your question.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "It does, yes. And then just in terms of the well cost, do you expect well cost there to be similar to Wolfcamp [indiscernible]?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "So far, that's our viewpoint. I mean, we're looking forward to getting that drill time and cost down, but right now, a Wolfcamp A AFE, we see a 7, 7.2.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. It is right in the mid-7 range right now. But again, we're early in that play. So like any other play, we expect that to come down as we drill more of those wells.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. We look forward to seeing you in the future conferences, and report back to you next quarter. Thanks a lot. Talk to you later.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much, Denise, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. On the call today here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President, CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and John Lambuth, Vice President, Exploration.", "We did issue our financial and operating results this morning. A copy of our news release can be found on our website. And I need to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. And you should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and news releases for risks associated with our business. So we had a good quarter this quarter and a lot of details to cover, so I'll just go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to go over the highlights of the quarter before turning the call over to Joe and John for a more detailed look at our operations.", "We had a solid second quarter. Production averaged 687 million cubic feet equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our expectations. This represents growth of 16% over second quarter 2012. Our oil production increased an even greater 29%, averaging 36,878 barrels per day this quarter.", "Capital expenditures totaled $390 million, funded principally from our $322 million in cash flow from operating activities, $44 million in proceeds from asset sales and $22 million in bank debt. We still expect to invest about $1.5 billion in 2013 on high rate of return projects, primarily in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin and on the Cana-Woodford Shale. Our Permian program continues to provide great returns, and that's where we'll invest $950 million or about 63% of our capital this year.", "Our results have been particularly positive in the Horizontal Wolfcamp. In our Culberson County focus area, we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron, which greatly enhances the future development plan for this significant resource. We've also had encouraging results in the Wolfcamp and Reeves County, where 2 new wells had first 30-day production rates averaging 925 barrel of oil equivalent per day.", "It's -- ultimately, it's about execution and making sure that each of our major programs is performing. And how do we define performance? After-tax rate of return, maximizing net present value and building a portfolio that exposes Cimarex to profitable long-term growth. Ultimately, the long-term becomes a series of quarterly results, and results are what we like to talk about.", "There's been a lot of buzz this week around the Delaware Basin-Wolfcamp play. On this call, you'll hear about some of our excellent recent results in this trend in some detail. As we studied our results and studied those of our competitors, we've reassessed and enlarged our estimate of the potential this play holds for Cimarex. John will discuss these results and opportunities in more detail later in the call.", "We remain focused on ways to improve our returns in each of our areas. We've made wonderful strides in our drilling cost and drilling days, and we have opportunities to optimize, experiment and improve our completions. We also continue to generate new ideas with good long-term growth potential. We have an active leasing program underway in the Permian Basin and elsewhere, a leasing program that's grounded in our discipline of full-cycle return on invested capital. Cimarex is having a good year, we had a good second quarter, and we're looking forward to discussing it in detail on this call.", "Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all of you, for joining our call today. I'll touch on our second quarter production, update you on our third quarter guidance projections, and then follow up with a few words on our operating and service costs.", "As Tom mentioned, we had a good strong second quarter, with reported net equivalent daily volumes coming in at 686.7 million equivalent cubic feet per day, that's above the midpoint of our guidance of 667 million and -- to 692 million and up 16% over last year. When adjusting for our 2012 year-end property sale, we were up 19% as compared to 2012.", "We achieved this production growth despite seeing about 9 million to 10 million a day of downtime during the quarter, that being associated with ethane rejection in various plant and facility shut-ins, primarily in Permian and in Cana. If you look deeper into the numbers, our second quarter Mid-Continent volume came in at 343.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, up 14% or 43 million a day from Q2 '12. The increase was driven by Cana, which grew 38% year-over-year to 216.1 million a day during Q2 '13.", "That said, due primarily to ethane rejection and a lull in our second quarter Cana completion activity, our second quarter Mid-Continent production fell 5% from Q1 '13, where we reported a level of 360.6 million a day. With both our operated and non-operated Cana completion activity picking up steam again here during the second half of the year, we're projecting our Cana volumes to see an upward trend starting here -- later in Q3 and extending into Q4.", "In the Permian, our second quarter net equivalent volume of 319.6 million a day was up 29% or 72 million a day from a year ago. Our growth in the Permian has been driven all by oil. With Q2 Permian oil production averaging 30,137 barrels a day, that's up 8,113 barrels a day or 39% from last year. As compared to the first quarter of '13, our Permian net equivalent volume was up 44 million a day or 16%, while our net Permian oil volume was up an incremental 4,305 barrels a day, which exceeded Q1 by 17%.", "Jumping to guidance. Despite reducing our Q3 '13 projected volumes by approximately 12 million to 15 million a day for ethane rejection, the midpoint for our full year 2013 production range remains unchanged from our previous guidance of 690 million a day. Our tightened full year guidance range of 680 million to 700 million a day reflects a 9% to 12% increase over 2012, which when we adjust for property sales, equates to a healthy 11% to 14% year-over-year production growth.", "With ethane rejection built into our Q3 guidance, our forecasted Q3 NGL volumes have been reduced by about 2,500 barrels a day. That said, the projected drop in NGLs is being offset by higher forecasted oil production from the Permian. Our year-to-date Permian drilling results continued to exceed our original program projections. And as a result, we've revised our total company projected year-over-year increase in oil production, now twice during the year. From 1% to 5% at the beginning of the year to 13% in our last quarter call, and now to a respectable 13% to 16% increase over 2012.", "Shifting gears to OpEx. Our second quarter lifting cost came in at $1.11 per Mcfe, that's down $0.06 from our first quarter cost of $1.17 per Mcfe. During the quarter, our production team did a very nice job of keeping our total LOE in check. With that, however, we continue to see cost pressure in certain areas such as compression, power and fuel rework and maintenance, particularly, in light of our 2013 emphasis on stepping up our well reviews and lease inspections in order to optimize our production from, and the appearance of, our wells.", "With Q2 coming in at $1.11, our first half 2013 lifting cost comes in at $1.13 per Mcfe, and as such, we've made no change to our previous full year guidance range of $1.10 to $1.22 and see ourselves as having a good chance of coming in on the low end of that range by the end of the year.", "On the service cost side, with regard to drilling costs, we continue to see most cost compliments remain relatively in check. Day rates have held flat during the quarter. Although we are seeing signs of the softening market, with rig availability and offered well-to-well contracts, versus the term contracts, we saw, let's say, a year ago.", "In the Permian, although a high demand for tools and equipment can sometimes create a challenge, we've been able to procure that equipment, those services, all the while seeing our costs continue to remain flat. Through operating efficiencies, as Tom mentioned, we've made some good strides in our drilling program, and it's reflected itself in our drilling cost, especially in the Permian, where we've made slight modifications to program design and implemented more aggressive use of bit technology and downhole tools, which has really allowed us to reduce our drilling days.", "On the completion cost side, we've seen signs of market softening in the Permian, particularly, in the Delaware now, with more available horsepower and competition amongst the service providers. And as a result, our second quarter average, overall, per well Permian frac cost is down about 20% from Q1.", "The bottom line of all this is continued improvement in our Permian total well cost. Depending on debt, our current New Mexico 2nd Bone Spring AFEs are running $6.1 million to $6.7 million, that's down about $200,000 from last quarter. Our shallower Texas 2nd Bone Spring AFEs are running about $5.3 million to $5.5 million, that's down $200,000 to $400,000 from the numbers we quoted last call. And our Culberson-Wolfcamp wells are running flat to last quarter at $7 million to $7.5 million total well cost. That's down $1 million from where it was a year ago. And our West Texas 3rd Bone Spring AFEs, also held flat from Q1 at $6.4 million to $6.6 million. Again, that's down considerably from late last year.", "In Cana, our program drilling has kept our total well cost in check. They're running about $6.8 million, $6.9 million, that's down about a $0.5 million from last year. The bottom line is we've made good strides to get our well costs down. And along the way, we've set some milestones we're proud of in our active programs, which we believe are competing well with our peers.", "So in a nutshell, Tom talks about results. I mentioned 3 of them in our call here today. Our production continues to grow. It's a positive result. We've trimmed our lifting costs down during Q2, likewise, and have made some tremendous strides in controlling and reducing our drilling and completion cost. All of these are certainly pointing in what we believe to be the right direction.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration.", "John A. Lambuth", "Thanks, Joe. I'll cover some of the specifics of our Permian and Cana drilling programs. We had an active first half of 2013. We've completed 179 gross, 95 net wells this year, investing $800 million in exploration and development capital. 65% of our capital was invested in the Permian basin, while 33% with the Mid-Continent region.", "We still expect our total annual exploration development capital to be approximately $1.5 billion for 2013. As planned, our capital investment has been front-end loaded this year.", "In the second half of the year, our Cana capital will be down slightly as a result of going from 4 to 2 rigs. Also in Culberson County, our capital will be lower in the second half as a result of the joint development agreement we signed with Chevron.", "I'm going to first start with our Mid-Continent region. This year, we've drilled and completed 87 gross, 35 net Mid-Continent wells, essentially, all of which were in the Cana-Woodford shale play. In Cana, we've drilled and completed 74 gross, 31 net wells, most of which have been operated by our partners. We currently have 2 operated rigs working in Cana. Including non-operated activity, we're on track to drill and complete slightly more than 50 net wells this year.", "Our Cana capital is projected to be just over $350 million for this year, of which, about approximately $250 million would be attributable to the nonoperating part for the program. Our returns in Cana for this year are tracking about where we expected in the mid to low 20% after-tax internal rate of return.", "I'm going to move on now to the Permian Basin. Permian Basin is our most active area. We've drilled and completed 90 gross, 59 net Permian basin wells this year. Most of our drilling has been focused on the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. We've had a very active New Mexico Bone Spring program, where we've drilled and completed 42 gross, 23 net wells. This program continues to deliver very strong results for us. Our per-well first 30-day gross production from these wells averaged approximately 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, 85% was oil.", "In our Ward County, Texas 3rd Bone Spring program, we drilled 21 gross, 15 net wells, with a per-well first 30-day average gross production rate of approximately 965 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These wells were 80% oil of that production. This program also continues to deliver great results for us.", "I'm going to now move on over to our Culberson County, Texas focus area. As Tom mentioned, Culberson County and our adjoining acreage in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico has become a key area for us. We continue to drill Wolfcamp C and D, as well as 2nd Bone Spring wells here in this area. We also still see additional upside in the Wolfcamp Bay, as well as the shallower Delaware Sand interval.", "Year-to-date, we've drilled 9 gross, 6 net Bone Spring wells, which have had a per-well first 30-day average gross production of 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day and were 58% oil. We currently have 2 rigs drilling 2nd Bone Spring wells in this area. Depths are less than 8,000 feet, and we're able to drill these wells in about 20 days. Well costs are now around $5.3 million to $5.5 million. These wells, with that type of well cost, generate great returns, as good as any of our Bone Spring drilling program throughout the Delaware Basin.", "Moving onto the Wolfcamp. We've drilled 8 gross, 6 net horizontal Wolfcamp wells in Culberson County in 2013. This brings total wells in the area to 39 gross, 35 net, per-well first 30-day production rates on all of the Wolfcamp wells drilled to date in this area have averaged 6.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day comprised of 43% gas, 27% oil and 30% NGL, assuming full NGL recovery.", "At the end of the second quarter, we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron. This agreement will enable us to be more efficient in our field development, as well as enable us to start drilling long laterals. In fact, regarding long laterals, earlier this year, we drilled a 7,500-foot extended lateral, which achieved the first 30-day IP rate of 8.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We have about 5 months of production history on this well, and we expect about a 50% after-tax rate of return based on the results we see. Because of this well, as well as now having that Chevron JDA in place, we are now planning a 10,000-foot lateral we'll be drilling in the third quarter of this year. We also continue to plan a Wolfcamp D downspacing pilot, which now looks like it will probably begin in the first quarter of 2014.", "Moving on the Reeves County, Texas. We drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp Bay wells. The first 30-day production rates were 983 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 865 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This production is comprised of 63% oil, 20% NGL and 17% gas. These are really good wells with 30-day averages of 600 barrels of oil per day plus another few hundred barrels equivalent of NGLs and gas. We have also now drilled a 2-mile lateral in Reeves County, which we recently finished frac-ing, and we're currently in the process of flowing back. Our plan is to drill an additional 5 Wolfcamp wells in Reeves County over the remainder of this year.", "So wrapping it up, we're having a great year. Our team, as always, are focused on maximizing returns on our drilling, and they are doing a great job. As we stand now, we see at least 200 to 300 remaining Bone Spring Sand locations in Texas and New Mexico, with further upside for the Avalon in New Mexico.", "As for the Wolfcamp, we have a very strong land position. If you look at the Wolfcamp trend going from our Southern Eddy County Culberson area, and then move over into Reeves and further into Ward County, we have over 170,000 net acres under lease. Quite frankly, that number could actually even be bigger just based on some of the more recent results that we're seeing from other companies.", "Narrowing into our Culberson and Southern Eddy County area, which accounts for around 100,000 net acres of the 170,000 that I mentioned, we have significant future potential there. Depending on spacing and whether we require multiple stack laterals, there could be several thousand locations just in this area. And then moving back in the Reeves County, where we have over 40,000 acres, we've seen some very encouraging results from our first 2 wells we've drilled, and thus, there could be ultimately hundreds of locations located just in this area as well.", "In summary, we have a huge amount of future drilling locations in the Permian Basin, not to mention the thousands of wells we still have to drill yet in the Cana area as well. Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Phil Jungwirth of BMO Capital Markets.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The oil cut in the 2 Reeves County wells was a little bit higher than what I think a lot of us expected, given some of the industry results to date. What would you attribute that to? And then do you expect to see much variability in the GOR across your 40,000 acres?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, let's keep in mind, it is only 2 wells, and they are fairly close to each other geographically. Whereas there's a wide distribution of wells that never reported [ph] over a broad area. So I think it's safe to say that as we drill more wells, there will certainly be variability in that GOR. I don't know that we really have it dialed down yet, that we understand it just yet. But again, I think, what you're seeing is some of the variability over a broad geographic area, so far.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then on your Ward-Winkler County area acreage, where you've historically targeted the 3rd Bone Spring, we've had some industry results also targeting the Wolfcamp last week. Do you have rights to the Wolfcamp? And if so, do you have any plan to test that later this year or next year?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, this is Tom. The answer is, we have fairly significant exposure to the Wolfcamp in that area. As John said, we've revised our acreage numbers upward to our exposure in that trend. And a lot of that revision is based on some of those recent industry results. So the answer is yes, we do have exposure, and we do have plans to test and develop it.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Just wanted to actually just stay on that first topic for a second. The Reeves wells, you mentioned 5 more this year, these first 2 being pretty close together. Is there going to be more geographic variability from the remaining 5? Or are they all going to be pretty close together this year, and then spread out as we go forward?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Brian, this is Tom. One of the interesting things that we really like about the Permian Basin is it's not a basin where you have to create every new data point. You have a lot of competition helping you out. And there's been a lot of results that have been announced by our competitors out there. And if you take our acreage position and you plot all the other results that have been announced, it really does help define our position. The oil cut is encouragingly high for much of Reeves County. The GOR changes, a fair amount, as you go across from east to west, but based on our other industry competitors, we're going to be testing a fair amount of our geography. But we feel pretty confident that now, if we just talk about Reeves County, our acreage is in several different pockets, but we have a fairly concentrated acreage position in Reeves County, we're currently up over 40,000 net acres, we're adding to it. We're in the process of developing takeaway solutions. And that's worked its underway there. But we're planning on -- we see most of that acreage -- in fact, I'll say most, if not all, of that acreage, is pretty well delineated by our drilling and that of our competitors. Now we'd prefer to be talking about our own results and not those of our competitors, but we're pretty encouraged by how that points to our acreage.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "That's great. And then the oil growth, obviously, great for the quarter, seeing it bump up a couple of times this year already, obviously, is good as well. What sort of expectations for the back half of the year baked into the new guidance. Are you expecting continued improvement, because it seems like it's difficult not to continue to improve that. Is that 13% to 16% a conservative number on your viewpoint? Or does it give you room for -- or the need to continue to grow that -- to hit that number for the year, as far as what you're seeing on results?", "Mark Burford", "This is Mark Burford. We have been undershooting what we expected or hope growth will be for the year. Pretty consistently, we continue to try to retune that up and make it more fine. We're not trying to sandbag our numbers, but we do expect continued good growth in the Permian in the second half of the year, and, hence, good consistent growth in oil as part of that -- being a big part of that program. So I mean, I don't think the 4,000 barrels a day we grew from the first to second will trail in the second half. That was a pretty normally high growth rate first or second. But we should see a good continual growth in order for us to hit that new upward band of our 13% kind of growth -- 13%, 16% gross for oil. So we should see good growth second half of the year, Brian.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Joe Magner of Macquarie Capital.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "I just wondered if you might be able to dive into some of the results that you're seeing out of the Culberson County-Wolfcamp C and D. It looks like the -- at least some the statistics you've provided in the release have moved around a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I'm just curious if you can maybe discuss some of the relative performance between those 2 different zones?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. I think what you're seeing is we keep showing the averages, and of course, as we drill additional wells, those averages change. I think also what you're seeing is both on those averages, whether we're in C or D, but also just geographic, we are still stepping out in some ways in part of Culberson. And sometimes the step outs are very good, and sometimes they're not as good, and that does affect the average overall performance there. In terms of just C and D itself, we definitely see a higher yield, a higher NGL content in the C relative to the D. But I would also say that we're still kind of early. We don't have as many D wells as we do C, and we're still trying to just get a better handle on what that ultimate production will be like in the D and -- I mean, excuse me, in the C. We're far more comfortable with the D wells, because that's where the majority of our wells have been so far. It still looks good. It's just -- we still need a few more wells online to get a better feel for how good the C will be relative to the D.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Joe, this is Tom. If I could just add to what John said. We've talked in the past about the C being higher yield but lower absolute rates because of that yield. So some of that is an overprint of a mixture of C and D results. We're still seeing very good returns out of both those benches. One of the things, I talked to my opening remarks about completion optimization. And we're really just at the advent of a lot of opportunity in this trend. Our wells have still been essentially for garden variety 5,000 foot lateral, we're pumping 12 stages. And we need to -- we do have plans to experiment with more stages. And I think that we yet, couldn't pound the table on any bench as to what we think it's ultimate potential's going to be. It's a very fixed section. There's tremendous resource in place, and we have a lot of work yet to do. I'm sure somebody is going to ask us about the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. We still don't have our well down and completed yet, so it's drilling now. And that's another very seminal test for us in defining the potential of the area. So very encouraging results, but we yet are still calibrating the ultimate potential of this area.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Good. I guess with my one follow up. Any plans, I guess, what are the latest plans of timing on when you might drill a stacked C and D lateral, like those and other testing initiatives that you had talked about pursuing?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. The stacked C and D lateral is scheduled to be drilled in the fourth quarter of this year. We have a location picked, and we are moving forward with that. And so that will be drilled in the fourth quarter with completion flowback. We really won't be able to say much about that until probably second quarter next year, but we are moving ahead with that for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a few quick questions for me. In terms of the 7,500-foot lateral, could you give us an idea of the well cost there? And then, over time, how you guys think about the well cost in the Wolfcamp in terms of the potential to move those costs down as you get more towards the development program?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. I don't have the actual well cost right in front of me. But by memory, we were right around in the 8.5 range for that well. We were very pleased with that well as far as the drilling of it. We can get back to you for sure with the actual cost, just to make sure I'm close on that. But it drilled very well, it completed well, we were very pleased with the results of that well. And now, again, with that Chevron agreement in place, we now have the freedom, so to speak, to now go and push it to 10,000-foot, which is essentially the beauty of that agreement, enabling us to combine those adjacent sections in that way. So that's what we're moving forward to. Again, we're very, very pleased with results of that well. And we think going to 10,000, we think we can get even better type results. Because once we get in that lateral, the drilling goes very fast. So it doesn't add that much more in the way of days to go another 2,500 feet. So we're pretty excited about the potential for that well.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. I'll just make a quick comment on that. The majority of the cost increase we anticipate to see, as John mentioned, we're making tremendous time in the laterals using rotary steerable tools. And so what it really comes down to, it's a completion. And there are stages that are associated with the the longer lateral like that.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And as we compare the Delaware Basin drilling program to maybe what we're seeing from offset operators in the Midland Basin, do you think ultimately that the longer laterals in higher stage completions will be utilized on the wells you're drilling today. And in terms of the wells we've seen to date, I just wanted to make sure I clarified that, those wells have been drilled on 5,000 foot laterals with 12 stages, is that correct?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. That is correct. As Tom alluded to, up until now, we've kind of stuck with the same type of completion program. In some ways, that makes sense because we're trying to derisk that area. But quite frankly now, we're at a point now where we're looking to maximize returns with every well we drill. So the things that we will be testing in the near future are as just Tom alluded to, on a 5,000-foot lateral, we'll certainly go to more stages, 20 stages, if not slightly more. Likewise, when we then scale up to a longer lateral, a 10,000-foot lateral, then there's a good chance again that we'll be scaling up in the stages in that as well. The 7,500-foot lateral would have essentially had the same equivalent stage with -- as with a 5,000. So we really didn't change that design as much as all we did is added additional stages for that length. So there's definitely some additional upside here with the improvement in our frac design in this program.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Again, we hope to be able to discuss particular results in future calls. We're flowing our 10,000-foot lateral in Reeves County back now. We'll have 10,000-foot lateral in Culberson County. But based on our existing 7,500-foot lateral, as John said, we think we see this as having the potential, which is our current completion design, to be north of 15% after-tax rate of return. And so we see a lot of upside on that number. So yes, we're very optimistic. We're forging ahead as fast as we can. But this sure looks does like it's working and working well.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just my last question on the back of that. In terms of your capital program as we look out over the next few years, from a philosophical perspective, if you start to generate these high rates of return with potentially very repeatable asset base here, how do you think about capital outspend over the next few years in terms of accelerating the Permian? Has your view changed at all in terms of the way that you're willing to flex your balance sheet?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, this is Tom. I'll take it from the back -- you asked question first. Our view hasn't changed at all. We are very willing to invest capital if we can do it with a good rate of return and making sure that with reasonable commodity downside protection, we don't destroy capital. And so we run our commodity downside, as well as $60 oil, and we look at flat $3 gas, flat forever on both commodities, less local D there [ph]. If we can get a good return on capital, we're very confident that, that's indeed the case, we will accelerate. And so we're looking at just that case in the Permian now. And with the opportunities that we have in front of us, with the balance sheet we have available to us, I would say accelerating this program in future years is not off the table for us, it's under act of consideration.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was hoping you can talk about the potential for other Wolfcamp zones in your Reeves and Ward County acreage, below, I guess, what the Wolfcamp Bay you've tested so far?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. As we mentioned, our first 2 wells were A tests. And even the long lateral we drilled has been an A test. That said, we are aware of a couple of competitor wells that had been located in the deeper C, D interval. And indeed, we have -- I'm aware of at least one test coming up, but we'll be testing that interval on our acreage. So yes, we recognize it as an opportunity, and we will be testing it with the well here coming up soon.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And on the Ward County acreage, do you have any concerns that there may be depletion in the Wolfcamp over there due to your fairly extensive 3rd Bone Spring drilling?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. I'll start with that question. I'll just simply say, as we look at it, the Wolfcamp is a pretty thick interval. And we see that there is quite a bit of vertical separation that we can achieve, where we can put a lateral and separate ourself from that third 3rd Bone lateral that we feel comfortable, at least going forward, in testing that. I'll put it that way. But there is an uncertainty there, I won't deny that.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So do you see Wolfcamp B, C, D on that Ward County acreage as well?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes -- I can't -- I just -- I'll just say that we see Wolfcamp intervals. I'm not as familiar with that right now. I mean, we see its perspective. I'll put it that.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "This is Tom. I just want to caution -- this is a blocking- and tackling-type project. It's very difficult to wave your arms at this type of expanse and make simple rules. The Wolfcamp B that works very well in Culberson County, there are places in Reeves County, where it'll produce too much water to be economically perspective. So we're -- what we've talked about today, with the acreage potential, the well potential, we are absolutely confident on that. Now could it be better? You bet. But we're just not going to look at that section and say, \"Hey, let's do acreage math and run with it.\" It's too complex. That's the way --- we look at it as very detailed. And we'd certainly encourage everybody to understand. It's very dangerous to wave your arms around this type of real estate.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just following up on Reeves. Can you just remind us what your drilling requirements are to hold acreage there, maybe over the next 12 months? And then also, as you and other producers in the area start to ramp up production, can you give us an update as to where infrastructure stands today as well?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. I'll take the first part of the question. In regards to Reeves and holding our acreage, we have about -- well, we need to spend about $170 million drilling program next year. And with that program, we'll be in good shape to hold all of our acreage in that area. And that's, obviously, very doable for us. As far as the marketing, I'll hand it to Joe.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. We have, right now, currently an infrastructure in place that we feel can accommodate the short-term going schedule. And we are currently, also, working with purchasers and processors in the area to attain more firm capacity to deliver gas for processing. As far as salt water disposal goes, we're aggressively looking at the drill schedule, and what we need to do to get ahead of that from a SWD perspective.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got you. And I know you guys took the acreage up in the last few months from 35,000 to 40,000. Are you still seeing opportunities to add there?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. Yes, the answer is yes. We are still actively pursuing additional acreage. Obviously, with all these competitors and their release, it gets -- it's getting a little bit tougher, but absolutely. We are still aggressively trying to pursue more acreage.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Gil Yang of DISCERN.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "To follow on Jason's question there. How much is acreage costing that you're adding in that area?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Gil, this is Tom. We're just not prepared to talk about what we're paying for acreage. I would say to our competitors, it's way too expensive, and you probably don't want to afford it.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Fair enough. And could you characterize it? Is it filling in chunks of holes within the acreage blocks you have? Or is it also trying to expand the overall footprint?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Again, Gil, we're in a competitive situation. And I'm just going to pass on that. We have an active acreage acquisition program this year, and we're building. So if you'll just indulge me to be that vague.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Fair enough, Tom. I may have missed it, but how much are your -- those Reeves County well costing?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, they should be a little bit more expensive. They're a little bit -- this is Joe. they're a little bit deeper, so I'd probably tack on another $500,000 to $750,000 to our regular Wolfcamp.", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. I guess, I have more recent information, because we're just looking at decisions the other day on this wells. And that particular AFE was around $7.3 million. It is what I recall for our latest Reeves County-Wolfcamp well.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "That was a -- was that a 10,000 foot lateral or?", "John A. Lambuth", "No, no that was not. And, in fact, I should just go and stand corrected now. On our 7,500-foot lateral in Culberson, our actual costs were, actually, more in the $10 million range, not $8.5 million. And I want to stand corrected on that. So around $10 million, $10.5 million is what we spent there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But those return on capital numbers were fully [indiscernible].", "John A. Lambuth", "No, no those -- no, absolutely. The return on capital is definitely against that actual well cost. I want to be clear about that.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Okay. All right, so $7.3 million for the Reeves 5,000-foot lateral and $10 million for the 7,500-foot Culberson lateral?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's our actual. That's not -- we're getting better. So that -- we're just quoting our actual and we're -- our landscape of improving results.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "And then just last question. You mentioned early on that the completion cost, I think, are coming down. Is that because of additions to pumping capacity in the area? Or is it -- that other operators are beginning to slow their activity down or changing the mix of what they're doing?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. I'll answer that. It's really due to, I think, what I'd call a competition moving over from the Midland Basin into the Delaware Basin. The majority of our cost decrease have come on both the service side and the material side. And, really, a result of just having more competition and available horsepower in the Delaware.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But you know, Gil, I want -- I think about completion cost a little differently. I think about drilling cost. There's no argument on why you wouldn't want your drilling cost to be as cheap as it can be, given that you're having a good clean, safe operation. Completions are a little different, because as we optimize, we've talked about going from 12 to 20 stages on a type -- 5,000-foot lateral. We may elect to spend more in our completions if we think that those are generating superior returns. So I wouldn't necessarily look to see our completion cost uniformly come down. That's a decision we'll make based on optimizing the performance.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Ray Deacon of Brean Capital.", "Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about expectations for the oil NGL split for the remainder of the year? It seems like you're a good bit higher than your guidance that you gave out at the beginning of the year and just wondering what the second half would look like?", "Mark Burford", "Do you want to do that?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "The other one [ph]...", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Ray. So yes, our first -- our oil component has been going up. That's right. The growth is being faster in oil. But our split is about 50 -- our split last year was up 31% oil, 8% NGL, 53% gas. And we should be up slightly. This quarter, we are closer to what -- we are at 30% -- excuse me, actually, I'm finding my split in front of me here. But our percent of oil should go up by 1% or 2% through the range of the year, and with the -- 50% gas, 32% oil, 18% NGLs. The percent of oil might tick up 1-or-so percent rate for the second half of the year for the full year.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. The only thing I'd add to that is, in our modeling, we've assumed ethane rejection for Q3, but don't know anything about Q4 enough to feel comfortable making an estimate there. So to the effect ethane rejection occurs in Q4, that could skew some of those numbers.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "I guess a question for John. John, can you just -- can you do a little comparison on Wolfcamp A, seeing Culberson versus what you saw on Reeves. I mean, it seems like operators are seeing better productivity and potentially some higher oil yields moving up in the zone, in the Wolfcamp in Reeves County. And was there -- do you think that'll be analogous to what happens in Culbertson?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, this is John. I sure hope so. As Tom stated, we're drilling that well right now. And yes, I mean, if I would to state what our expectations is, I think that's what we'd hope to see. All I can say is, just as we look at it from our logs and from the subsurface, we like to look at the A in Culberson. But I don't have a well producing there to tell you whether it's good or not. That's why we're doing it. And so, hopefully, we'll have results here by -- at some point that we can talk about, and be very proud of. But that's where we are right now. We're drilling the well, and that's what we're hoping that the results will be.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I appreciate it. And Reeves County, and I know it's still early there, but I think one of those wells, you'll probably have a little bit more extended production history on. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think that curve is going to shakeout? I mean, is it similar to what you see in Culberson?", "John A. Lambuth", "I would say, like for any of the shale wells, so far, they have a decline profile that, that's not unexpected. I mean, that they are declining about how we'd expect them to. Again, a lot of these shale wells are really somewhat dependent upon those early 30-day IP rates. That's really a telltale sign of how good a well you have. And as you can tell, we have some pretty good 30-day rates, so we're very pleased with those wells so far. And so far, based on the production, we like it enough that we're going to commit to the amount of capital I talked about next year, the $170 million, to hold it. It's looking good so far.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, and I just want to underscore, we only talk about 30-day rates. I know a lot of people are out there talking about peak rates, 24-hour IP, our experience is the only rate that's really meaningful in evaluating the quality of well is that 30-day average. And we've got very, very solid, very good 30-day averages.", "John A. Lambuth", "I would concur. Yes.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Burford for any closing remarks.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much for joining us today. Appreciate the interest and look forward to continue reporting our results to you in the coming quarters. And I hope to see you at conferences coming up, here in Denver, next week, EnerCom and then further into the fall. But thanks, everyone, for your interest, and I look forward to seeing you soon.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Burford. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, Chad. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. On today's call here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and John Lambuth, Vice President of Exploration; and Karen Acierno, Director of IR.", "We did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website, and I need to remind you today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings, and news releases for the risks associated -- factors associated with our business.", "So with that, we have a lot of good things to cover today. I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Mark, and I want to thank all of you for participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'm going to take a few minutes here at the outset to touch on some of our highlights for the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to John and Joe for a more detailed update.", "We reported another great quarter of production, averaging 717 million cubic feet a day, which was above the upper end of our guidance. Solid production, coupled with strong product prices led to adjusted cash flow from operations of $394 million, which was more than enough to fund our exploration development expenditures for the quarter. Our debt-to-cap stand at 19%, a slight drop from June 30, as our debt increased only slightly while strong earnings added to our shareholder equity. Operationally, this has been an exciting year for Cimarex and the third quarter was no exception. I want to complement our entire organization for delivering these results. We're a focused team. We're a talented team, and everybody's dedicated to bring it for our shareholders, and it really was a nice quarter. We have a great group of people throughout our organization, and they're firing on all cylinders. We're able to report very encouraging results from 2 new complete -- 2 completion techniques in the Wolfcamp, and I'll touch on that in a moment.", "In Culberson County, we completed the Tim Tam well to the Wolfcamp diesel in using a 5,000 foot lateral and a 20-stage frac. This is the new completion technique that we've talked about. The incremental cost of $700,000 provided us with a 25% uplift to the 30-day IP rate [indiscernible]. That rate increased to 7.8 million cubic feet a day compared to our historical Wolfcamp results of 6.2 million cubic feet a day. That well is 31% oil, 30% natural gas liquids and 39% gas. So it's a stellar well. As most of you are aware, the Wolfcamp is especially attractive in Culberson County because of the stacked pay potential offered in the Wolfcamp D, C and A sections. During the third quarter, we drilled our first Wolfcamp A test in Culberson, and although we don't yet have a 30-day IP, the early results look very encouraging. This well is also completed using the 20-stage frac design. We'll release the specifics on this well when we have 30 days of production. Obviously, as I said, we're encouraged, but we find 30 days to be a more meaningful number than in the instantaneous so we're going to defer the release of that.", "In Reeves County, we announced the Ruby 139H, a Wolfcamp A test, using a 10,000-foot lateral. It's a stellar well with a 30-day IP of 1,816 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% of which is oil, which is over 1,000 barrels a day on average for its first 30 days. This compares favorably with our previous 2 Wolfcamp A wells in Reeves that were completed using 5,000-foot laterals and had an average 30-day IP of 925 barrel of oil equivalent per day, which was 63% oil. The Wolfcamp play is continuing expanding in the Delaware Basin. It's moving east where the Wolfcamp A thickens. It's moving into the Ward County area where we've historically had our Third Bone Spring development. In September, Cimarex added 10,000 acres in Ward County. We now have 1 rig drilling wells in Ward County. So we have a nice position there. This is really an exciting emerging play for us, and as we get more data, we're getting more and more excited about it. So far, we drilled 44 Wolfcamp wells on our 180,000 net perspective Wolfcamp acres, and it's fair to say we're just getting started.", "We haven't released our 2014 capital guidance yet. But as we look into 2014, I'll say, we're really looking at 2014 in this Wolfcamp play with several different goals. We want to continue to hold our acreage. We want to delineate the play and really understand the extent of it, but we also are asking ourselves question of working our program so that by December of 2014, we'll be able to have the information we need to make ultimate development decisions. And that means information on spacing, both laterally and vertically, so we need to know are we at 80-acre spacing, are we at 40-acre spacing, are we at 160-acre spacing. How many zones that applies to and can we stack them on top of one another. So in 2014, we'll have quite a few different pilot projects going, quite a few different stack lateral projects going. And by the end of the year, we'll have the information we need to make good investment decisions on the structure of the project and the timing as we go to down spacing. We have long-term plans that we're currently formulating, and we have to make those plan so that we plan our infrastructure. We plan on our financing. We plan on our ultimate development. So it's an exciting emerging play. It's one that, obviously, our recent results are making look better and better, and these tests go a long way in getting Cimarex the information we'll need to make development decisions for 2015 and beyond. We look forward to sharing those results with you as we go.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth to discuss our drilling results in a little more detail.", "John A. Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I'll cover some of the specifics of our Permian and Mid-Continent drilling programs. Cimarex has had an active 2013 program, investing $1.2 billion to drill 291 gross, 147 net wells so far this year. 65% of that investment was in the Permian Basin with another 31% going to our Mid-Continent region. We estimate our total E&D capital this year will be around $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, up slightly from our last call, mostly as a result of the expansion success of our leasing efforts in the Permian region.", "I'm going to first cover the Mid-Continent area. The Cana-Woodford Shale play continues to drive activity in our Mid-Continent region. So far this year, we've participated in 134 Cana-Woodford wells, and estimate that Cana will represent $400 million of the $475 million we'll spend in Mid-Continent capital this year. Including non-op activity, we're on track to drill and complete about 35 net wells in Cana in 2013.", "As Joe will discuss in further detail, well costs in Cana have dropped significantly, which is having a positive impact on our returns in this liquid-rich gas area. Cimarex is now operating 3 rigs in Cana. One more operated rig is actually scheduled to begin drilling later this month, bringing our total operating rig count to 4. We are adding these rigs to keep pace with our partners development plans between now and end of the year. Our intention is to move these 2 new rigs down to the Permian Basin by the end of this year.", "Speaking of the Permian Basin. We've drilled and completed 132 gross, 87 net Permian Basin wells this year. Our drilling program has been focused on the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. We've had a very active Bone Spring program in 2013. We have drilled and completed 106 gross Bone Spring wells in New Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the company's highest rate of returns, with oil representing up to 84% of first 30-day production. I'll refer you to the press release or most recent presentations for specifics on each of the Bone Spring programs results year-to-date.", "We have around 200 to 300 Bone Spring locations identified, the majority of these located in Culberson County, where we have identified a thick, highly productive Second Bone Spring sand. In fact, during this past quarter, we finished drilling 5 new -- or essentially 5 wells per section in the Second Bone Spring interval, essentially new development wells in addition to the existing initial well. The performance of these new development wells is on par with the original wells. We're very encouraged with those results in that play.", "Moving on to the Wolfcamp. Culberson County has a number of very exciting developments, including upsized fracs and a Wolfcamp A test. As Tom mentioned, we have drilled our first Wolfcamp A well in Culberson, and completed it using a 20-stage frac. The well named the Twenty Grand 26 #1H is currently flowing back, and as anticipated, has a higher liquid yield in the C or D interval. This is the second well we've completed using this upsized frac design. We've also completed the Tim Tam 24 #1H with the larger 20-stage frac. This Wolfcamp D test has a 30-day average rate of 7.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which, as Tom mentioned, has a 25% increase over our average Wolfcamp D well. At a drilling complete cost of $8.7 million, this well generates an A-tax rate of return of over 40%, a very good result.", "Moving now East in the Reeves County, we drilled and completed the Ruby 139H, a 10,000-foot lateral drilled into Wolfcamp A. As mentioned, this is a stellar well with first 30-day IP average production of 1,816 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, 21% NGLs and 23% gas. Of note though is the 60-day average rate, which is holding in at 1,728 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 58% oil. This, again, is typical of what we've seen from our log laterals, and that we see slower declines from these type of wells. This is pretty amazing well, especially considering it's not even using our newest stimulation. This was our old stimulation for this well. We'll be watching this performance as well as trying upsized fracs in the other Reeves County wells to better gauge how to achieve the best completions going forward.", "Our teams are doing a great job of focusing on maximizing returns on our drilling and generating future drilling inventory. We have a strong land position, including 180,000 acres in what we call the Wolfcamp fairway, which extends from our Southern Eddy Culberson area over to Reeves, and continues into Ward County. We have lots going on across our acreage. In Culberson County, we're currently drilling our first 10,000-foot lateral in the Wolfcamp D interval, and are planning a stacked Wolfcamp CD test, as well as a down space pilot for the first quarter of 2014. We continue to add acreage, as Tom mentioned, Ward County, where there, we'll soon be testing Wolfcamp A wells and currently plan to have 1 rig drilling continuously in that area. We have also found the completion technique that looks like it could potentially unlock the Avalon Shale on a portion of our acreage. We look forward to continue testing of the oil Avalon in Southeast of Mexico. Wrapping up this exciting time at Cimarex, we have a great asset base, and are well positioned to take advantage of this significant opportunity set. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Well, thank you, John, and thank you, all of you for joining our call today. I'll touch on the typical items, our third quarter production, update you on our fourth quarter guidance projections, and then I'll follow up with a few words on our operating and service cost.", "As Tom mentioned, we had a great quarter. Our Q3 volumes came in at a record $717 million a day. That was well above the upper end of our guidance of $675 million to $700 million a day. It was up 30 million a day from last quarter, and up 13% from Q3 last year. If we adjust for the property sale that we had at the end of last year, which equated to about 15 million a day of production during Q3 '12, we were up 16% from the third quarter of '12. Although we saw limited impacts from plant facility downtime during the quarter, we did continue to see ethane rejection in Cana, which reduced our quarterly equivalent volumes by approximately 12 million to 14 million a day. We're anticipating that to continue, at least, for the remainder of this year and we, therefore, built that type of reduction into our fourth quarter guidance.", "As we dig deeper in the details, our Q3 Mid-Continent volume of 338 million a day was up 4% from Q3 last year when we reported 324 million a day. Cana drove the increase, continues to drive the increase. Cana came in at 217 million a day here in our Q3 '13. That's an 18% increase from a year ago. Sequentially, our Q3 Mid-Continent production was down 1% from the second quarter level of 343 million a day, but we had a couple of factors coming into play here.", "First, we saw ethane rejection for the entirety of the third quarter as compared to just 2 months in Q2. And secondly, the majority of our production adds from our operated Cana completions came on in late Q3, and therefore, Q3 didn't see the full benefit of that increase in production. In the Permian, our reported net equivalent volume of 352 million a day was up 28% or 77 million a day from Q3 '12. Permian oil production was the driver here. We averaged nearly 32,000 barrels a day from the Permian, oil-wise, during Q3. That's up nearly 7,000 barrels a day from a year ago or up 28% from last year.", "As compared to the second quarter, we also saw significant growth with our Permian equivalent volumes up 10% or 32 million a day, and our Permian oil volumes up 6% or 1,856 barrels a day. All of this, a direct result of our very active Delaware Basin program. With our strong third quarter and the positive overall results of our programs, as you've noted, we bumped our 2013 full year guidance range to 695 million to 700 million a day. That increases the mid-year of our full year guidance to 698 million a day. That's a nice jump from our previous midpoint estimate of 690 million a day, especially when considering they were incorporating anywhere from 12% to 15% -- 12 million to 15 million a day of reduction into our fourth quarter numbers due to ethane rejection in Cana.", "With our fourth quarter guidance projection of 714 million to 734 million a day, we anticipate yet another quarter of sequential growth for Q4, albeit not forecasted to be as strong a jump as we saw from Q2 to Q3, and there's a few things that work here as well. In addition to varying working interest, rates, product types, recoveries, projected timing to first sales for all the wells that we'll complete during the quarter, we slipped in the drilling of a salt water disposal well into one of our Permian rig lines, which took the slot of a producer. And we have accounted for some likely downtime for the maintenance of our triple crown system later in the quarter. The end result, when it does settle, however, is that we will see continued significant quarter-to-quarter production growth for Q4, again, a direct result of our activity in both the Permian and Cana.", "We're pretty proud of where we see ourselves ending the year. With the full year guidance range of 695 million to 700 million a day, we're projecting year-over-year production growth of 11% to 12% as compared to 2012. If we account for the property sales at the end of last year, we're projected to be upwards of 14% year-over-year with our production growth.", "On the LOE side, our Q3 lifting cost came in at $1.15 per Mcfe, slightly below the midpoint of our full year guidance range, which was $1.10 to $1.22, and fairly well in line with our Q1 average of $1.17 and our Q2 average of $1.11, although we're seeing some cost pressure for our increased activity for the most part in items such as SWD, compression, power, fuel and rentals, our operations group has done a good job keeping our lifting cost in check, I'd say so, especially in the Permian, where we generally see higher operating expenses for items such as lift, compression and SWD. In fact, with our focus on LOE over the last 3 years, we've been able to reduce our Permian lifting cost from $1.88 per Mcfe in 2011 to $1.50 in 2012, and we're currently on track to see levels of around $1.47 here for 2013.", "So with Q3 coming in at $1.15 per Mcfe, we did end up tightening our 2013 lifting cost guidance range to $1.11 to $1.16. That did drop our midpoint to $1.14 for the year, and that's down $0.02 from our previous projection. With regard to service cost, we continue to see most drilling costs components remaining relatively in check, it's been that way for the last 2-plus quarters. Day rates continue to hold flat with rigs still available, and there does seem to be ample availability of tools, equipment and services for each of our programs. With flat cost for most of the year, the cost reductions we've seen to date have come through our operating efficiencies. We continue to focus on cutting down days to drill, and we've made some pretty good strides, especially in the Permian. As an example, we continue to use of bit technology and rotary steerables during Q3. We decreased the average days to TD in our Culberson Second Bone program down to 15 days, which is a drop from 17 days in Q2 and a drop from 25 days in late 2012.", "On the completion side, we've had no difficulty securing frac equipment and crude, and we continue to experiment with different frac designs. In general, our per well frac cost have stayed fairly well in check, with this partially offsetting the cost of larger jobs with increased efficiencies and reduced material costs. In Cana, after numerous years of program drilling, we continue to see cost improvement. Our recent core wells are now falling in the range of $6.5 million. That's a marked improvement from last quarter when we quoted total well cost of $6.8 million, and well below the $7 million to $7.5 million levels we saw in late 2012 as cost reductions, as John mentioned, have had a significant impact on generating some nice healthy rate of returns in the Cana program. In the Permian, our most mature Second and Third Bone Spring programs have seen the greatest benefit from program drilling. Our current New Mexico Second Bone Spring AFEs are running $5.7 million to $6.5 million, depending on debt. That's down slightly from last quarter, but down $400,000 to $500,000 from where we started at the beginning of the year. Our shallower Texas Second Bone Spring AFEs are running around $5.1 million. That's about flat with the number we quoted to you last quarter, but we're down about $0.5 million from Q1. In our West Texas third Bone program, we're seeing AFEs continue to hold flat around $6.4 million to $6.5 million. Again, that's well below the $7.5 million-plus numbers that we were seeing in 2012, all of this as a result of program drilling.", "In the Wolfcamp, we're still in the early stages of our program drilling, especially when we consider the broad geographic area we're testing with the play. The 180,000-acre position we have extends from Southern Eddy County, New Mexico down into Culberson Reeves and over to the east into Ward Counties and Texas, fairly broad area. And as we've drilled across that area, we've encountered some fluid loss issues in some portions of the play. In particular, the Southern Culberson area, which has forced us to experiment with and even alter the design of our wells. Second factor that's coming into play, as John mentioned, is we've also upsized our completions into Wolfcamp. And albeit at the same time seeing some very favorable results, those upsizes and completion techniques are adding about $700,000 to our total well cost. And so now, as we go forward to account for both those items, our current generic Wolfcamp AFEs are running in the range of $7.8 million to $8.7 million, with our Culberson wells on the higher end of that range and our Reeves, Ward County wells on the lower end of that range. To the extent we push out the lateral lengths in the Wolfcamp with only a few wells under our belt, and I want to emphasize that, this is only with a few wells underneath our belt, we see our early total well cost for a 2-mile lateral to fall in the range of $13 million to $14 million, depending on whether or not we drill a pilot hole, and then obviously depending on the size of the completion. And if we were to drill a 7,500-foot lateral, we would take approximately $2.5 million to $3 million off those numbers. But again, we've drilled less than a handful of long laterals down there. And as we do with every well, each and every well, we learn more.", "As Tom mentioned, we're really just getting started in the Wolfcamp, not only from the geologic and reservoir side, but also on the drilling side. We're certainly in the early stages of fully understanding and developing the play. That said, similar to what we've seen in Cana and Permian with our Bone Spring programs, we fully anticipate program efficiencies to take root in the short term here in the Wolfcamp and show up in the form of decreased well cost as we take the program forward.", "So in closing, we had a great quarter. As John mentioned, our programs are doing well, seem to be hitting on all cylinders. We saw record Q3 production. Our LOE's in check, and we continue to see improvements in our development cost for program drilling.", "So with that, Chad, I suppose we'll turn the call over to question and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Wanted to start with the longer laterals and the increased frac stages. Maybe you could go through both. How many more wells of each type are you guys thinking about doing before making that a standard? And then to that end, are there pieces of your asset base where those sorts of techniques don't work? Or is it just a matter of determining that that's the best use of a well in each location as the case may be?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. Let me first address the increased frac size jobs. I will tell you that we've seen enough, not just in the wells that we've talked about today, but even the wells that are early flow back, that we're very encouraged with the results we're seeing there. Going forward, right now, all of our Wolfcamp wells, regardless of Culberson or Reeves or wherever they are located, all off them are planned with an upsized frac job going forward. Now obviously, we will monitor those results as we go forward to make sure that the increased cost is justified. But as I mentioned earlier, so far, every early indication, including the Tim Tam well will say that this is the right thing for us to do. In regards to extended laterals, no, that one is something that we just don't have that many under our belt. But again, I would say, so far, the few we do have, we're very encouraged with the type of production profile we see from them and the type of rate of returns that they're generating, but that's also a function of our acreage. Some acreage may allow us to do that, some may not, and it also will be a function of just how comfortable we get with just the drilling and completing of these. As Joe mentioned, we've done a just a few of them, and then they're not easy, especially the 10,000-foot laterals. We do run in to some completion difficulties that I think we're going to overcome over time, but when it comes to extended, that's going to take a little bit more time on our part before we get more comfortable. Broad strokes saying we do that everywhere.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great. And then as my follow-up, Tom, you mentioned you wanted to have the Wolfcamp essentially fully delineated by the end of the year. It seems like a pretty bold task. Maybe you could walk us through how you're trying to get your guys to think about it and how many one-off wells that really means, how many down spacing wells that really means to fully understand that play in the next 12 months.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, hopefully, if I use the word fully, I'll go back and edit the transcript, but we're just -- we have long-term plans. I mean, this is an asset base, when we look at it, when you look at our acreage position, there are -- it's really emerged as multiple zones almost everywhere. I mean, we've talk about Culberson County. We knew we had a D zone that was productive. We knew we had a C zone, and we speculated that we'd have an A zone. And now at least, with the 1 well we've tested, I think we can say we've had very encouraging results. Even in Reeves County, one of the things that's changed in the last 3 to 4 months is that it's also emerging as a multiple zone. We think there may be as many as 3 or 4 independent zones in Reeves County, and that's based on our own experience, but also some of our competitors are helping us there. So what we're doing is we're looking long-term with an asset that size. Our first goal, of course, is we're going to hold every acre that we view as perspective, and so we're still drilling to hold acreage. We're still acquiring new acreage. But we're also looking ahead to when it will be appropriate for us to go into a development mode. And it's probably going to be a case where we'll go into development mode in some portion, while we're still holding to drill acreage in other areas of the play. So in order to make good decisions on development mode, we have to know spacing in terms of how many wells per section, how many zones per section, and can we put those directly on top of one another, do we stagger them. So just to repeat what I already said, in 2014, we're going to be doing some spacing experiments both vertically and horizontally to make really good, at least, intermediate-term development decisions. And why? Well, one is some of our best returns are coming from development and we like returns. Secondly is we have to think ahead in terms of getting the midstream take away capacity to facilitate development, and then third is we have a great balance sheet. We're outstanding position, but we don't want to be surprised by financing these either. So we're really looking at some long-term plans. I don't know that we'll have it fully delineated in 2014, but we are steering our experiments to gather as much of those critical pieces of information so we can make some really good decisions on development.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I know you won't give official 2014 guidance until early next year. But can you talk a little bit about general trends in 2014 spending levels, how much you might be wanting to spend relative to cash flow? And possibly, any granularity that you can provide around maybe year-on-year increases in County or Wolfcamp versus Bone Spring, anything of that order?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Sure, Brian, this is Tom. Yes, we've talked openly that we would be comfortable increasing our borrowings next year a little bit. I think we wouldn't have hard time borrowing $200 million to $400 million next year, and that's certainly not a limit on that. I mean, we're going to look at our programs. We're going to look at our opportunity set, look at the prudent pace of development. I would expect -- so our capital next year, I think it's reasonable to think it will be up a little, given that commodity prices hold and we continue to have the kind of success we're having. And I would look for a slightly larger percent to be in the Permian than it was this year. I mean, we're -- we'll be upsizing our Permian program. We have a great opportunity set and lots to do. As far as Bone Spring versus Wolfcamp, I think it's going to be a higher Wolfcamp program as a percent of our total capital, and that's just naturally evolving to -- for us to develop this really premier resource play.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Are there any areas of the Wolfcamp, in particular, where you see -- like over the next 12 months, where you see infrastructure being more of a bottleneck than in other places?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, there's the Delaware Basin involves infrastructure planning. And so everywhere we're working, we're putting a lot of energy in the infrastructure. Our operations, our marketing, our midstream group has done a phenomenal job getting ahead of it. We're currently planning very diligently, and I'm very confident that we're going to be ready for program when they come online. Joe, do you want to add to that?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes. I'd echo what Tom said here, as far as our 2 biggest areas, the Triple Crown area, we've obviously got our main 34 mile trunk line that we're trying to stay out 6 months ahead of our anticipated development from a well standpoint to make sure our laterals are in place, our CDP is in place, our CDPs are in place. We're looking forward to salt water disposal wells to try to get out ahead of any water disposal, in particular, in Reeves County where we're seeing more water. In Triple Crown, we're looking for and have obtained additional markets coming off the middle of that pipe. So we will have, at least, have gotten further down the road of trying to maintain and capture some of that market optionality that we have out there in the area by now, have the markets to the north in the middle and to the south with our own JT. In Reeves County, we're putting the infrastructure together to be able to handle a fairly healthy Wolfcamp Bay development program, not only from the gas takeaway standpoint, but also from the salt water disposal infrastructure and even the oil takeaway. So we are -- that is one of those areas that we have to be out ahead of this type of development in these plays.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, this project, as you can tell from our release, as we get more information, it's getting better and better. And the mandate we have to our organization is let's get that infrastructure out ahead, so that if we increase our capital, we're ready for it. So we're planning for success.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I guess if I could ask one -- that's very hopeful, and if I could just ask one more. You mentioned a tighter spacing test you did in the Culberson County Second Bone Spring. I think 5 wells in the section rather than the traditional 4, and that the results were kind of in line with expectations. Is that -- should we expect that to be from your base case from now on or is that something you feel like you need to test more broadly across the play?", "John A. Lambuth", "Ryan, this is John. I think it's safe to say for similar net thicknesses across the section, then that certainly would be our base case, going forward, in that immediate area, and I want to stress, that immediate area. But I would also say there's still room to test additional things there. I mean, this was not much of a step-up to go from 4 to 5, but we are very encouraged by that. And so even internally, we ask ourself, is that still the right spacing, but so far, we've been very pleased just with those initial 5 well results to date.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gil Yang with DISCERN.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Yes, maybe following on to that question. Is it probably fair to say that while you don't know what the spacing should be in the Bone Springs, are you closer than what it might be for the Wolfcamp because of the tighter formation?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Gil, this is Tom. We don't know. I mean, we haven't tested it yet. And one of the things, of course, these upsized fracs we're talking about, it's taking the industry by storm. It's not just Cimarex. If you look from basin to basin, you obviously -- a lot of our peers are coming forward with the same evolutionary or even revolutionary change in completion technology. And the primary benefit, in addition to uplift in production, is greater near wellbore recovery and potentially a tighter spacing. So with this upsized completion technique, we're probably now more interested in exploring tighter spacing than we were before, and we were obviously deeply interested. So we need to get out and test it. I mean, this Wolfcamp is a thick, thick section, and we might still be underestimating the number of laterals we can put in it. So we've got to get out there and test it. We can do all the forward modeling in the world, but until you to drill, test and have empirical evidence. Your confidence is very low.", "Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "So it sounds like, not only are you going to be testing the lateral spacing, you're also going to be staggering the wells, Chevron-ing them within a thicker section so that the -- they may still be relatively far apart, but when you look down upon in sort of the helicopter view, they're close together?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, no, Gil, you said Chevron-ing, we may get there. Our first test will be putting them directly in the top of one another just to see if that works. And then if we can stagger a Chevron, then we can do that as well. But it's -- as I said, it's a huge resource. And in Culberson County, there are now 3 independent zones producing, and in Reeves County, there are now 3 independent zones producing. Now we don't have those 3 independent zones, but if we look at our competitor activity, there are at least 3 different landing points in the Wolfcamp producing, and so a lot and lot of work to do to find its ultimate potential.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ipsit Mohanty with Cannacord.", "Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just looking at your Wolfcamp curve that you've provided before and then seeing your press release, it kind of seems like the oil percentage in the yield mix has gone up. Is that a function of doing more of the Wolfcamp C? You've talked about how maturity sort of reduces as you go shallower, and that's where we look forward to the A as well. But is that a function of more of Wolfcamp C versus D?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, first off, I guess the tight curve that we published is on the average compilation of a lot of D wells that we've drilled. Pretty sure, it's just D, the tight curve. And you have to keep in mind that even within the D, geographically, as you move throughout Culberson, you're going to get variations in yield. And so there is an overprint of geography relative to just that tight curve. So that overprint is probably there. In terms of this latest well we announced, it does seem to have a slightly higher yield. But I don't know that I could say that that's a definitive trend yet or not. I mean, we need more wells on our belt to really establish that that's happening.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, but the A is oilier than the C and D. So as we bring a lot more of our Reeves and Ward County into development, we're going to see an oilier overall mix, and the A in Culberson looks like, as we predicted, it's oilier than the C and D.", "Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And just moving a bit for a second to the Avalon, is it too early to ask you sort of number of potential locations that you can talk about? And in addition to that, what's your leftover locations left in the Bone Spring to drill?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, first, on the Avalon, given our current acreage position, we see around 200 to 250 locations currently with our position just in that kind of Southern Southwestern part of Lea county. And I'd just caution because that's really where we see right now the really good returns, and that's where we focus our efforts. So 200 to 250 locations there. When it comes to Second Bone Spring, it's as we've always said, it's the revolving inventory that, as we drill up, we come up with new ideas. We keep adding and we're still sitting there with that 200 to 250 locations for Bone Spring as well. Culberson is now taking a bigger share of that. Obviously, as we drill more and more in Culberson, we get more and more confident of additional locations there, but it's still that ever-moving kind of 2-year program, and that's kind of how it's been a trademark for us for the last 4 or 5 years.", "Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And my last, if I may, then how comfortable you would be yet. But you gathered some acreage in Ward County. That's getting a lot of good positive vibe. Would you care to comment on the cost play that you've got there, how much did you spend per acre?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we -- yes, this is Tom. We bought it at a public sale, so it's public record and then...", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, we've advertised that at the sale, we picked up approximately 10,000 acres, and we spent $25 million. So 2,500 an acre at that sale.", "Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "That's a great buy.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Hope so. we'll get back to you on that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeb Bachmann from Howard Weil.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just wondering, Tom, if you can give us an idea of the rig count, operated rig count exiting this year in the Permian and where those rigs will be working.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we currently have 12 rigs working in the Permian. And of those 12 rigs, 8 of them were drilling Bone Spring plays, and that's several different Bone Spring plays, but those are sands, more conventional reservoirs, and 4 of them are currently drilling in the Wolfcamp shale. Of those 4 in Wolfcamp shale, 2 of them are in Culberson County. One is in Ward County, and one is in Reeves County. So amongst that Wolfcamp play, we have 4 active rigs. As John said, our plan is probably not by year end, but probably around year end, we'll have 2 additional rigs moving into the area, and certainly, we'll see an increase in Wolfcamp drilling. So I think you'll probably see, going into next year, we'll probably, early on the fourth quarter, have 14 rigs running and probably the increase will be Wolfcamp.", "John A. Lambuth", "No, that's right, Tom. I think you can anticipate that beginning of the year kind of about an even split between what we call Bone Spring Avalon versus Wolfcamp. But keep in mind, at any one time, we move those rigs around. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts there to rig schedule in terms of permitting or what's ready to be drilled, but that's a fair look at it going forward into '14.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just quickly on the Avalon, give us the cost on that first well there.", "John A. Lambuth", "Our generic AFEs for Avalon are running around $7.3 million, $7.4 million.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I think we've been hitting that. We're doing a nice job there.", "John A. Lambuth", "No, it's right just north of $7 million, drilling complete.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one for me. Any idea what's causing the fluid loss in Culberson?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, yes. There's area there where we have, in the shallower section, a highly fractured interval, mostly Avalon. And as we drill through that, we take massive losses, and so we don't see that -- we don't see that most parts of the play, but we have experienced it with quite a number of wells, and so we adjust. As Joe alluded, we'll either make adjustments to our pipe program or we'll make adjustments just to the ability to just take those losses and get our way through it, and then get pipes up through it. But we're making plans now that we don't see this as something we can't overcome fairly quickly.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Jeb, I want to just chime in. This is Tom. We like to talk about what we're spending. We don't typically talk about target well cost, and our drilling group has done a remarkable job when they've had a reputable program of not only getting our efficiencies down, but also our cost. So this is something that I'm highly confident we're going to get these costs down. But the real news, and that shouldn't be lost, is even with these increased costs because of some of these drilling issues, we've seen a significant uplift in our return on invested capital. I mean, this is very good news and it will only get better. So we're -- obviously, we're focused on cost. We're going to, I think, achieve what we've set out there and getting them down, but our turns are improving, not degrading. We're really seeing some nice results on invested capital.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Portillo with TPH.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a few quick question for me. Just wanted to confirm on the Reeves 10,000 foot lateral, how many stages you guys ran in that well?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That would have been a normal frac job. I'm pretty sure it would have been around 20 stages, 20 to 22. It would not have been the upsize job, as I mentioned. Our typical jobs in the past were around 10 on a 5,000. So I think it was a natural uplift. That's why I would say, why we're very encouraged off of that results because that was again more of our normal job and not the upsized tighter stage job. I can tell you that, going forward, our next 10,000-foot lateral, we currently plan to -- that job is planned for 35 stages, for that job. So that's a pretty hefty uplift from what we did with that first 10,000-foot lateral, the Ruby that we talked about.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just last conference call, you guys mentioned your first 7,500-foot lateral in Culberson, and it had an initial uplift to the production rate, and maybe a little bit slower decline than expected. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how that's performing, and if you've been encouraged at all by the longer lateral length there?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, it's continuing to perform very well. We're very, very pleased with that well. It -- in no way has it diminished at all from our last conference call, which is why we're very again excited about the site of the extended laterals. I think our challenges is, again, as we go longer and longer, there are operational issues that we have to deal with as we do that, and so we'll get past those, but yes, still, the day start, the 7,500-foot lateral still looks very, very good to us.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just one last quick question on the drilling side. Maybe just curious if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of where your targeted depth is in the play in Culberson and Reeves for the Wolfcamp. And as we've seen, you squeeze a lot of the cost out of the Bone Springs moving towards a full development, what kind of opportunities exist in the Wolfcamp play today? Is it days to drill, is it the pad development? Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on how you potentially see some of those costs coming down over time? And then just my last follow-up question to that is, on these wells, as you complete the wells, how long do they flow on natural production versus being put on artificial lift? And that will be it.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Okay, this is Joe. I'll let John answer more specifically the landing points for the Wolfcamp wells when we get there. But bigger picture is take a look at Cana, we've drilled hundreds of wells that's taken 5 years. We looked at Barnett, we looked at our days to TD. In Cana, we've made a ball projection early on in that play internally that we should be able to see that same reduction in days that operators saw on the Barnett, which is about a 40% improvement in number of days to TD. Our early Cana wells are running $8.5 million, $9 million there in the quarter. We're down to $6.5 million today. That's due to drilling hundreds and hundreds of wells, and then you throw on top of that the program efficiencies of pad drilling and consolidated batteries and everything else, and you can create those types of benefits. The Wolfcamp, holy cow, it covers 4 separate counties. And if you just do a straight line through all the counties, it's like 200 miles swath of area. So we're talking about hundreds of square miles of potential development. We've drilled 40 wells. In Cana, we've drilled hundreds. In the Second Bone Spring, we've drilled hundreds. So 40 wells, although it sounds like a fair number of wells, it's still young in that play, learning how the heck to drill it. So I just want you to understand that. From the standpoint of improvements that we've seen with bit technology, rotary steerables, consolidated equipment, hydrating our rigs, all those things, in general, at least in the Bone Spring, heck, it knocked 10% to 20% off some of the early AFEs. So I anticipate that as we go into full-scale development, if we start focusing in on any one particular area that has the same common characteristics, we'll see similar type of reductions in the Wolfcamp. We're pretty excited about what we think we can be able to do down there. We just got to get the program going. Now the other thing, as far as when we put these wells on lift, we're -- a lot of that depends on the product mix, the flowing pressures, is it more gassy than oil or is there a lot more water being produced, so forth and so on. Some of our wells have gone a year-plus without needing any kind of lift or even compression for that matter. We've had some long stretches there. So it's a matter of whether how long it takes to get our flowing pressures down to lime pressure. As to when we've even think about putting them on compression, and we can put them on compression without having them on gas lifts. Our practice to date has been to equip these wells with gas lift on tubing that we snug in early so that if and when we do get to that point where we need to lift it, we're able to flip a switch, so to speak, and put the wells on gas lift. But we're even challenging ourselves there with that design and looking at where we set the tubing inside the lateral length. Bone Spring wells, we'll need to put on compression and gas lift quicker than we might a Wolfcamp well. So a lot of it just varies on the product type, the pressures and so forth. And I know it's a very vague answer, but that's about what we're saying.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "All right. I'll just add a little color. The depth range, again, because it's such a broad area, varies, as you move from Culberson to Reeves to Ward, you go shallower to deeper. You're typically in the 10,000-foot range, down to 12,000-foot over the course of the play. But then you have to consider the interval itself is over a gross interval 1,000 to 1,500 feet or more thick. So it depends on what zone you're targeting and then where you're planning to land. So shallower over in Culberson, and then we pick up a couple thousand feet as we go, and finally, head our way off into Reeves and Ward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Robertson with Barclays.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Tom, as you drill longer laterals, is it difficult to keep the bit in zone in any of this or more difficult at any of these formations than others to keep in the landing zone you're trying to target?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Jeff, that's not really an issue here. It's such a large broad zone. We don't really micro steer, and it's such a thick, organic rich resource that we don't have any problem getting out of zone. The challenge is, we've had challenges building the curve, you get at 10,000 feet, you're on the hole a long time. It's pretty easy to leave a fish in the hole, and then you end up fishing. Just longer lateral just gives you opportunity for more things to go wrong, just in the everyday course of business.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Do the -- does the enthusiasm for these plays, Tom, make you think any differently about how much acreage is the right amount to have in the Delaware Basin, given the focus on after-tax rate of return?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, yes, absolutely. We look at that very carefully, and we ask ourselves how much is enough. When we lease land, and yes, you know this, but indulge me here, we look at the capital required to bring that land to be held by production. So when we add leases, we look at the long-term capital that that requires. And then we'll also look at permutations at downside of commodity case. We're looking at $75 oil or $60 oil, and then we'll also look at a case where we say, \"Okay, what if we lease this land and we delay the drilling for 1 to 4 years\". And we'll look at the value of that. So we look at the broad range of value. To make sure, one, we're not biting off more than we can chew; two, that we have the capital to bring that net present value forward; and three, that we have the luxury that if we do defer it, we're not destroying capital in the process. So it's a fairly complex formula, but we're disciplined. And that's one thing that when people look at Cimarex, they need to understand that fully. We are about return on invested capital. We're not about growth. We're not about having nice pretty slides about a wonderful resource play. We're about return on invested capital. And so I think we might approach the problem slightly different than our peers, and that's beauty of our balance sheet. We can still add a little asset here, and we have plenty of wherewithal to develop and create value for the shareholders.", "Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And lastly, Tom. As you think about laying out a 2014 capital program and even looking out into 2015, I guess, with some of the answers you hope to get on these plays, over the next 12 months or so, are there other assets within the company today that just from a rate of return standpoint, all the way in, you all would consider selling as a way to fund what maybe an outspend in '14 and '15?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we always ask that question, and we do have assets that would be non-core, that we'd consider divesting. We don't have to do that. I mean, we really look at it against cost of our borrowing, our overall balance sheet structure, but we do look at that. I'll say one thing, Permian Basin is a wonderful place right now. We're getting absolute top tier returns, very oily and the oil price is our dominant revenue phase, but we still like to have gas in our portfolio. We wouldn't want to sacrifice that balance. So although the Permian is obviously a topic of today's call, we really like having Cana in our portfolio. It gives tremendous optionality to shareholder for future increases in gas price.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Nelson with Citigroup.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Hoping, first, just as a clarification, I missed it. The Ruby well in Reeves County, did you guys give the oil cut on the 60-day rate, if you could repeat that?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I think I quoted a percentage of oil. Did I not?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. That's right.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Oil cut as a percent of oil water?", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, exactly.", "John A. Lambuth", "58% of..", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Oil and water, yes, it's...", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, we could follow up. I guess, just staying on that well. You noted the 60-day rate, the decline was pretty shallow. Are you choking back the well or can you just give us sort of any color on why you think the decline was so shallow there?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, no, we're not choking back the well, per se, as much as that so far has been kind of a characteristic of the longer laterals. I mean, that was certainly true of our first extended lateral on the Day Star we talked about last call to where we're very pleased with the shallower decline we saw on that well. And so far, and again, I'll caution, so far, given the 60-plus days of production we have, we've been very pleased with what we've seen out of it as well in terms of its decline profile, but it's early, and we'll have to monitor over time to see if we continue to see that type of shallower decline in what a normal 5,000-foot well will do.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. To some degree, we are still above line pressure, but the flowing pressure has dropped over the period of time that it's been flowing, and hence that will have an impact of potentially supporting the rates. So as we get closer to line pressure, we expect the well and even below that when we get on the compression, obviously, we could maintain those higher rates as well. So when we get to the point where we are at the bottom end of our pressure capability on the tube inside, the well will most likely start to climb quicker than it is today.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just the 2 other, I guess, I'll call them shorter laterals, but the 5,000 laterals in Reeves County that you guys disclosed last quarter, just any comments on sort of how they're holding up and sort of the oil percentage longer on?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Again, so far, very good wells. Very, very pleased with the results out of those wells. They're pretty much on forecast of what we expect out of them. And so no, there's been no degradation whatsoever in the production out of those wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, and we -- this is Tom. We look at that daily. We have some engineers that send out a update of some of those new wells, and they include all of our old wells, as kind of a benchmark. We currently are flowing back 5 wells with our new frac style. We're having the executive team watching them very carefully, and it's nothing but encouraging. You talk about the long laterals having shallower decline. These upsized fracs also have shallower declines. So this really does look like a potential game changer for our returns.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's great. And the last one for me, I think I have an idea of the answer I'll get, but I'll go ahead and try anyway. The Culberson County-Wolfcamp A, you mentioned that it sort of has a higher oil and liquids mix. Can you maybe just give us a ballpark on sort of where that range might be?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, no, but I'll answer your question in vague terms. We talked about the Wolfcamp B, the deepest zone has oil rate that's roughly 90 barrels per million cubic feet of gas, so 90 barrels of oil per million cubic feet. As you move up to Wolfcamp C, we talked about some of our wells having oil rate of 150, give or take, per million cubic feet of gas. There's some more, some less. And we said early on before drill the well that we -- we're anticipating the Wolfcamp A would extend that trend and be oilier than the D and C, and be trending that way. And we've said in this call that, yes, it is confirming our model that it's oilier. But right now, it's not that we're trying to be coy. It's just that we really want to stick to our knitting. We like to talk about 30-day averages. If we don't have a 30-day average, we're just going to wait until we do.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Smith with Bank of America.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wanted to -- a quick clarification in Reeves. I think you guys talked about industry testing multiple zones. You guys have been focused on the A zone, I mean, are you guys looking to test in the other zones as well?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, yes, we are. We currently, in fact, have finished a well in the C zone that we actually started frac-ing just today. So that's an additional zone in the A. But also, we are recognizing that given the thickness of the A in Reeves, we're noticing the trend to try, and in fact, at least 1 operator stacking laterals in the A. And we also will be doing that, probably early first quarter, the same type of test that is putting 2 laterals in the A itself, stacked above each other. So that right there potentially, depending upon results, could lead to 3 unique intervals that one could put laterals in, in Reeves County that we're currently going to test.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, and this is Tom. In Reeves County, just to follow-up on what John said, we have wells that have are landed in the upper part of the A. We have wells that are landed in the lower part of the A, and now we have a well we're completing that's in the C. So we've tested at least 3 different zones. We just need to confirm that they are in 3 different zones, and you can stack laterals and have independent wells.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Good color. And where is the focus initially going to be on the A zone or you're going to test the multiple zones there as well?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It's, right now, as we look at it, it's A -- that's how we look at it. It's a very thick A over there. Right now, we just want to get some of those under our belt just to see -- hopefully, we've seen some results from other operators. We're very encouraged, what we've seen from other operators. So we just want to go there and get a few wells down ourselves, and then we can worry about whether want to stack or do other things. Right now, it's just strictly A.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Mark Burford", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a really exciting quarter, and have a lot more wells coming up and look forward to reporting to you our further continuation of our Wolfcamp extension and understanding. But thanks again for participating in today's call, and we'll hopefully see you soon. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford, Vice President of Capital Markets and Planning. Mr. Burford, the floor is yours sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. And today here in Denver, speaking will be Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; John Lambuth, Vice President, Exploration; and also present will be Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations.", "We did issue our financial and operating results this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website, along with our latest presentation, which might be you finally find useful, when I make the references to it during the call today. And I need to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. And you should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements and our latest 10-K, other filings and news releases for the risks factors associated with our business.", "With that, we'll have a full call. I'll get the call turned over to Tom.", "Thomas Jorden", "Thank you, Mark, and thank you to all of you on the lines, participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to touch on some of the highlights of the year before turning it over to John and Joe for a more detailed update.", "We ended 2013 with 2.5 Tcf equivalent in proved reserves, which was an 11% increase over 2012. Production was up 11% year-over-year as well and we look forward to grow roughly 13% in 2014. Because of our efforts in the Permian region, 26% of our proved reserves are now oil. Revenues reached a record $2 billion in 2013 and our debt increased to $924 million, which represents 19% of our total capitalization.", "Operationally, 2013 was a remarkable year for Cimarex. We saw continued high rates returns from our Bone Spring drilling in both the Mexico and Texas. We unlocked oil-prone Avalon Shale development in our Lea County, New Mexico acreage through new completion technology. And we saw opportunity in a multi-pay Wolfcamp shale expand across our Texas acreage. Without a doubt, the sheer size of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunity became much clear in 2013.", "One of the things that happened in 2013, as we saw a dramatic increase in competition in the Delaware Basin. We normally don't welcome competition, but it added a lot of data points, the information floor accelerated greatly, and the stars aligned deploying to the high-quality of Cimarex's core position in that play.", "We started the year with a good, but albeit fragmented opportunity in Culberson County, which was based mainly on the development of the Wolfcamp D bench. Later in the year, we proved that the Wolfcamp C and A were also productive, and in June we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron, which solidify the Culberson acreage, making it possible to test long laterals and ultimately optimize development.", "Simultaneously, we found multiple Wolfcamp pay across our acreage in Reeves and now Ward Count, as evidenced with today's announcement of initial 30-day production from the Worsham well, a Wolfcamp A test in Ward County. In addition, we tested long laterals and have been working on perfecting well completion by using upsized fracs and include more stages as well as higher volumes of profit.", "Today, we were proud to announce results from our first well that combined two. The Montrose LL 45 Unit Number 1, a Culberson County Wolfcamp D well was completed using an upsized frac with a 10,000 foot lateral and had a max 30-day rate of just over 2,800 barrel of oil equivalent per day.", "This is significantly higher than our original completions of Wolfcamp D wells. The Montrose looks to have an after-tax rate of return in excess of 85% and the peak 30-day rate now well may end up being even higher than what we've announced, because we haven't seen the well declining yet. This well and the opportunity it has really speaks to the opportunity that joint development agreement allows us to capitalize.", "In Culberson County, that entire over 100,000 acre gross position is available for full development with long laterals, and these results with long laterals and more that we're currently drilling will allow tremendous development efficiencies as we exploit this with long laterals.", "We're currently working to determine development parameters in Culberson and Reeves County. We have four separate spacing pilots underway and each tends to go along way and giving Cimarex the information we need to begin Wolfcamp development in 2015. And we look forward to sharing those results with you as we go. One of the things that you see as you look at Cimarex is we try to stay disciplined and when we talk about 30-day results, and with some of these wells we've had to kind of restrain ourselves, because the initial flow back has been extremely encouraging.", "As we look ahead, I think I can speak up for the entire executive team, we're very proud of our organization. We're proud of the way our organization is adapting to a changing business for doing multiyear planning for acquiring the science we need in order to make prudent development decisions in the future or building and identifying the infrastructure we'll need for future years. And really organizing and performing in a way that will allow us to optimally exploit this tremendous resource that we control. You're going to see some detail here in the comments that Joe and John make.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to John Lambuth to discuss those details.", "John Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting in to the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent drilling program.", "Cimarex had a busy 2013, we drilled and completed 365 wells during the year, investing nearly $1.6 billion, 65% of that was invested in Permian region and over 30% in the Mid-Continent region. In 2014, we estimate capital expenditures to be $1.8 billion, up over $200 million from 2013, a result of the continuous success we've had in the Permian region.", "Speaking of the Permian, in the fourth quarter we drilled 43 wells bringing our total wells to 175 for the year, which equates to 115 net wells contributing to our growing production and reserve base. Throughout 2013, our drilling was focused on the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. The 2013 Bone Spring program included 18 net wells in the Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the company's highest rate of return with oil volumes representing up to 84% of the first 30-day production.", "The 2014 program looks to provide similar returns on the $375 million of invested capital plan for the year. Although our inventory of Third Bone Spring wells in Ward County is dwindling, we continue to have about a 200 location inventory Bone Springs, which equates to about two year inventory of drilling. These locations identify throughout our acreage in the Mexico and in Culberson County, where we've identified a thick highly productive Second Bone Spring sand.", "Moving to the Wolfcamp, as Tom mentioned, 2013 was an exciting year. With the drilling of 26 wells we worked our whole acreage, while adding production from five new Wolfcamp zones, the Wolfcamp A and C in Culberson; the Wolfcamp A and the B/C zone in Reeves; and the Wolfcamp A in Ward County; all of this at very attractive rates of return. In addition, we tested the long lateral concept and have worked to optimize completions with upsized fracs.", "To illustrate, I'd like to direct you to Slide 12, in our latest Corporate Update posted on our website. This graph compares to traditional Wolfcamp D completion with our first upsized frac, the Tim Tam well. As you can see, not only has the upside frac had an impact on the initial production and initial decline rate, but most importantly on the returns.", "Investing additional $700,000 increased this before tax internal rate return from 30% to 77% and NPV10 more than doubled from $4 million to $10.7 million. Now, in fairness this well has only been on production for five months. However, two additional wells using the same frac design have been completed in Wolfcamp D with similar results to that Tim Tam.", "The Montrose well announced today, which has a 30-day IP of 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent, incorporates both long lateral and upsized frac technologies. This 10,000 foot lateral was completed with 36 frac stages. We have another 10,000 foot lateral flowing back now in Culberson that was completed using 43 stages. The product mix on the Montrose well is 765 barrels of oil, 7.5 million cubic feet of gas and 65 barrels of NGL, assuming full recovery. It's a fantastic well.", "About half of our Permian drilling capital in 2014 or about $685 million will go toward further delineation of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunity on the 180,000 net acres we have currently identified as perspective for the Wolfcamp. This includes down spacing pilots and wells drilled to hold acreage.", "I'd like to briefly take you through the design of the pilot we have currently underway. You can see an illustration of them on Pages 15 and 16 in the presentation. In Culberson County we have two pilots underway. One is testing the concept of producing from lateral stack in the Wolfcamp C and D. These two wells are currently waiting on completion, which is scheduled to begin in late March. The second Culberson pilot is designed to test 80 acre down spacing in the Wolfcamp D. This is a four well pilot and the wells are currently drilling with a completion date schedule for May.", "We also have two pilots drilling in Reeves County, both are down spacing pilot and both are in the Wolfcamp A. One of the four well 80 acre pilot similar to the one in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson, while the second one will test a 106 acre spacing, which is equivalent to six wells of section as well as testing the liability of stacking laterals in the thick Wolfcamp A section.", "Lastly, in the Permian, Cimarex has added Avalon drilling to its portfolio for 2014, and we plan to invest upon a $150 million drilling Avalon wells this year. Avalon has become perspective, because of the redesigned completion technique we tested in 2013. It is an upsized frac design that includes more stages, higher volumes of profits and adding 100 mesh to the mix. The five Avalon wells drilled in 2013 had average 30-day IP of 1,080 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 700 barrels per day of oil. We plan to drill another 15 to 20 wells this year and identify over 200 potential locations on our acreage.", "Now, onto the Mid-Continent. The Cana-Woodford Shale play continuous to account for the lion share of our Mid-Continent activity. In 2013, we participated in a 149 Cana-Woodford wells completing 52 net wells. CapEx in 2013 totaled about $400 million in Cana and will drop to about $250 million in 2014 as our partner has suspended drilling activities in Cana to focus on other opportunities for the time being. Of that $250 million, Cimarex plans to spend about $200 million will be used for drilling and completion activities, including approximately $60 million for drilling new wells and $140 million on completions of wells drilled in 2013 and 2014.", "Of note, the success we've experienced with the upsize fracs in the Permian is now been tested in Cana. The most recent set of completions included four wells that were fraced using 20 stages. We are at the initial stages of the flow back of these wells, but early indications are very encouraging. As planned in January, we move two of our operated rigs from Cana to the Permian, leaving two operated rigs working in the Cana region.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph Albi", "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on usual items, our 2013 production. I'll talk about our 2014 and first quarter of production outlooks, and then I'll follow-up with a few words on our operating and service cost.", "While we closed out Q4, reporting average net daily production for the quarter of 704.5 million equivalents a day. That came in about as expected, after accounting for the late November and early December whether in pipeline shutting impacts that we reported to you in our December press release. And as we're all aware, we've had an extremely cold winter this year, and its impacts on our production, not only impacted us in Q4, but also a flowed a little bit into Q1, albeit not to the extent we saw at the end of last year. And I'll touch on Q1 here in a minute.", "With Q4 coming in at 704.5 million a day, our full year 2013 average net daily equivalent production equated to 692.6 million a day. That was above the midpoint of our beginning year guidance, which if you recall, we gave and issued at 680 million to 700 million a day. It was also a record for the company and an increase of over 11% over 2012.", "As you recall, we had some property sales at the end of 2012, which if we incorporated that into our numbers for 2013, as the impact of that, we were up 13% over 2012 and we're pretty proud of that statistic. With our focus on the Permian, our 2013 oil production jump to a record 36,659 barrels a day. That's up 17% from 2012, and if we adjust that for those yearend 2012 property sales, our Permian oil was up a very respectable, 23%.", "As expected our Permian activity drove our production growth with our 2013 Permian equivalent volumes averaging 319.9 million a day. That's up 56.2 million a day or 21% over 2012. On an oil equivalent basis, that's an increase of nearly 9,400 BOEs per day. As John and Tom both mentioned, our Delaware Wolfcamp and Bone Spring programs turned out some great results during the year and they're showing up in our numbers.", "Our 2013 Permian new drills added equivalent production of over 114 million cubic feet equivalents per day, that's an addition of 19,000 BOEs per day to our production for the year. With our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring program making up about 80% of that wedge and the Wolfcamp program making up the balance.", "With our continued focus in Cana, we also saw a production grow in the Mid-Continent during the year. With our 2013 Mid-Continent net equivalent production coming in at 346.2 million a day, that's up 7% over 2012. The majority of our '13 Mid-Continent activity was, in fact in Cana, which bumped our 2013 Cana average production up to 221.9 million a day, that's up 42.7 million a day from 2012, and again another 24% jump. So significant production increases in both Cana and in Permian, with that being the focus of our activity.", "So as we look forward into 2014, our updated model continues to support our beginning year 2014 guidance projection of 760 million to 800 million a day and that corresponds to a 10% to 16% growth rate over 2013. And as was the case in 2013, our projected growth is expected to come from the Permian, where we're directing nearly 80% of our 2014 capital. We'll have the strong focus on the Wolfcamp in the Permian this year, and as such we anticipate the Wolfcamp to be the dominant contributor to our 2014 drilling wedge.", "Similar to the profile we saw last year, from a total company standpoint, our forecasted production this year calls for production ramp-up post Q1. Our first quarter net equivalent daily volumes are forecasted to average between 696 million and 700 million cubic feet equivalents per day. That's in essence flat to Q4. Well, there is couple of things at work here. First, our Q1 volumes incorporate a reduction of about 13 million to 15 million a day for recent weather-related downtime and the plant shutdown of our Triple Crown pipeline facility in Culberson County.", "We're excited to get started on the work in Triple Crown. We're going to be enhancing the liquid recovery capabilities of the system, to better conform to new delivery points of the central portion of the system, and also to help protect against future line freezes like we've seen over the last two winters.", "Also limiting our first quarter volumes is the initiation of the four Wolfcamp spacing pilots that John mentioned. We have the two in Reeves County and two also in Culberson County. Combined, these four projects comprise a total of 16 wells. Our plan is to grow the wells in each pilot first, and then complete the wells in each pilot, once drilling has been completed. And as such, none of these 16 wells will have first sales until the second quarter.", "Also with varying working interest in the wells that we drill, the overall timing of total company net completions has been varying quarter-to-quarter. And taking this into account for both the Permian and the Cana areas, our total company net well completions just dropped from an average of 17 net wells per month in Q3 '13 to 10.5 net wells completed per month in Q4, and we're projecting to increase that number of completions from back up to our Q3 '13 levels here in late Q1 and Q2. So the bottomline to all this is, is similar to the production profile we exhibited last year, we're projecting 2014 growth to take foot in the mid-to-late Q2.", "Jumping now over to our operating cost. Our Q4 lifting cost came in at $1.11 per Mcfe, that was at the low end of our full year guidance range of $1.11 to $1.16, right in line with our Q1 '13 average of $1.17, our Q2 '13 average of $1.11, and our Q3 '13 average of $1.15. And with that our full year 2013 lifting cost settled in at a $1.13 per Mcfe, that's flat with 2012, despite the cost pressures we've seen in items such as SWD, compression, power, fuel, rentals, et cetera.", "Especially in the Permian, where we're generally seeing higher operating expenses for items such as lift, compression and water disposal. With our focus on LOE over the last three years, we've been able to fight off those pressures, while reducing our Permian lifting cost from $1.88 per Mcfe in 2011 to $1.50 in 2012, and now down to $1.48 in 2013.", "So across the board, our production team has done just a great job of keeping our operating expenses in check. As we look forward into 2014 with our continued focus in the Permian and our overall focus primarily on liquids growth, we're projecting our 2014 lifting cost to fall in a range of $1.12 to $1.22.", "A few words on service cost. First with regard to drilling cost. With tools, equipment and services readily available in each of our programs, we continue to see most costs components stay relatively in check. Day rates appear to be in the same boat, although we are seeing the market for top-drive rigs tighten up a bit from last quarter.", "With these costs somewhat flat, our drilling group has made great strides to reduce our drilling cost through program efficiencies, especially in the Permian, where our continued focus on bit technology and rotary steerable drilling has helped us cut our AFE drilling days over the last year in each one of our programs, the Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring program, the Avalon program and the Wolfcamp program.", "On the completion side, we've had no difficulty securing frac equipment or crude, and we continue to experiment, as John mentioned with different frac designs. In general, through operating efficiencies, and I need to mention the efforts of our service providers, we've enabled to capitalize on stable to softening service and material cost in order to help offset some of the cost that we've been seeing with the larger jobs that we've pumped.", "In Cana, after years of program drilling, we continue to see performance and cost improvement during 2013, cutting our growing cost per foot by 25% from the levels we saw in 2012. And with that our current core AFEs are now running in a range of $6.3 million to $6.9 million, again that's primarily depending on the size of our frac.", "In the Permian, our Second and Third New Mexico Bone Spring AFEs continue to run in the range of $5.7 million to $6.5 million, depending on debt. That's down about $400,000 to $500,000 from where we were a year ago. Our shallower Texas Second Bone Spring AFEs are holding flat at $5.1 million. That's also down about $500,000 from a year ago.", "And our West Texas third Bone Spring AFEs continue to hold flat at $6.4 million to $6.5 million. That's well below the $7.5 million that we were incurring back in 2012.", "In the Wolfcamp, we're gaining some traction with program efficiencies. As an example on Culberson, we've seen our average days to TD for 4,500 foot Wolfcamp lateral, dropped from 39 days in 2012 to 33 days in 2013. We have seen the same improvement in the Reeves Ward County areas with our Wolfcamp average days to TD again for 4,500 foot lateral dropping from 28 days in 2012 to 22 days in 2013.", "That said, we're still in the very early stages of program drilling the Wolfcamp. Especially, when considering the broad geographical area that we're testing with the play, extending itself from Southern Eddy in New Mexico down into Culberson, and then over to the east into Reeves and Ward Counties. As such, we're obviously excited about the progress we've been making, but we are also seeing, potential gains still yet to be made as we get more wells under our belt.", "As John mentioned, we've upsized our completions into Wolfcamp and we've seen some vary favorable results. Those upsized completions are running us anywhere from $600,000 to $700,000 per well. And incorporating those costs, our current generic Wolfcamp AFEs are now running in the range of $8 million to $8.5 million, with our Culberson County wells, falling on the higher end of that range, and our Reeves, Ward County wells on the lower end.", "As we continue to experiment with long laterals, we are projecting our 10,000 foot Wolfcamp laterals and Reeves County to run into $13 million to $14 million range and that's solely depending on our whole design configuration. If we drill a 7,500 foot lateral, we'll probably take about $2.5 million off those numbers.", "Again, we're still in the very early stages of not only the Wolfcamp, but drilling these long laterals and our drilling team is pretty excited about creating the efficiencies that we've seen in other programs as we continue to drill more of them.", "In closing, we had a great 2013. Our programs are doing great. We saw record 2013 production. Our LOEs in check and development cost continue to head in the right direction, great momentum to start-off 2014. Reiterating what tom said, part of our growth last year was helping our organization grow together to develop these program plays from just finding the locations, to drilling them ,to producing them and putting the infrastructure in place and then the overall administration of the program. So we'd made great progress. And we're very proud of the organization.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question we have comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.", "Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley", "In your opening remarks, you talked about multiyear development planning, just hoping you could talk about Culberson County to begin with, I guess going through, how long you need to hold your acreage there? How many wells that entails? When you might be able to be drill more Wolfcamp A wells, and I guess, also when do you think you might be drilling more of those 10,000 foot laterals?", "Thomas Jorden", "Well, Drew, this is Tom. We are indeed looking at a multiyear time horizon and we have to. I mean, we've got decisions to make today that will impact 2018, 2019. We have to collect the science and do the spacing pilots in order to come up with prudent development plans. We don't know what ultimate spacing will be. I mean John talked about 80 acre spacing. He talked about 105 acre spacing. Today, we can't tell you that it's not 40 acre spacing. We just don't know until we go out there and test it.", "And we're looking carefully at competitors, but right now we're not throwing a lot of spacing pilots going on the Delaware Basin, other than our four. We have one competitor doing another space pilot issue, but we're having to create these data points to setup our out years. So we have to do the science required for out year developments. We have to build the infrastructure and we have to club the financing plan. So we are looking at that year at out years.", "You asked about Culberson County, overall in the Basin, we're on a glide path to hold all of our acreage, certainly all of that we see perspective, which is darn near every acres. And that's a very manageable program. If we do the minimum, it would probably be $350 million a year for the next few years, but we're accelerating that and we'll front load that, so we can get that held earlier.", "Your question also was about Culberson County and Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp C, Wolfcamp D. It depends by large on the lease. Some of our leases, we can hold all Wolfcamp with one well, so we can choose the zone. Other leases, we have to drill the deepest target first in order to hole the deepest interval, but a lot's changed since we have gone into this project, and one of which there was a day when we would have said, we think the Wolfcamp A is our most economic target. Today, we don't know.", "That Montrose well was landed to Wolfcamp D. And it's arguably the best economics of any well we've drilled in basin. And so we don't know, if leases were a concern, I can't tell you today, which would be our primarily target. We've got a lot of experimentation with these long laterals and upside fracs, before we can make that kind of economic high-grade.", "And finally, you asked about future development. We do have a development plan and its changing everyday, based on these pilot projects, that's why we're doing them. We don't think we're going to have any issues with land going into full development, whether that would be Culberson Reeves or Ward we don't know today, but we're getting for it.", "Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley", "I guess, going back to the HBP question. Do you have a sense of when do you might have that Culberson position held? And then I guess going back to those long laterals, what would I guess changed your -- how many wells you're drilling on that 10,000 foot lateral basis?", "John Lambuth", "I can address right off about the laterals. We have drilled two now, I mean we have talked about one. Going forward, currently in Culberson for the rest of this year, we have three more 10,000 foot laterals planned, One into D, two into C. We also have seven 7,500 foot laterals. Now you might ask yourself, why not 10,000, and quite frankly that's because of the way the acreage lined up, we were able to drill 7,500 because of the way the o sections were.", "We have seven of those going forward, four into D and three in the A. So we have quite a few now that that we're planning. And obviously from the results we talked about we're very excited and trying to move quicker towards the path and towards drilling those type of wells. I mean, as far as holding our acreage, I mean we have a schedule and we kind of know each year what kind of capital that schedule requires. We do tend to front in that, meaning we try to get ahead of it. It's safe to say, with certainly by the end of 2017, we'll have a majority of that held or maybe just a few wells maybe we have to do, but we'll be in pretty good shape by '17 for sure.", "Thomas Jorden", "I want to make one follow-up point. All of our pilots are 5,000 foot laterals and we don't see that as -- in everything we learn on the pilot, we view it will be directly applicable to a longer lateral. And so we're doing our pilots on 5,000 foot laterals, quite frankly, because we can get them drilled faster, completed quicker and we spend a little less per well as we experiment, but everything we're learning in this pilots should directly translate to longer laterals.", "Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley", "One last one for you, do you have exposure to the stack play in Merrimack in Oklahoma? Is that something you've been testing?", "John Lambuth", "As we recognized the play, as we see what our competitors are doing and as we map it, we do feel as though that that interval definitely carries over into our Cana HBP acreage. Quite frankly it looks very perspective based on where they're putting their laterals. And we are developing plans to aggressively move forward and tested here in the near future on our acreage, at least some initial tests.", "Operator", "Next would Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors", "Question, Tom, you talked about Culberson being pretty well set out to moved along longer lateral development there. Can you just talk about the setup and reason Ward counties? How much of that do you think you can move toward the longer lateral development?", "Thomas Jorden", "We have a fair amount, and I'll let John chime in, but certainly in Reeves County, there is a fair amount of our acreage that would support long laterals. I'm looking at John, half maybe?", "John Lambuth", "I would say, at least half.", "Thomas Jorden", "The challenge in a lot of these areas is it's parsed up land-wise. So it's a nice thing when you get these continuous acreage blocks. Ward County, we have some good continuous acreage blocks, but whether that will be -- I don't know if that will support for 10,000 foot lateral. We may have some 7,500 foot laterals to drill there. But when we think long laterals, based on what we seen, we're going to do it everywhere we can. But it really harkens back to the real value of that agreement between Chevron and Cimarex. Long laterals were strong motivator for both companies to enter into our joint development agreement and the results we're seeing are really, really reinforcing that decision.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors", "And I guess sticking with that topic, I mean can you just talk about the interplay with moving the longer lateral, I mean obviously you're getting much more right upfront and just how that dovetails with thinking about facility and midstream build out there?", "Joseph Albi", "It obviously plays a big role in that. The resources needs not only, as far as batteries, equipment, but also people. And as we continue to look forward down the road as to our resource needs, this all plays a big role in that. So we're trying to optimize every which way we can. There is not only just operational efficiencies to be gained, we also firmly believe there is tremendous capital efficiencies to be gained as well.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors", "And then just jumping, same to Culberson, and then jumping at Bone Spring, it looks like you had a pretty nice uptick in terms of the average productivity on those wells from last quarter. There is some talk about some upsize frac from some initial comments in that area. Was that playing at all into the results or is that in the balance of just the natural variability.", "John Lambuth", "I would probably lean more towards the natural variability. We have played with the frac design. Tom mention, it is kind of nice in Delaware Basin that there are a lot of competitors, and we pay very close attention to what others were doing. We learn from that. In the case of the Bone Spring, we have tried some upside fracs. I would say, right off the bat, we got the kind of uplift we were looking for, but still the jury is still out. Those wells are still in early flow back.", "I would also point out that we're just getting more and more comfortable with that region in terms of what we're looking for, in terms of what we're putting those laterals in the Bone Spring. I think that's what's showing up in the kind of activity results we're getting there. I mean it's turning out to be, without a doubt, that Second Bone Spring in Culberson, some of the highest rate of return wells we're drilling right now.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors", "And then just lastly Permian. I know it's not a focus area for you guys, but I think you drilled a few wells over in Reagan County. Just kind of curious what the plan is there, if that's an area where you look to expand or potentially a monetization candidate?", "Thomas Jorden", "Probably in that case more monetization and we have some legacy acreage there. Our team did a nice job of identifying the potential there and there was enough acreage to justify what's going out there and doing a couple well test. We're still in flow back on those wells, but we were encouraged enough from the results that we have budgeted some money this year to drill some additional wells on that acreage block. But this is not a very big position for us at all. It's more about just taking advantage of having that relatively small track of land right there in Reagan and drilling on it.", "Operator", "Next we have Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "When thinking about the drivers behind your production guidance growth for 2014, have you assumed any uplift from the upsize fracs like you've seen from Tim Tam or from the longer laterals or is there a bit of conservative in both in there?", "Joseph Albi", "When we first put our plan together, we had limited data. So the answer to your question at a fairly high level is, yes. We've incorporated production uplifts on a risk basis for our Wolfcamp program and that's built into our numbers.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And with your initial Ward well out of the way and with you saying earlier that you probably don't have as much acreage to drill longer laterals on there. Should we expect you to maintain a fair amount of activity there or do you expect to shift the focus really back to Reeves and Culberson? And what do you have to hold acreage-in in Ward?", "John Lambuth", "Well, we expect to be still fairly active in Ward. We do have acreage to hold. As you know, we picked up a nice block of acreage last year that we will need to overtime here drill on. But, no, the actively level will be pretty good at Ward, because we have a lot of acreage there, but we also have a lot of testing delineations still to do there. Of the three areas is the one where we've done our lease drilling.", "So we still have a lot to do to learn and understand how perspective that acreage is, I'll just point out, not just in the A, but I would argue throughout the entire Wolfcamp section there. We haven't really stepped down into the deeper section yet, although we talk about doing that at some point later this year in Ward.", "Thomas Jorden", "We're quite high on Ward. It's not a stepchild by any means. We currently have 18 rigs running in the Delaware Basin and four them are in Ward County. So it's a good project.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And I'd like to squeeze one more, and you guys haven't talked at all about potentially testing the Delaware zone. Do you have any plans to do that, as you go through this delineation here?", "Joseph Albi", "We don't have any plans as of right now, as we always talk about, we recognize it. It's just obviously our first primary purpose, when we drill the well in a new section like that is to hold acreage and so we're going to the deepest target, where we can get good rate of returns. We will get there eventually, but as of right now, we don't have any plans.", "Thomas Jorden", "There's no mystery there. We like the Delaware group. We've drilled a lot Delaware in our history. The thing is it's relatively uncontrolled out here. It's a big thick package, sands come and go, and you need to map it with control. So every time we drill a Wolfcamp well, we add another point of control, we're mapping as we go and we see it as future objective, but it certainly will be part of our 2014 program.", "Operator", "The next question we have comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "There were some well in Ward County had a pretty comparable IP rate to the typical Third Bone Spring well that you've drilled in the past over there. But is there any reason to expect that you might see a shallower decline rate in the Wolfcamp than you've seen in the Bone Spring?", "John Lambuth", "We don't know. I think honestly just time will tell in that case. I don't know that -- I guess I'll just say we don't know. We just need more production history here to tell us whether or not we can get a different type of decline profile than what the typical Third Bone Spring sands do. So we'll just have to wait and see.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "And then on Slide 14 in the presentation, where you mentioned Ward County, in that slide are you saying that you don't think the Wolfcamp B through D is perspective and Ward that you just haven't tested that yet?", "John Lambuth", "And you're referring to Reeves County?", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "Ward County?", "John Lambuth", "Right now, I can't really comment on D. Honestly, when we look at Ward County, the next sound that we get really excite about is really the B/C. Now, I don't know that really look much at D, I think it does thin there some, but I can't really comment. Nobody's, really to my, recollection has drilled a D well in Ward County.", "Thomas Jorden", "Just on Slide 14, our wells and targets that we're currently exploiting that we view our economic. So in Ward County, we only have one target there, because that's all we've drilled. We will be testing the B/C as John said. It looks highly perspective to us. We didn't include on the slide, because we don't have any results.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "And then on Slide 12, the old curve looks like the 5.5 Bcf case from last year. But I was wondering what the EUR assumptions are for the Tim Tam well? Just looking at the graph and the PV10, it looks like it could be a little bit higher than the 30% increase in IP range that you've talked about from upside fracs?", "Thomas Jorden", "We're not prepared to comment on EUR for a well for which we just have a few months of production. We're going to have to watch it. And it does look like it's a little shallower decline in our original wells. And we're seeing greater than a 30% uplift certainly on sustained rate. But time will tell our EUR there.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "Then the last question, how much opportunity is there to expand your existing Avalon oil acreage and then also the Reeves County acreage positions?", "John Lambuth", "I must say that Avalon position we have is right in kind of the sweet spot of where the best Avalon wells are being made. And so it's pretty tightly held by a number of operators. We're fortunate enough to have the position we have to develop those locations. So I don't see much in a way. There is no acreage necessarily just go out there and lease, it's tied up pretty tight. Your second question? I'm sorry.", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "Reeves County, Wolfcamp?", "John Lambuth", "In terms of additional acreage?", "Phillip Jungwirth - BMO", "Yes.", "John Lambuth", "Well, it's safe to say, yes. We are still actively trying based on our mapping to continue to acquire acreage, and we continue to be somewhat successful in doing that. But we still are having some success picking up new leases in that play.", "Operator", "Next we have Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.", "Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company", "Guys, just a follow-up on the acreage question over there. As far as your position in Culberson and the relative availability of the longer laterals, does that new tactic of doing this many long laterals as you can, focusing more attention on potential acreage swaps and bulking up acreage in prices where you and some of your neighboring operators will be benefited from that sort of agreement.", "Joseph Albi", "Well, boy, I'd love to think we could do that. Obviously, what made the Chevron JDA so perfect for that is because it was a check report. Essentially they were the white squares and we were the black. So by putting that together it was a natural fit. In other areas, it all kind of depends on how your acreage flows relative to your competitors and your peers and what you could do there.", "I mean if there was a situation, where we felt like there was someone who had a comparable acreage position that we paired up it would lead to longer laterals, we would probably entertain talking to them. But I just don't know if there is going to be that many situations, just given the lay to land there.", "Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company", "And then you mentioned stack, you mentioned plans to test it, any sort of timeframe you wanted to put around that, as we talk in to something that's eminent, something that's a back half '14 event?", "Joseph Albi", "No. I would argue it's more of a latter first, second quarter event for us.", "Thomas Jorden", "This time we're obviously watching our competitors carefully on that and we see their enthusiasm for the play. We also understand that there are a lot of technology challenges that were faced and dealt in that play. We understand those technical challenges probably. And we see the potential, but boy, there is so much we don't know. We don't know what the yield will be, is it oily, is it gassy, what the deliverability will be. We're going to test it and we'll report back when we have some results.", "Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company", "And Tom, you kind of alluded that with [indiscernible].", "Thomas Jorden", "That's underway and we'll report, it will be midyear.", "Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company", "And last one from me, as you guys walking through the Q1 production impacts and how those wells come on in the very variability of timing of things. It seemed to indicate that the run ramp for production obviously starts in Q2, but the back half of the year from a percentage gains basis would probably be stronger, is that a fair assumption to make?", "Joseph Albi", "I mean to get to the 760 to 780 and start off where we are in Q1, it's obviously a ramp up. And the ramp up as we've currently got it scheduled and all this can vary with completion schedules, frac schedules, crews and what have you, calls for a good ramp up here in the later part of Q2.", "John Lambuth", "And reality always can intervene on the best plants, but I'll say this, we have shy of one rig of the rigs that are fully baked into that plan and we're on track here. So the model is what the model is. It's back half loaded.", "Joseph Albi", "This is the exact same type of profile that we put out in front of you guys last year and we did it.", "Operator", "The next question will have comes from Jeff Robertson of Barclays.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "Can you all talk about the time you need to evaluate these new frac techniques to figure out if you're having the right recipe before you start deciding whether or not there is a variable you need to change?", "John Lambuth", "I guess it would depend on which engineer I talk to because depending on who I talk to, they all wanted a difference amount of time. There are certain things we look for, obviously what's and rather so excited about Culberson is just that initial IP and that 30-day rate we see, that clearly was a step change relative to our other wells as our graph shows.", "But I'll be honest, some of these other wells, it doesn't really show up some times early on in the production, but it definitely shows up a good 90 days, 120 days later in the client profile. So sometimes it could take a good 90 days to 120 days before you really sell like you've made a type of change that's going to be material in terms of that overall EUR.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "Do you think you'll have data by the time you start completing some of the wells, some of that pilot test you're drilling on pads in the second quarter.", "John Lambuth", "Well, we feel very good about our frac design right now, especially in Culberson, very good. Now, I would argue in Reeves, we haven't drilled as many wells. And I would argue that we still have potential to dramatically change that frac and do even better Reeves. The resource there is very thick. It maps very good for us.", "And so we still have some homework to do their in Reeves in terms of optimizing that frac, but I'd like the job, we have right now that we're doing as evidenced by some of the results we've talked about in the past. So going forward, we feel very good about our current stimulation for that area.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "John, I think you mentioned you all are going to take that technique or some variation of it up to Cana this year? Did you say how many wells you have on inventory?", "John Lambuth", "What I can speak to is we have taken from the Culberson completion and we've taken it to one of our sections and we have completed four wells now in Canada using that frac style and we are inflow back, and again you can sit here and argue how many months is it going to take to tell whether it makes a different or not. But I'll just simply say, as I said earlier, the early signs to us are encouraging. And certainly that's something probably by next earnings call, we'll have a lot more information to tell you about on those wells.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "Last question on the Reeves County where you all will drill the stacked pilot in the Wolfcamp A, in Culberson or in Ward is a Wolfcamp A where you show it beginning a little bit thinner, is it thick enough or is it there trying to do any kind of a stacked spacing test as well.", "John Lambuth", "We don't know. I would argue. We will probably test it, since we just don't know.", "Thomas Jorden", "Is it thick enough? Is it sufficiently thick to absorb to pilots and stack them and we're going to probably test it.", "John Lambuth", "We are constantly amazed based on what others are doing not just within the Delaware Basin, but other Basins and how tight people are starting to put these laterals, vertically from each other. And so that's something we recognize, and yes, and in Culberson A we will more than likely touch that.", "Operator", "The next question we have comes from Abhi Sinha of Wunderlich Securities.", "Abhi Sinha - Wunderlich Securities", "I just had couple of questions. One on Avalon, just trying to get how uniform the acreage is or how continuous the acreage is basically, so I'm trying to evaluate how did you get to 200 locations? Is it just like acreage or spacing or there is more specific location wise?", "John Lambuth", "Again, we're very lucky in the Avalon. There is a lot of drilling that's taking place. A lot of pilots have gone forward. And right now, everyone is kind of gravitating to six wells a section. So really there's nothing more than just taking our current perspective acreage position and then planning out to six wells per section to get to that well count.", "Abhi Sinha - Wunderlich Securities", "So just as a follow-up. The technician that you've brought in Avalon versus what you experienced last time. My guess is like in the last experience, three years ago, when you drilled some wells, you experienced a high decline rate. And the techniques that you're applying right now is geared towards getting a higher IP. Are you doing something to tackle the high decline rate in terms choke size or anything like that or is it more towards getting higher IP, which will get you higher returns.", "Thomas Jorden", "In the cast of Avalon, you're absolutely right that early on in that program when we drilled the completed wells, we've got very good IPs, but then they would fall like a rock within the first 30 days to 60 days. Quite frankly, with this new frac design, we don't really experienced very high IPs at first, but over time the wells continued to clean up to whereafter 30 days to 60 days, we then reached our peak IP. And then we see much slower decline. So that's what's been the biggest change as per that frac design, which has led to that kind of result we're having. So we've fundamentally had changed kind of the flow back profile of those wells based on that frac.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "And on the Wolfcamp side, can you comment if you have any presence of Wolfcamp in your New Mexico counties like Lea or any counties like one of your smaller competitor just reported a well in Lea County I guess having the Wolfcamp presence?", "Joseph Albi", "We have acreage in that play, especially up in the White City area. But we also recognize that that it could expand even beyond there. We just haven't got to the point of testing it just yet in the areas like Lea County like you're mentioning.", "Thomas Jorden", "White City is in Eddy County, and that's actually where we drilled our first Wolfcamp well in 2009.", "Joseph Albi", "An area quite frankly we're looking back at now from along lateral standpoint. It to us right now that area looks very perspective now, because of these long laterals.", "Jeff Robertson - Barclays", "And lastly, could you just remind us, how your rig distribution looks like right now? I mean considering you increased the rig count in Permian from 12 to 16 and it decreased in the Mid-Continent, but I'm not sure what the non-activity looks like in Mid-Content and how the rig distribution look likes versus Bone Spring versus what you have in Wolfcamp?", "John Lambuth", "Well, I can tell you exactly, what's going on today, but also in 30 days it will change, because obviously any one rig we have could move from a Bone Spring to a Wolfcamp well. But as we speak right now, we have nine wells, soon to be 10, drilling Wolfcamp wells. Six wells drilling Bone Springs and then one well drilling in Avalon, and then there is another rig testing other types of concepts for us right now.", "So right now that should bring you to 18 with the 19 rig coming some time in the April, May timeframe. In terms of Cana, we have the two operated rigs and then we have a partners has six rigs. But our understanding is they will be winding down the rig count to essentially zero some time here in the second quarter, if not sooner in Cana.", "Operator", "Matt Portillo of TPH.", "Matt Portillo - TPH", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I want to do just follow-up on a few. In terms of your acreage position, you mentioned perspective acreage in Reagan, and then also some perspective acreage in the stack. I was wondering if you could put any context behind that in terms of the size of those positions?", "John Lambuth", "Well, I can say this much in terms of the Midland Basin right now we have seven wells scheduled for Midland on that acreage. Again, the 2014, I think there is some follow-up ones in '15. It's not a huge position.", "Thomas Jorden", "It's not going to be more than a few dozen wells in absolute total.", "John Lambuth", "And then in terms of stack, I honestly I don't know, we really have a good number on acreage right now. We're still trying to map it to get a better definition of it. We have a lot of acreage over, I'll just say that much.", "Thomas Jorden", "I can tell you that most of what we know about stack, we've gleamed from the internet. And we see the same mystery that our competitors do and that the long response look somewhat enigmatic and competitive that's ahead of us to call core, and now is unlocking the play to them. We've taken a long-haul core, it's currently being analyzed.", "As John said, as we map that interval it comes over most if not all of our 75,000 acres held by production acreage. And I just told you about the full technical analysis. We're analyzing the rocks. We are going to test it and the proof will be in the pudding. But one of the many unknowns, two of them are the rate, the ultimate deliverability and the hydrocarbon type. And we can do all the science in the world, and then the well will tell us the answer and that's underway.", "Matt Portillo - TPH", "And then in terms of the Avalon, I was wondering if you could put any context behind how you guys are thinking about the EURs in the play, even if it's kind of a wide range around it, just trying to get a sense of what your recovery maybe there?", "John Lambuth", "I'm not going to quote an EUR as much as I'll just say again, the rate of returns right now on our Avalon wells are pretty much competing right there with our Bone Spring wells. It's turned into a wonderful rate of return play for us. So we're very, very pleased. And then thus you see the amount of capital we're going to allocate to it this year and aggressively drill it this year.", "Matt Portillo - TPH", "And then just last question, Gulf Coast has become kind of diminished within your overall portfolio. I wondered if you could give us some color on the plans there kind of in 2014 and then on a go-forward basis on what you maybe looking at doing?", "John Lambuth", "It saddens me to say being a geophysicist that at the end of '13 we've made the decision to close down our Gulf Coast region, as an active exploration region. It really reached to point where with the totality of all the opportunity we had in the Permian and quite frankly Mid-Continent and the type of rate of returns we're generating, we just felt like the Gulf Coast cannot be as impactful as it has for us in the past.", "And quite frankly, we have extremely talented people in the Gulf Coast that we felt like we could better deploy in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent efforts. So at the end of '13 we did that. We have at best maybe one or two prospects remaining that we like, that we may drill in the '14 and then that would pretty much close the door on our Gulf Coast exploration program.", "Operator", "It's showing that we have reached an hour, we will go ahead and conclude with our last question for today. It will be Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "So a couple of quick ones for you. Following-up on the Avalon, the couple of hundred locations you have talked about in Avalon so far, is that spread across all acreage review as perspective there. Do you have any upside to that potential in Avalon acreage?", "John Lambuth", "I mean, when we quote those locations, we're really talking specifically to that one area in southwestern Lea, that that quite frankly the best wells are being drilled. And that's where we concentrate our effort. As I said earlier, for the previous call, that acreage is tied up very tight. There is not a lot of additional opportunity to expand upon that. So right now that that's where we're concentrating our efforts.", "Thomas Jorden", "The Avalon is perspective over a very broad part of the Basin. In fact, our one of the best Avalon wells drilled, there's a well we drilled in Eddy County, a very gassy well, a very high deliverability. So could the Avalon expand? Absolutely. It's a function of product price. So it's reservoir and it produces over much of the Basin.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "Speaking of price, obviously, has pretty strong gas prices and slightly better NGL prices than we've had in a while. Any thoughts on use of -- I mean I would imagine given the commodity prices that we have right now. I know it's early in the year, cash flow is probably tracking ahead of budget and ahead expectations. Any thoughts on how you'd prioritize use of potential excess cash? And whether you think about increasing activity at all maybe Cana in or targeting opportunism in gas.", "Paul Korus", "We have not changed our capital program expectations for the year, yet. We're still at $1.8 billion. Coming into the year, we envisioned outspending our cash flow by $300 million or $400 million. The higher product prices and higher revenues simply mean, we'll most likely borrow less.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, did you have any closing remarks at this time.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you everyone for joining us today on the conference call. I appreciate your attention and I will look forward to seeing you in future. Any follow-up calls, please give Karen Acierno or myself a call and we'd loved to discuss any other question you might have. But again, thanks for attending and we look forward to report you further in the future. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we thank you, sir and the rest of management team for your time today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Burford, Vice President of Capital Markets and Planning. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you very much, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; John Lambuth, Vice President -- and John Lambuth, Vice President, Exploration. We also have Paul Korus, CFO; and Karen Acierno, on hand here today as well.", "We issued our financial and operating results release this morning and also a release regarding a new acquisition that we announced yesterday after the close. And a copy of the news releases can be found on our website, along with the latest presentation, which we may refer to from time to time today on today's call.", "I need to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read and -- you should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and news releases for risks factors associated with our business.", "So we have a lot of to cover today, so I'll go ahead and get the call turned over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex.", "I'd like to take a few minutes to touch on some highlights for the quarter, before turning it over to John and Joe for a more detailed update. Our success in the quarter, I think, is best described with one word, and that's innovation. Innovation resulted in dramatically improved results in our Cana-Woodford play, which led to record production of 740 million cubic feet equivalent during the quarter, up 12% over last year, but more importantly, up 13% sequentially, which was well ahead of our guidance. This extraordinary success in Cana came from the implementation of upsized completions and some better-than-expected results from a workover program.", "These results were a key driver in our decision to purchase additional Cana assets, a transaction we announced yesterday. Upon closing, we'll have spent approximately $250 million for 140 Bcf-equivalent approved reserves and, more importantly, 50,000 net acres, of which 30,000 are in our Cana focus area. With this transaction, we were able to increase our position in the field where we are a dominant player at a time when we are rediscovering its potential. We're experiencing significant uplift to our returns in Cana from an upsized frac, returns that compete with those in the Permian. In addition, we see additional upside in this acreage, including the Merrimack potential.", "As you know, we, at Cimarex, seek a return on investment capital, and we're somewhat agnostic as to whether those returns come from oil projects or gas projects. We think it's to our advantage to be a multi-basin company with a portfolio of opportunities. Every now and then, you articulate a strategy, you articulate a philosophy and you occasionally get to demonstrate it by living it. What I want to say is that we've become very heavily Permian-weighted, and I'll -- we'll talk about that a lot in this call, but one of our challenges to our organization over the last 9 months to 1 year has been let's find other areas to get returns that can compete with the Permian.", "We manage Cimarex and we manage our program by having a diverse exposure to a number of different play types, a number of different commodity types, and we believe the company is made stronger to have the flexibility of picking and choosing as opportunities arise. We had some extraordinary success and I attribute that to our team in the Mid-Continent working Cana, with their completion innovation and also some workover innovation. And as we sit today, we think our Cana program competes head on with returns with our Permian program. And that is an absolutely wonderful outcome.", "Now it's also gratifying to raise our guidance and give an increased growth trajectory and communicate it to you. But I want to say again, and we've said this before, this is about return on investment capital and not about a growth target. And we're delighted to be facing a landscape where we have returns on invested capital in the Permian and in the Mid-Continent area that can compete head-to-head, that gives us the flexibility to adapt to market conditions and any constraints in this growing industry environment. So I want to be clear, this purchase and our excitement about Cana has not altered our plans for the Delaware Basin. We are right on track, and you'll hear about some significant new results.", "Innovation has resulted in Cimarex continuing to make great wells and see improvements in our completion techniques in the Delaware Basin as well. One thing we like in particular are the results we're achieving with long laterals. So much so, we're now moving our program to drill long laterals wherever possible. We've put a lot of energy into building a land position that allows for long laterals. And this year, in 2014, approximately 40% of our Wolfcamp wells will be drilled with long laterals.", "Our acreage position in Culberson County, which we solidified by our joint development agreement with Chevron, provides the perfect platform for long laterals. Today, we announced our second long lateral in Culberson County, drilled to the Wolfcamp D target, the well was the Gallant Fox, completed using a 10,000-foot lateral and a 43-stage completion. Despite some initial pipeline constraints, that well had a 30-day average production rate of over 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.", "With long laterals in mind, we added to our acreage position. We added 45,000 net acres to our Wolfcamp play fairway in the first quarter, including 35,000 acres in Reeves County. Now some of that acreage was added through new leasing. Some of it is added through an expansion of our fairway. We had a couple of fairly significant wells that industry competitors drilled in Southern Lea County, and that allowed us to recognize additional acreage that went into our Wolfcamp fairway.", "Our pilot program continues. We're flowing back our Wolfcamp C and D stacked lateral tests in Culberson County. And our completion of our 4-well 80-acre pilots in Culberson and Reeves are underway and on target. We'll share those results with you later in the year.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth to discuss details of our drilling program.", "John A. Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting into the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent region and the results in Cana.", "Cimarex drilled and completed 74 gross, 36 net wells during the quarter, investing $467 million. 67% of this investment was in the Permian region, with 29% of it in the Mid-Continent. Of those 36 net wells, 21 net wells were in the Permian region, where we continue to be focused on the Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin.", "Bone Spring activity in the first quarter included 13 net wells in New Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the company's highest rate of returns, with oil volumes representing up to 84% of the first 30 days of production. Our Bone Spring program for 2014 is comprised of 56 net wells, which results in a total investment of $375 million. We continue to have about 200 to 300 Bone Spring locations identified on our acreage in New Mexico and in Culberson County, where we have identified a thick highly productive 2nd Bone Spring sand.", "At the beginning of the year, we announced a new drilling program in the Avalon Shale in Lea County, New Mexico. Results to date have been very good. The 9 Avalon wells drilled-to-date have a 30-day average IP of 1,003 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with oil making up 77% of the production from these wells. We have an inventory of over 200 locations and plan to drill from 15 to 20 wells in 2014.", "About half of our Permian drilling capital in 2014 or about $685 million will go toward further delineation of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunities in the Delaware Basin. This includes downspacing pilots and wells drilled to hold acreage. As Tom mentioned, we now have 225,000 net acres identified as prospective for the Wolfcamp Shale, up from the 180,000 net acres we discussed during our last call. This is the result of both acquisition of additional acreage and a slight redrawing of the Wolfcamp fairway outline due to recent well results. You can view our new fairway outline in our updated presentation materials.", "We are currently producing from 6 distinct Wolfcamp zones across the 225,000 net acres we've defined as our Wolfcamp fairway. While they may have the same name, they have very different characteristics across the play. We define them as the Wolfcamp A, C and D zones in Culberson, the Wolfcamp A and B/C in Reeves and the Wolfcamp A in Ward County. We currently have wells producing from all of these Wolfcamp zones.", "As Tom mentioned, one of the innovations of the first quarter was the proof of concept of long-lateral drilling in the Wolfcamp. We now have 9 long-laterals wells producing across our acreage and expect 40% of our 2014 Wolfcamp wells to be long laterals, which we defined as being longer than 5,000 feet. Over half of the Culberson County Wolfcamp wells will be long laterals, with 14 in the Wolfcamp D, one in the C, and one in the A, and another 13 long laterals are planned in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves and Ward Counties.", "A couple of examples of the recent success we've had with long laterals includes a well we announced today and then one that Tom mentioned earlier, the Gallant Fox, which had a 30-day peak IP average of 2,516 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It is our second well in Culberson County to incorporate long-lateral drilling and upsized fracture stimulation. The 10,000-foot long Gallant Fox well was completed with 43 frac stages. Typical of a Wolfcamp D well, it has a product mix that is comprised of 646 barrels of oil, which is 26% of the production; 6.9 million cubic feet of gas a day, which equates to 45%; and 730 barrels of NGL per day, or 29%.", "In Reeves County, we recently completed a well we call Thunder, which had a peak 30-day IP rate of 1,411 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Wolfcamp A. This well was a 6,400-foot long lateral and was completed with 30 frac stages. This rate is 50% higher than our standard 5,000-foot lateral with a 12-stage completion. Like other Wolfcamp A wells in Reeves County, the Thunder was predominantly oil, which made up 50% of the production.", "Lastly, in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of the 4 unique pilot programs we currently have underway. I'll refer you to our presentation for an illustration to the designs. Our first pilot to be drilled and completed is the stacked lateral test in Culberson County. These wells are testing the concept of producing from laterals stacked in Wolfcamp C and D. These 2 wells have been fracture stimulated and have just started the flowback on them. The 2 4-well 80-acre downspacing pilots, one in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson and the other in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County, are both in various stages of completion. Once all 4 wells in the pilot are completed, the wells will be put on production and begin flowback. The fourth pilot is in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves and is considered both a stacked and staggered, as it will test the downspacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the thick Wolfcamp A section. We currently have 2 rigs drilling this 6-well pilot. As scheduled today, all the wells and all of the pilots should be on production sometime in the third quarter.", "Now onto the Mid-Continent, where we have perhaps our most exciting news for this quarter. We are pleased to report that our efforts to bring the upsized completion to our development in Cana has been highly successful. To illustrate, I'd like to direct you to Slide 18 in our latest corporate update posted on our website. This graph compares the traditional Cana infield completion with our aptly named Golden Section, the first section completed using an upsized frac. Results are strikingly similar to those we've experienced when we upsized the frac in Culberson County. This upsized frac had a positive impact on the initial production, the recoverable reserves and, most importantly, on the returns. Investing an additional $700,000 increases our before-tax internal rate of return from 38% to 86%. And our NPV10 more than doubles from $5.5 million to $14 million.", "At Cimarex, we like having options. And based on our results so far, these wells most definitely compete with our returns in the Permian, giving us more places to invest capital for good returns. We have 2 more operated sections on the schedule to be completed in 2014, and we look forward to reviewing our future plans as we get further confirmation of upsized frac results in Cana.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual topics. Our -- first, our first quarter of '14 production. I'll discuss the remainder of the year from a production outlook standpoint and follow up with a brief discussion on our operating and service costs.", "We truly had a great Q1, reporting average net daily equivalent production of 740 million cubic -- equivalent cubic feet a day, a record for the company and 30 million a day above the upper end of our Q1 guidance which was 696 million to 710 million. Both Cana and the Permian played a role in us exceeding our guidance, with Cana being the real driver.", "The step-change in performance that we've seen using upsized fracs in our new Cana completions played the biggest role on our production beat, while we also saw some nice increases in our Cana-based property production as a result of a number of well-bore cleanouts and remediation projects that our production team performed during the quarter. The bottom line is, Cana just simply well exceeded our plan expectations.", "In the Permian, our new well forecast held very tight to plan, while our Triple Crown pipeline turnaround project went about as smooth as it can go and, therefore, resulted in less downtime on the system than we had expected. And it also played a role in helping us to exceed our guidance.", "With a nice jump in our Q1 production, we were up 5% from our Q4 '13 average of 705 million a day and 12% over our Q1 '13 output of 661 million a day. Driven by Cana, Q1 ended up being a quarter of records for us in the Mid-Continent, where we set regional records for all product categories: gas, oil, NGL, total liquids and equivalent production. Our Q1 Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 371 million a day was up 28 million a day or 8% over where we were in the fourth quarter and 11 million a day or 3% from the levels we saw a year ago.", "With the nice quarterly gains in Cana, our Q1 Cana volume of 255 million a day was up 30 million a day or 13% from the fourth quarter, and it actually set a new record for us once again in the play. And with that level of production, Cana continues to play a vital role in our overall program. It now makes up 69% of our total Mid-Continent production and more than 1/3 of our total company volumes.", "In the Permian, we continued to see nice production growth during the quarter as well, with our Permian Q1 net equivalent volume of 347 million a day, up 4% or 15 million a day from Q4 '13, and up a very respectable 26% from the 275 million a day we averaged during Q1 '13. Oil continued to provide the growth for us in the Permian with our Q1 Permian oil production of 31,624 barrels per day, up 7% sequentially from Q4 and 22% from 1 year ago.", "During the quarter, we completed 22 net wells in the Permian. That well count was constrained a bit by our Wolfcamp spacing projects that John mentioned, which are projected to come on in the late Q2, early Q3 timeframe. And as a result, our net completions in the Permian are currently modeled to accelerate from 22 in Q1 to levels of 35 to 45 completions per quarter as we end out the year. With this pickup in completion activity, our modeling is showing that our Permian production growth should accelerate beginning here in the Q2, Q3 timeframe.", "Looking forward into our guidance. With our continued successes in Cana and in the Permian, our updated model is now projected -- is projecting a full year 2014 guidance range of 822 million to 847 million a day. That's up significantly from our beginning year range of 760 million to 800 million a day, and it reflects a very healthy 19% to 22% growth in our production over 2013.", "I want to make special note here that this range does not include any volumes from our recently announced Cana-Woodford acquisition, and that acquisition will add about 35 million a day to our books and on top of these numbers upon our anticipated closing, which is slated for June 30. And obviously, following closing, we'll include these new volumes in any future guidance updates that we provide to you.", "As might be expected from the tone of this call, the increase in guidance from 760 million to 800 million now up to 822 million to 840 million (sic) [ 847 million ] is nearly all driven and attributable to what we're seeing in Cana. As John mentioned, we've seen a solid step-change uplift in well performance, pumping larger fracs. In addition, our production group has done a great job of increasing production from our Cana-based properties by identifying underperforming wells and performing a variety of cleanout and wellbore remediation projects. That work really kicked off in late February and March, and we didn't see a full quarter's worth of that work. But the work that we did perform equated to approximately 6 million to 8 million a day to our Q1 Cana production volumes, and we expect that to increase as we close out the year. In a nutshell, both our exploration and operations teams are virtually hitting on all cylinders to boost production coming out of Cana.", "We also continued to see strong results from the Permian. With the number of Permian completions projected to accelerate in Q2 and Q3, our current model projects that Permian oil will jump from our Q1 levels of 31,625 barrels per day to well over 40,000 barrels of oil per day for an average in Q4, quite a jump with more than 60% of our fourth quarter projected oil coming from the wells that we drilled this year. So that gives you an idea of the impact that our new wells will be having on our oil production.", "So with our successes in Cana and our projected acceleration in the Permian, we've got just a wonderful springboard as we jump into Q2 here. And it's reflected on our Q2 guidance, which is projected at 810 million to 830 million a day, and that's a projected increase of 9% to 12% over just the first quarter. So as our volumes continue to grow, things we worry about, product takeaway remains high on our priority list. In that regard, Culberson -- in Culberson County, we're working alongside Chevron to evaluate proposals currently on the table for a third-party construction and operation of an oil-gathering system in our Triple Crown project.", "In all areas of the Permian, we're expanding the number of purchasers and haulers that we use to truck our oil out of the basin. As a result, we've recently added 3 new purchasers and are evaluating additional proposals from a handful of others. And although we feel the pressures of increasing oil supply coming out of the basin, as I'm sure all of our peers in the basin are also feeling, we continue to be successful, lighting up our production with sales all the while that we've been able to add new purchasers. In general, the pricing term for receiving reflect the WTI Midland-based pricing. And when we do see some gravity adjustments, we do find them to still be in the modest range.", "We're also working diligently on the gas takeaway and processing side in all the core areas of our activity. As an example, I'll use Triple Crown. Along that Triple Crown pipeline infrastructure, we now have 6 available markets for gas takeaway and processing as compared to just one option that we had years ago when we started in the area. Our marketing and midstream groups are doing a great job to work side by side with our exploration and production teams to ensure that we're building out infrastructure as far ahead of our activity as we can, and ultimately providing for takeaway.", "Shifting gears to OpEx. Our Q1 lifting cost came in at $1.13 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our full year guidance range of $1.12 to $1.22 and right in line with our 2013 average of $1.13 per Mcfe. Although we saw some cost pressure during the quarter in items such as chemicals, compression, power and fuel, our per-unit operating expenses benefited from our stronger production, obviously. And as a result, we've brought down the top end of our production expense range for full year to $1.18, putting our revised guidance for lifting cost for this year at $1.12 to $1.18.", "A few words on service costs. We continue to see most costs on the drilling side to stay relatively in check, including our day rates, which, for 1,500-horsepower top drives, have been holding in the $22,000 to $25,000 a day range for multiple quarters now. That said, top drives do seem to be in short supply. And with that, we are seeing that the number of new builds seem to be going up. But with service costs flat, our drilling team is continuing to focus and is successful on doing what they can to reduce our cost through operating efficiencies, and we continue to see that in most all of our programs.", "On the completion side, we've seen some modest cost pressure from a tightening market for equipment. But most of the cost pressure has come on the transportation side, particularly in the transportation of prop when we're pumping these bigger jobs. That said, any real significant cost increases that we've seen on the completion side have come directly associated with us pumping bigger jobs, more stages, more fluid, more prop. And as a result, the completion component of our AFEs can now make up more than 60% of our total well cost in programs like Cana in the Mid-Continent, and in the Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp in the Permian. Our recent well results, however, are telling us that the incremental benefits are certainly well worth the additional cost.", "From a total well cost standpoint, incorporating the upsized frac into our new Cana well design puts our current Cana core AFE at the $6.9 million to $7.2 million level. That's up from the $6.3 million to $6.5 million level we saw early in Q1. With the smaller fracs -- on the smaller fracs in Q1, the increase that we've seen has been entirely attributable to the upsized fracs. And as a good example of this, we've made just tremendous strides on the drilling side in Cana over the last 6 to 9 months. And it's very well evidenced by the fact that our current AFE, including the large frac, is running about where we were all-in for the small frac in Q3 '13.", "In the Permian, AFEs for a 4,500-foot lateral, 2nd and 3rd New Mexico Bone Spring wells continue to run in the range of $5.7 million to $6.5 million, depending on depth. That's flat from last quarter and down about $400,000 to $500,000 from where we were a year ago. In our shallower Texas 2nd Bone Spring program, our AFEs are still in the $5.1 million to $5.5 million range. We've bumped the upper end of that range from last call by pumping a little bit larger-sized frac, but that's still down about $0.5 million from where we were a year ago. And our current Avalon wells are running in the $7.2 million to $7.5 million range, incorporating the larger frac.", "As we continue to experiment with upsized fracs in our Wolfcamp program, our current AFEs for a 4,500-foot lateral are in the $8.5 million to $9 million range, that's depending on the geographic area and the size of the frac, while our 2-mile Wolfcamp laterals, our AFE are in the $13 million to $14.5 million range, again depending on the size of the frac.", "So in closing, we're off to a great start here in 2014. Q1 production came in very, very strong, and it gave us a wonderful springboard into Q2. And with that, we've raised our full year outlook for production. We're keeping our LOE and our service costs in check, and we're making very good progress finding ways to optimize production from the wells that we've drilled.", "And with that, I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just one quick question on the Cana. Obviously, the returns you guys have highlighted here are quite impressive. I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about the asset from an acceleration perspective as you move into kind of 2015 and, in particular, with regards to the recent acquisition?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, Matt, this is Tom. We are looking at acceleration in Cana. We're, of course, kind of in the midst of a lot of moving parts here with just announcing this transaction. We're in the due diligence phase, getting ready for the June closing. We are looking at a potential acceleration that would have additional infill drilling, really would be a 2015 issue. We might get started later this year. But obviously, we have other companies to coordinate with. Cana is a multi-company arena, and no one company can just do things in isolation. So we're looking at some plans, we're lining it up and we'll get back to you when get a little more detail on it.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just a second question, kind of a bigger-picture question in terms of, I guess, both the Cana and Permian. Given the resource base that continues to expand here, I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit of context of how you guys think about kind of your drilling program and how it will progress over the next year or 2 in terms of the size and scale that this may move to from kind of your current position.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well -- again, this is Tom. We see -- given commodity windage, we see an accelerating drilling program. And the beauty of what we've announced today is we think we have an equal opportunity to accelerate in the Mid-Continent, in the Permian and/or both. Now one of the things that we're concerned about, the industry is concerned about, is some of the pressures of so many Permian companies accelerating simultaneously. That leads to pressures in rigs, pressures in stimulation and other services, pressures in oil and gas takeaway and pressures in manpower. So one of the things that this allows us to do, to the extent we look at accelerating, we have a little built-in relief valve without sacrificing our return on invested capital. I mean, this is exactly the strategy Cimarex is built around. So yes, we'll -- we will accelerate. And the way we're thinking about it is we have the flexibility that we've always cherished that optimize both our returns but also our ability to execute efficiently.", "Operator", "Our next question is Brian Gamble, Simmons & Company.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "On the long-lateral wells, we've talked about a couple of them. You said you had 9 producing now. Any others to note anything of, or is that something the -- for later in the future?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John Lambuth. Well, obviously, we don't talk about every long lateral that we drill. We just try to point out significant ones, which is why the Gallant Fox was talked about because it was a very nice confirmation of what we were able to achieve with the previously announced Montrose well. And likewise, the Thunder we talked about because besides being a long lateral, it also incorporated a bigger upsized frac. That really -- those 2 components are kind of the go-forward components in all 3 of those areas, for Culberson, Reeves and Ward. And certainly, as we get further long lateral results and, let's say, others zones that we haven't talked about, we'll certainly add more color and comments to that once we have those wells to talk about.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And on that same-well results side, the -- I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I was going to say, obviously, we're very encouraged that the program is moving in that direction. We don't know that every well we drill is going to be representative of the 3 10,000-foot laterals we have announced. But so far, so good.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And the 30-day IP rate, one of your slides, the Eddy, Lea County number moved up significantly during the quarter. Is that all upsized frac, or were you doing anything else there during the quarter versus last quarter? I think it moved up from 665 to 966...", "John A. Lambuth", "Can you tell us what particular page are you referring to so we'd look at it?", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Sure, of course. On slide -- let's see, on Slide 8. You mentioned the 2nd and 3rd Bone in Eddy and Lea, your 30-day rate for this quarter versus last quarter, 966 versus, I think, last quarter was 665. Is that all frac stuff?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, it is. In the Bone Spring, we haven't talked a lot about that. But we have definitely, in the Bone Spring, gone in and made adjustments to our frac design there as well. And we're seeing some nice results by doing that, especially in the White City Culberson area, and so we're moving to that frac design in that area. And going forward, that's what we'll use. But -- plus, we're still tinkering with it. We still think we can even get better results. So we're very encouraged so far from what we're seeing out of that area.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And then one more, if I may. The gravity adjustment that you mentioned were modest thus far. Are you intending to just continue to lock in modest adjustments in some of these new purchasing agreements or eliminate those adjustments moving forward? How do we think about any sort of deducts that may be involved in new deals or even better pricing that may be involved in new deals?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. The current deducts that we're seeing are like $0.30 to $0.40 per degree gravity, and they're over different API numbers, depending on the contract. Getting long-term contracts with these guys, with our purchasers, is not as easy as, I guess, we had hoped to have it be, because I think they are concerned about the same things we are. That said, what I will tell you about our ability to get new purchasers into the game down there, we've been very successful. We've added 3 additional purchasers and all of them seem very comfortable in taking any of the gravities that we're giving them.", "Operator", "Our next question is Jason Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on Brian's question on crude oil pricing again. Is that gravity issue, is that more just focused in the Wolfcamp C and D, and as you guys kind of the move up to the A, it's less of an issue?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes. This is Joe again. The only areas we're really seeing any kind of adjustment in the Permian are in the Wolfcamp, and so in the Culberson area, as well as in the Reeves. The Wolfcamp, the Culberson is little bit higher gravity. It's like 54 to 58 degree. And when you get over there into Reeves, it's 46 to 52. We've got -- let's see, we've got 3 specific purchasers that I'll speak of in Culberson. And we're seeing the deducts in one case over 45 degrees, and then the other one will take crude over 50, but it's just a little bit higher fee. So their fee jumps up about $1.50. So I don't know about...", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But all the zones you're seeing -- I mean, I know you haven't done much in the Wolfcamp A over there. But you're seeing the Wolfcamp A in the high -- in the mid-50s as well?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We -- this is Tom. We do see a little lower API number in the A than we do the D and the C. But it's still what you would call light. It's in the 50s. So really, the variation we're seeing that's significant is more regional than it is stratigraphic. We'll get a little lower API number in Ward County than we will in Culberson County, and Reeves is kind of intermediate.", "Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then in Reeves and Ward, the acreage you guys tacked on, can you just maybe give us some color on what you paid for that?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John Lambuth. We added approximately, as Tom said, the 35,000 acres. And the cost for that was right around in the $2,300, $2,400-an-acre range for that additional...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "This was a leasing effort. It wasn't one fell swoop. This was dozens and dozens of incremental deals.", "John A. Lambuth", "I mean, we saw an opportunity from our -- in our explorations where we felt like we could expand the play and get more acreage, and we were able to execute upon it and add that acreage. So we're very pleased with that additional acreage position we've added to it.", "Operator", "Our next question is Joe Allman, JPMorgan.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Tom, for that Cana acquisition, why flip half of it and not keep the whole thing?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, there's lots of answers to that. Would we have been happy to keep it? Yes, yes, we would. That said, Cimarex and Devon had a long-standing cooperation out there, and we typically offer assets like this to one another. So that was part of the thinking. We also are the biggest working interest owners out there. And so both companies, I think, having a willingness to reawaken the drilling program in Cana is important to both of us. So I will say this, I was more concerned about just the willingness to invest and go forward than I was the $250 million or $500 million. We do look at our debt, and this is incremental to our debt. We have lots of inventory, and it was not a -- it wasn't a tough call for us. We're happy to offer half of it. Joe, Cana is -- just I can't underscore how pleased we are with our recent results. We're encouraged that it will translate over the widespread field, and we're going to have a long road ahead of us of just top tier returns out of Cana. The executive team, we're here in Tulsa today and we're having an annual conference with all of our technical people from around the company. And I walked up this morning and came in the middle of an argument that 2 of our junior engineers were having, one was a Permian engineer and one was a Cana engineer, and they were debating whose programs generates higher rate of return. And that's a debate that we love and greatly encourage here at Cimarex. And so we've got plenty to do here. And you know what? Yes, could we have taken all of it? You bet, but we're real pleased with the decision we made.", "Operator", "Our next question is Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just thinking ahead to the 2015 program, you talked about potentially accelerating in Cana. Are there any gas processing or pipeline takeaway concerns in Cana? And I guess, how many -- how much running room do you have before things become tight there?", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. We've taken a good, hard close look at our production wedge and the marketing arrangements that we currently have. And with our current takeaway options, we feel very comfortable getting through the remainder of this year without any processing or compression issues with our primary purchaser. We also have 3 other markets that we're pursuing now as we look forward into 2015 to try and understand our wedge there. We really -- with the '15 program, if we were to accelerate, it'd be row [ph] drilling. We'd start that in the fall, and that completion activity probably wouldn't really start to hit the books until second quarter of next year. And that would be the time that we hope to have these other potential arrangements locked up. So I guess a high-level answer is we've got plenty of breathing room that we see right now in the short term, medium term, and we're worrying about our long-term ability to get out of there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. And, Drew, it's Tom. the -- like anything we do, we have to look pretty far ahead and make sure that the infrastructure's ready, the market's ready, the rigs are there. And so as Joe said, we're in the process of doing that. The nice thing about where we sit right now is Permian and Cana kind of complement one another and play off one another. So any activity that's limited in one can be taken up by the other. So we're intending to accelerate in Cana, but we've got plenty to do in both basins. So we're-- we feel like we've -- today, are announcing a very significant safety valve for Cimarex in terms of our future growth profile.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then just to follow up to that. Do you feel like these new Cana completions can be applied across your position, or is there anything that would keep you from being able to use the new completions across-the-board there?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, this is John Lambuth. That's a great question. That's exactly what we're attempting -- or are doing right now with our current rigs. We are both completing some additional new infill sections, which are geographically separate from the Golden Section. So that'll be a nice checkmark to show that we can get similar-type returns. And then likewise, we are out there drilling some initial parent wells or first wells in the section in areas where we're trying to reestablish what is the type of production we should expect using this new frac style. So there's a lot of delineation in a sense. It's hard to imagine me using that word. But in some sense, that is there, that we're trying to kind of recalibrate ourselves as to what type of production profile we should expect with this new fracture stimulation. And then let me also say we haven't really honed on -- honed in to actually exactly what is the best frac job. Even within the Golden Section. We changed it up some -- among a number of the wells there. And we are still experimenting some that we think we could perhaps even -- can do even better than what we have right now. So there's definitely some additional drilling and testing we need to do to just gain further confidence to how applicable this could be across the broad Cana area.", "Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is there any conservatism baked into your Cana production forecast, just given how much production history you have on these new completions?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "That's a very...", "Joseph R. Albi", "In all of our modeling, we're modeling what we book and -- as a starting point, and that's with our base properties. And those are based on current well productions levels and current well declines. And as we start to see better and better well results, the -- I guess the type curves of the wells that you're drilling are going to be integrated into those future wells that you drill. And those are the wells that we model off of. As far as guidance is concerned, our beginning year guidance did not incorporate the impact that these upsized fracs had because we kind of wanted to wait to see if it happened first before we go ahead and do that. And obviously, now that we've upped the ante on our Cana production for this year, we're sending the signal to the market that we're fairly confident that what we're doing is working and it's showing up in Cana. So as we continue to see results, we build those results into not only our future investment decisions, but also to what we forecast that we'll produce in our cash flow models.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes. Drew, we always estimate what we think is realistic. And is there conservatism? I mean, there's always is. And life in the oil patch can be a very humbling experience. Things tend to go wrong. So we always build in a fair amount of tolerance for either timing delays or operational issues. But yes, it is what we think we'll achieve.", "Operator", "Our next question is Cameron Horwitz, U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "On your Delaware Wolfcamp map, can't help but notice more dots there to the east and in Ward County. Maybe a little bit early, but I was hoping if you could potentially give us a little bit of color as to how you're thinking about kind of the opportunity set over there, the relative productivity and the oil cuts on -- in the Wolfcamp over there to the east?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. This is John Lambuth. The word you used is very appropriate. It is early. A lot of those dots you see are in their flowback, and we haven't really achieved peak 30-day averages for us to talk much about them. It is definitely oilier as you get into Ward from Reeves. That trend continues into there. But we are still very early there in Ward and just trying to get a good understanding of the type of the well we're going to have there. I would hope, certainly, by next conference call, we'll have a lot more to say about our Ward County program.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of modeling for the rest of the year. With the Cana acquisition, how do we think about the average working interest there in Cana at the current pace once that acquisition closes?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. I'll just rattle off some of the stats, working interest-wise, that pertain to our share of the QEP sale. There were 793 properties that were in the proved category. They operated about 243 of those. We'll own an average working interest in all those wells of about 14.5% working. That is where that 35 million a day level that we've quoted in our call comes from. That production mix is about 64% gas, 28% NGLs and about 8% oil. About half those properties are in the Woodford. In the Cana area, they comprise probably 90% of the value, and our working interest in those properties is at the 9.5% level. The remainder of the properties are older vertical wells that obviously don't carry as much value as the Woodford section, and make up the balance of the deal. So hopefully, that helps kind of give you a high-level snapshot of what you're looking for.", "Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just lastly, any evolution in terms of your view on the stacked concept? I think you alluded to a well that I think you had flowing back. Just curious if your view has changed at all from last quarter. I know obviously early there as well.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Well, we're currently flowing our first Merrimack well back. And we don't have 30 days production, so we'll defer that to our next call. But we definitely recognize the potential. We follow the play carefully. As I've mentioned before, we've taken our own core. We're in the process of analyzing it. And so I would anticipate that we'll have other drilling to do, and probably 1 or 2 wells to discuss on our next call.", "Operator", "Our next question is John Nelson, Citigroup.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to build on Drew's question in a little more detailed fashion, if I could, thinking back to our discussions on why 2013 production was able to beat -- I think you guys attribute it to haircutting -- the new Wolfcamp completion design as you sort of factored that into guidance. I guess is there any reason to believe that you wouldn't be following a similar practice with the new Cana completion design, or have you maybe learned a bit from 2013 and we're more in the gray area? If you could provide any color there.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe, again. I -- we don't set off and say, \"Hey, here's this forecast. Let's haircut it.\" If we don't have a lot of wells under our belt, and we're really not certain if it's just a geographical thing or something's working versus something else, we may look at it unrisked and risked and risk certain areas other than others. So it's a very dynamic thing that I would hope that quarter-to-quarter, and I think we've demonstrated in the past, we're pretty darn tight on our guidance. And in this quarter, it was, in my mind, an exception for just a couple of extraordinary reasons. We didn't know what was going to happen in Cana. And so now that we've got a little bit of this under our belt, we're going to incorporate that into our future guidance as if it -- we think it's going to happen. And so I really just want to underscore that. We don't start off and say, \"Hey, let's just kind of really watch this thing and not put the right numbers out there.\" We got a budget and cash flow model and everything else here, too. We want to be as accurate as we can.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But -- yes, I'll follow that. Joe is absolutely right. To the extent that we have meaningful data in these upsized completions, we only have a long flowback period over a fairly restricted area of the core. Now we do have a couple of outlying experiments that we're watching and we're encouraged, but we don't have the calibration that we do in the core. That's the thickest, highest gas-in-place part of the field. So we have modeled an uplift over the entire area. But until we get some calibration, we've left ourselves some room, as we need to. So we don't think we're being overly conservative in anything we're forecasting.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's really good color, and I can appreciate, I guess, not conservatism, but not being aggressive, I guess is the way I'll put it. And then if you could just remind me what -- timing-wise with regards to Cana completions throughout the rest of the year. I think the presentation notes 2 rigs, but can we just -- should it be pretty steady, the flow of completions over the course of the year?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. This is John. We are currently actually completing our next operating section, as we speak. We have 2 sections to complete. But I would also point out that the other company in Cana has quite a bit of completions ongoing through the rest of the year that we have a pretty good interest in as well. So I would say a good rest of the year.", "Mark Burford", "John, this is Mark. Actually, we had 14 net completions in Cana, roughly, in the first quarter. Second quarter, we should have about 11 net completions, so fairly similar rate. Similar into the third quarter, with about 14 net completions. But it really tapers in the fourth quarter.", "John A. Lambuth", "In the fourth quarter, yes. The fourth quarter is where it tapers off. And that's where -- again, we have to get this closing done, but that's where we look at -- once we start ramping up, where do we do that. Although more than likely, no matter what we do, we really won't get those wells online until probably sometime first, second quarter '15. So there will be a slowdown some in the fourth quarter, but of course, we've incorporated that in our guidance.", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. From a high-level standpoint, all these -- how all this is playing out underneath the hood, you're -- what we're seeing is fairly consistent quarter to corner -- quarter-to-quarter -- I can't say that word apparently -- Cana completion count through Q3. It tapers off in Q4 right about the same time we're starting to see the acceleration in the Permian. So where the Permian is accelerating, Cana is kind of rolling off, and the bottom line is what it is.", "John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's really, really helpful. And then just one last one, if I could sneak it in. It looks like you widened sort of the Wolfcamp map, specifically that acreage, and sort of Central to South Central Reeves. Are you chasing similar targets to what you have and sort of more north of that acreage, or just stay tuned or any color around that?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. This is John Lambuth. And that is the area that we went out and pursued and was able to acquire that additional acreage. And...", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Southern Reeves.", "John A. Lambuth", "Southern Reeves, as you highlighted. And that is an area that we'll be targeting our first well in later this quarter, early next quarter. But we see it as being very similar to the same section we're drilling in Northern Reeves, in terms of Wolfcamp A, as well as B/C, as potential targets down there.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "And if you were to go back historically, you'd see some of our early trend maps included a lot of Lea County acreage. We skinnied it up, just because we weren't sure what it would do up there. There was 1 or 2 industry wells there in the southwest corner of Lea County that were very, very nice Wolfcamp wells, and fully made us realize that, that acreage we have in the southwest corner of Lea County is absolutely going to be Wolfcamp prospective.", "Operator", "Our next question is Michael Hall, Heikkinen Energy Advisors.", "Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC", "Quite a bit have been answered. I guess couple left of mine would be -- just curious, to what extent is Devon also employing these sorts of upsized fracs and how much are you guys sharing, I guess, information on technology and whatnot?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. This is John Lambuth. Devon is applying the similar-type frac design as we are doing as well. They have interest in our wells. We have interest in their wells. So we clearly learn from each other. So they have quite a few sections now under their belt with a similar frac style and, again, quite a bit of experimentation within there, too. We're still trying to hone in on what works best. Early data on that is encouraging so far, but it's very early. But they are, themselves, also trying to apply the same frac style.", "Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC", "Okay. And I'm assuming -- it sounds like you guys are thinking about some acceleration. Have you been in contact with Devon around that as well for the new properties or what's the -- any commentary there?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "It's too early to really get too granular on that. We're just kind of talking about it at this point.", "John A. Lambuth", "Got to close.", "Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC", "That's fair. Okay. And I just want to make sure I heard you right in terms of the ramp in Permian oil production, the prepared remarks there. In the fourth quarter, was that to over 40,000 barrels as a net number in the fourth quarter on average?", "John A. Lambuth", "That's correct. That's a net number for our Q4 average that we hope to exceed that number.", "Operator", "Our next question is Jeb Bachmann, Howard Weil.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just had a question on these upsized fracs and looking at recovery factor. Is -- are you expecting these upsized fracs to essentially accelerate the recovery of the reserves, or do you also think you're going to get an increase in that recovery factor as well?", "John A. Lambuth", "Well, I'll take a stab at it first. I'm sure Tom will want to as well. It looks as though we are, I would say, getting a higher recovery factor for the same gas-in-place section, that's what's occurring. So I would not call it acceleration as much as we're more effectively connecting to the rock and draining that resource. That's what we think is happening.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But to the extent we're getting higher recovery and higher rate, getting -- we're getting more gas out faster, so.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, yes. It's coming out faster. But we are not -- I would say, in terms of acceleration, we're not really competing with other wells. We are effectively just getting better connected to that total resource that's there in place. That's what we feel is happening.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "And going forward, do you guys get a sense of when you're going to be able to come out and talk about maybe increased EURs associated with this new design, or how long -- how much longer -- or how much history, I guess, do you need to establish before that?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes, I don't know. It's just too early right now for us to think about when we might publish some type of EUR on that. I mean, again, what we showed you today was an early idea of the flowback data, what it looks like. You can judge for yourself the type of wells we're making there, based on that graph.", "Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And last one for me. Do you guys have a resource-in-place estimate for Reeves County, for the Wolfcamp in Reeves at this point, or it's still too early for that?", "John A. Lambuth", "This is John. We internally have a resource-in-place map, but I'm not really going to talk about it. Reeves County is a very competitive area. We're still actively trying to lease. So that's not something that I really want to talk publicly about.", "Operator", "Our next question is Nicholas Pope, Cowen and Company.", "Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to get a little bit of granularity on the Cana wells and the upsized fracs. I want to -- I did want to clarify that -- are -- what you all -- the data that's shown, is that just a upsized frac with the same lateral length as what you all previously had been doing in the region?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. This is John. It is the exact same equivalent of a 5,000-foot lateral. And what you're seeing within that graph is an average of the well results from that section.", "Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And do you all have just a rule of thumb? It looks like a 2-stream volume that you provided. As you all report on 3 stream, do you know what the uplift is in the Cana from the wet gas to a 3-stream profile, just volumetrically?", "Mark Burford", "Yes, Nick. It's approximately 20% uplift going from 2 to 3 stream.", "Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And how many wells were included in that, in the new infills?", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. That was an average of 8 wells.", "Joseph R. Albi", "On the graph.", "John A. Lambuth", "On the graph.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We have completed a whole series of wells.", "John A. Lambuth", "Yes. But for that particular graph, that's 8 wells.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Burford for any closing remarks.", "Mark Burford", "Thank you, everyone, for joining. We appreciate the -- taking time to stay with us and going over our results. And then we look forward reporting to you in the future quarters.", "Thank you very much.

During this call, you'll hear details of our accomplishments, our challenges, and our prospective as we look ahead into 2015 and 2016. We had some great well results to report. Our operations group achieved outstanding production growth in-spite of some severe weather events and unplanned downtime. We executed on some well time strategic asset purchases and sales.", "We finished the year strong and entered 2015 with over $400 million cash on hand. In these difficult times, Cimarex stands out with quality assets, the strong balance sheet and an organization that is eager and ready to face today's new challenges. What a difference a quarter makes.", "During October, we met with a number of our current perspective owners in the midst to the drop in oil prices from the mid $90 per barrel to the mid $70 per barrel. At that time, we said that Cimarex would view the changing situations through a lens that focused on three key questions. Does our portfolio contained investments are look attractive at current commodity prices and service costs? Do we have the balance sheet and cash flow to fund these opportunities? And once the overall market psychology and how should that impact our capital discipline? In other words, will the industry slow dramatically and drive service costs further down?", "Since that time in October, the situation has deteriorated further, but the conversation still about asset quality, balance sheet held and capital discipline. First and foremost, Cimarex has great assets. Our Delaware Basin assets are providing excellent investment returns in the current environment. Innovation and optimization continue to produce improved well results. Our Anadarko Basin assets are top tiered. The Woodford Shale is delivering solid returns. We've continued to de-risk our Meramec position they are gaining increasing confidence to say that it provides some of the very best returns in our portfolio. We have a great acreage position in the economic sweet spot of the play. John will provide additional details on this.", "Secondly, our balance sheet remained strong and we planned on keeping it that way. We do not know how deep or sustained this down cycle will be, preserving a health of the company and our financial flexibility is paramount. Finally, we're committed to being highly disciplined in this volatile environment. We may not have seen the bottom of this correction yet. We do expect to see further service cost reductions. Our go forward approach will be characterized by a mix of long-term and short-term thinking.", "We're going to take a long-term approach with our assets and organization. With few exceptions, our 6-rig program can hold our acreage in 2015 without difficulty. We'll let a little acreage go, but it will all be second-tier acreage in which we've had marginal results. Our organization is focused and fully deployed on adding value and capturing opportunity in this environment, and I'll speak more on that in a moment.", "We'll take a very short-term approach to our balance sheet and capital investments. Our goal in 2015 is to live within cash flow and cash on hand. We view debt as a long-term commitment, and we are highly reluctant to incur additional debt, until we see commodity prices and service cost stabilize.", "Although, we're guiding 2015 CapEx in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range. We aren't really thinking about this as an annual budget. The $900 million to $1.1 billion estimate is a snapshot in time. We remain poised and ready to increase activity on the moment's notice. Our decision to contract the six rigs as the prudent course of action, until we see signs of stability that can have the confidence in the robustness of our investment returns.", "At our current pace of activity, will go production 3% to 8% year-over-year. Furthermore, we've projected Q4 2015 exit rate, which is essentially flat or down only slightly from our Q4 2014 exit rate. We can manage this downturn without sacrificing future growth.", "Finally, I want to comment on the opportunities with this down-cycle will present. There will be acquisition opportunities. We've already been presented with a number of them, but the bar is high. Any corporate or asset transaction will need to be value accretive from the Cimarex shareholder or we're not interested purely. Our balance sheet gives us great flexibility, and we're under no pressure to do anything other than play it smart. Make sense deals are rear, but will be ready.", "Cimarex has a staff that is focused, dedicated and hungry to continue to innovate and optimize. We are not shipwreck victims waiting for rescue. The mandate throughout organization is to figure out how to make a living and drive in today's environment. We're not ideally waiting for commodity prices to bounce back to the pre-correction levels. None of us can know where commodity prices will stabilize, but we are proceeding on the assumption that the days of $90-oil are long gone.", "In this new era, the efficient low-cost resource producer will be the one that survives and prosperous. Cimarex is dedicated to emerge from this current environment as a better, more productive company. We're using this downtime to refocus and retool our organization, we'll be measured by what we've always been measured by results and we face this challenge without looking back.", "In the end, there is no substitute for great assets, a great balance sheet and an outstanding organization. During 2014, we continued to demonstrate that Cimarex has some of the best assets and the organizational capability in the business.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John and Joe, who will describe the progress we made in delineating and developing our outstanding portfolio.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly recap our activity in the fourth quarter and for the year before getting into some of the specifics about our new drilling results. Cimarex drilled and completed 87 gross, 53 net wells during the quarter, investing $457 million. 78% was invested in the Permian region and the rest went toward activities in the Cana region including the drilling of both Meramec and Woodford wells.", "Our Permian operations are in Delaware Basin, where we grew up 39 net wells during the fourth quarter. Our activities in this area were focused on drilling and completing Wolfcamp long laterals; second Bone Spring wells in our White City area; and Avalon wells. We've had exceptional results drilling second Bone Spring wells in our White City area in Eddy County, New Mexico.", "I'll refer you to slide 10 of our presentation which illustrates the uplift we've seen in production using a larger completion. We've gone from nine to 15 stages in order to achieve these results. Similar to the second Bone Spring wells in Culberson County. These wells have a higher gas components than our traditional Bone Spring wells, which increases productivity and improves overall economics. As of today, we have identified approximately 90 second Bone Spring locations on our White City acreage with the vast majority of those being located on acreage, which is currently held by production.", "In our press release, we've mentioned results from six new Culberson County, Wolfcamp long laterals. Five of those were Wolfcamp D wells, which had averaged 30-day peak IPs about 2,236 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And while we are very pleased with these results, we continue to work on optimizing our frac design to both maximize IP rates, while also paying close attention to cost. Currently, we have five long laterals flowing back with varying frac designs including some with pure equivalent stages. These wells have been completed are in the early stages of flow back thus no conclusions can be reached yet for these wells.", "We've adjusted our Wolfcamp acreage position slightly since our last update, but still have a total exposure of 235,000 potential net acres. In 2015, our Wolfcamp capital will be focused on drilling additional long lateral wells in Culberson County, as well as meeting our leasehold obligations in Reeves County, which will be fulfilled by drilling eight wells in 2015 at a cost of $70 million.", "Lastly, in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of our fourth pilot drilled in 2014, which is the Stacked/Staggered Wolfcamp eight pilot in Reeves County. This pilot was designed to test both down-spacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the thick Wolfcamp A section. After delays caused by the September flooding, these wells began producing in early December and have been online for about 75 days.", "However, due to intermittent downstream processing issues during December, a good number of our Reeves County wells, including this pilot were hampered with sporadic production down times thus making a 30 day IP meaningless for the purpose of this call.", "With the addition of a new processing outlet in the area, we anticipate having smoother production information as we get further into the quarter and thus enable us to better determine the true potential of this facing pilot.", "Now on to the Mid-Continent region. We drilled 57 net wells in Mid-Continent region in 2014 with 42 of those wells being Woodford wells. We also drilled seven Meramac lineation tests, all of which are now producing. We now have enough production data on six of the seven Meramac wells to provide you with a peak 30 day average IP rate of 10.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day.", "As was mentioned in the press release, these wells have a wide range of oil deal. In fact I need to issue a correction to the release and that the oil percentage range for these wells is actually 7% to 55% instead of the 20% to 55% that was stated in the release.", "As illustrated on slide 18 of our presentation, you can see that wells on the up-dip side of the line have a much higher percentage of oil averaging 49% versus down-dip wells which average 16%. We are very encouraged with these wells results, especially when you take in account that all of these delineation wells were just 5,000 foot laterals.", "Our 2015 plans are to continue to delineate our acreage position with 5,000 foot laterals, while we also embark on drilling a number of 10,000 foot laterals in the Meramec. If we achieve similar uplift and going from 5,000 foot to 10,000 foot, I've seen in other plays, then these wells will generate some of the highest rate of returns within our portfolio drilling opportunities.", "Current plans are to invest $70 million in the Meramec drilling in 2015. Regarding our acreage position, Cimarex has approximately 115,000 acres that are prospective for the Meramec, 70,000 acres of which have been de-risked by our and competitor drilling activity.", "And then finally, in November, we commenced a seven-section infill development program in the Cana-Woodford shale. Originally planned to be 10 sections, commodity prices caused this year's development to be downsize. We will operate two of these sections. Drilling capital allocated for the Woodford infill program in 2015 is approximately $180 million for both operated and non-operated wells.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Thank you, John. And thank you, all of you for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our first quarter and full year 2015 production outlook and guidance and then I'll follow up with a few comments on (13:55) really drove the increase there with Q4 Permian oil volume of 38,246 barrels a day, being at the 11.5% or 3,947 barrels a day over Q3.", "Over last year, we've seen exceptional production growth overall in the Permian, not just in Q4. Our Q4 2014 equivalent volume was up 34% or 114 million a day from a year ago and our Q4 2014 Permian oil volume was up 29% or 85,095 barrels a day over the same time period last year. On an annual basis, our average 2014 Permian equivalent production came in at 399 million a day, that's up 79 million a day or 25% over our 2013 average of 320 million a day.", "As we anticipated, with fewer net Mid-Continent completions coming online in the latter half of 2014, we saw our Mid-Continent net equivalent volume drop slightly from Q3 to Q4. We completed 35 net wells during Q1 and Q2 of last year in the Mid-Continent, as compared to the 9 that we completed during Q3 and 14 that we completed in Q4. And as a result, our Q4 Mid-Continent equivalent production averaged 488 million a day, down slightly from the 518 million a day that we posted in Q3.", "That said, we posted nice production gains overall in the Mid-Continent during 2014. Our Q4 2014 Mid-Continent exit rate of 488 million a day was up 42%, or 144 million a day from Q4 2013. And our full year 2014 Mid-Continent average of 451 million a day was up 30% or 105 million a day over our 2013 average of 346 million a day.", "So overall, at the company level, it was a great year for us from a production standpoint. We set record marks in all production categories, whether it'd be oil, gas, NGLs or equivalent volumes, at the company level, as well as at both the Permian and the Mid-Continent regions, we're pretty proud of that.", "With the contributions from the Permian and the Mid-Continent, our full year 2014 total company net equivalent production average of 869 million a day was up a 176 million a day or 25% over our 2013 reported average of 693 million a day. When you throw in the 2014 property sales that we had, on a year-over-year, apples-to-apples basis our production growth was 27%.", "As we look forward into 2015, our 2015 total company average equivalent volume guidance of 895 million a day to 935 million a day is modeled using the low-end of our 2015 productions or capital projection, and results in the 3% to 8% projected growth over 2014.", "The carryover the current geographic focus of our drilling program into 2015, coupled with our reduction in shipping of rigs as we move further into the year, results in our 2015 production growth coming from the Permian early in the year and the Mid-Continent later in the year.", "With our current 2015 rig and completion schedules, we're focusing approximately 50 net wells to be completed in the Permian during 2015, with 35 to 40 of those wells projected to come online during the first half of the year.", "With that, our current modeling calls for Permian production to continue to grow in 2015 with projected Permian equivalent volumes up 13% to 19% over our 2014 levels.", "In contrast, we're targeting 30 net wells to 35 net wells to be completed in the Mid-Continent during the year, but five to six of those wells coming on production in the first half of the year and 25 to 30 coming on in the second half. That coincides with our Cana-Woodford development. With the back-end loading of completion activity, our Mid-Continent production is expected to drop somewhat through mid Q3, and then increase significantly during Q4, and really reaching a peak with the full development of row 4 in December of 2015.", "The bottom line at the Mid-Continent level \u2013 is that the Mid-Continent will see relatively flat year-over-year production as compared to 2015 \u2013 2014. As we start-off into the year, we've issued our Q1, 2015 guidance of 920 million to 940 million a day, which incorporates a negative impact of 25 million to 30 million a day for early Permian downtime, associated with weather in January and some pipeline facility maintenance that we're doing in Culberson and Reeves County here in February.", "With our current drilling schedule, our projected fourth quarter 2015 exit rate is forecasted to be as Tom mentioned flat to down slightly, compared to our fourth quarter 2014 exit rate. But again this forecast is based on the low end of our capital spending projection, and as Tom emphasized just a minute ago, we have a lot of flexibility in that regard, as we watch the market conditions react accordingly. Any changes in our capital spending will obviously affect our current production forecast.", "Jumping over to OpEx, with the continued focused on our LOE, our Q4 lifting cost came in at a $1.05 per Mcfe, puts us in our full year average of $1.08 per Mcfe, right at the bottom end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.12 and down $0.05 from our 2013 average of $1.13. Our production group is keeping their focus on reducing cost in all areas and we're seeing signs of modest cost relate here in Q1 for items such as saltwater disposal, rentals, chemicals, contract labor and well servicing.", "The purpose of the guidance will project in our 2015 lifting cost to come in at a $1.07 to $1.17 which takes into account the front-end loading of our projected higher lifting cost Permian new production in the first half of the year.", "Our service costs are concerned with the precipitous drop in industry activity, we've seen significant drops in service cost since just the beginning of the year. First, we saw on the drilling side, and more recently on the completion side. Geographically, the reduction seem to come quicker in the Mid-Continent then in the Permian. Most likely result of the backlog of industry Permian activity during Q3 and Q4, especially on the completion side. That said, current costs are now down in both areas.", "On the drilling side, we've seen anywhere from 5% to 15% reductions in day rates and 10% to 20% plus reductions in virtually all other cost components the mud, rentals, bits, directional tools just to name a few. And just recently we've seen drops on the completion side. The significant decreases in all of the major frac cost components whether it'd be sand, transportation, chemicals or service.", "As a result, at the total company level, our current average per well frac costs are down about 20% from late Q4 levels, all the while we're pumping on the average 10% more fluid and 40% more sand.", "The bottom line is that depending on the program, our total well costs currently are down 13% to 20% from where they were just two months ago. Our current Cana Core Woodford AFE is in the range of $6.8 million to $7.2 million, that's down approximately 14% from the $7.9 million to $8.4 million that we quoted last call.", "In the Meramec, with just a half dozen wells under our belt, the current single mile lateral AFEs are running in the $7.2 million to $7.6 million neighborhood, that's down 13% more they were in late Q4.", "In the Permian, our focus in 2015 will be the Wolfcamp, primarily in Culberson, primarily during long laterals. The cost reductions we've seen today uphold our projected two-mile lateral in Culberson, down 15% to 20% to levels of $11.3 million to $12.3 million. With our Reeves County two-mile Wolfcamp laterals running slightly higher at $12.1 million to $13.1 million, primarily a result of the need to add for us to run additional string of pipe in certain portions of the Reeves County area.", "In closing, we had a great 2014, with strong contributions from both our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. We set new records for the company in all production categories. Both our proved reserves and our net production were up 25% over 2013 with the strong fourth quarter and carryover of our 2014 activity were set up for production growth again here in 2015, despite falling in the range on our capital program, while we preserve our balance sheet.", "And with some nice decreases already under our belt, we continue to focus on reducing LOE and total well cost, so as to be that, low cost resource producer to be able to capitalize on whatever the market throws at us here in 2015. We want to commend the organization for the great year that they had in 2014 and for the great job they've done early on in the year retrenching us to make the best and a very successful year for us in 2015.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Drew.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just wanted to get some color on how are you thinking about capital allocation between Cana and the Meramec, the return is obviously for both programs look great on current prices, but Meramec looks a bit higher. Are there infrastructure needs that prevent you from flipping that to be selling more in Meramec or is it just too early to have a great sensitive production profile there?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah Drew, this is John Lambuth. I'm not aware of any infrastructure issue whether on drilling Meramec or Cana. They have fairly similar production flow stream. So, that's not a hindrance to us in terms of our decisions there.", "It really comes down to in the case of Cana or the Woodford shale, there we're pretty much in development mode. And so, there it's kind of that dance we do with our partner Devon and ensuring that we're working together and we've already laid out a plan in terms of what will be developing this year and that's the amount of capital we talked about.", "As far as Meramec, really it's still all about delineation for us, further expanding the opportunity set here as far as what acreage is perspective. And then as I stated, there's also the need to get after and get a few 10,000 foot laterals under our belt, get some production history under those to get more confident as to what kind of returns those will generate. So that's kind of the balance we're striking right now for this year as we go forward.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Jerry, this is Tom. I would add to that. A lot of that's baked in. We started this development project in the Woodford last fall. We're pleased to have and the returns are excellent. To the extent that we have additional capital, and it's competing, Meramec is going to be top tier and probably we'll be getting additional capital if indeed we accelerate.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's very helpful color. Then I was just curious, if you've seen longer production history on these upsides Cana completions. Can you talk about the decline rates in the production profile on the new completion versus the old style. Is that just a one-to-one shift up in a curve. Does that come off, that improvement come off somewhat as you get further out in the production profile?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, this is John Lambuth again. I mean so far we're very pleased with what we're seeing with those upside fracs, and what we're seeing at the production of those wells. We're not falling off, let's say faster than what the \u2013 say the old style frac was doing. And I guess I'll reference you to slide 21 which actually shows some relative data as far as flow back time to both the Golden and the Hartz wells.", "Let me also say that we are still not fully optimized within the Woodford when it comes to our frac design, we are currently fracking wells right now where we're testing even more stages and more sand, I will tell you that embedded within that Hartz section which what we're showing you there is an average result of Hartz, we have a number of wells, two of them in particular where we did go to even more stages and those wells definitely exhibited better production rates.", "So we're pretty confident that we're actually going to be able to get even more out of this rock based on those results, and again we have some wells right now we're fracking, that we think will lead us to the ultimate design that we'll use as we go forward on well four and its development.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.", "Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah, good morning.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Good morning.", "Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "You mentioned the 3% to 8% growth was based on the low end of the budget or $900 million. So, do you anticipate spending at the low end of the range based on this six operated rig program and the range assumes the potential of second half increase? And then, could you give us a sensitivity in terms of growth rate year-over-year, it is a higher CapEx meaning we were to spend at the midpoint this could add an extra 200 basis points or 300 basis points to grow or is this just help your exit rate in 2015?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, this is Tom. I'll \u2013 I'm going to take that in the back going forward. Yeah, we have modeled that. I just want to remind our listeners that it's only been within the last 10 days or 2 weeks that we've seen oil prices inch up slightly and we were in an environment where prices were self-falling so fast and it was very difficult to have any capital model that allows you to make intelligence statements about what your balance sheet would be at the end of the year.", "So we made a decision to go to six rigs and we stand behind that decision, even in today's environment we think what is that exactly, where we are to be. So we modeled our production at that low end of our capital. But as I said in my opening remarks, we don't think about this as an annual plan. It is a snapshot in time that's appropriate for today and in fact, we may make a decision to accelerate a rig or two here next week, if we really are confident that the situation is stabilized.", "Our capital model for 2015 as we'd currently plan under current conditions, involves us having cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year, and we don't see the need to have cash on our balance sheet. So we do have the wherewithal to increased activity.", "Now, guilty as charged that we have not come out with a production model that captures any increased activity. Our production model we released this morning is at that lower level of activity, where I want to just ask for your indulgence in reminding you that was made in a following commodity price environment. So, we'll see as we go, we're poised to accelerate.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Yeah. This is Joe. Couple of the points I'd like to make with regard to that too, there is so many other factors that play here. Drilling and completion costs, do they reduce further or are they flat? How that affect our activity and our production? The timing of that CapEx. If we were to increase our capital expenditures as of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, is it applied to road drilling in Cana where we drill wells first get them all drilled and then come back and complete them later or is it single wells in the Permian. All these factors really tell us that if we were to accelerate our capital spending this year chances are, it's not going to have an immediate impact on the middle of the year projection and would most likely show itself up in the latter part of the year.", "Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And to that point, what's your ability to accelerate or increase net activity in the Chevron, JVA and if you were to add back rigs with which place do you think would see the first incremental dollar allocated to them?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. We have plenty of locations in the building to bring rigs back into Culberson, with Chevron. We're in constant communication with them, and they see as we see some of the great way to returns we see there. So, we are tied up to do just that indeed, that's one area as we talked about where we see very good returns. But likewise, just north of there in the White City, our Bone Spring wells are generating some outstanding returns as well. And we have a very nice inventory wells permitted, ready to go there as well. And then as someone else mentioned, we have lots of Meramec locations that we can nearly get after as well.", "So, this is not a question of the opportunity set, we are ready to go, we're just waiting for the right conditions to tell us it is time to go.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. This is Tom. It's a lot easier to start than stop. The decision to lay down rigs can take 60 days to 90 days depending on the rig and what project it's on. Decision to add a rig can be executed in the matter of couple of weeks. So, we're poised and ready.", "Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And then last question. During the 2009 downturn if memory serves me right, you guys used that as an opportunity to focus on efficiencies and really kicked off the Bone Spring play into Mexico as a horizontal play. Just wondering if there is any less obvious efficiency improvements that are worth highlighting that you're focused on this cycle as you look to do more with less capital?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yes. This is Tom. We are absolutely looking at becoming better executors at resource play development. We have huge resource plays in our inventory and those involve very complex project management challenges. It involves not only drilling the wells, it involves infrastructure, it involves water sourcing, water disposal, it involves electrification, it involves air quality, it involves a host of things that in order to be a low cost operator, demand is strategic focus.", "And in the high growth high level of activity, in some sense, we've been in reactive mode more than the kind of strategic planning mode, there that will take to become that low-cost operator in a lower margin business. And we are absolutely focusing our organization on this challenge. So our organization is highly engaged and we're building plans for when we come back with a roar. And I appreciate your \u2013 reminding us and reminding the listeners of the downturn in 2008, 2009. I think if you look at that periods in Cimarex history, it was some of our finest efforts and we came out of that correction a far far better company than we came into it and we are fully dedicated to do that again.", "Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International", "Good morning, guys. Couple of things, one on the upside, just looking at some of the well results in the Permian for the quarter. It looked like some of the IPs maybe a little bit short of what you'd recognized through third quarter, but the oil cuts were outstanding, is there anything specific that was being done in each of those plays to change that, or is it just the matter of geography, maybe you could walk through that a little bit?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. I think in particular, you're making reference to our Culberson long laterals entity (34:47). And you hit it right on the head, one of the biggest factors there is geography. We're obviously delineating more and more of our acreage with those wells. And in some areas, it's very good, in some areas, it's not. And so that's one driver to that. And then the other is, we always are tinkering with our frac design. And some of the newer wells, we've been really pumping a lot of fluid. And quite frankly, and flowing back those wells that will in some ways have an impact on the overall IP 30 rate. We don't think it's really material to the EUR of the well, but it does have some potential impact on the flow back on that well. But mostly, it's geographic diversity as we continue to explore across our large acreage position there.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International", "Great. And then maybe on the strategy side of things, Tom you kind of mentioned that it's obviously the flexibility is the keyword, taking it down to six as we've \u2013 if we call a bottom here on crude in the low $50s, looking at the slide that you have provided.", "The (35:53) are still pretty impressive in multiple areas. And when you think about ramping capital up from the low-end, do you need to see improvement in the oil price to make that happen or do you just need to have \u2013 I guess from a company standpoint, some reasonable certainty or some reasonable comfort with the current levels because even at current levels it seems like your returns are more than acceptable?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Brian, you hit the nail on the head there. We have great assets, and there's lot of things I am grateful for. There is no substitute for asset quality, and we have great assets. Assets that in today's climate with current costs and current service costs generate very-very nice returns. So, that's not a barrier, just picking up activity. It's we want them to just become convinced that we can see a stable future. There is still some speculation out there that we haven't seen the bottom in the oil markets.", "And the last thing we want to do is get out there and accelerate and then see oil slide into the $30s. Now, maybe that's not going to happen, maybe we've seen the bottom, and if you're willing to call it on this call Brian, I think that'd be great.", "We're just going to watch this a little while. And I want to be clear here, we're not committing to what a little while means. We may go next week and say, it's time to add a rig or two, but we want to be very forthcoming with you today as to how we see it and our most prudent course of action is to say you know what, we're just going to watch this until it clarifies. So no, we have great assets and we think our assets can generate acceptable returns in today's commodity pricing.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International", "Great. And then one quick last one on the Meramec, you mentioned either the plans or the future possibilities of drilling 10,000 foot laterals, are we drilling a 10,000 foot Meramec in 2015, should we expect that before year-end or is that a 2016 event?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. We definitely are drilling in 2015. In fact, we have one come up here real soon on the schedule. We right now have three scheduled and really in drilling those, we're trying to place them close to \u2013 we have an established 5,000 foot lateral that way we can measure the uplift and get a good sense of is that a good investment decision for us. So, we have quite a few planned for 2015 and as we get that data and get the production data in hand we'll give you an update on it.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International", "And John, do you want to throw an approximate AFP on that 10,000 foot?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "This is Joe. I'd probably run it somewhere in the $11 million to $12 million range.", "Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International", "Great, Joe. It's very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.", "Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Hi, Tom, I know, we're just trying to figure out what you guys are going to do next week or next month. But can you just help us think about 2016 in terms of \u2013 I know you're not going to give your budget, you don't have one but just give us kind of the guidelines and the parameters given that as of right now you're going to be running six rigs, would you expect to see production decline in 2016, given the status quo? You mentioned you expect to have cash on hand, would you expect to have cash on hand at the end of 2015 close to the level at the end of 2014? And anything in particular to consider about 2016 from an operations perspective?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me take the last question first. No, we're going to \u2013 the cash on hand issue \u2013 we currently model somewhat less than $100 million cash on hand at the end of this year. And as I said, we don't see any virtue in keeping cash on our balance sheet. So, I would not anticipate that we have cash on hand at the end of 2015 that would be comparable to 2014.", "Now as we look into 2016, we are looking at plans for when will be the appropriate time to accelerate and after that balance sheet is formed, and we've said that for years and we mean it. So we're willing to tap that balance sheet as long as our investment returns are excellent, and as we've always said they can stand that downside test.", "So, you know Joe, the issue is accelerating in 2016, is what's the downside test? In October, when oil was $75, we pulled our group together, and said, look, let's run a new flat case on oil of $50. And at the time, we thought, well, that's just ridiculous, and we blew right through the bottom of that.", "So, before we would make a decision to accelerate, we would want to have confidence in knowing what our downside case was because we wouldn't want to borrow and wake up and find that our credit statistics are well outside the balance of what we're comfortable with. So, we have not abrogated growth in 2016 under any way, shape or form. We think we have the assets demanded and the balance sheet that supports it. But as you started out your question, we are taking this in kind of day-by-day right now.", "Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Okay. It sounds \u2013 that's helpful. And then a different question maybe it's for Joe or for John. You guys talked about 4Q, 2014 to 4Q, 2015 flat-to-down slightly. Could you just give us a break out by product, oil \u2013 how do you see oil over the same timeframe and that gas and NGLs?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Mark, you want to add.", "G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning", "Yeah Joe. Yeah I'll take that. This is Mark Burford. We look at our production mix and the combination or components or commodities, Joe. We see it fairly stable oil, gas, NGL mix. In the fourth quarter, we averaged 49% gas, 27% oil and 23% NGLs and look out into 2015 it might be a percent of variability in oil, as Joe mentioned the front-end loaded nature of the Permian and then the second nature of the Beacon (42:24) into the fourth quarter for our average 2015, oil breakdown is still about 48% gas and oil 29% and 22% NGL. So very similar mixture of oil, gas, NGLs going into 2015 with some variability quarter-to-quarter depending on the ramping of the Permian in the first half of the year and ramping in the second half of Mid-Continent.", "Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I think it's helpful. I'll work with that and contact to you guys offline, but just one final question with the new completion designs, are you increasingly confident that not only are you increasing production, but you are actually increasing reserves per well?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. I think we are gaining confidence with every months of more production day that we have from those wells yes, so they clearly are getting \u2013 they're giving book at a higher EUR. And so now, we don't think this is in anyway just acceleration. I would also point out though that, we are really-really focused way to return. And so way to return in some ways is really driven by those first three months of production and clearly these wells are generating much higher production rates than what the over spot fracs were doing.", "Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "All right. All very helpful. Thank you guys.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "This is Joe Albi. I wanted to clarify some to the previous question on the two-mile Meramec. Our current AFEs are probably closer to range of $10 million to $11million rather than $11 million to $12 million.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH [Tudor, Pickering, Holt]", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, all.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Just one quick clarification on the cash comment. You mentioned that you could be down to $100 million in cash by the end of 2015 and I was just curious, under that scenario and kind of the $900 million capital program, what commodity deck would you be assuming to kind of generate that sort of cash draw down?", "G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning", "Yeah, hi Matt. This is Mark. Yeah. We have run (44:33) primarily measure when we look at our cash flow projections in that one that we're looking at more recently was Friday the 13 strip price that we most recently ran into that, that's about $56 oil, about $3 gas \u2013 and into that strip environment, and strip price, that price environment we were looking at just a little south of $100 million in cash exceeding the year at the $900 million capital plan.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, perfect. And then I guess just a follow-up question in regards to the activity levels. I believe the majority of the rigs here are under contract right now or are currently running in the Cana. As you guys wrap up your operated drilling program in the first half of the year, how should we think about kind of rig allocation between the Cana and the Permian into the back half of 2015?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John Lambuth. Essentially, by the time we hit June \u2013 May, June, we will be at the six rigs. Three of them will be operating in Mid-Continent and three of them will be in the Permian region.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. And then, my final question just is in regards to your 2015 plans in the Wolfcamp in Culberson County. You guys highlighted you're focusing in the Wolfcamp A and D, and I assume the D is because of the strong well results you've seen so far and the ability to hold the depths in the A, given the higher oil cut, could you talk a little bit about the Wolfcamp C wells, you've seen to-date and how does that compares on a rate of return basis or how that fits into your program in the medium term?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John again. Well, clearly right now, both the D bench and the area are generating the best returns for us in that particular acreage block in Culberson. Our C results are not as strong, as they are in the D and the A. We still need to do some work on the C to try to get it to a level that it would justify further expenditure for us. Now, again, you made a good point there. By drilling our D wells, we don't sacrifice those opportunities in the future. And indeed as we keep working at it, we see may at some point raise its level from a rate of return standpoint that we'll want to go and capture it. But right now, today, based on our results, it's the D and the A that clearly shine best in that region.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I might add to that, this is Tom. Well, we're going to full resource development. There is a pretty good chance, we're going to exploit all three of those benches and not leave those reserves stranded. So we've a lot of work to do and plan for that. We're not for \u2013 if it's a-la-carte the A and D are certainly sharing the day for this \u2013 it's full payable service. We're going to probably develop that C simultaneously.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. My first question is on Meramec. You showed a variation in oil cut across up dip and down dip and not to know \u2013 knowing you guys don't throw out a curve without adequate confidence in the play. How does your program look like in 2015? Are you going to focus on up dip, and have you held what is needed to be held by production? Any more color that you can provide?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John. Let me first say on the acreage side of things. Of our upside acreage, almost 85% of it is already HBP. And so we really don't have much of the lease exploration issue at all for the Meramec for us, and what little we have will be easily satisfied with the wells we have planned both this year and the coming years. So that's not of a concern to us. In times, what are we targeting? We are still trying to fill our way across this fast position as to where are the best returns.", "Clearly, some of those up dip wells are outstanding wells. But I will also tell you some of the down dip wells have some phenomenal gas rates associated with them, and still generate very nice returns even for 5,000 foot lateral. So right now as far as 2015 goes, we are not going one area using other we are again trying to expand the opportunity set with our delineation wells. And then we'll see as we go further long. But again, right now, the returns look good whether on one side of that mine or the other right now.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I just wanted to add. This is Tom. It's the wrong viewpoint only to look at commodity mix, when you look at the Meramec. A very very significant over (49:13) is pressure. And as in so many place up dip to down dip, you go from essentially normally pressure to overpressure. And we think we really like our position in aggregate and we've got a lot of energy in that reservoir, we're over pressured, where we have our acreage. And I'm not sure if the map was all clean and we're releasing today, we're not clear (49:38) for our acreage exactly where it is.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just looking at the first quarter, is it going to be very frontend \u2013 frontloaded with completions? Are you going to exhaust your entire backlog coming from 2014? And my related question would be, would you run if you keep your rigs as is, would you run a risk of not having kind of any headroom or any kind of backlog going into 2016?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John, with our rigs moving from the Permian and to the Mid-Continent, we're obviously going to finish up all the completions that we have in the Permian. So as far as future wells are concerned, we've got a number of them permitted and queued up and ready to go. So it's just a matter of drilling on them and then getting them fracked and back on the frac schedule. If I understood your question...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think the only comment I'd add is that, are waiting on completion well (50:35) against the derivative of, I don't know, which are running and assist (50:41) the client from completing drilling the well and completing it, that's what the backlog as of the year-end represented albeit we're low (50:47) on our rig counts, that backlog will decrease until this represent what (50:51) that rig finishes drilling?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "So certainly, by the way, we're looking at it from a capital expenditure standpoint. We don't say drilling or completing, we just say dollar spent. And that carryover evolves from 2014 and 2015 as capital associated with them, that we incorporated and we're fine and that's completion capital.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Got you. And with predominantly, you're moving into longer laterals, extended laterals. I was just curious if you've got the operational risks that are generally associated with during such laterals if you got it into science now, looks like you're. But if you can talk about how well you understand the risks involved in drilling such laterals, especially when you are in a capital constrained environment?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "This is Joe. Knock on what we are gaining that that efficiency in our operations and find very, very comfortable drilling two-mile laterals whether it's in Cana in the Woodford or the Meramec or in the Wolfcamp.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess first of mine is on the Cana program, correct me if I'm wrong, I think in the past call or early last fall or late last summer, you'd initially talked about I think a full 10 section development as a part of that infill program versus like seven now. Is it right, number one, I want to guess is that right?", "And then number two is, is it right to think about that as your just \u2013 you'll still be developing that full 10 section row, but it will just take longer and so that program that really then just bleeds into 2016 and provides a nice tailwind as you move into the 2015 period?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, this is John and you're absolutely correct. Again that as we're planning for this well development, given our commodity prices, we have fully expected to do 10 sections led to development. Commodity prices have changed. And so right now, a number of the sections we find right now not to be of a sufficient return that we want to make the investment today. Those sections don't go away, they're always BT (53:19). So, we have made the election to only develop seven of those for now and just essentially save the other three for another day when commodity prices justify making an investment then.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. So, it sounds like maybe it's more about the economic sensitivity of the unit as oppose to just overall decision to slow the pace of the development of...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it was a little of both. I mean the wells that we've decided not to drill this year are down the drier gas portion, but they still generate reasonable returns. And depending on our results with the infill project, we've discussed as recently as this morning that we could add additional development sections on to that development this year. And so, that certainly I would say this, an additional extension of that development program is among our options that are active that we wanted to up our capital slightly this year.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "And I'll call off with that. Tom's absolutely right and that couple of those sections are queued up permitted ready to go and we have that optionality. And so, don't be surprised if indeed we add on from seven. We will \u2013 Mark, obviously make that decision as we monitor the commodity prices, as well as our capital and what we want to do.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And maybe it's a little too granular, but is it fair to say that that's the low point from a quarterly perspective this year would be second quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?", "G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning", "Actually Michael, this is Mark again. This is actually our third quarter will likely be our low point for the year, but (55:05) activity in Permian in the first quarter and second quarters as it'll be growing, it's going to be pretty flat and in the third quarter it'd be \u2013 it looks like our low quarter.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think (55:14).", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Ish, we'll put a big ish after it.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. And then last one's on mine, I think on the Meramec good update there. I guess any way you provide a range of the DOE or MMTSE (55:37) flow rates across those fits, I'm just trying to get a sense for like you said there is maybe quite a bit of dry gas rate associated with those down dip wells. I'm just trying to better understand how the distribution looks around that average?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean for now we've elected to give you the average rate for those wells. I'll just put it this way, there is still a lot of drilling to do and there is also quite frankly some leasing to do. So as much as we're very proud of these results. There is still a lot to be done here. So I think what we've given you is I think is a good snapshot of the kind of results we're having right now.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. Great. And then...", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "(56:28) in that average. These are really good wells.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. On the economic comparison you put on slide 20. Is that well I assume that's the averages of the hydrocarbon mixed in average well or is that...?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. That's just not taking a generic type curve for both ways. And giving you an idea of what those returns are like. But clearly, depending upon where you are those numbers can swing quite a bit one way or the other but that's just the generic type curve the book plays (57:01).", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Great. It's all very helpful color. I appreciate it.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Yes. My question, and going back from there, Meramec has turned around to understand (57:22) it's still delineating. So far, the wells have been \u2013 they have been really good. So, should we think of this spread as having very low exploration risk, and really what I'm after is, how continuous is this interval, or how heterogeneous the play really is and so how many more wells would you need to truly understand the reservoir architecture?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, I'll try to answer that first. This is John. We did talk about on an acreage position that we consider to be delineated, meaning that from those wells, we feel very good about going forward from an investment decision.", "I will tell you and again, Tom mentioned this, we've been very pleased that along those wells that formed that average \u2013 as Tom said, there's not a dog among them. And so, that does, in some way, speak to the lateral consistency of results that we're getting across that position. And then, so that's encouraging, very encouraging to us.", "But we're only technically seven wells into it. So hang on, let us get more wells drilled. But so far, I would say, we're very encouraged again for that immediate variable, we drilled our wells to the consistency we've seen from the production of those wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Irene, this is Tom. I mean, we're in the business of being romanced by upside and the Meramec offers tremendous romance. And one of the things that we don't know and I really want to be clear, we don't know \u2013 we don't know what the spacing will be. But we also don't know if there will be multiple zones. I mean the Meramec is a fixed section.", "And there are some of our competitors out there testing stack laterals and as we look at that section and we have indeed varied our own landing zone, as we drill these wells, we will be testing that there could be multiple zones in the Meramec, possibly a couple of layers to this. So, we just don't know. And John's point is really the right one that with just six wells or seven wells an area this large, we have a lot of work to do before we can really get too granular with it on what this asset can deliver. So, I think, very encouraging so far.", "Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "It's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the last question today comes from Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Hi, Cameron.", "Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC", "Hey Tom, you referenced in deal flow early in the call. I was hoping you could just talk about what you're seeing out \u2013 out there from that perspective. I guess asset quality wise, if you've seen any reconciliation of some of the wide bid/ask spread that we've heard so much about?", "And also maybe just the competitive landscape? And how that's maybe changing here over the last few months, seems like there's been quite a bit of an influx of private capital competing, looking to take advantage of some of the same opportunities that you all are, so hoping you could just give us some color there?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd be happy to and none of what I'm about to say is news to you. There's a lot of capital in our sector in chasing opportunities, and there's a lot of private equity money on the hunt. Now there are some assets for sale and they're good assets, but there is still that bid/ask spread. I think that there's still a sellers' intent to try to find last year's work if you will, I mean, I think \u2013 I think asset prices have to rationalize around current commodity over look and we haven't seen that yet.", "There is also corporate opportunities that get whispered to us from time-to-time, we've looked at a couple of them and wouldn't surprise you to hear that some of these companies have a lot more debt than we do and when we do a pro forma, we're \u2013 you got to just love the asset in order to take on that burden. And it's \u2013 as I said the outset, our hurdle is high, but \u2013 I think a lot of these management teams out there are going to try weather through this to the extent they can, it's just going to be a function of how brutal does this get and how sustainable it will be.", "As I said in my opening remarks, we're not waiting around for a recovery, I mean at Cimarex we've got assets that can work in this environment and we're getting our cost structure, so that we can move forward and not looking back. And I think there is going to be have to be more sellers with that viewpoint before there's going to be pricing that makes sense.", "Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color on that Tom. And then can you just talk about how Ward County kind of fits into the strategic picture, I think you talked about that somewhat falling down in terms of the (62:16) on the Wolfcamp and just some of the challenges there some of the water and stuff. Can you talk about and how you think about Ward County is that they're better potential monetization candidate for you or is that just kind of wait and see how things evolve. How are you tracking that in obviously a much more constrained environment?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. It is clear to us that Ward County currently based on our drilling results doesn't compete versus Reeves or Culberson and that was even true at a much higher oil environment and there are challenges in Ward County that we've yet really been able to overcome with our drilling program. That said, we don't have a lot of exposure this year. I think at last we're looking at about 3,000 acres of explorations in 2015. And so and as much as we're not going to be actively drilling there. We will certainly be monitoring other companies who have assets around us who will be drilling, and pay careful attention on what they do. But I'll just say as of right now, we have no plans to do any drilling this year for Ward County.", "G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning", "And we haven't really explored monetizing it. I think our \u2013 always our first preference is to figure it out, and Joe and John's right we're going to be starting it, and watch our competition carefully.", "Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC", "Thanks, Brian.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Cameron, (63:44), once the Culberson County is going to work and now it's out there in our portfolio.", "Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC", "Sure. I appreciate all the color. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.", "Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations", "I don't think we have any comments, just thanks for participating, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Last night, we updated \u2013 we posted an updated presentation on our website. We'll be referring to this presentation during our call today if you'd like to take a look at it. And as a reminder, our discussions will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "So today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling results and activities from John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and finally Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs. Paul Korus and Mark Burford are also here in the room to help answer any questions.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to share my thoughts on the current environment before turning it over to John and Joe for the details of our first quarter results and our plans for the rest of 2015.", "During this call, you'll hear about new wells that are outperforming our expectations, which has led to our Q1 production beat. We have several new long laterals in the Delaware Basin that are in the Wolfcamp on line and they've reaffirmed our enthusiasm for the long-term potential of this play for Cimarex. Our improved well performance is primarily driven by ongoing well optimization, but is also driven by certain changes in our horizontal landing zone. You'll also hear some of the results from our second Bone Spring oil play in our Eddy County, White City acreage. These wells are among the best in our portfolio with multi-year running room.", "We've always been a company that emphasizes the science and that emphasis is yielding results in spacing pilots, well design, completion design and unraveling geologic complexity. We will also update you on our continued success in the Cana-Woodford shale and the emerging Meramec plays.", "Oil prices have recovered modestly since our last call, but are still at a level that we view as unsustainable. Natural gas prices remain depressed. Our projected 2015 cash flow outlook is similar to what it was at our last quarter call in February. Owing to our commitments to be fiscally disciplined, our 2015 capital expansions remain at the $900 million to $1.1 billion that we've previously announced. We have seen service costs decrease 15% below Q4 levels and we look forward to further service cost reductions.", "For now, we intend to leave within cash flow and not incur additional debt during the remainder of 2015. We view debt as a long-term commitment and we're hesitant to make long-term commitments in this volatile environment. Our focus has been on asset quality. As we have high graded our activity, we have continually scrubbed our project returns to ensure that we're investing wisely and not destroying capital in this depressed commodity environment.", "The robustness of the returns in our portfolio has surprised us to the upside. We've a deep inventory of projects that make great sense in today's environment and when the time is right for acceleration, we're ready to roll. The quality of our inventory is a testament to technology, innovation, and great geo-science that have become hallmarks of Cimarex. There's also a splash of luck in there too; our assets are in great basins with tremendous multi-pay geologic targets.", "Finally, as always, our focus is on creating shareholder value. These depressed commodity prices make our task more difficult.", "(04:30 \u2013 04:41)", "Operator", "Pardon me. This is the operator. Please continue to hold the line. We are attempting to reestablish connection. Again, please continue to hold the line.", "(04:47 \u2013 07:23)", "Operator", "This is the operator. Once again, please continue to hold the line. The speakers will reconnect shortly. Thank you.", "(07:28 \u2013 08:08)", "Operator", "Pardon me. This is the operator; I have reconnected to speaker's location.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I thank you for your patience. Apparently our emphasis on technology does not include telephone technology, but I'm not sure where we got cut off; but I was just saying that oil prices have recovered modestly and we're so committed to the $900 million to $1.1 billion that we previously announced for 2015 CapEx.", "And also, I think I it was fading when I was telling you that we've seen service costs come down 15% since the fourth quarter and we're expecting further service cost reductions but we intend to remain within cash flow for the remainder of 2015, and that's based on our core hesitation to incur addition debt in this volatile environment.", "Our focus has been on asset quality, and as we've managed through this price correction, we've continually scrubbed our returns and looked to make sure that we are funding the very best projects and that we are not destroying capital. And as we've done that, the robustness in quality of our well level returns have surprised us to the upside.", "We've got a great inventory of projects. We have lots to do in current environment, and when the time is right for us to accelerate, we'll be ready and we got lots teed up. And as I was saying, the quality of this inventory is really a testament to our organization, our emphasis on technology and innovation, and great geoscience; and it's nice to have a little luck as well. Our assets are in great basins; they're multi-pay basins that really allow us to leverage technology and play against our core strengths.", "And finally, as always, our focus is on creating shareholder value. These depressed commodity prices make our task more difficult while but are uncompromising on our focus on shareholder value. We have the organization and the assets to emerge from this down-cycle stronger than ever.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth who'll provide additional detail.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics about some of our latest results.", "Cimarex invested $308 million during the first quarter drilling and completing wells. 67% of that investment was in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region. Companywide, we brought 53 gross, 33 net wells on production during the quarter. Our Permian operations are in the Delaware Basin where we completed 30 of those 33 net wells during the first quarter. We focused on completing our backlog of Avalon wells and Wolfcamp long laterals. We also began production on several new second Bone Spring wells located in our White City area.", "We continue to have exceptional results drilling second Bone Spring wells in this area since incorporating larger frac jobs into our completion design. We've gone from 9 stages to 15 stages in order to achieve these results. We now have 15 wells with 30-day peak averages of 1,344 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil represents 68% of the production stream on a three stream basis with the 15 wells averaging just over 900 barrels per day for 30 days. As of today, we have identified approximately 100 second Bone Spring locations on our White City acreage with the vast majority being located on acreage which is held by production.", "Our long lateral program in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County continues to provide solid results. Eleven long lateral wells are now producing and seven wells now have enough data to provide an updated average 30-day peak IP of 2,378 barrels of oil equivalent per day.", "As I said on our last call, we continue to work on optimizing our frac design to both maximize IP rates while paying close attention to costs. In fact, we've recently brought on a number of Wolfcamp wells with various frac designs in order to determine the best design for our next spacing pilot. Based on these recent well results, we have chosen a stimulation design which places the same amount of sand per well as the previous pilot had, but we accomplished this with fewer stages. As for this pilot, which we just recently began to fracture stimulate, we are testing the equivalent of six wells per section with the wells spaced 880 feet apart. A diagram of this pilot can be found on slide 15 in our new corporate presentation. The new pilot was drilled directly south of our first Culberson down-spacing pilot, thus enabling us to be able to review well results without worrying about geologic variation.", "Also in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of our stack staggered Wolfcamp A pilot in Reeves County. This pilot was designed to test the down-spacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the fifth Wolfcamp A section.", "After delays caused by the September flooding, these wells began producing in early December. I'll refer you to slide 18 in our presentation for a diagram of the pilot. The wells landed in the upper part of the Wolfcamp A produced at higher rates than the lower wells, achieving a peak 30-day average of 1,068 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil. The wells in the Lower A had a peak 30-day average rate of 761 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56 barrels of that being oil.", "Slide 19 shows the production of the upper and lower wells for the first four months. We had a very difficult time placing sand in the wells landed in the lower A, which we attribute to a poor choice of landing zone, which led to a higher amount of carbonate instead of shale in the lateral. We have reviewed the landing zone in question and are confident with a small landing zone adjustment we can achieve much better results in future wells landed in the lower part of the A.", "In 2015, our Wolfcamp capital will continue to be focused on drilling additional long lateral wells in Culberson County as well as meeting our leasehold obligations in Reeves County, which we expect can be fulfilled by spudding eight wells in 2015 at a cost of $70 million.", "Now on to the Mid-Continent; we brought three net wells on production in Mid-Continent region in the first quarter. The rest of the wells drilled are awaiting completion. You may recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford Row 4 infill development program late last year. We and our partner are nearly finished with the drilling on this row and expect to begin completions around mid-summer.", "To help ensure we use the most effective fracture stimulation on Row 4 wells, we recently completed and are currently flowing back eight wells in the Haley section. We varied our completions on these wells with changes in total sand pump ranging from 9 million pounds to 12 million pounds or, same way of saying it, 1,800 pounds per foot to 2,400 pounds per foot, as well as varying stage count from 24 to up to 30. We will monitor these well results and then choose the appropriate frac design for Row 4 wells.", "In our emerging Meramec play, we now have enough production data on seven 5,000 foot laterals to give you an average 30-day peak IP rate of 10 million cubic feet equivalent per day. The seventh well, the Peoples 1-29H, had an average 30-day peak IP of 9.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 1,628 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well has a very high oil yield averaging 788 barrels of oil per day. We will watch the performance of all the wells drilled to date as we continue to delineate our position, refine our geologic model, and further enhance our frac design.", "We currently have two Meramec wells flowing back with a third being completed right now. We have also recently commenced drilling the first of several 10,000 foot laterals in the Meramec. Results from the long laterals shouldn't be expected before our third quarter call in November.", "Cimarex has approximately 115,000 acres prospective for the Meramec, 70,000 of which have been de-risked by our and competitor drilling activity. From a capital standpoint, current plans are to invest $70 million in Meramec drilling in 2015. Once we have finished Row 4 drilling, one of the rigs that is currently working the Mid-Continent will be redeployed to the Permian Basin, bringing our rig count to three in each region.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Thank you, John. And thank you all of you for joining our call today and especially for bearing with us during our little phone technicality there; and hopefully things are working well and it sounds like they are at least with the phone, for the call. I'll touch on the usual items, our first quarter production, update you on our second quarter and full year production outlook, and then I'll follow up with a few words on operating and service costs.", "We had another great quarter for production. Despite expected shut-ins of approximately $30 million a day for January weather and February pipeline and facility maintenance in the Permian, our first quarter net equivalent daily production came in at 947 MMcfe a day; that was virtually flat to our record company production level that we posted last quarter. We were up 28% from a year ago and we beat our guidance of 920 MMcfe to 940 MMcfe a day, so a strong quarter from that perspective.", "Really guided by our strong 2014 exit rate; and with that, our Q1 2015 total company reported volume was up 206 MMcfe a day from a year ago with our Permian equivalent production up $141 million a day or 41% from Q1 2014. And our Mid-Continent production up 73 MMcfe a day or 20% from last year, both statistics reflecting our strong activity levels in each of those areas over the last year.", "As we mentioned last call with our \u2013 with the \u2013 excuse me, the geographic focus of our drilling program and the shifting of rigs as we moved into the year, we forecasted our early 2015 production growth to come primarily from the Permian and we saw just that in Q1. Despite freezing and pipeline maintenance issues, our first quarter Permian equivalent volume of 488 MMcfe a day was up 42 MMcfe a day or 9% from fourth quarter. Oil production drove the increase with our Q4 Permian oil volume of 43,089 barrels a day \u2013 excuse me, our Q1 Permian oil volume of 43,089 barrels a day up 13% or 4,843 barrels a day over Q4. With that, the Permian now makes up 52% of our total company equivalent production and 84% of the net oil we produce as a company.", "As we mentioned during our last call, that with fewer net Mid-Continent completions planned for the first half of the year, we projected our Mid-Continent volumes to drop somewhat through mid Q3 of this year. Our Q1 Mid-Continent production came in accordingly at 444 MMcfe a day, down slightly from the 488 MMcfe a day that we posted in Q4, yet still up 20% from the 371 MMcfe a day that we posted a year ago. Nothing has changed at our modeling, where we project our Mid-Continent production to pick up in the second half this year as we bring on our Cana infill (20:03) project. We completed 3.1 net wells in the Mid-Continent in Q1; we anticipate a similar number here in Q2, and then are projecting a rapid increase to 30 net wells to be completed during the second half of the year.", "So looking forward, with strong Permian results, we're really off to a good start here in Q1. Our current model projects 2015 total company net equivalent production to now be in the range of 920 MMcfe to a day to 950 MMcfe a day. That's reflecting a 6% to 9% growth over 2014, and it's up from our previous guidance of 895 MMcfe a day to 935 MMcfe a day. As was the case in our beginning year model, our current projection reflects a geographic focus to our activity, with the Permian driving production during the first half of the year and our Cana infill (20:57) project providing the catalyst during the last half of the year.", "Our Q2 guidance of 965 MMcfe a day to 985 MMcfe a day is up 15% to 17% from our Q2 2014 average of 839 MMcfe a day, and it reflects continued production growth in the Permian with a slight drop in our Q2 Mid-Continent production, just prior to the onset of our Cana infill completion operations, which should begin here in Q3.", "With our current drilling schedule, our projected fourth quarter 2015 production rate is forecasted to be flat to down slightly to Q4 2014, but as we've mentioned before and Tom alluded to earlier in the call, our forecasts are based on the low end of our capital spending projection and any changes in that regard will obviously effect our future forecast for production.", "Shifting over to OpEx, our production team's focus on reducing LOE continues to show up in our numbers, driven by strong reductions; in items such as rentals, compression, SWD and in particular well servicing, our Q1 lifting cost came in at $0.96 an Mcfe, below the bottom end of our guidance which was $1.07 per Mcfe to $1.17 per Mcfe and down $0.09 from our Q4 average of $1.05 per Mcfe. So counting for our strong Q1, all the while the variable nature of work over expenses, we're guiding our remaining year lifting costs to be in the range of a $1 to $1.10; and again, that's down from the $1.07 to $1.17 that we quoted last call. We're extremely proud of the strides our production team has made to reduce LOE and even prouder the resolve to reduce them further yet.", "A few comments on service cost. With the continued decline in industry activity, we've seen further softening in drilling and completion costs since our last call. On the drilling side, we've seen further cost reductions in items such as bits, cementing, tubulars, directional equipment; all the while day rates today are certainly more negotiable than they've been in years.", "On the completion side, since about February we've seen anywhere from 10% to 40% decreases in all of our major frac cost compound, whether would be sand, transportation, chemicals, or service costs. And as a result, to give you a perspective of 30,000 feet, at the total company level, our Q1 average crude oil frac costs were down 20% from Q4. All the while, we're pumping an average of 12% more fluid and 20% more sand per job. The bottom line here is our total well costs are down 13% to 20% from where they were at the end of 2014.", "Our current Cana Core one-mile lateral Woodford AFE is now in the range of $6.7 million to $7.1 million. That's down approximately 15% from the $7.98 million to $8.4 million that we quoted last year \u2013 late last year. In the Meramec, with just a handful of wells under our belts, our current single-mile lateral AFEs are running in the $7 million to $7.4 million range; that's down about 13% from late in Q4. And in the Permian, our primary focus, as John has alluded to, is in the long lateral development of our Culberson County Wolfcamp program. We've gained tremendous drilling efficiencies and cost reductions both in that program. And our current two-mile lateral Culberson's AFE for Wolfcamp are now running a $11 million to $11.8 million and that's down 17% to 20% from year end.", "So we're making strides. Our LOE costs are down, our drilling costs are down, we're seeing some nice production results. We've come off a very nice quarter. Our late 2014 drilling activity has carried very strong production levels into early 2015, even into the latter parts of the second quarter. Our drilling program continues to generate positive results despite the lower commodity prices; and our organization is acting swiftly to reduce costs across the board while we're keeping a focus on optimizing program results.", "So with that, I guess, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Andrew Venker with Morgan Stanley.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Drew.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, Tom. I just want to start with the Culberson density pilot; just curious aside from the spacing, are you doing anything different on the completions versus that first density pilot?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, Drew. This is John Lambuth. As I mentioned for this particular pilot, which as I said directly located south of the first pilot we did, we are changing the frac design some based on some recent well results. We're not changing total amount of sand. We're still at around 6 million pounds over the length of a 5,000 foot lateral. But we're going to do it with fewer stages; instead of 20, we're going to do it with 16 and then what we're also doing is adding more clusters within each stage. We have a few wells that recently came on with this type of design and although we don't have a lot of production on those wells just yet, the early time data we see from those particular wells is encouraging and that's why we're making this particular change for this pilot.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And is that a cost savings measure, a capital efficiency measure, or do you really think that well design just gives you the best performance?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. Clearly, it was a decision of best performance. That said, because we're going to less stages, there will be some amount of cost savings because we haven't quantified that just yet.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "This is Joe. I'll elaborate. We've seen significant reductions in our service cost per stage, upwards of 30%, 40% per stage just over the last three months as a result of not only the market itself, but our efficiencies in pumping the jobs. So really, all those cost components are intermixed in us changing these designs, but overall we anticipate that to be down slow \u2013 somewhat from our prior jobs.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then, just as far as the completion design and the landing zones overall for Culberson, can you talk about how that's evolved and how much room you think there is for improvement from here? Have you played around with, I guess, the landing zone a fair amount, and where do you think you're on the completions?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, on the landing zone front \u2013 I'll take that first. This is John again. We have a lot of wells drilled now that we've tried many different landing zones and so I think we're getting a good sense of where its best to land a well in terms of both achieving the best EUR, being able to actually place all our sand and even getting a very high drill rate through the rock. All those things come together to leading to the most economic wells. I think we're very comfortable now saying the Wolfcamp D as to where we want to be there, and I think we're definitely getting there on the Wolfcamp A from Culberson as well.", "As far as the completion design, I don't know we'll ever probably reach the optimal design. Obviously, year and year-and-a-half ago, we had a major step change when we went from 10 stages to 20 stages and we are very pleased with that outcome.", "In the case of Culberson Wolfcamp, we actually took it even further, going to 30 stages and we did not really get our bang for the buck doing that. And that's when we start to ask ourselves, well maybe we want a little too far on stage count and those are the things that we've been testing, as I said. These latest wells where we backed off on the stage count, but still were able to place the equivalent amount of sand just doing it with less stages but more clusters. Again, as I said, early time data is encouraging to us, but I am sure we'll find ways to even adjust that as we go along", "with our future wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, this is Tom. I just want to comment on that. Having the two basins really makes us better, and you've heard us talk about that. We get a technology arbitrage from basin-to-basin from time-to-time. And although in 2014, we hit a major step change in our Cana-Woodford completions, we're kind of undergoing another one right now. We're trying some things in Cana that are leading to significantly better results and we are discussing what implications that may have on the Permian. So I think that this advancement in completion and well performance is still well underway and it would be, I think, foolish for us to say that we've got the right recipe in the Permian, because we're learning some things in Cana that causes us to rethink some core assumptions.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's helpful color, Tom. Just one last one; Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you would be ready to accelerate when the time is right. Can you give us any color on if there's specific criteria there that you're looking for, or is it just kind of a different feeling of the environment?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, a lot of it is feeling and that's the hardest to get specific on. I will say I think we'd like to see what happens at the OPEC meeting in June, and at least get some kind of a directional confirmation of oil prices. It's been nice to see oil prices firm up a little bit over the last couple of weeks; we'd like to see that trend continue. And every increase is a big positive to our cash flow and our outlook. So, we've said in the past that our current capital program is a snapshot in time and we'll be reevaluating that here, I think, come midsummer and make our best determination. We are absolutely getting ready to accelerate, if indeed it's prudent.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color, Tom.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.", "Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International", "I'll take a stab at the other county that you have the spacing pilots down for; maybe you could walk us through the Reeves County issues with the lowers, just \u2013 what was different on the landing zone? I'm assuming you landed in a similar spot to the parent well, but how much variability do we think that is there and just other lessons learned that may not have been part of the prepared remarks?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John Lambuth. I think what it just shows is there is a quite bit of variability in terms of the Wolfcamp in regards to these inter-bedded carbonates that we encounter from time to time. And indeed, that's what occurred with those lower wells on this particular pilot. What we didn't do, which we would do now is if we do encounter that, we will be more aggressive in our directional planes to get out of that and get back into shale, and that's something now we do do with the wells we're currently drilling. And then furthermore, we will pay more careful attention to the local well control to make sure we avoid those particular zones. That's really what it comes down to is just ensuring that you place most of that lateral in good shale because we've seen now when we do that, we're able to get our sand, our frac jobs off, and we get the best wells. And so that's really the main lesson we learned from that particular pilot on those lower wells.", "Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International", "And when are we going back into the lower with another similar spacing pilot? Is that something that's ongoing?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "We don't have a current spacing pilot right now lined out for Reeves. We're still looking at this one as well as our previously mentioned 80-acre Spacing Pilot and monitoring those results very carefully over time. Secondly, really, what we're doing now is doing more long laterals in Reeves. We have a quite a number of 10,000 foot laterals that are coming on now. And it's really the combination of these two different spacing pilot results along with long laterals that will help us better line out what does development look like for that particular area; so that's kind of where we're at right now.", "Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International", "Great. And then one bigger picture question. Tom, on the M&A market, maybe give us an update on any sort of changes in bid/ask spread as oil prices have increased, appetite for different deals, things that maybe you've seen come across your desk. Any update there would be helpful.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. This is Tom. We really haven't seen a lot of assets recently, but I think our viewpoint is probably what's out there in the writings that there's still, I think \u2013 what did I see, a quote from CERAWeek, whistling past the graveyard; they said that our industry is whistling past the graveyard. If we get into a lower longer environment, we're expecting that bid/ask spread to collapse a little, but we have not seen it yet.", "Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International", "I appreciate it, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jason.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, Tom, so to follow up on the earlier acceleration question, the returns on your Culberson long laterals per your slides were, I think, about 100% at current commodity prices. So when you think about moving up from six rigs, where does the potential for hedging fit in?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, boy, I wasn't expecting this.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Well, I am wondering if you're something to protect your downside versus, if your trends are that good then...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's a good question. I want to say first off, when we talk about our returns, they're well level returns; they're not fully burdened, I want to be clear on that. Although fully burdened, they still look very, very good. And then when you have a program, things go wrong and you have opportunity for over expenditures. So I wouldn't want to represent that our entire inventory anywhere in our program is 100% after-tax rate of return. We do have a fair amount of that, but we have a mixture of a return landscape.", "But your core question is on hedging; we're discussing a different hedging approach at Cimarex. I think one of the things that philosophically appeals to us is some kind of a program hedging where we would take volumes periodically and just commit to hedge them without making a determination whether price is high or low; layer them in and kind of have a feather over time of a hedge book.", "But the tough question is, all right, when you're going to start that. And I think we're kind of reluctant to layer in a lot of hedges at these price environments. We were at a dinner recently where an individual we really respect made the comment at the heels of a big discussion on hedging, he just kind of quieted the room when he said if Cimarex were to hedge today at $60 oil and prices were to recover to $90, there'd be a riot. And, you know, we maintain that balance sheet. We're fully equipped to ride through the down cycles and participate fully in the uptick. So, yeah, we're arguing about it, but I wouldn't be waiting with bated breath for some new approach.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Okay. So then that the three rigs I think, Joe, you mentioned that the third rig is going to move back to Permian, could you just talk about where those are going to concentrate? Is it going to be all Culberson? And I guess what I'm curious about is you guys completed 16 wells in the Avalon; you said some of that was running through backlog, but obviously one of your peers this morning had some pretty positive results out of that place. So can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing there and how that fits into the portfolio going forward?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. In regard to the rigs in the Permian, the three rigs for the rest of the year, they will almost primarily be Wolfcamp wells, either in Culberson or Reeves. A lot of that is to ensure we hold our acreage; some of it is delineation as well, but that's primarily what they will be doing for the remainder of the year.", "In regards to the Avalon, we did, in fact, bring on beginning of the year around 18 gross Avalon wells. Those wells were really spread across four different sections and they were essentially spacing pilot wells. We were testing both spacing and turns of 80 acres and 107 acres or the equivalent of eight or six wells a section. We also in one section stack and staggered and on another one, we even varied frac. So there's a lot going on there. All of those wells are flowing back now and really we need a little bit more time to review those results and I feel pretty confident by probably next earnings release, we'll be able to give you a good update on the result of that \u2013 of those wells in the Avalon at that time.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. And just one last quick one from me, I know you guys aren't focusing there this year, but just your thoughts on the Ward County acreage and how that kind of fits in the portfolio. And maybe you can talk with any acreage exploration issues in 2015 and 2016 there that would cause you to have to drill.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. In regards to Ward County, it is a struggle. Ward County has not been a good rate of return area for us at Wolfcamp so far. And we still talk about it and we still monitor not just our own but competitor wells to make sure we fully understand that asset. We don't have any major explorations, but they really start coming in pretty big next year in 2016. We're currently looking at that acreage and asking ourselves, is there anything left that we haven't tested on it to see that we can try, but so far, within our portfolio of Wolfcamp opportunities, the Ward County is much lower prospective than the other two.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. This is Tom. One of the things we've seen in Reeves County, and I think we have a little bit of work to do in Culberson County, is so much subtle changes in landing zone are having a fairly significant impact on well performance. And we did a fair amount of (39:47) physics work and have just recently completed a couple of wells that we're optimistic will reconfirm for us what we're seeing in some competitors that landing zone makes a huge difference.", "Now, is that going to save Ward County? We don't think so today, but we're looking long and hard at it and, as John said, we study our competitors' as well as our own activity. Stay tuned. I mean, there was a day when we expected Ward County to be our best and it cycled. I mean, there was a day when we looked at our entire Wolfcamp landscape and we thought that Ward County would be our best. And so it comes and goes.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate the answers. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Guffey at Stifel.", "Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, guys. You gave rates on your four 7,500 foot Wolfcamp A laterals and Culberson, and I'm curious if you can kind of walk through \u2013 I know they're more oil rich, but they come in \u2013 come on at lower rates. I guess, can you walk through and compare the economics versus the D? And then on top of that, how many locations have you identified and are 10,000 foot laterals feasible, across your acreage?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John Lambuth. I'll take a stab at that. The Wolfcamp A wells and Culberson are definitely higher yield, higher condensate, but they do come in at a little bit lower rate and that's simply because you're a little bit less pressure than you are in the D. But that said, those lower rates are more to make up for because of the amount of oil we do make; but right now, just as I speak on a comparative basis, the Wolfcamp A laterals to us look just as good economically as do the Ds.", "The first few A wells are 7,500 and that's just a matter of the way that acreage laid there in Culberson. We share that JVA with Chevron, and we just have an odd number section so at some point, not all of them could be 10,000 foot laterals so in this case, those basket of wells were 7,500. The remaining of our acreage, we fully anticipate to be 10,000 foot for A, and in fact, I think we have one of our first ones coming on here right now. So the lateral length, it's just because of the acreage itself not because we don't think we can't do 10,000 in the A and that would be our plans going forward for the A.", "Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, on locations and how much of your acreage you think is prospective across Culberson and then does the A thin, I guess, as you move across your acreage to the north and to the west?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "As far as the A is concerned, it does begin to thin as we go toward the west and a little bit to the north. But to be honest, we haven't really determined how thin is still good. We haven't pushed that edge yet so it's hard for me to say, how much of the acreage is good for A or not. Those are some of the things we'll have to do here in the coming \u2013 with the drilling program is to test that boundary. We don't know the answer to that.", "I mean, clearly, we started in an area where we had a very good thickness in the A; but again, to be honest, and it's kind of nice, there are other competitors drilling wells nearby us, testing some of these thinner intervals of the A that will go a long way to helping us to determine just how prospective is our entire acreage there in Culberson. But I don't really have an answer for you today, but stay tuned; over time, we'll be able to give more clarity as we get more wells on line.", "Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then just two follow-ups kind of defining acreage in the Avalon, just piggybacking on the last question; previously, you guys have talked about 200 plus locations. You guys are obviously doing down spacing test among the others that you listed. I guess what is your identified inventory in the Avalon at this time and I guess what base assumptions are you using to back that up?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. I think in today's commodity price and cost environment, we see around 186 gross, 5,000-foot laterals and that's, I believe, based on six wells per section. So that could change dramatically based on the spacing pilot results. But that's just how we see it today, but that number is always changing. That's just as of today, that's how we see it.", "Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then switching gears over the Meramac, you guys have talked about 70,000 net acres you feel is de-risked and 115,000 net acres total. You guys have provided a map and you guys have mapped that geologically with significant well control across your acreage. I'm wondering how much do you feel is kind of in the up-dip \u2013 up-dip kind of normalized pressure versus the down dip over pressured regime?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head. Clearly, we have a good representation of acreage both in the up-dip as well as the down-dip, but I don't recall the break \u2013 breakout of their \u2013 off the top of my head. We could probably follow-up with you on that to give you that breakdown; I just don't have it with me.", "Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks for all the color today, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Investment Research.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I appreciate the color you just gave a few minutes ago on the Wolfcamp A and Culberson. Just kind of like to extend the idea a little bit and ask, is the prospectivity of the Wolfcamp D and the Wolfcamp A similar across \u2013 I'm looking at slide 11, across the Culberson acreage or are there different parts to the acreage that are discretely prospective for each zone?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Give me a minute while I get to slide 11. The Wolfcamp D is prospective over all of our acreage there in terms of thickness. The Wolfcamp D is much thicker. I think the only issue we have there is, of course, like in the Delaware Basin, as we go from east to west, you begin to lose your yield as you go to the west. And it just becomes a matter of economics at that point as to how far west you can go. We don't really \u2013 we haven't really defined it as of yet. But the D is a much thicker interval across the breadth of our acreage than what the A exhibits, thus, more prospectivity.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "This is Tom. The nice thing about this Culberson block, when we're talking about economic limits, is we have a wide open playing field for long laterals. In fact, 10,000 foot laterals, I think, will be the standard out here and that gives us tremendous range of economic liability. And that's going to be true on the A and the D. And then I also do want to discount the C. We've talked about the C not competing with D and the A. But when we go to full development, I would anticipate that the C will be developed alongside of it.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "I'll follow-up with Tom's comment. That's especially true when we look at the C on a 10,000 foot lateral basis; then it becomes more economically viable for us. And it starts to make sense that in a full development mode, while you're there you'd want to capture that interval while you're doing the D as well. And that's something we'll clearly need to be testing once we get further along and actually into development mode whenever that occurs here.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And this speaks back to our opening remarks on asset quality. When we look at our Culberson block, and that Eddy block \u2013 Eddy County block to the north of it, there you have also great Wolfcamp prospectivity and then our central Reeves acreage, all of it is nicely blocked out. So the opportunity for longer horizontal wells is pretty deep in our inventory and that allows us a lot of robustness.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "And it sounds like from what you just laid out that there's certainly going to be some potential for maybe A, C and D in some locations when you're full bed development.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "That is especially true on the eastern side of our block. And then as we move to the west we'll just \u2013 we'll have to take a wait and see based on well results. But certainly, the eastern side of Culberson definitely aligns itself up to that and with further drilling, we'll see how far we can push that full three stacked opportunity.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Although we don't have results to discuss, there's also a push for a second D landing zone. So it's too premature to even hint that we may have two zones in D, but we're testing it.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Look forward to some color on that one, when it comes out. On slide 22, you showed, by my count, six locations in the Meramec, so it looks like maybe the seventh one hadn't shown up on that slide yet. I was just wondering was the seventh completion an updip or down-dip well?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "No. This is John. I believe there are seven stars; just got to look up to the north, west or up.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Oh, there it is; yeah, so which one was the seventh?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "That was the seventh.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. So you've also tested a little bit further away from kind of the area where you've been drilling.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yes. That was a delineation up there. Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then as a final question, I just wanted to go back to the lower A landing zone subject in Reeves County. I just wanted to make sure that I understood it correctly. Is it \u2013 based on the need to move the landing zone, does this affect the amount of acreage that you thought \u2013 previously thought was prospective for the lower landing zone? In other words, is this an adjustment that you can make in your \u2013 within your existing vision and prospectivity or does it change anything?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "It really doesn't change any prospectivity as far as acreage. It just means we have to be a little more careful when we drill those laterals and pay a little more careful attention to what we are in. To us, like I said, it's literally a very small adjustment to lateral zone and then very careful attention to why we are drilling that lateral, if we do encounter a carbonate to quickly adjust and get out of it.", "And no, we don't see that as a hindrance at all going forward. It's just a lesson learned. A tough lesson learned, but we've learned our lesson there in regards to how we will drill those wells going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay, great, thanks. I appreciate it. Good quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinnen Energy Advisors.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Thanks, good morning.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "I guess maybe one on the Mid-Con first. Just curious around what sort of discussions have you had, what's the thought process behind any additional row development with your partner in the Cana-Woodford as we think about formulating a 2016 plan.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. We have lots of discussions with our partner and there are two rows currently being discussed as future development. Potentially, even to the point we began drilling on at least one of those rows later this year. So there's still funny to do here and both us and our partner are very pleased with returns we're seeing from our development, which is leading toward the discussion I just mentioned about a couple more rows of development that potentially may begin later this year and go into next year. As we firm up those plans, then certainly we'll let you know probably by next quarter's call, we'll see. But discussions are underway about more development in the Woodford.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. And I guess maybe just high level then, thinking about just the capital cycle 2015 and 2016, is it fair to say then that 2016 might be a similar look to 2015 as it relates to Permian outperforming in the first half and the Mid-Con coming in in the second half in a stronger way? Is that...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, this is Tom. It's really premature to get that granular with 2016. We're still wrestling with what 2015 is going to look like. So we've got lots to do, but how we stage it and what that will look like, it's way premature for that.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay. That's fair. And then I guess jumping over to the Permian, can you give a little more color around the thought process on the six well spacing versus the tighter spacing on the prior pilings in Culberson and what you're hoping to learn outside of the varying completion designs from a spacing perspective?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. I'll take a stab at that. I think we all recognize that when we do go to development mode on the \u2013 in Culberson, that's a very critical step for us; lot of capital and we want to make sure we do it right. And so we knew all along that one pilot would not be sufficient to answer that question. And we kind of knew all along that we would have to do a couple pilots where we varied the spacing, in essence so we can bookend results in terms of what does six wells looks like per section versus eight. Please understand it, us going to six wells a section with this particular pilot in no way infers that that's what we think our spacing would be. It just helps us with those results and our previous pilot really hone in on what is the right spacing from a standpoint of both rate of return and PV. And that's why we are doing that, it is to kind of create those bookend results and then review that, and then make an informed decision on how to go about and develop that acreage. So that's the thought process.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "That's super helpful color. Thanks. And then just in the Permian program in 2015, how much of the program is on full two-mile laterals at this stage for rest of the year?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. All of Culberson is either 7,500 feet or 10,000 feet in regards to Wolfcamp; and in regards to Reeves, I would say the majority of the wells are 10,000 foot. There are some that are 5,000 foot just simply because we don't have the acreage to do 10,000 foot, but we're at that point even in Reeves that if the acreage allows us, then we're drilling 10,000 foot.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The one exception, the pilot we've discussed is 5,000 foot. We choose to do \u2013 to the extent we're doing science and it's an experiment, we like to go with a more cheaper well.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Yeah. Thanks. And then last one on my end, in that Reeves pilot, the mix shifted a little bit over the course of the 90 days in the lower A. Is there anything to read into there or is that, again, somewhat a function of the carbonates encountered during drilling?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "I don't know there's a lot to read into that. Obviously, over time, these wells tend to \u2013 our GOR does go up as we produce these wells, so I think you're seeing a little bit of that there. But in the course of four months, I don't know you can read too much into those numbers just yet.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Okay.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, this is Tom. You know, when we forecast these wells, we forecast the declining oil yields and that's built into our economics and we have raging debates internally as to whether we've got that forecasted correctly. I think there's some organizations would think we're a little conservative in our forecast, but we just need to have a few more years of production history.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors", "Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys. Most of my questions are answered, but if I could just \u2013 I couldn't stop but notice your impressive results in the Second Bone Spring in White City. But if I understand correctly, you're probably not going to do much on it for the rest of the year. Is that a component of HBP there and no need to go back there?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yes. It is held by production, and our need to go back there is our need to generate top tier returns and it's about the best in our portfolio. I will say this, as I've said repeatedly, our current plan is a snapshot in time and if we were to accelerate activity, I think you'd find that to be a strong contender for increased activity. We're ready to go there and those wells are phenomenal.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Got you. And as you think about the second half of the year, sort of more held up by Cana \u2013 Cana's program, what's the extent of longer laterals \u2013 the longer laterals that you're going to drill there? What's the percentage of other wells that you're going to drill on long laterals?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John. Clearly, Tom talked about this, how we leverage off each region. And clearly, based on our experience now in Culberson, we've gotten extremely comfortable as a company in terms of drilling and completing long laterals. So we haven't \u2013 but done but one of those 10,000 foot laterals in Woodford so far, although we have a few 7,500. But without a doubt, we have areas now where we have a large acreage position that we operate and control where we envision long laterals being our go-to method for developing that acreage. We're not there yet, we still talk internally about it; but we do make plans that eventually we will be developing with 10,000 foot laterals in the Woodford. Because again, we've gained great confidence in our ability to do that based on our experience in the Permian.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And then to follow-up on John's comment, I want to just remind our listeners, at our Meramec program, the wells we've announced, are all 5,000 foot long horizontal wells and you will be comparing those with competitor wells that are largely 10,000 foot long horizontal wells. We've \u2013 are just in the process of our first 10,000 foot long Meramec well and we're very, very interested to see what that will generate.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Yeah, that's great color. But would you be drilling any longer lateral Woodford wells in the second half?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "As of today, we don't have any definitive plans, but plans can change. I mean we are talking about, quite frankly, maybe one or two where we further delineate our acreage with 10,000 foot laterals, but nothing has been approved just yet.", "Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC", "Great. The rest all sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Your previous production guidance that assumed CapEx at the low end of the range. How should we view the latest production guidance relative to CapEx and how much flexibility is built into production and CapEx?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Yeah. This is Joe. We've done the same this go-round as we did last. So what we've really done is just incorporate the first quarter well results that we've had and our projected timing and anticipated volumes for the remaining part of the year with the same budget.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's the low end of the range.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "It's the low end of the range.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And we've \u2013 although we're always updating our projection based on our latest well results. Some of the improvements we've made, we're modeling in in our projection, but we're testing a lot of things, and we don't have any future improvements modeled in. We're modeling current CapEx and current well performance.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. So just to be clear there, there's no acceleration or anything assumed; it's just the current program of six rigs running forward for the rest of the year and that's the production.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct. Low end of our range and 900 MMcfe is our guidance.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "And as we talked about last call, because our (01:00:20) had a couple of questions on this already, the profile itself is such that we see a peak in our total company production here in Q2 as we roll off the Permian completions and then into Q3, we start to pick up the Cana completions that give us a boost in the latter half of the year. So \u2013 and that's obviously implied when you look at our Q2 guidance versus our current forecast for our full year guidance.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And would we expect a production mix shift between gas and oil as we head into the back half of the year of a material amount given the change to the Cana projects?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Ironically enough, our Q4% gas was running around 49% and we'll end up there this year, at around 49%. We'll have some \u2013 a little bit of a dip in there in Q3 as we transfer out of the Permian into the \u2013 into Cana.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. That's all for me. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.", "Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Keith. So I guess we'd just like to thank everybody for participating in the call and please let us know if you have any further questions. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen Acierno. Please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno", "Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year conference call. In addition to last year\u2019s results, today, we will be discussing our 2016 capital plans, which were released separately yesterday afternoon. An updated presentation has been posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during the call today.", "As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "So today\u2019s prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, Senior VP of Exploration; and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Cimarex CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.", "So with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Jorden", "Thank you, Karen and thanks to everyone who is participating in today\u2019s conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. On the call today, John will give a rundown of our recent results and update you on some of the delineation that we have underway in 2016. Joe will provide an operational overview.", "I would like to kick off the call with some overview remarks in our direction in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, we put a lot of energy into long-range planning and we developed capabilities for running detailed iterations on current and future year\u2019s CapEx, cash flow and balance sheet configuration. We scrubbed our assets and developed net asset value models that help us to fully understand our upside and plan accordingly. Today, we are making decisions for 2016 with a close eye on 2017, 2018 and beyond. Cimarex is better positioned for the future by slowing down a bit, preserving our cash and assets and living within our means.", "Our focus is on preservation of our assets and balance sheet. We don\u2019t have any special insight on when or how commodity prices will recover. We do know that we will probably be as surprised by the recovery as we were by the collapse. When prices recover, Cimarex will be ready and will be stronger and healthier as ever. We have never been more bullish on our assets, our inventory and our organizational capability. Our Delaware Basin and Meramec Woodford assets are top tier. We continue to be pleased with our well results and associated returns on investment.", "On the call today, you will hear updates on our Wolfcamp spacing pilots and the implications for future development. We continue to be extremely pleased with our Wolfcamp well performance and have room to run in achieving further performance improvements. You will hear an update on the Meramec Woodford spacing pilot that is underway in Cana. We are testing a combined 19 wells per section in the Meramec and Woodford. The Meramec continues to surprise to the upside. We are currently flowing back Woodford spacing pilots that are testing 10 and 12 Woodford wells per section. Results are very encouraging. Furthermore, our improved Woodford results are showing remarkable consistency across the Cana core. In both the Delaware and Woodford Meramec, long horizontal wells are an increasingly important part of our story and our assets are well configured to allow for them. We have a manageable lease exploration issue and we will preserve all of our prime acreage.", "In spite of the downturn of activity, we are emphasizing our core strengths in idea generation and innovation. Our teams are hard at work developing new plays and new concepts. During the downturn of 2009, our activity level dropped from 43 operated rigs to 3. At that time, we challenged the organization to be innovative, creative and to find ways to make a living in spite of the downturn. We were not victims. During 2008, we developed plays that were going to carry us in the ensuing years and are still among our core programs today. In 2016, our challenge to organization is to do it again. We are built for these times however difficult they may be. We will make the tough decisions around capital investments and activity levels. We will remain disciplined and preserve our assets and the deep inventory that is our future. We will also seek to build new things and to take advantage of this downturn. No one is hanging their head at Cimarex. We are hard at work to control our own destiny.", "I recently heard a CEO describe some advice that one of his board members have given him. The board member was a retired military officer who told the CEO that he had always told his troops that, when the map doesn\u2019t match the terrain, go with the terrain. Here at Cimarex, we are going with the terrain. During 2015, we increased our rig count to a high of 12 rigs, with an original plan to keep 12 operated rigs throughout 2016. As the year wore on and the commodity outlook continued to worsen, we determined that a 12-rig program was no longer prudent. Although we have the inventory to justify the higher activity level even at current prices, we have decided to slow down and preserve our cash on hand. Production growth will have to take a backseat to flexibility and balance sheet preservation.", "Our focus is on a multi-year outlook. We currently have 11 operated rigs running and will be decreasing our rig count to 4 rigs in the coming months. Our 2016 program is designed to preserve our assets on leasehold and finish out some delineation and spacing pilots that are underway. We plan to invest between $600 million and $650 million in exploration and development. The range of investment is driven by timing of completions in one of the projects currently underway, the Woodford infill well in the eastern core of Cana. Whatever we do not spend in 2016 will be pushed into early 2017. We will also continue to delineate the Meramec drill spacing tests in the Wolfcamp and the Delaware Basin and hold leasehold.", "In the fourth quarter of 2015, we were impacted by severe weather events and took direct hits at both the Western Delaware Basin and in our core Cana field. Furthermore, a planned outage in Delaware Basin added to our problems. I cannot overstate how pleased we were with the response to these events by our organization. Although they had a significant impact in our production volumes, our teams worked valiantly and safely in extremely hostile conditions in order to restore our production and find creative workarounds to market interruptions. These extraordinary actions don\u2019t always evidence themselves in top line reported production numbers, but they humble us and make us deeply proud to be part of an organization that is so dedicated and focused.", "With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide further details on our program.", "John Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I will start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $191 million during the fourth quarter on exploration and development. This brought the total to $877 million for the full year. About 55% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 65 gross, 28 net wells on production during the quarter, which brought the total for 2015 to 219 gross, 99 net wells.", "Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. In the Permian, we completed 2 upper Wolfcamp wells in the fourth quarter using a larger stimulation. As you can see on Slide 14 of our presentation, these wells have seen a 34% higher cumulative production in the first 120 days versus the previous upper Wolfcamp wells. In fact, one of the wells, Mine That Bird 38 Unit #1-H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 2,020 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 51% was gas, 30% -- excuse me, 51% oil, 30% gas and 19% NGL, a record IP from a 7,500-foot Upper Wolfcamp lateral in Culberson County.", "As discussed previously, we spudded downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp and Culberson County in the fourth quarter. Drilling on these wells will be finished this month with completion scheduled to begin in April. First production is expected by the end of May. This 6-well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test two different spacing designs, one testing 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. The larger completion I just discussed will be used on this pilot.", "For the rest of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6, 2-mile long infill wells in Reeves County. These infill wells are located next to our Big Timber well, the best Wolfcamp well we have drilled in Reeves County. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stack staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. We currently have 6 rigs running in the Permian, with one of them drilling a saltwater disposal well in Culberson County. By June, we will be down to 2 rigs for the remainder of the year.", "Now, on to the Mid-Continent, you will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford row 4 infill development program in the fourth quarter of 2014. Completions on the seven sections are now finished and all 57 gross wells are producing. Cimarex operated two of these sections. Typical development in the Woodford calls for eight new wells in addition to the parent well on a section. The Armacost section was infilled with nine additional wells, while the Philip section was infilled with 11 new wells. For the Armacost section, the average 30-day peak production was 9.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 61% gas, 8% oil, 31% NGL. And the Philips wells produced an average 30-day peak rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 54% gas, 13% oil, 33% NGL.", "As you can see on Slide 20 of our presentation, these increased density infill sections are performing very similar to previously infill Woodford sections with only eight new wells, a very encouraging result for us. In the fourth quarter 2015, we commenced drilling another Woodford infill well in the East side of the core. This development covers six sections, of which Cimarex again operates two sections. The entire infill project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Depending on the timing of completions, something that will be worked out with our partner, production from this East Cana development was expected to come online as early as October or perhaps as late as the first quarter of 2017. In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 17 operate at 5,000 foot laterals. In addition, our second 10,000 foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early October. This well, called the Vessels 1H-3526x have a 30-day peak IP rate of 14 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 791 barrels of oil per day.", "Page 22 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we have seen from the two long laterals versus the 5,000 foot laterals drilled to-date. We have outperformed the shorter laterals by 69% within 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we are seeing in these 10,000 foot laterals, we will be carefully monitoring the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long lateral wells.", "To better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have designed a down-spacing pilot which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015. See Slide 23 for an illustration of this design. Due to the commodity price environment, this pilot has been downsized, will now consist of eight new wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing at the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of five upper and five lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard nine wells per section development plan. Drilling should be finished by mid-April with first production expected late in the second quarter. Once drilling is finished on the pilot and infill sections, we will be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. Since late 2014, we have added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. We will need to drill approximately 40 to 45 wells over the next 3 years in order to HBP our position. In 2016, we will drill 12 operated wells to hold this acreage position, with 10 of the 12 wells being 10,000 foot laterals. We currently have five rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region, with plans to go down to one rig by July of this year.", "With that, I will turn the call over to the Joe Albi.", "Joe Albi", "Well, thank you, John and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I will touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I will finish with a few comments on LOE and service costs. Our fourth quarter total company net equivalent production came in at 985.7 million a day, up 4% from the 949.5 million a day that we posted in Q4 \u201814 and within our guidance of 0.98 Bcfe to 1.01 Bcfe per day. Late in the quarter, as Tom mentioned, winter weather and facility disruptions negatively impacted our production by approximately 30 million cubic feet a day equivalent, with the majority of that occurring in the Permian. Late December winter storms caused significant downtime in not only the Delaware Basin, but also impacted our Cana production as well, albeit to a lesser degree. When we adjust for the estimated impact of the weather and the facility downtime, we would have exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than 5 million a day. With Q4 now in the books, our full year 2015 equivalent production came in at 985 million a day. That\u2019s up 13% over our 2014 average of 869 million a day.", "During Q4, our Permian equivalent production averaged 520 million a day. That\u2019s down 42 million a day from Q3 \u201815. But as I mentioned, a significant portion of the decrease was a result of not only the \u2013 was a result of the weather and facility downtime, but we also completed fewer Permian wells during the latter half of the year than we did in the first half as we talked about in our previous call. As expected, with our Cana-Woodford wells coming online, we saw a very nice bump in our Q4 Mid-Continent production, with our Mid-Continent volumes coming in at 461 million a day. That\u2019s up 14% or 56 million a day from the 405 million a day that we reported just prior in Q3.", "For 2016, with a number of moving parts, the most sensitive of which is the timing of our 2016 completions. We have issued full year total company equivalent production guidance of 890 million to 930 million equivalents per day. With our focus on preserving our assets and protecting our balance sheet and the low price environment we are in, we have opted to slowdown and more consistently spread out our completion activity throughout the year. As John mentioned, we also find ourselves needing to coordinate the timing of our Cana-Woodford completion activity with the completion timing of our offset operator. As a result, there is considerable variability in the inventory of uncompleted wells that we will have on the books at the end of the year.", "As we best can project at this time, we anticipate and we have modeled that our Cana infill fracking operations will begin in late the third \u2013 late third to fourth quarter and continue into 2017 with first production from the project not hitting our books until early 2017. This program represents a lion share of our 2016 Mid-Continent activity, consisting of 50 gross and 23 net wells. With our current modeling, we expect to see first production from approximately 50 gross or 16 net Mid-Continent wells during \u201816 and that\u2019s down from 134 gross or 39 net wells that we completed in 2015. With the anticipated Cana infill completion delay, we expect to exit the year the 57 gross or 24 net wells awaiting completion, hence moving associated production for those wells into early 2017.", "In the Permian, we also plan for a slower place of completion activity, which will likely only require us to utilize just one completion crew the majority of the year. We are forecasting approximately 31 net Permian wells to come online in 2016, that\u2019s down about half of the 60 net wells that we completed in 2015. As we progress through the year, we project a number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells to increase to approximately 18 net wells by mid-year and then drop off to just six net wells by the end of the year, primarily a result of us dropping to the two rigs that John mentioned in the Permian in the middle of the year.", "I want to take a moment to make a special point that a quick glance at our 2016 full year guidance could very easily imply a decline in our 2016 exit rate. What\u2019s not so easy to see is the forecast of production increase associated with the delayed Cana infill programs back to back completion activity in early 2017, which along with a handful of Permian carryover completions is forecasted to bring our total company production back up to Q4 \u201815 levels by as early as Q2 \u201817. It\u2019s all about the timing of our completions. As far as our Q1 total company production is concerned, incorporating anticipated Permian pipeline and facility curtailments of about 30 million a day for the first quarter, our projected guidance for Q1 comes in at 925 million to 955 million a day.", "Jumping over to CapEx, with our production group\u2019s continued focus on trimming operating costs, our Q4 lifting costs came in at $0.85 per Mcfe. That\u2019s in line with our guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 and was down 19% from the $1.05 that we posted in Q4 \u201814. For the year, our 2015 lifting costs came in at $0.83 per Mcfe, that\u2019s down a respectable 23% from our 2014 average of $1.08. As we look forward into 2016, our full year lifting cost guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe takes into account our regional forecasts of production mix as well as the variable nature of work over expenses. You may have also noted that our Q4 \u201815 transportation and processing expenses came in at $0.58, so slightly above our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55. As I mentioned, our current production modeling forecast a slowdown in our completion activity during the year, which resulted in a one-time accrual of approximately $8 million for anticipated minimum volume agreement shortfalls, which increased our reported cost on a non-recurring basis by approximately $0.09 per Mcfe.", "We have made great strides cutting our LOE and we will continue our efforts to reduce them further. As we mentioned last call, the important by-product of our LOE reductions is the additional funding we are providing our drilling program. Our Q4 \u201815 average monthly LOE came in at $25.7 million a month and that\u2019s $5 million below our Q4 \u201814 average of $30.7 million a month. But if we average over 12-months time period, has freed up nearly $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.", "A few comments on our drilling and completion cost. Although we continue to push hard for further cost relief, any cost reductions we have seen have been small, single-digit reductions and modest in nature. That said, we continue our focus on operating efficiencies. On the drilling side, we have high-graded our rigs. We are fitting out each and every service. We are consolidating our equipment and resources everywhere we can. All the while we are staying focused on reducing drilling days. On the completion side, we are focused on optimizing the cost of water sourcing by more efficiently fracing our wells, in particular, when we are completing multi-well pads. The bottom line is that while we continue to experience \u2013 experiment with various frac designs, our generic well AFEs have remained relatively flat.", "Our current Cana core one-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million. That\u2019s unchanged from last call. While in the Meramec, our current one-mile lateral AFE is in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. That\u2019s also unchanged from last quarter. In the Permian, as we have mentioned last call, we have made great progress with our drilling efficiencies, cutting our Wolfcamp two-mile lateral spud to rig release times down 20% from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015, with a record of 20.5 days. We are accomplishing similar drill time reductions in our one-mile lateral Bone Spring and Avalon program as well cutting average days from spud to rig release 35% from 23 days in \u201814 to just \u201815 in Q4 \u201815. We continue to get more done with fewer rigs. And with all that, our current two-mile lateral Wolfcamp AFE is running $10.8 million to $11.6 million. That\u2019s flat again to the figures we quoted last call.", "So in closing, we had another great quarter. We fought up significant Q4 downstream weather \u2013 downtime to stay within guidance and provide us with a strong springboard for production in 2016. We posted solid year-over-year production gains over 2014. We have made significant strides cutting our LOE. Our drilling group stays focused on cost reductions and efficiencies. And as an organization, we remain vigilant to keep our cost in check, protect our assets and optimize our investment program results.", "So with that, I will turn the call over to question-and-answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dan Guffey of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Guffey, please go ahead. Your phone maybe muted.", "Dan Guffey", "Sorry about that. Good morning, everyone.", "Tom Jorden", "Good morning.", "Mark Burford", "Good morning.", "Dan Guffey", "In the past, you guys have conveyed budgetary snapshot of the current environment and the company does remain flexible. I guess key question here is, at what price would you want to bring rigs back, obviously, with the extreme volatility in crude, it may make that decision a little more cumbersome? But just curious when you think you would add rigs back since you do have some of the lowest cost production throughout the U.S.?", "Tom Jorden", "This is Tom. That\u2019s a great question. Mark, I am going to \u2013 I will pass that to you. We have run tons of models and it\u2019s hard to make a definitive statement. I will say this so before Mark comments, we remain highly flexible. And if we see daylight, we are going to run for it. Obviously, in building a company and preserving a balance sheet, you can have all kinds of optimism, but you can\u2019t run a company on that optimism to the extent that you are not preserving your balance sheet. But Mark, you know how to answer it?", "Mark Burford", "Dan, surely what Tom referred to is we are on the two primary concerns we have right now watching our return on our investments making sure we get adequate return which isn\u2019t the highest \u2013 isn\u2019t the biggest concern more was not preserving our balance sheet. So, we have cash flow sufficient to really support our larger program, which we are really trying to constrain our investment to make sure we preserve a very strong balance sheet, preserve our cash position and a better way to do this. So, I think if you saw price environment settling in around $45 to $50, you could probably see us have the cash flow supporting a larger program. But at the low $30 environment we find ourselves in and that\u2019s where we are constraining our investment to the extent we are, but there is \u2013 it probably have to be some clarity \u2013 certainty around that $45 to $55 for us to see that to make some upward adjustments in our investment page.", "Dan Guffey", "Okay. I guess, are there any limiting factors in terms of how quickly you could add whether that be personal or infrastructure? And then I guess, what area would your first few incremental rigs target should we get to that $40 to $50 environment?", "Joe Albi", "Well, this is Joe. As far as our organization is concerned, we can act quickly. And depending on where we are drilling, if it\u2019s in and along our existing infrastructure, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. You got to remember that we had a bigger plan scheduled and modeled as far as our organizational activity and we just paired back from it. So, getting back on the track should not be that difficult for us. We took a rig out of the yard. We have got to ask that question last year and we took a rig out of the yard that on its first wells start setting records for us. So, we are not terribly concerned about our ability to ramp up. And I would anticipate that our first place to ramp up would be the Permian.", "John Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. Without a doubt, we are ready to go. Our Upper Wolfcamp wells in Culberson, as I talked about earlier, are really coming in performing very well. And we\u2019d love to get back to drilling into that program beyond just the spacing pilot I talked about. Our long lateral Bone Spring play, up in White City, is very, very strong economics. And even part of our Woodford development in the Eastern core, which is more liquid-rich, especially as we look at it from a long lateral perspective, which our acreage allows us to do looks pretty attractive to us, but we would like to see a little bit more encouragement from the commodity price before we want to go and deploy capital in those programs.", "Tom Jorden", "Yes. And I just want to finish your question, but I don\u2019t want to throw a marker down that\u2019s $45 oil price. If we see a recovery in oil price, it looks better and better to us. So, I would even say if prices get north of $35 and our outlook is stronger, we are going to look at it. I don\u2019t want to throw any particular number down and say, that\u2019s the number. We have the flexibility. We have the balance sheet to do it. And it\u2019s going to be what our vision is. I mean, if there were some structural changes in all markets and the reason for long-term optimism, we would be prepared to act to that.", "Dan Guffey", "Okay, great. Thanks for the details. Last one for me, can you guys discuss if you still you have reached or surpassed the productive and economic limits of enhanced completions across your various areas throughout the Permian and the Mid-Con?", "John Lambuth", "Well, this is John and the very simple answer is no. In no way that we feel like we have reached the limits. We constantly are debating entirely about all the different components that go in at our frac design. And quite frankly, I am constantly amazed how certain tweaks lead to even better and better wells. So no, we are not at all feel like we have reached a point where we can get even more reserves out of these laterals. And quite honestly, that\u2019s some of our charge right now, given the environment we find for every dollar we invest in those wells, we need to get more out of those wells. And so far, I have been very pleased and that we have been able to achieve that with a number of our programs.", "Tom Jorden", "Yes. And I want to \u2013 this is Tom, I want to follow up to that. John and I started off first thing this morning at 7 o\u2019clock in my office arguing about just this thing, not arguing with one another, arguing the point that one of the nice things about having assets and through the most active prolific areas of the country is there is a lot of activity. And we study our competition really hard. It\u2019s pretty important if you are going to have an innovative culture you can\u2019t have and needs to be invented here mentality. And so we are always looking to see what others are doing. And I think we have a lot of room for improvement, I would say in both our corridors, the Delaware Basin and Meramec. There is lots of things others are doing that, yes, we have opinions on, but at the end of the day, some of this is just trial and error and we need to try some things.", "Dan Guffey", "Thanks for the color, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "David Deckelbaum", "Good morning, Tom and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, good morning.", "David Deckelbaum", "Just to follow up on all the commentary. Tom, in your opening remarks, you said you are looking very closely at \u201816, \u201817 and \u201818 as I guess putting some color around that, is it looking closely at what sort of goals would you like to achieve at the field level, looking closely at what your debt metrics are, looking closely at how much cash you have or a production growth scenario?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, you kind of run through the gamut there. We are not changing our logo. So we can take that one off the table. As we look ahead, I think the industry is having a sobering reset and I would love to sit here in the call, put lipstick on and say, you know what, it\u2019s one thing. But as you look ahead in running a company, we have to look at the ins and outs of cash flow balance. And so we look into what \u2013 I said in my opening remarks, we spent a lot of time last year looking at our assets and looking at the future drilling inventory and the value that adds. And we have made a tremendous amount of progress on our flexibility and our ability to do real-time modeling of future increases in price, future increases in activity and actually modeling the impact that has fully looking at our cash flow and our balance sheet. But when you do that, one of the reasons that we are doing that is because if prices don\u2019t pick up at any point, we want to make sure that Cimarex stays healthy and stays competitive. And we don\u2019t want to put ourselves in a situation where we have lost our flexibly. So inherently, that modeling is kind of a downside model. It\u2019s really easy to run an upside model. But you have to kind of plan of the downside. And so we are \u2013 as we look ahead to the next few years, I will say that if things don\u2019t materially improve over the current strip, Cimarex will be just fine. We will be healthy financially and we will be in a position where we attempt to throttle into that future without increasing debt. But if things increase, if commodity prices pick up, we are ready to roll. I know I am not giving you \u2013 I am not giving you detailed answer on what our 2017 and beyond model looks like, but we are making decisions to keep Cimarex competitive and to preserve our assets. Mark, do you want to add to that?", "Mark Burford", "Yes. Let me try, Tom. When you look at the different scenarios David, it\u2019s obviously some bookings were using strip influences a lot of our thinking right now in the four strips in the low 40s through \u201817 and only $45 by \u201818 our recent stripping holding. And looking what our activity levels could be at those different price decks preserving our balance sheet strength and seeing what fits within that cash flow without really having occurred in preserving some portion of our cash balance and not incurring incremental debt what we can look like into those future years. And it is current strip environment, low-40s, it\u2019s been 30s are challenging for us to find a [indiscernible], with our cash flow can support our pace of development. So there are lot of iterations we are running all the time, looking at different sensitivities on different programs. And then given \u2013 as Joe remarked in his comments even for this year have been impacted to a thorough completions can have a very big impacts on our timing of our production thing. So we are running on iterations just looking at what the outlook could be for this year and for the years out.", "David Deckelbaum", "I appreciate all the clarity around that. There is one more if I might, I know John you reminded all of us about LOE might not be appreciating the amount of production that can come on from 50 Cana wells and the infill towards the end of the year beginning of next. And you said 2Q of \u201817 could be back up to the levels of 4Q \u201815 conceptually. You are running four other rigs total, much of that is for HBP and acreage. So as you think about going into 2017 and 2018, is \u2013 would future rig activity or incremental rig activity be devoted to doing a very large pad our multi-section developments where we would have this sort of persistent lumpiness until things smooth out where you have a larger rig fleet that\u2019s called up everything?", "John Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. I think it\u2019s safe to say that when we reach that point that we want to get back towards true development drilling, then certainly that\u2019s going to lead towards that high intensity rigs and pads and so forth. But we just don\u2019t know at one point we will be back there. Here is what I know. I know for this year and going forward, our main goal, as Tom alluded to, is both the balance sheet and more importantly protecting investments we made in the acreage that we picked up in both the Anadarko as well as the Permian Basin. We have wonderful acreage and we have gotten it at a very attractive price and essentially for this year\u2019s program, as we go up to the end of the year, that\u2019s where our capital is going to be geared towards is preserving that acreage position so that we are in a very good position. Whenever the time is right, then go back to that full scale development, when that will be, I can\u2019t tell you at this point.", "David Deckelbaum", "Okay. I appreciate all the answers guys. It\u2019s all for me.", "Tom Jorden", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jeanine Wai", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Tom Jorden", "Hi Jeanine.", "Jeanine Wai", "Can you talk a little bit about your forecasted out-spend for 2016 on whenever price deck you are using, it sounds like the strip, there appears to be a fair amount of non-D&C spend that might be driving some of the out-spend?", "Mark Burford", "Hi, Janine, this is Mark here. Yes. So in our 2016 out-spend about $600 million, $650 million of capital using a recent strip price around $34, $2.20 gas. We are looking at coming in the year with $539million of cash. We are looking exiting the year somewhere around $400 million of cash add back to \u201816.", "Jeanine Wai", "And can you give a little bit of clarity on what that non-D&C is?", "Mark Burford", "Yes. So the non-D&C drilling is comprised of about $35 million. We are targeting for the lease-hold acquisition, about $120 million roughly for capitalized overhead, it was about $40 million for production capital or at least for our production group capital for the re-completion and well maintenance, eight wells.", "Jeanine Wai", "Okay, great. And then I know that you have mentioned that IRR is not the only factor in determining activity for this year, but can you give us a little sense of whether you have an after tax IRR hurdle in this environment or kind of what the after tax returns are on some of the plays that you mentioned that are performing very well in the current environment?", "John Lambuth", "Well, this is John. And yes, we always have on our way to return hurdles. They are a little bit challenging right now. What we find ourselves \u2013 I guess what I find myself doing, there has been a lot of time looking at just flat price returns, I just don\u2019t spend much time looking at strip right now. And then we look at those flat prices and we ask ourselves, is this a good investment. Especially these wells we are drilling to hold acreage. And in this environment, it\u2019s tough, I will admit. But when we look at that and look at the future potential of that section we are holding, we still feel like we are making a very good investment in drilling those wells. So right now again, we definitely look at the IRR and quite frankly, that means some of the acreage that we have will not be held because no matter what scenario, whatever flat price I look at, it\u2019s hard to envision how holding a certain set of acreage is in the best interest of Cimarex. That said, we have a lot of good acreage to hold there on and I am very pleased with that.", "Tom Jorden", "Janine, this is Tom. We run everything currently down to around $30 NYMEX oil and $2 NYMEX gas held flat forever. So those are index prices, and then we will deduct whatever market deduct to get back to the wellhead. And we would like to see our cost of capital are better at that flat price. And then we will also look at the strip. And let me just answer your question this way. If we were forced to increase activity and we had an A-tax 25% hurdle rate. We have lots to do in our portfolio. If we weren\u2019t tasked with holding acreage and we can just go drill at will and there were no other considerations, when we look at these long laterals in the Wolfcamp, the long laterals in the Cana, Meramec play, we have lots of them that generate, what I would say, are acceptable returns at current strip. But as John said, we have a lot of considerations currently. We don\u2019t think prices will stay here forever. We have some outstanding acreage that we would like to hold, not all of which can be developed with long laterals. We have partner considerations. And then we also have some science that we want to get done that will really set up the future. So it\u2019s a balancing act. One thing that we will not do, one thing we will absolutely not do is liquidate this company because we are in a $30 oil environment. So we are going to make judgment calls as we see fit.", "Jeanine Wai", "Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew Venker", "Good morning everyone.", "Tom Jorden", "Hi Drew.", "Drew Venker", "If you could provide some clarity just on that you are targeting a leverage ratio or if you are still thinking about spending the remainder of the secondary offering proceeds or how you are setting the budget really?", "Mark Burford", "Drew, this is Mark. As I mentioned, what we are looking at planning for \u201816 right now, with our current $600 million, $650 million of cash, capital plan for \u201816 and the recent strip price forecast for cash flow, we think we would use up from December 739 million we exited \u201815 with net debt of \u201816 out $400 million of cash in the balance sheet. So no, we didn\u2019t expect to use remainder of the proceeds in \u201816 and we are going to see how the environment flattens out before we get that activity further, but no, we do not plan to use in \u201816 and then even in \u201817 we are still looking at different scenarios now and what pace will be in \u201817.", "Drew Venker", "Mark is there a target leverage ratio or is that not really a primary consideration?", "Mark Burford", "Drew, we really have one financial covenant, which really in our credit facility which the debt to cap covenant, which is limited to debt cap of 65% and we exited the fourth quarter of 35%. And going into \u201816, we don\u2019t see us having any issue of that covenant, even with potential future impairments, which are likely with the fact that prices are continuing to still \u2013 drilling 12 months average is still declining through \u201816, but we will have to watch that metric. Our debt to EBITDA metric typically would have been 1.5x or less, but with \u2013 in our dropping commodity prices, that metric is obviously more challenging and the exit year 12-month price debt-to-EBITDA of 1.9x. Going into \u201816, we expect that probably likely will go into low 3s or so into \u201816 with EBITDA still falling lower prices.", "Drew Venker", "Okay, alright. That\u2019s helpful color.", "Mark Burford", "Because they are in fact thrilled, we have a covenant that we have to watch carefully, Drew, with the rest of the covenants. We just \u2013 we were projected as basically we are not in fact expect incurring incremental debt in this environment and indeed in the future for some time. We expect to just have the $1.5 billion of senior secured notes outstanding. We don\u2019t expect any bank borrowings in the near future.", "Tom Jorden", "Drew, it\u2019s Tom. I want to be clear and I think I have been, but we have actually made this tactical decision to try to keep as much cash on our balance sheet so that we are well positioned when this situation turns around. We think that the best activity level for Cimarex in 2016 is preservation mode. We want to make sure we preserve our assets, we preserve our obligations and we preserve our flexibility. But our goal is to keep as much cash as we can on the balance sheet as we look ahead so that we are well-positioned to strike when we see some daylight.", "Drew Venker", "Right. Yes, that all makes sense, I think. I guess, and along that vein, does it make sense to layer on hedges albeit I realized the forward curve is not really where you would like it to be but maybe for you and for 2017? Is that \u2013 does that make sense strategically?", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, Drew, we have for sometime now. We are working towards having a quarterly progression in our hedging program. And we did take steps in the first quarter, hedged 40 million a day for 15 months for second quarter of \u201816 to second quarter of \u201817. And that was a layer that we will put in is targeting on about 10% of our four production roughly in that neighborhood. And we look at it again. And we were targeting 4,000, 5,000 barrels a day of oil would be our target for the first quarter. Other, as you mentioned a forward strip in oil prevented us from taking that step on oil, but each quarter, we are going to look at that forward projection on our volumes and look at clearing maybe 10% on our volumes each quarter and over a period of time, when you hope to get to about 50%, our volume covered. But we have been inhibited by low oil price for taking that step on oil.", "Drew Venker", "Okay. If I could circle back on the new Wolfcamp A completions, is the plan to implement that new style on the rest of your program? I know you said you would use it on the density pilot, but all of you are drilling in 2016, is that applicable to the Wolfcamp C and D as well?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. Well, it\u2019s certainly applicable to come up with the next new innovation on it, yes, I mean, we plan to use that current design on that spacing pilot. We have a little bit different design for the lower grades. Suffice it to say that, even with that design, as we talked earlier with one of the earlier questions, we are still looking to see how we can even improve upon that, to be honest, very pleased with the results from that frac design. What I really like about those wells and we are looking at the other day is just how well they are holding in over time from a decline perspective. I mean, they are very attractive wells for us. But again, it doesn\u2019t mean that, that\u2019s where we are going to stay \u2013 standstill with that design, we are going to keep asking ourselves, how can we make it even better as we go forward?", "Drew Venker", "And John, how do the returns compete with the rest of the portfolio assuming that this uplift is repeatable?", "John Lambuth", "Well, I can simply tell you we look at our programs, we look at different flat prices like the one Tom mentioned. And certainly right now, the two-mile Upper Wolfcamp and Culberson in that area is one of our top tier programs right now, especially with the most recent well results. So, it looks very, very good to us. And we are very anxious to get that spacing pilot in, so we can start to hone in on exactly what the full potential is for that zone for us from a development standpoint.", "Drew Venker", "Great. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Matt Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.", "Matt Portillo", "Good morning, everyone.", "Tom Jorden", "Hi, Matt.", "Mark Burford", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt Portillo", "Just a couple of quick clarification questions, on the theoretical 2017 production with the timing of the Cana completions, I just wanted to see you clarify when thinking about the exit rate Q4 \u201815 of about $985 million a day, would the thought be that with the Cana completions, the total corporate production could reach that level again by kind of Q2 2017 if everything kind of stays on plan as you guys envision it at the moment? ", "Joe Albi", "Yes, Matt, this is Joe. I will answer that. What we have modeled is kind of the worst case where that production doesn\u2019t start until the first half or first part of \u201817. And in that scenario, we are about up to the same corporate total company levels by Q2 \u201817. And if we speed up things, we might find ourselves in maybe the Q1 time period. So again, it\u2019s all timing. And somebody with their questions alluded to the fact that these are big projects, you have got multiple wells all coming on at once. And you saw what roll forward did for us from Q3 to Q4, significant increase in our Cana production, from 405 \u2013 Mid-Continent from $405 million to $461 million a day. So, those are big swings. You can see the difference between the Q4 \u2013 if you imply a Q4 exit rate with a typical decline or whatever, you might think we are going to be in the high 800s. And all of a sudden, two quarters later, we are 100 million a day higher than that. So, it\u2019s just the nature of the beast and it\u2019s all about timing.", "Matt Portillo", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the second question on 2016 guidance, I was hoping that you potentially could provide a little bit of clarity around the midstream impact and the curtailments, I think you guys alluded to some of those still impacting Q1, but was curious how that\u2019s impacted your full year expectations as well. And any color or timing on when those may ultimately reverse here?", "Joe Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. I will answer that one as well. The gist of it is we are modeling that is going to transpire here in Q1. We have been able to work some other marketing arrangements in and around the downstream curtailment that we have right now and hope to have those plus the remedy itself of the facility that was impacted with the fire that you are aware of. I will finalize by March, late March. And then of course, we have our Hidalgo plant coming on not too far after that and then there is a number of other processing alternatives that are on the map and pretty close to completion that we feel like mid to late this year, we are going to be in very good shape.", "Matt Portillo", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jason Smith", "Hey, good morning everyone.", "Tom Jorden", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Smith", "So, Tom, the Meramec vessels, well, I think it was a ways away from your other vessels in the Meramec. And I know you have the down-spacing pilot this year, but any plans to test the flanks of your acreage position there at all in 2016? And also just curious if you have any near-term HBP requirements, I guess, outside of what you consider your de-risked area?", "John Lambuth", "Yes, this is John. Yes, we will be testing quite a bit of extension acreage throughout the Meramec. Part of that will be to essentially hold our acreage. A part of it also would be delineation. We are still constantly surprised, not just by our results, but as Tom alluded to, a lot of competitor results that are kind of changing the landscape within the map in the Meramec. And it\u2019s given us some encouragement, especially as we look more to the Western side is looking much more attractive to us. Unfortunately for us, we have a pretty nice position over there. In fact, that\u2019s where lot of the new leasing that we have picked up is in more of that area. So yes, throughout the rest of this year will be geographically spreading across that map quite a bit with the wells that we would be drilling and that will just help us further delineate the full potential for this interval.", "Tom Jorden", "Jason, it\u2019s Tom. Just let me follow-up on that. One of the things that we are seeing in the Meramec is a fair variability, but also a fair availability of results with landing zone. Landing zone seems to have a fairly strong impact in a way that has surprised as compared to the Woodford below it. And so I think as we go forward, you are probably going to hear us talking more and more about the Mississippi as opposed to the Meramec that some of the lower section, you hear the Osage being talked about as the target. And that\u2019s looking more and more interesting to us. There are some really good wells out there that are hard to explain if you only have the Meramec to explain it with. And so as John said, there is a tremendous amount of upside for us not only in our acreage but also operational improvements as we test landing zones and then also completions. We are pretty bullish on that play right now and our position. And although we generally read competition everywhere, there is some competition out there that\u2019s giving us a lot of good information and it\u2019s just shining a very positive light on our position.", "Jason Smith", "Thanks for that detail. And my follow-up is a little bit different direction here. The dividend is now a lot bigger part of your cash flow at current prices, you obviously have the cash on your balance sheet to cover it, but just curious on your thoughts around where it fits and the benefits of maintaining at current levels?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, we are committed to dividend. We have got some very long-term owners that for whom it\u2019s important. I will say, I was expecting that call because I know so many of our peers in their end of your late release had addressed their dividend. We have a Board meeting next week and that\u2019s certainly going to been an active topic with the Board and we will make decision around what\u2019s appropriate.", "Jason Smith", "Thanks Tom. I appreciate that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Michael Hall", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Tom Jorden", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Hall", "I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little additional granularity around the planned completions in the 2016 program outside of these kind of key projects that you have highlighted. First in the Permian, outside of the Tim Tam and the Reeves County infill, I guess you talked about 31 completions coming out through the course of the year. I am just curious what the composition of those other wells looks like, be it Bone Spring or Culberson, Upper Wolfcamp, Lower Wolfcamp, etcetera? And then I have...", "Joe Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. As far as the net well counts of wells that are being completed during the year, we see about the majority of them, two-thirds of them are in the Wolfcamp, Culberson and Reeves. And then the remainder is primarily Bone Spring. And as I have mentioned in my discussion early on, we got a couple of rigs hitting them right now, right. And we are going to drop them down. So you are going to see our net completions in the area overall, wells waiting on completion increased to about 20 or something in the middle of the year. And then it\u2019s going to come on down as we pull those rigs back and keep our frac crude running at taper itself down to just six waiting on completion at the end of the year. So sorry, two-thirds Wolfcamp, one-third Bone Spring and really just kind of she goes consistent completion pattern during the year.", "Tom Jorden", "Yes. No, he is absolutely right. I will just point out the Bone Spring component, essentially those wells were drilled and so they will be completed in the first half. And then all of the rigs for the rest of the year will be dedicated towards Wolfcamp, towards finishing up the pilots. And then the rest of the time, it\u2019s all about acreage holding. So yes, there is a component of Bone Spring, but that\u2019s early in the year and everything else to the rest of the year is Wolfcamp.", "Michael Hall", "And that Wolfcamp activity outside of the Tim Tam and the Reeves and so, is that predominantly upper or lower or that\u2019s from a leasehold perspectives are you incentivized to...?", "Tom Jorden", "As we have talked about before, it all kind of depends on the lease and what we need to do in order to hold, depend on the lease term, a lot of them maybe lower Wolfcamp\u2019s, others could be upper. I don\u2019t have that breakdown for you. I do know that as a program, we are about half and half, half net wells in Culberson, half approximately in Reeves for the year.", "Michael Hall", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, similar question in the Meramec program, I am just curious how many \u2013 I am sorry if I missed this, but how many completions are you expecting in 2016 in Meramec?", "Joe Albi", "Yes, this is Joe. The majority of them, about two-thirds will be \u2013 this is not counting the infill program, which we said we have deferred into the Woodford development program, which were deferred in \u201817, but of the \u201816 completions, approximately two-thirds are in the Meramec and then just some little singles in and around that. But John, I don\u2019t know if you want to move to that?", "John Lambuth", "No. Joe is absolutely right. Again, we are pushing back in the Eastern core development theoretically into \u201817. The majority of our completions will be Meramec. And then we have the occasional Woodford one-off well where we still continue to expand and test the boundaries of our Woodford play.", "Michael Hall", "And how many completions is that, sorry if I missed it?", "Joe Albi", "It will be total of about 16 net completions.", "Michael Hall", "Great. Thanks. Then I just wanted to understand a little better around the decision to \u2013 I guess yes just the decisions around the timing of that road development and bringing that on production late in the year, early next year, is that \u2013 it sounded like it\u2019s more a function maybe of holding acreage and in the Mid-Continent as opposed to just logistical considerations with\u2026.?", "John Lambuth", "Well, this is John. And I will just say, as I alluded to in my comments, we have a partner and we develop these roads. We coordinate with our partner from a standpoint of the frac calendar. We recognize that to achieve the optimal result, we have to work together. We have to time our frac schedule appropriately as we bring these wells on. Our partner has indicated to us that, at this time they would like to delay that frac schedule. And so we are working with them and coordinating with them to the best of our ability. We have emphasized we would like to move it up some, if we could. We decide the positions were taken, but I think we would like to move it up in the year if we could. And we are having those ongoing discussions right now. And we will see where it ends. I think what we have done is we presented you maybe you could call the worse case scenario where they get pushed all the way to early \u201817. But there is a chance perhaps we can push them up earlier into \u201916, I think that would be our preference.", "Michael Hall", "That\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate it, John. And then last one or I guess two more quick ones for me. Number one, just to be clear, I want to make sure I am reading this right, the total CapEx is at $650 million to $700 million or is that $50 million of midstream included in that $600 million to $650 million?", "Mark Burford", "No, Mike. The $600 million to $650 million is the E&D spending. There is an incremental $58 million from midstream and other capital incremental to the $600 million and $650 million, so the $650 million to $700 million with it.", "Michael Hall", "Perfect. And then last one, you mentioned you had some minimum volume commitment payments, is there much more exposure to that through the course of \u201816 anyway to quantify that?", "Joe Albi", "Yes. This is Joe. As best as we are modeling right now, we have taken the gist of that.", "Michael Hall", "Alright. Thank you very much.", "Tom Jorden", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Karen Acierno for any closing remarks.", "Karen Acierno", "Well, thanks everyone for joining us. Apologies to those of you who are still in the queue, we have run out of time, but if you would like to call up with those questions, feel free to do so.

All participants will be in listen-only mode.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Acierno, please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. So, yesterday afternoon, an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. And as a remainder our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "So today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, our VP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO Mark Burford is also present to help answer any questions.", "And as Rocco said, we want to try and keep everybody to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get everybody in the question queue and you can feel free to jump back in if you have another question.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Karen. And thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference call. We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.", "On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. Joe will follow John with an operational overview including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As we've described in the past calls, owning to the timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come and fits and starts this year.", "Rest assured our organization is hard at work during this downturn: necessity is the mother of invention. I'd like to open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production beat this quarter driven by improved well performance.", "Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in the strong quarter overall. Gas production was up, our oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin, due to the timing of our delineation projects.", "We expect to pick up the pace on our Permian completions during the remainder of the year. We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford infill program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016. The application of bigger, more effective stimulations across the board and greater than anticipated working interest in both our own wells and in partner operated wells.", "With the results that we're seeing we're delighted to have the increased exposure. Since our last call, we've seen a bit of breathing room in commodity prices, as a result, we're accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the plant outages this winter.", "As you'll also hear during the call, our focus on science and innovation continues apace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations, primarily to the use of more profit, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and more clusters per stage and the use of diverter technology.", "This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advantage of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies. We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organization is undergoing a concerted effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to head count reductions, reducing contract and consultant services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead.", "In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where it was sustainable, where we were living within cash flow and had a capital program and a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve our organization. I am pleased to tell you that we're on track with both sets of goals.", "As we look ahead of the current strip, we modeled at Cimarex that lives within cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in the years ahead. We have best-in-class assets and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold with our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work, generating new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.", "We don't know where commodity prices are headed, but we don't expect to return to the price levels of 2014 anytime soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount, and asset quality, and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business, and things won't be any easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery would be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape, and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter, before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results, and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $158 million on the exploration and development during the first quarter, about 55% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going towards activities in Mid-Continent region.", "Companywide, we've brought 22 gross, five net wells on production during the quarter. Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of infill wells, and the Woodford shale, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware Basin, and the Mid-Continent.", "That activity is winding down, and a majority of our contracted drilling rigs will be rolling off by July. By August, we plan to be down to three operated rigs. In the Delaware Basin, you may recall that we spud a down spacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells, and completions are scheduled to begin in mid May. First production is now expected by midyear. This six well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test two different spacing designs. One at eight wells per section, while the other will test six wells per section, both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions.", "On page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift, using a 40% larger completion on these Upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand per foot.", "We are about to take that a step further on using even larger design to complete this six well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these pilot wells will have 44% more sand pump, than the largest completed wells we've had to date, as shown on page 12. We are currently drilling also, our Lower Wolfcamp infill project, which we call Tim Tam. This 10,000 foot spacing pilot is comprised of five wells, which will be drilled in a stacked/staggered pattern testing six wells per section. We believe, the success we've had with larger completions in the upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to the Lower Wolfcamp.", "If I wave an example, page 13 in our presentation illustrates the uplift we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000 foot Upper Wolfcamp well. We have also just finished operations on our largest Lower Wolfcamp completion to date, a well we call the Flying Ebony, where we pumped 2,400 pounds of sand per foot.", "The production data from this well, along with the larger completions we're doing in the Upper Wolfcamp, will provide us critical data for the design of future completions, including the Tim Tam wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.", "For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware Basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include six two mile long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to two operated rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.", "Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers six sections of which Cimarex operates two sections.", "Due to some last minute changes in working interest, this infill project now consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is nearly finished and completion of these wells have been moved up. It is now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $50 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.", "And our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000 foot laterals. Also, our third 10,000 foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early January. Located in Blaine county, this well called the Dakota Carol 1H-2722X had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a condensate yield of around 278 barrels per million.", "Page 21 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift, we've seen from the three long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000 foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62% within \u2013 by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we're seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long laterals.", "To better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015 and has just finished the drilling phase. See slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The eight new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of five upper and five lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard nine wells per section development plan.", "Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner Devon, was recently completed, and is in the early stages of flow-back. The results from this five wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked/staggered pilot. Once drilling is finished on the infill sections, we'll be focused on holding our Meramec acreage.", "As you know, in late 2014 we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital would be invested in holding Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have four rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region with plans to be down to one operated rig by July of this year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "Well, thank you, John. And thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll hit on the usual items, our first quarter production, our Q2 and full-year 2016 production outlook. And then I'll follow-up with a few comments on LOE and service cost.", "As Tom mentioned with the help of stronger than expected base property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes, came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of 973 million a day, beat our guidance projection of 925 million to 955 million a day and was up 3% from the 947 million a day that we posted in Q1 2015. As expected, facility disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately 30 million a day.", "Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at 477 million a day, down 43 million a day from Q4 2015. The decrease was expected and came as primarily a result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as completing three net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to eight wells in the fourth quarter of 2015. With our Cana row four wells coming online in late Q4, we did anticipate a nice Mid-Continent posting during Q1 and we saw just that. With the wells exceeding our planned expectations, our Mid-Continent volumes came in at 493 million a day. That's up 7% from the 461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the 444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 2015.", "As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of a frac crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1. And by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana (15:47) completions to October of this year.", "With our stronger than expected Q1 results, and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about, at a midpoint basis, 45 million a day from our beginning year guidance of 890 million to 930 million.", "As compared to our original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana infill project, results in a significant decrease in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells on our books at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 gross and 9 net Mid-Continent wells waiting on completion at year-end; that compares to the 57 gross and 24 net wells that we anticipated we'd have awaiting completion earlier this year, when we issued our beginning year guidance. The acceleration not only boosts our 2016 total company guidance, but it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well. With our new modeling, we now project our total company fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us deferring approximately three net completions into the latter part of this year. With the processing constraints anticipated to now be behind us, our plans are to add a second completion crew to help catch up \u2013 that'll be here in May and into early June. And with the projected two rigs working the latter part of the year, as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 gross and 30 net Permian wells to come online in 2016.", "That's flat with our previous estimates, but we've just really accelerated the pace here into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our projected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells will in essence drop fairly quickly here from 34 gross and 21 net wells here in May to 10 gross and 9 net on the books by year-end.", "For Q2 2016, our projected guidance of $935 million to $965 million a day, reflects a drop in production from Q1 2016 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity which is planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help provide you with some clarity on our projected completion timing through the year. We completed five net wells in Q1, we're forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2 with approximately 44 net wells projected to come on line in Q3 and Q4. So you can see the emphasis in the later quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.", "Shifting gears to OpEx, our production group continue to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realized additional and sizable cost reductions in items such as salt water disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 2016 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our guidance which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% from our fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted for the average in the first quarter of 2015.", "With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say we'll most likely be on the lower end of that range as we finish out the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our ops team has put forward to reduce our cost structure, all the while maintaining safe and efficient operations.", "Tom touched on this, not only is doing so so critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment, but our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling program, making us a more efficient operator. Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis we've seen our total company monthly net operating expense drop about $5 million per month, which annualized equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.", "And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost components remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service costs on the completion side, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spud-to-rig release drill time, now down to 28 days as compared to 35 days in 2014.", "On the completion side; in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing our water sourcing cost by challenging our team in the planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in that regard. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make their way into our total well cost. As we continue to push the limit on our frac design and size, our completion costs will continue to dominate our total well cost, while we experiment with larger frac designs, many of our generic well AFEs still have stayed somewhat in check.", "An exception is the Wolfcamp, where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic two-mile lateral Culberson lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million. That's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last call and down 22% from where we were in late 2014.", "With last quarter's frac designs, our Cana core one-mile lateral wells, continue to run in a range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014, but with the larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 2016, this range is likely to increase anywhere in a range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well.", "And in the Meramec, our current one-mile lateral AFE still in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late 2014 and also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in these AFE as well.", "So in closing, we had another great quarter, we beat guidance, despite sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides further reducing our LOE, our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies \u2013 reductions and efficiencies, and optimizing the results of our fracs and our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells all the while we're optimizing our investment program results.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons/Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Good morning, and great quarter, guys. My first question is on slide 11, on the Culberson County Wolfcamp 10,000 foot laterals, the before tax IRR changed \u2013 moved higher significantly since your last update on this particular slide. I was just curious what was driving that significant change?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. There are several factors in there, the biggest driver is just an improvement in our type curve or expectation going forward. And that's really related to the \u2013 continually to increase our frac design on these wells. We have three wells now with this current design which I talked about earlier at the 1,640 pounds per foot and those wells have been long enough now that, what's really impressing us is quite frankly lack of decline.", "These wells come on and they tend to have a very long flat period to them. And we have enough time with those now that we've gained confidence in that type curve and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward. I should also point out, though, as Joe mentioned, we actually have also in addition to that, seen some cost reduction in those wells.", "So, with all that, factored together, that's led to the improvement you're seeing there.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Excellent. Thank you for that color. And then my follow up and this grows out of slide number 20 in your presentation on the Meramec. But looks like you had some do well results there on the 5,000 foot lateral and then also the 10,000 foot lateral, looks like they were slightly weaker than some prior ones. Now, they may have had a bit of a higher oil cut. Just want to get some color on those recent well results in the Meramec.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John, again. Well, first thing I would say is, this is still an emerging play and for us, we're still out there doing both a combination of holding acreage, delineating acreage and testing frac design. And so, it's fair to say that some of the wells come in much better than expected and some come in less. We're still learning a lot in regards to these wells, and there's still a lot that we think we can change or improve upon to make these wells even better.", "So, yeah, there is some variability there, especially, I would point out yes, with our 10,000 foot lateral we just announced. It's also, well, I want to point out that we anticipated having a much higher yield than our previous two 10,000 foot laterals. And so, in that case, we did not flow it back as aggressively from a choke management standpoint. We were interested and with this one, particularly in seeing with choke management, how we could manage that yield. So for that well in particular I don't know that the 30-day rate is as important to us as say the 90 or 180 day rate in terms of the rate we're flowing that well back.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Great. That's very helpful. Thanks again and good quarter.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone. Great results. I was hoping you could speak to whether you can apply the same techniques you've used in the Wolfcamp A recently to the Wolfcamp D? And I know you said you're testing that with at least one well already, but does it have broader applications?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing coming out of the Upper Wolfcamp D wells, with this continuation of improving to frac design and that's why we indeed went to our most current 10,000 foot lateral in the Lower Wolfcamp, the Flying Ebony to apply that design to it. It's just now an flow back, we all have very high expectations for that well. But we also recognized that not any one well makes a trend this year.", "But yes going forward, we're very encouraged and let me be also clear, we're not sure that we've really even reached even close to the end number in terms of these frac uplifts, that's why for that Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot, even though we don't have a well under our belt, we're very comfortable stepping up in the total amount of sand that we're going to pump in those wells because the way we model it with a modest increase in IP and EUR it's a very economic thing to do.", "So, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing here, but we still think there's a lot more to gain.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Drew, this is Tom, I want to follow-up on that. We're very excited by the Wolfcamp A and certainly the results and the uplift we've reported is real and it's grounded in actual results. We probably see the Wolfcamp A as being a better target overall than the Wolfcamp B but the Wolfcamp B is also outstanding, I mean so it's a question of great and outstanding.", "But one other things I want to follow-up on is, one other things that make Cimarex strong is our presence in multiple plays and in particular with our footprint in Delaware Basin and our footprint with stack, we're doing a lot of innovation as are our competitors. And every time, we see something that works, we look for opportunities to apply it elsewhere in our own portfolio.", "So, having that footprint in multiple plays allows us to really bring innovations in much more quickly than we could if were single basin player. So, there are, as John said, we have a lot of running room in completion optimization in both Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp D, and I would add in stack both in the Meramec and Woodford.", "All of those plays are trying some things and that laboratory gives us ideas to apply across the board. I don't know that we're even scratching the surface yet in a lot of areas, and we're very, very excited about some of the advancements we're reporting, but we have tremendous uplift yet to happen. And so, it's pretty exciting right now.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color, Tom. So just to follow up on that, the results obviously are great in the Wolfcamp A. I know it's been less tested in Culberson, because the returns, I think, for Wolfcamp D had looked so good, and you can hold the acreage by drilling down to the D. But can you give us a better sense of how delineated the Wolfcamp A is across your acreage position?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John, it's not near as well delineated as it is for the D, that's a very fair statement. The majority of our A drilling to-date has been \u2013 has mainly occurred in Culberson down in the southeast part, that's where we really recognize it and from the way we map it, but I would also tell you that we are now stepping out into other areas of Culberson, and I'm hoping in future earnings release to talk more about those efforts.", "But, so far, it's been relegated more to a much smaller area in the southeast than the D, but that's just, as you mentioned early on, we were drilling Ds and a way to hold our acreage and hold all our rights with the Wolfcamp As we've been a little bit more selective, but now with these encouraging results we're seeing, we are quickly stepping out in the other areas of our acreage to get a sense of just how good this could be across the whole position.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Drew, there is tremendous future opportunity to test new zones and the same zone elsewhere in our acreage, not only within Culberson and Eddy County. So, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and it's definitely pointing us to get more and more excited about that asset.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Will Derrick of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.", "Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Nice update. I guess first question looking over in the Meramec and Cana Woodford, on the completion time and moving it up to October, what's your expectation on when those wells are all going to come online?", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "This is Joe. We're going to start to see the beginnings of that production late Q4 and into early Q1. We flow the wells back, they clean up and just the timing of the complete row of activity is such that it will end up pretty close to what happened this year with row four, carrying into not only Q4 but into Q1 of this year. I think we'll see the same thing next.", "Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then also up there, in terms of the completion design that you all are looking at, how does that differ from what you've seen in the past? Are you using the higher intensity completions you've done recently? What are your thoughts there?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. I think you're referring to our Woodford development wells, correct?", "Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yes, sir. Yeah.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. We \u2013 on our previous row, row four, we did quite a bit of experimentation with the frac design there. And in fact, in one case, one section in particular we pumped upwards of 3,200 pounds per foot. That section and those wells are outstanding. I mean, we are just really impressed with the results coming off of that section. And so going forward into this new row development, our base case, and I think Joe alluded to that why we're anticipating the additional cost is to go up to that size of a frac job in the Woodford Shale at 3,200 pounds per foot, whereas before, our standard was more around 1,800 pounds per foot. Again there is cost that are associate with it, but based on the performance we're seeing in on those wells, it's well worth the additional cost to do that. So, that's our go forward plan there for that next row development.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning. Tom, I was wondering if you could perhaps give us some more details on the stacked/staggered pilot that you're doing in the Meramec? In particular, I just wanted to see if you could comment, maybe, on where your completions have been landing today? And just your general thoughts around this pilot coming up?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'll answer your question, then I'll turn it over to John, he will have some additions. Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was, quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir and so, early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells had done.", "And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing two different landing zones in that Meramec stacked/staggered pilot and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zone to be a overprint on production that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are some areas of the play that have underperformed, that we're going back in now and testing new landing zones, new completion techniques and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where we land these laterals.", "John, do you want to add to that?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "The only thing I would add is that for that particular spacing pilot, we went the extra step where we went ahead and drilled, what we would call a pilot hole to get additional log information, to really refine where to put those laterals in the Meramec. And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stacked/staggered pilot in regards to the data we've received from that pilot, which really helped us pinpoint exactly where we're going to put these laterals. Whereas before, Tom's absolutely be right, we would have looked just say, say two sections over and to see what the company XYZ does as far as where they landed it.", "I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec, I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that's some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So, I'm very excited about the stacked/staggered pilot and I'm looking forward to when we finally get around to completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have a strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now. And there was a lot of science associated with that pilot and we're very anxious to kind of see the flow back, review the science data. And that's why we're not in any rush to go out and frac our current stacked/staggered till we see some of those results and see how we might then tailor our fracture design for our pilot.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And just my follow-up, you drilled and completed some wells on the updip portion of your acreage and the downdip. Any takeaways or conclusions around well performance on the updip or downdip? Are they similar?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. I think you're referring to Meramec wells or Mississippi wells?", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Pardon me, it's slide 22?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. Well, I guess, I need to just adopt the stack vernacular, I guess.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Sorry.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, we have. Again, delineation wells, sometimes the results were not as we were hoping, other times they're outstanding. So, it's kind of what you expect early on in a play like this where every now and then, you hit a homerun and then \u2013 now and then, you hit one that's not so good. And then really, it's the ones that don't quite meet our expectations that we really, really spend a lot time on saying, okay, what could we have done differently, where could we have landed differently, how do we make it better. And so, yeah, I'd still think there is a lot of improvements still to come in this play based on what I've seen so far.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Arun, Cimarex, I think speaks a little differently than some other companies about the Meramec. I would say, first and foremost, we're very excited about the Meramec. We have a program that is in our estimation top tier. We study our wells. We study our competitors' wells, and we think our results are in that upper class, and we have a lot of data to back that statement up. That said, we do see a fair amount of reservoir variability through the play. We don't view the Meramec as a blanket play. We see a fair amount of variability and that's why John talked about the importance of having pilot holes when we target our laterals. The landing zones can change in short order. The yield can change in short order and the well-performance can change.", "Now, we're fairly confident based on the work we're doing that all if not most of those are solvable. Solvable with completion techniques, solvable with smart application of your landing zone, but it's an evolving story. And as we always have done, we're going to talk about results and our results stand on their own. They're quite good.", "Operator", "Our next question come from Dan Guffey of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. Focusing on Reeves County, can you update us with the cumulative production and days online for the Big Timber? And then whether or not you think the strong result is repeatable? And then I guess a few comments how the Upper Wolfcamp in this area stacks up to other Delaware Basin assets that are in your portfolio?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah. This is John. I don't have the Big Timber production in front of me right now; we can probably give that information back to you. What I do know is based on that well result as well as some other competitor wells in the area, we feel really, really good about that acreage over there from a 10,000 foot lateral standpoint. So good, as I mentioned in my comments, that we are moving forward with the development plans that we're doing in Reeves County with the 10,000 foot stacked/staggered development that we'll initiate \u2013 in fact that's started drilling on right now.", "It's a very good area for the Upper Wolfcamp and I think our Anaconda pilots really demonstrated to us that it's not just a good area, it's thick enough to support multiple levels of wells in that shale. So going forward, we're very, very excited about that area and the results we'll get, especially from this development that we're currently drilling right now.", "Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess, as it competes for capital in other areas in your Delaware Basin program, I guess, assuming commodity price, assuming the strip currently isn't competitive with other assets in your portfolio, do you have any constraints such as infrastructure that may limit future development as you head into 2017?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Sure. I'll take the stab at that. It competes very well with the other things we have in our portfolio. The thing that's driving a lot of our capital this year, as we've mentioned. is acreage holing. And in particular in Reeves, we have a lot of acreage there that's still on a primary term that we definitely want to hold. So, there is quite a bit of capital going that way. It is fair to say that once we get to the point, where we've excess capital beyond holding acreage, then we have to look \u2013 and any time we make those decisions, then it's factors such as, yes, always rate of return and takeaway issues and water sourcing as Joe mentioned, and other factors that lead to where we deploy that capital. But in terms of optional capital spending Reeves, holds its own pretty well compared to Culberson right now.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Dan one of the things that drives that, isn't just the rocks, but it's also our ability to drill that longer lateral.", "Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And so one of the things that makes Culberson such a beautiful asset for us, not only is it multiple zone, some of which we haven't even tested yet, but we can drill long laterals at will, there is no constraint there over that entire acreage block.", "That's generally true in Reeves, but there are areas where that's not true and what Cimarex is doing and a lot of operators are focused on, I think there's wide spread recognition of the economic uplift of these longer wells. And so there are some trades going on to let us block up that area and be in a better place to drill long laterals. But as far as the rock goes, it's highly competitive with other things we've got.", "Operator", "And our next question come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So to kick that prior question on capital allocation maybe a step further, and just thinking about the portfolio as a whole. Now that you've drilled more wells in the Meramec and are getting more confident in your Upper Wolfcamp wells \u2013 I'm not going to ask you, Tom, when you're going to go back to work. But just a question around where that first incremental dollar goes, when you do go back to work?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Back to work, Jason. You see golf pants on us?", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I should have worded that one a little better.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, the challenge is it's a really evolving story. And if we had the snapshot of today, and we said, you know what, based on what we know today we have to make long-term capital allocation decisions. There'll probably be a bias for a lot of our Delaware program not only the Bone Spring but the Avalon looks quite good and these long wells in the Wolfcamp, those are all cream of the crop.", "But we are still seeing not only the Meramec but I'd still throw the Woodford in the mix, that with our \u2013 the experiments we're doing with our completion innovations, we're seeing a really improving story there. And so, in the near-term, we're going to continue to experiment. I mean, we want to have an active program in both basins because what we learn is setting the stage for a long-term capital allocation. I mean, you've heard us talk about in the Woodford, we have some projects that would be stacked Meramec and Woodford that once we kick them off, they are hundreds of 10,000 foot long wells. I mean, it's a real opportunity for Cimarex. So we're not just going to snapshot today its evolving story.", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Yeah, this is John I'll just follow-up. Especially in today's market, to what Tom said, completion costs are really surprisingly enough to me they've gotten a little softer on the service cost side. But as an example to just take our total company frac stats now is the time to try this experimentation. Our early 2016 average frac statistics compared to our 2015 averages such that we're drilling \u2013 we're completing 11% longer laterals, pumping 23% more fluid, 30% more sand and when you look at it all-in, cost reduction per well including water sourcing, we're seeing a reduction of 5% and our completion cost even with those increases. So now is the time to try those experiments.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks. And just one quick one on the Avalon. A few of your peers have talked about it this quarter. I think that it's held by production for you guys. Any change in your thoughts around allocating some capital there or doing any further tests in that zone?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, this is John. Actually I think about two days ago, I was in Midland and reviewed our latest Avalon well with our latest generation of frac design and it's fantastic, it's a great well. And the challenge again as you mentioned is all held by production. And so right now, we would must rather spend that capital to hold the rest of our acreage position throughout the Wolfcamp.", "But, I got to tell you, I got a team down there, this is just itching to go on a two-mile lateral and the Avalon and the numbers look great. But it's just a matter of capital allocation right now, where we think obviously our best interest is to go out there and deploy that capital and hold our acreage for this year. But they're raring to go and at some point, especially since we've already got a number of the spacing pilots done where we're already at eight wells per section of each interval within the Avalon, there are several benches. So it looked really good, it's just a question of when we get to a point where I guess as someone said, we get back to work and start drilling some more wells out there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jeanine.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So on the fourth-quarter call, you all provided us with your estimated year end 2016 cash balance of I think it was $400 million. And with the $50 million CapEx increase that you announced last night, what's your new estimated cash balance at year end 2016? And realizing that the strip has moved up in the meantime?", "G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. Jeanine. Hi, good morning this is Mark here. Yeah using a early May 2 strip price with that incremental capital in our new volume forecast, we're still expecting actually, it's gone up a bit from $400 million to maybe $450 million, the way it looks right now, Jeanine. So, it's something we're closely watching and seeing how that moves through the year. But even with the increased capital you expect that cash balance to be even a bit higher than we had previously forecasted.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And Jeanine, I want to give just a little bit of detail in that CapEx increase. On our fourth quarter call, we were at a range of $600 million to $650 million and we said the upper-end of that $650 million would be if those completions rolled into 2016. So, those completions have rolled into 2016. So if we wanted to benchmark us against the fourth quarter, we'd be at that $650 million number we talked about.", "Now we gave a range of guidance of $650 million to $700 million. So, really we kind of deal with midpoint, midpoint is $675 million. So really it's a $25 million increase over where we were in our fourth quarter call given that those completions are accelerated. So although, it looks like $50 million, I think that's probably just an absolute upper-end of that.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great, that's really helpful. And my follow-up, so it sounds like you have more cash \u2013 slightly more cash than you previously thought, and you're finding more ways to spend your cash flow. So what are the next opportunities you have to spend more CapEx on, if you spend any more at all?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'll take that, this is Tom. We've got lots to do and certainly we have a lot of projects that are begging for capital in the Delaware Basin and these are as John said, the list is long and long and long. And then this Meramec delineation probably is one that we'd easily be able to throw a little capital at. And then we're also, we've talked in the past about we're doing some exploration. I mean, this is the time when we are kind of keying on what our organization does best and our value proposition has always been centered around doing good geoscience, finding ideas that give us competitive advantage and getting acreage positions ahead of the crowd. And so we're putting a lot of emphasis on that as well and there will be some opportunities to come out of that.", "So depending on what the landscape looks like over the next six months, I think there is a reasonable chance that we may do a little more. We're going to need to see the fundamental shore up. We're going to need to have confidence that this price file is affordable, but we are ready to roll with cash and balance sheet to do it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "Thanks. Maybe follow up a little on that, while we're on the topic. Just bigger picture, as I think about capital allocation in this cycle, what's your perspective on out-spending cash flow? You mentioned earlier in the remarks that you think within cash flow on the strip, you can get back to growth in the years ahead. I appreciate that certainly, but will end the year with a substantial amount of cash on hand, already a very differentiated balance sheet. And I'm just thinking through this \u2013 where we are in the cycle. You've got productivity trending up and to the right. Costs are at cyclical lows. How do you think about out-spending cash flow, as we move further forward in 2017? Given the current environment, is that something you'd be more likely to do than at other points in the cycle?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Michael, I'll take that one. This is Tom. We are very willing to outspend cash flow, and the way I think about it is very simple, it's about creating value. If we can borrow money at low interest rate and invest it in the high interest rate, I think as long as we're confident in those returns that's a value creating proposition for our shareholder. And with our top-tier assets, I think our bias as a management team is to bring that value forward for our shareholders.", "Now that said, when you drill a well, those returns are predicated on a discounted cash flow that makes some significant assumptions about future commodity pricing. And the quality of that assumption is key. If we get to a point to where we gain confidence about that future commodity pricing, if we think that the markets have kind of worked themselves out and they're in balance. And we get asked about at what price file, it's not about the price file. We have the opportunities today at this price file to accelerate and add value. It's about our confidence in that price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low volatile proposition.", "So, I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet and yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, do you want to answer that?", "G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, no, I completely concur with Tom here. It's gaining confidence in our future curve. And now we're seeing kind of same thing as we think about increasing activity, the current curve suggest that we have lots of economic wells to drill. But we've seen a couple head fakes seen the commodity price reverse. A lot of movement to date has probably been driven on expectation of continued oil production than inventories improving, which we're starting to see. But we want to see more continuation of that and making sure that forward strip is really kind of intact and based on the fundamentals.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll say just one last thing on that. We do an annual look back, and many of you've heard us talk about that in the past, and John and I spent two hours yesterday, reviewing our annual look back, going back on our history of economic performance. And there are some real lessons there. And one of the lessons is you really have to have confidence on that commodity price file. I mean there's a lot of lessons in that. And it's about being good at the business, making sure you have high quality assets, and being very prudent in your investments.", "And I think Cimarex has a long history of success on that front, and we're going to continue to stay disciplined. We have the luxury of top tier assets, and outstanding returns in this current price environment. So we're going to be ready to roll, and I think you \u2013 I think it's reasonable for you to expect with a little stability in commodity pricing, you will see Cimarex pick up the pace.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "I appreciate that color. That's very helpful. I guess my follow-up, stepping way back again, high level. If you just look at the Meramec today, and this might be a little tricky to answer, but just given all the moving pieces in the world. But if you look at the Meramec today, and you try to compare that to the year of learning curve for the Wolfcamp and the Del Basin. So looking back in time, in the Delaware Basin and on Wolfcamp, what year would you think we're in if we were to try and characterize the Meramec today? Does that makes sense?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "Well, this is John. And I guess I'll take a stab at it. It's interesting you asked that. I've been actually kind of going down memory lane, and just recently talked with our lead generator for Culberson. And I'd forgotten that Culberson started in 2006 for us. So, we're in year 10 in Culberson and I'm going to tell you right now, we still don't know everything about Wolfcamp and Culberson; obvious by our well results and what we continue to do.", "Whereas we're in year two of Meramec and I just think we've scratched the surface. There's just so much that we are learning with each well, both us and our competitors and in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated paced than Culberson ever did because we were the only game in town when we were doing Culberson. Here, as you well are aware, we have at least five other operators drilling all around us, and we're all looking at each other kind of figure out what works best, where should I go, where do I land. And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace, but sometimes I wonder maybe too fast, honestly, in that you never really get a chance to really catch your breath and look at the data and look at the results \u2013 not just that 30-day rate as I mentioned \u2013 but what is the well doing 180 days later. And is it surprising you and so \u2013 there are sometimes I wish we went to little bit slower to be honest in Meramec \u2013 but in some ways we're being forced to just with the competition.", "So, I don't know if that answers your question, but that's just my perspective on what's going on in the Meramec right now.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "We saw the same \u2013 this is Joe. We saw the same thing in Cana. We kicked off that program in 2007 and it's 2014 where a frac design revolutionizes the play. So, boy, that's a tough question. Where is the end-game on how well these wells can produce, is the real question there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, and actually a good segue into the question I had here, focusing in on the Meramec. Going back to the commentary on the landing zone and some of the variability, how do you address those challenges in the variability, as you apply the downspacing tests, going forward, both the results from yours and Devon's, across the broader acreage position?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "This is John. That's a great question. It's something that we talk about all the time. Part of it is sometimes in some of these sections, we're blessed to have, quite frankly, quite a bit of vertical control within the section to give us an idea of what variability we should expect. In other cases, quite frankly we've reached the point, we said we just got to go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole.", "I would also tell you in some ways we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage because at least with 3D seismic, you are sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date to build a more comprehensive model of what's going on and what we should expect going forward.", "I would just tell you that, again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill, and each one in some way typically surprises us fortunately to the positive, but also sometimes to the negative. So as we go forward, we'll continue to look for ways to get more comfortable with that variability and be able to adjust to it appropriately.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Well, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up here, for Tom. Could you just talk about the current M&A outlook and what you're seeing in both the Permian as well as in the Mid-Con?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we see opportunities and we're always in the hunt as we've talked in past calls. There's not a point in time, where we're not evaluating something. Our challenge is we want to create value and I think if you look at the history of M&A, in E&P and in other industries, it's a fairly challenging landscape for acquirers to make the argument that over the long run, that's been a real good value-creating strategy. Now, hey, maybe we count our money differently than others do, but we are who we are and we want to be forthright in our approach to the business.", "We look at full cycle value creation, we look at time to capital, we look at what the pace of development will be and will that generate a rate of return for our shareholders? Some of these splashy acquisition deals are good for everybody that participates except for the shareholder. And our focus first and foremost is on shareholder value.", "So, as I've said in the past, there are assets we covet. I mean, there are some really outstanding assets on the market and some really outstanding assets that have transacted. And we've been in that game and we often are at a valuation point where we are just flat out unwilling to get the number that's the winning bid.", "We ask ourselves at every turn what's our competitive advantage. If we don't have a competitive advantage, and that's generally either information, science or our ability to execute well above and beyond our competitors, then we're just bidding discount rate and commodity price forecast with a group of very well-funded competitors. And that's just not a winning proposition for the Cimarex shareholder. So, we look \u2013 I'm very hopeful that there'll be opportunities for us and when we find the right one, we'll strike. But it will be right because we had a competitive advantage.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We've already belabored the re-acceleration point. But if I could just ask, would it be reasonable to assume the planned drop of rigs around midyear is probably a good catalyst for you to reevaluate if that commodity outlook has stabilized, rather than risk losing efficiency gains \u2013 efficiencies kind of with those rigs?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, that's reasonable. Hey, we're not happy about going down to four, then three rigs, but we're going to do what we need to do to preserve that balance sheet and make sure that we're well positioned for the future.", "We may be getting the wrong feedback. We've always kept our debt low and our conclusion from what we've seen over the last 24 months is that was a prudent course of action because we have a lot of flexibility today in an arena where many of our competitors do not. So we're going to be careful, but nobody is unhappier with us going down to three rigs than we are, but it's what we have to do and we are going to stay disciplined.", "Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP", "And this is Joe. I'll follow-up, from a rig standpoint, when we added rigs earlier, a couple of months back, we got good iron, good crews. And I don't \u2013 in fact one of the rigs we got back drilled a record well. So I think the quality of the rigs and the people right now when \u2013 if and when we do pick them up, I feel very confident we will get a good efficient optimized service provided to us.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, I appreciate the help on providing the exit rate in your commentary. Should we expect oil mix to be constant, as well, with the 4Q 2015 level? Or should that be down?", "John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration", "For the year, we may end up being slightly more on the gas side at the end of the year. You want to add to that Mark?", "G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, no, it's pretty consistent, John. We're at 28% oil in the first quarter and mid-year within that 0.5% of that is what we see for the fourth quarter. So it's pretty consistent.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Acierno for any final remarks.", "Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Rocco. So, before we signoff, I have received some information on the Big Timber well, so I can give you the Q production, Dan, if you're still on. So, it's produced for 320 days. It's produced 250,000 barrels of oil, and about a 1.1 Bcf of wet gas.", "So, with that, we'll say good bye, and have a nice day. And thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "And thank you, ma'am.

(Research)", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cimarex Energy Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants today will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And please note, this event is being recorded.", "Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, EVP of Exploration, and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.", "Yesterday afternoon we posted an updated presentation to our website. We may be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a remainder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.", "So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to once again ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on of the delineation projects that we have underway, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview.", "For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We averaged 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We expected the third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we face delays in our completion owing in large part to the timing effect of our upside stimulations. We did not properly plan for the significant impact for setting in offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent lost to higher ethane rejection.", "The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter, but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items, and quite frankly, we need to do better.", "I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its nadir in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rigs running. We reached a low in summer of 2016 with four operated rigs. As we ramped our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and non-operated drilling was on large, multi-pad pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays.", "That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way, the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said \"it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\"", "Our 2016 exploration development capital budget is now $785 million, that's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year, and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion cost associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016.", "In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We wanted to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year, with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth.", "We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds, and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have on the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call. That will be in February, and that will include our total E&D expenditures as well as our first-quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity and additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline.", "Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to push the envelope in completion, optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory.", "We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that hopefully will be subjects for future quarterly calls.", "Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex, and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We have some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to do John to provide further color on our program.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter, before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.", "Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Companywide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of five operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. We have recently added three rigs, one in the Anadarko and two in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year-end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017.", "As planned, during the third quarter we brought the six 7,500-foot long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot, while also incorporating design parameters such as stage spacing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent parent-well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days, and yet we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected, since it usually takes our upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rate relative to the Lower Wolfcamp Culberson Wells.", "The results of this spacing pilot are especially meaningful in light of a recent result to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval in Culberson County. Earlier this year we completed the Kingman 45 State Unit 2H, which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, slide 10 identifies the location of the Kingman well.", "Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels, or 58%, was oil. The Kingman was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017.", "We also just finished drilling an Upper Wolfcamp well north of the Kingman well in Eddy County, which, depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that will is planned to begin in mid-January.", "We've completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital in the basin will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have five rigs running in the Delaware Basin.", "Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Canaccord in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers six sections, of which Cimarex operates two sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September, with all the Cimarex operated wells now completed and beginning early stages of flow back. These wells, along with partner operated wells, should be coming on production over the next two quarters.", "We also completed the Leon Gundy wells, our stacked/staggered Meramec-Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call.", "We also continue to both delineate and hold our Meramec acreage, with our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our pre-drill expectations. Of the four rigs we plan to operate in the Anadarko Basin next year, three of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll start first with our third quarter production results, then go into some detail on our revised Q4 2016 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook, and then, with an underneath-the-hood look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp up in production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs.", "As Tom mentioned, with reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million cfe a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 million to 980 million cfe. Two main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance. First, we saw an unanticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day as a result of ethane rejection associated with the processing of our share of outside-operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 million a day of production downtime due to slightly longer than anticipated completion times and the shut-in of the wells associated with those completions. These two factors alone pulled us away from the midpoint of our guidance.", "If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million cfe a day was up 2% from Q2 2016, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million cfe a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning-of-the-year slowdown in Mid-Continent completion activity, which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, up here in late Q3.", "Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results, and to maintain full control of the timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With a fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and individual well completion projects, we carefully plan our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping crews.", "If we did add and drop crews, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crews (13:35) with which we've worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies. Which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operational or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the fly to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue.", "Our Wood State completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then-planned job size required an 18-day time period to complete each three-well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design, which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells and projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well, and as a result we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted to add production in early Q4, now to come on later in Q4, and pushed others out into 2017.", "So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4, and a total of 10 net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production two to four weeks has a big impact when projecting volumes for 12-week quarterly time period, and as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate.", "We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we revised our first production timing for our Wood State project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November/ early December, versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for five net Permian wells, including production from our Tim Tam project, into early 2017.", "Similarly in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated Nancy Condrey (16:49) sections now scheduled to come online in November and December, and our non-operated project sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 timeframe. As a result, five projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017.", "So when the dust settled, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million cfe a day, with a fast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we are projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of a Bcf a day.", "As Tom mentioned, we have put together a preliminary nine-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. With the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity, and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we're projecting a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full-year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full-year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017.", "As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection, and the timing of our capital deployment.", "Shifting gears to OpEx, we posted another nice guidance beat with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production groups' continued efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We commend their efforts, and with their focus we continued to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor, and rentals in particular.", "As a result, our Q3 lifting cost came in at $0.61 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2 and down 27% from the $0.83 we posted for an average in 2015. After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we're projecting our remaining year lifting cost to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.", "And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling cost components remain relatively in check, and have seen our completion cost components for the most part level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs, with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days, and on the completion side by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing, and optimizing our pumping operations.", "With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat to last quarter, but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That again is flat to last call, but down 5% from Q4 2015 and down 23% from late 2014.", "With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we quoted with smaller fracs earlier in the year, but we're still down 10% from late 2014.", "And finally, as we continue to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with frac design really being the largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells.", "So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continued to make strides to reduce our operating cost structure, we stayed focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well cost, and we continue to make progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results, and for that matter, we're very pleased about our entire program.", "So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.", "Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning. My first question, Tom, is just thinking about the 2017, call it preliminary outlook. A couple of questions around that. One is, if I look at your spending in the quarter, you spent $175 million, and if you annualize that you'd be at $700 million, and your rig activity is ramping. So I'm just trying to put that into context relative to an initial D&C spend of $600 million? Because it does like you are accelerating from that $175 million that you spent in Q3?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. Arun, I'm going to give you an overview answer and then I'm going to turn it over to Mark for the detail. The quarterly spending is really a function of drilling rigs but also completion timing. And it's driven not only by the pad development timing, but there's also a fair amount of non-operated timing. That preliminary $600 million is an annualized rate if we kept those nine rigs running throughout the course of the year. Quarterly spending can fluctuate depending on how that gets bunched up. Mark, do you want to add to that?", "Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, Arun, we have a little choppiness in our capital spend levels with the amount of completion dollars we have in any one quarter. Actually you'll see in the fourth quarter, applied guidance has quite a uplift in capital costs for completions, of which we will have a number of completions occurring in the fourth quarter, a lot of them later in the quarter. But you'll see an upward kick into 2017. And as Tom said, it's a nine-rig program timed out with the capital and completion dollars with that program.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Arun, just to finish that thought, we're feeling really solid about the quality of our returns, the quality of our program, and the things we want to accomplish. So even though I know oil markets are a little nervous here in the last week, we're feeling a little better about some of the fundamentals, and so our bias as we sit today \u2013 and again this is just today \u2013 but our bias is going to be to lean forward on that capital number, and we're looking at a lot of things that we want to get done, and we'd like to get them done sooner rather than later. So I think there's a pretty good chance we'll be giving meaningful updates here in our next call.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And if I could just elaborate on that point, because the initial, and again understanding its initial, but right now if you look at our forecast and consensus, it's between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of EBITDA, so the number that you put out there last night would suggest quite a bit of free cash flow generation. So I'm just trying to understand is if you guys are thinking how you plan to balance growth versus potential free cash flow, and is there an intention, as we think about modeling for next year, to spend your cash flow? As you know, this is a market that is rewarding growth to a decent extent?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, the market will reward what the market rewards. There's a pretty big difference between a spreadsheet and iron deployed on the ground. And we're poised for increased activity. We have lots of things to do, and our bias is going to be \u2013 we don't have a great interest in keeping cash on our balance sheet; our bias is going to be to activity. And we focus on the returns on that investment, and as you know, you all get tired, I sound like a broken record, I think growth is a nice outcome of really good, prudent investments. And we're feeling pretty confident about those investment opportunities. Mark, do you want to comment on that?", "Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, Arun, as we talked in the past, over the last six months, we've been continuing to watch for stabilization in commodity prices. It's been seeming that some more stabilization occurring lately, but obviously even more recently there'[s some more pressure on oil recently, with some of the OPEC discussions. But certainly, with the Street forecast probably embeds a low mid $50 oil price, if that kind of environment starts to play out into 2017 and we feel that's a good price to be working off of as far as capital generation, certainly want to increase our capital level.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes, I will say from my viewpoint, I have a strong bias to spend our cash flow. And if we have any kind of signals of stability \u2013 and we think we are seeing those signals. We've talked a lot about structural reset in the markets, and we feel like we are starting to see that. And so our bias is going to be to spend our cash flow, and possibly \u2013 that cash on our balance sheet is there to be invested. So we're looking at it carefully. It's a good question, and you're right on point with the way we're viewing that.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hi, Drew.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, Tom. So on the 2017 program, the capital plan indicates to me, at least, a really big uptick in capital efficiency. And I think that's clearly occurred on the well productivity side. Is there an element of cost improvements at the well level for the further efficiencies that Joe talked about? And I did catch that he said costs really haven't gone down at all from 2Q, so was hoping you could provide some color there?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. Mark, why don't you take the capital efficiency, and I know Joe will make some comments on costs.", "Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, right. Drew, there is definitely more of a program going with longer laterals and we also have the efficiency improvements we've seen in our uplifts and our frac design. There is some capital efficiency embedded in it. But certainly there's also some efficiency gained from the fact that we are bringing forward wells from 2016 into 2017, that's a big part of what's happening into this next year's forecast, is the fact that we have carryover, as we mentioned in the release, 10 wells carrying over from 2016 that we previously thought would in the fourth quarter into 2017, so that's helping, getting that front-loaded production into 2017.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "And this is Joe. I'd say that's the primary driver to the capital efficiency calculation there, that you've got our significant East Cana infill projects coming online right at the end of the quarter, you've got the Tim Tam, you've got the Wood stage, you've got big chunks of new production starting off the year in 2017 with the capital deployed in late 2016.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color. And then if we can go over to the Culberson Wolfcamp A, I think is one of the highest rate of return assets in your portfolio, if not the highest. And so given the successful delineation you've had across a lot of that position there, do you expect to move into more of a development mode in 2017?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. This is John. Yes. I mean, there is both a combination, we still have some acreage obligation we need to do, and I need to point out what's really, really nice about that Kingman result is it gives us great encouragement to, quite frankly, put more wells over there on that west side, which further helps us secure our acreage across the entire Culberson position. So that was a really significant outcome for us, we're really pleased with that well.", "Likewise, as we continue to monitor our current spacing pilot, the Sunny-Gato pilot, we're already in plans for the next development phase of Upper Wolfcamp. We have a couple of sections in mind, and really the thing we're debating it just how tight do we want to put the wells. And again, a little bit of time here as we continue to watch the flow back of our current spacing pilot.", "And I just want to make another comment, as much as I can't talk a lot about it because we haven't gotten our \"peak rate,\" I would still consider a very encouraging sign that we're still seeing continued improvement, that is, the wells are continuing to clean up. I think we're encouraged by that, and hopefully by next call we'll be able to give you a lot of color on those actual results of those wells.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, John. And I guess with that in mind, does that give you comfort that you'll be able to incorporate the results of that spacing pilot in time for budgeting for 2017? Or would it still be kind of, prior learnings would be the basis for your capital plans in Wolfcamp A?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I think the only thing I would say is, within our budgeting for 2017, we've incorporated some development in Upper Wolfcamp. What might change, again, is maybe a well count on a section where we'll maybe add an additional well or two. But the full scale of the budget, I don't think that will have a huge impact on it. But, no, our intention is to incorporate the results from that pilot to then help dictate how we go forward with our future development in the Upper Wolfcamp. But those Upper Wolfcamp developments currently on the schedule, I believe, aren't really start drilling until late second, early third quarter, last time I looked at it.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, Drew. the word development doesn't mean what it used to mean. Everything we do, we're testing something. The beauty of our assets is that we're making really good returns while we test it. But there's some great innovative thinking going on in our organization on stimulations and well spacing, and we've got some significant tests to look at that could have meaningful implications for our overall inventory. So we can use the word development, but everything we do has learnings that impact future operations.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. I'm going to go back to 2017 again. If I just think about the big pad completion coming online in the first quarter, how should we think about your quarterly kind of production run rate through the year? Should it be flattish to a slight incline drought the year, or how should we \u2013 any guidance you can give me there? Any color you can give me there?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes, this is Joe. As modeled, with the larger projects coming on at the first part of the year, and then as we look out through the remainder of 2017, the placeholders that we currently have in place are more single-well project in nature. You'll probably see a ramp in the first two quarters of 2017, and then relatively flat for Q3 and Q4. But again, this is just a preliminary plan that we put together based on capital assumptions for 2017.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks for that color. And then I guess Tom, if I look at \u2013 I'm looking at slide 13 of the new deck, which is those Upper Wolfcamp completion design, those four Wells in Culbertson. And I look at that and then I look at the prior \u2013 same slide from a couple months prior, and it looks like the blue and the red line are \u2013 that increase is decreasing over time, so that gap's narrowing over time?. And I'm just getting back to this, there's this debate a couple years ago that's kind of got lost lately, but are you pulling more value forward? Are you really increasing the EUR? What exactly \u2013 what's the endgame as far as these higher completions? Can you \u2013 can I look at these four wells and make a determination based on that? Or can you give me more color, what you think, as far as ultimately what the \u2013 is the sand really driving higher EURs, or are you just accelerating that value, I guess?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I'm going to just set the stage, and then John will take it from there. The devil's in the details, and one of the things that completion and optimization really allows you to focus on is rate of return. So we don't really judge it by production uplift nor EUR uplift. We look at the return, and that's usually defined by certainly your first 18 to 24 months of production.", "And there's a raging debate as to at what point we end up accelerating and at what point we're having a new reserves. But as long as we focus on the return on an incremental completion investment, and we use really good, well-grounded data in doing that, that's not really a first order of concern. It's something that we will learn over time.", "Now, again, the devil is in the details when you compare this blue to the red curve. There's lots of optimization in the Wolfcamp that we haven't experimented with, and I'm going to let John take it from there.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, the first thing I would say is I would again emphasize what Tom just said. When we look at these additional costs on our frac uplifts or optimization, we are always looking at it from the standpoint of the incremental cost relative to the rate of return that that well achieves, and that is our first and foremost measure. We certainly also look at \u2013 we debate a lot internally over, yes, how much of this \u2013 is there a component of acceleration versus how much of this is new reserves? And honestly, there's still a lot of that to be determined as these wells continue to perform, and we'll watch that very carefully.", "As far as innovation, yeah, I don't \u2013 I do not believe, for either the Upper or Lower Wolfcamp, that we still have achieved the optimal frac for an individual well. And we talk about that all the time internally. And we have a lot of experimentation, in fact a well in particular coming up that we're going to test a lot of concepts and ideas, where we still think there's possibilities to achieve \u2013 or recover more reserves out of that rock.", "So I guess all I could tell you is, we watch it carefully. We monitor it carefully as far as the incremental cost to make sure it's a good decision, and we're going to keep trying to innovate on it.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I might just finish with one point, I'm not \u2013 we wouldn't look at slide 13 as necessarily the guiding light to make this decision. There are lots of things that are second-order advancements or innovations, and that would include cluster spacing, it would include pounds of sand and fluid per cluster. And so it could be that the blue and the red curve may lie on top of one another, but if we can get more wells per section, that's a huge, huge advance for us. So again, the devil is in the details on this.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. I appreciate the color though, helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next call comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Color on 2017. My first question is, when you look at well cost per lateral foot, do you think that's starting to level out, and maybe even start to move up as the intensity of the completions increases, as well as just service costs moving up?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes, this is Joe. I'd say the general answer to that is yes, but it's, like we've been talking about, here too, the types of design of your frac, the pounds of sand, the amount of fluid, your cluster spacing, your science projects, what have you; I tend to look at it more on the basis of cost components, because they're the variables we can measure. And what we're seeing on the drilling side are relatively flat cost components. On the completion side, it's no secret, you've heard the likes of Halliburton talking about increasing their service costs, we anticipate that it's entirely possible we may see somewhere, 5% to 7% some-odd increase in our completion service costs as we move forward.", "But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there is so many variables. How efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that. And again, optimizing the cost-benefits of the different frac designs, so that whatever the cost is we see the optimal side of it on the production side. These are all things that we're constantly scrutinizing and studying, and the end result is what Tom and John have both alluded to, what's our best rate of return? So I kind of danced around your question, but I think I left you with some flavor.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-on just sort of grows from that, but when you put out your preliminary 2017 capital budget, have you done those services to kind of lock them in, so that you don't have the incremental service cost inflation on top of the guidance that you've already put out?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "No. We've got just wonderful relationships with our service providers, and I think we know well in advance about what our cost structure is going to be looking like the next three to six months out. We have strong confidence that we'll be able to manage our cost, particularly on the completion side, through the duration of 2017.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Thank you for taking my...", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I just want to follow-up on that. We typically don't prefer to do long-term service contracts. And I know there's lots of people that see that problem differently. Locking in, that's \u2013 works on both sides, and I'm not sure who is locked in. We like flexibility. We like the ability to adapt our program up and down depending on changing conditions. So we're typically market takers. We look for good relationships, as Joe said, we look for high quality service companies, we look for safe, responsible service companies, and our history as a company has steered us away from long-term contracts.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Morning, Tom, and great detail so far. Say, Tom, just when I was looking up at slide 10 of yours particularly that talks about the Culberson and Wolfcamp details, and you guys have certainly added just a large amount of new oil gathering. And so some of your peers mentioned maybe being constrained next year, or having the infrastructure limit what they can grow. Is that going to be any sort of issue for you all, particularly in the Delaware Basin, that would limit your growth in any regard?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "We don't see that as a constraint over the next couple of years. We always model that out, both on a local and a basin-wide level. And certainly we've got a good relationship in Culberson, Plains is our gatherer and they've got good takeaway capacity and we're in very good shape there. There's been a tremendous amount of processing capacity built out in the Delaware Basin.", "We look at not only that, we look at gathering, and we also look at basin takeaway, and we're typically looking two to three years out, because that is usually the window in which if you have to lock up firm or do some kind of contractual obligation with a midstream Company you can build in advance, but we currently don't see that as an intermediate-term constraint. Do you want to comment on that, Joe?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I agree entirely. We've \u2013 when we put our project together with Plains, we had done a number of multiyear models on targeted drilling programs \u2013 or projected drilling programs and the resulting throughput. And we have a high degree of confidence in the capacity of the oil pipeline system that's currently in place in Culberson. And then likewise on the gas side, adequate processing and at least, given where we are today with the number of projects that are out there, two, three years' worth of capacity on the processing side and also on the takeaway side. So we feel very comfortable about both the gas side and the oil and NGL side \u2013 all three of them, I guess.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So, guys, does that just \u2013 again, it seems like others have to use a lot of their capital to do some of this build-out themselves. But you all, certainly \u2013 is it because of your great relationships and looking this far out with some of these third-party partners that you don't have to use the capital, and you have more than needed?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we do spend midstream capital. And in Culberson, in particular, we do own and operate our gathering system, and that's been a great benefit to us, as our Permian production manager reminds me every chance he can get. It's been a really, really smart thing for us, and we reached out and did some risk in doing that.", "And \u2013 but we have capital discipline. We really look at our midstream investments carefully. We want to make sure they're balanced against our drilling and completion capital and not get ahead of ourselves. And that's been important to us. So I think Cimarex probably does view midstream a little differently than some of our peers, and we like just-in-time midstream investments.", "I'm going to finish by saying that both those outlets in Culberson, the Plains and the MarkWest plant that was built, that was a really great outcome through the partnership we have with Chevron \u2013 the joint development agreement with Chevron. And I think it's been well crafted, and it's a great benefit for both companies.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly, really quick, Tom, just on bolt-on opportunities, either Permian or Mid-Con, what's your thoughts as you look into 2017?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Just for general opportunities?", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yes, sir. Just for bolt-ons there for either one, just to sort of block up either of those -continue to block up those positions?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we look at every asset on the market. And I get asked from time to time, do we just count our money differently? And maybe we do. We have a very difficult time with some of the acreage prices that are becoming commonplace. But we look, and we would love to do bolt-ons. We're also seeing a lot of operators come together now and have a greater willingness to swap acreage, so we can drill 10,000-foot laterals. John, do you want to comment on that?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, yeah. I think over the last year or two \u2013 and I'm proud to say, I think we led that way with our long lateral results, you had a number of other Wolfcamp operators who were kind of stranded with their sections with only 5,000-foot laterals. And now we're starting to see more and more other companies willing to talk about trading acreage, section for section, such that they as well as us can leverage long laterals. And we're getting a few more of those deals done with a couple of different companies out there.", "And I would not be surprised you'll see more of that happening where each company tries to kind of block of their own acreage. So then you get those capital efficiencies, with the long laterals as well as the midstream assets and disposal. So we'll see more of that. Would I love to get more bolt-on acreage? Absolutely. And as Tom said, we look at every deal possible, especially adjoining to our position. And we just can't seem to come to the same valuations that others are able to in this current market.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the details, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Morning, Tom and everyone, thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping just to go back to \u2013 I know you guys gave a lot of information around the discussions and the delays in Cana. I just wanted to clarify little bit, the increased time \u2013 you talked about the impact obviously of the ethane rejection, but the increased time, was a created from having to shut in wells? Was the time itself just related to the frac job itself? And is there an expectation of significantly longer time for these wells to be cleaning up once they're on line?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is Joe. The answer is not embedded and it's taking longer for the wells to clean out. It's entirely tied to the timing of the frac itself and the duration of the operation of the frac. And the loss, I guess if you want to call it that, as compared to the previous forecast in production with a longer timeframe for a given well that is newly completed. But also in conjunction with that, we are offsetting wells in and around the wells that we're fracking. And the delays that we see there is going to get a little bit multiplied, if you will, by some number based on the number of wells that are offset.", "So it's a combination of both. It is entirely due to when we anticipated a frac to start in our Q3 guidance, and end, and the wells that would be associated with that frac that were shut in and the volumes that would have been deferred.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So the shut-ins were anticipated, just the duration of it was not?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Correct.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. And then...", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "David, I just want to add to that. One of the challenges is, with these pads, the shut-ins are longer in duration than we're typically used to, and it's more significant than it's been to us historically. Some of these shut-ins, if you are on some of these significant pads, you might be shutting in offset wells for a couple of months while you complete them. And that's a little different issue.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. Especially I would say operationally in the Permian. I think we're more used to it in the Woodford because that's how we've been developing our acreage. We do multi-section development, so we anticipate the significant shut-ins. Honestly, up until this year in the Permian most of our shut-ins were always associated with a one-off parent well, and typically then we'd only experience a week of shut-in. Now when you go to major six-well developments like Wood, and then you incur a little bit longer time because of the frac design change, that certainly then led to far longer shut-ins than we typically had been used to. Obviously now we're adjusting, and we will plan for it accordingly, going forward. But that's really what, hit us pretty hard in the Permian here, in this last few quarters.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "And gaining a better understanding of the wells that will most likely be associated with that operation, to be shut-in.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I appreciate that. And my last one was just, you talked about the three rigs, I guess, running in Meramec next year to HBP, and I guess want to delineate. Can you just remind us how much of your acreage will be held, then, with the three rigs? And then I guess with the one delineation well, I guess you're testing various pilots. What area of your acreage do you think there's sort of the most debate about that you'd like to do some density tests on, and to which zones?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Let me be clear in terms of my statement. The three rigs that I referred to will be holding acreage while delineating Meramec acreage, it's kind of a combination of two things. Those three rigs through the end of the year will pretty much ensure that we keep all of our Meramec acreage intact, with those three rigs throughout the rest \u2013 all of 2017. The fourth rig that will run in Anadarko will more \u2013 most of the time be dedicated to more Woodford drilling in areas where we're testing other Woodford concepts. Again, the three rigs will be both holding acreage but also delineating, in a sense, because we still have areas in the Meramec that we'd like to get results in and get a good idea of how well it will perform.", "I will say that a lot of our acreage holding in the Meramec will be in more of that northwest part of the map, that's where we got out ahead a couple years ago, that's where a lot of our term acreage is. And so that area where I think previously we announced the Peterson well, as well as the People's well. We have a lot of acreage to hold up in that area, so we have a lot of rigs headed \u2013 a lot of drilling to do next year in that area.", "And so far, both ourselves as well as some of our competitors have announced some very impressive wells in that area. So inasmuch as we're holding acreage, we're holding acreage with what appears to be some really good rate-of-return opportunities with the rigs we'll be running there.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks very much for that color, John. I appreciate the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom, just coming back again to the 2017 guidance \u2013 and I wanted to touch on slide six really quickly \u2013 can you help clarify what oil growth looks like, relative to total growth in MBOEs next year?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "No. We didn't give specifics on oil growth, Jason, but if \u2013 what I said is, we're talking about a top-line growth number, and oil growth that underpins that that will be substantially larger than that top-line number. We'll give some color on that on our next call. But I will go ahead and tell you we're pleased with what we're seeing in oil growth for 2017, but I think I'd like to defer specifics until we can come back at you with much more detail on our capital program. Was I sufficiently evasive there, Jason?", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "No, I appreciate that and I appreciate. It's a bit of a moving target right now. But \u2013 and maybe sticking on that front, in the Cana, your partner yesterday led out a pretty optimistic picture with a nice step-up in oil yields relative to legacy production. So as you move beyond your current set of completions, can you just talk about how the Cana-Woodford fits from a capital allocation standpoint into next year, and maybe just the timing around your next set of completions?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I'll start and John will still add on to this. Certainly a lot of what we're looking at in the Woodford next year is on that eastern corridor, which is much oilier. It's offering outstanding returns, and I think you will see a joint project along that eastern corridor in 2017. And we're in the process of formulating that, but yeah, it'd be an oilier project. John?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. It's an exciting project because, as our partner elaborated \u2013 I saw their write-up on it \u2013 it is a long lateral development project. It's 10,000 foot laterals in an area where we get very good condensate yield, with very good rate of returns. I will tell you, the biggest questions we have regarding that, quite frankly, is how many wells per section do we want to put? Based on our previous results in what we call Row 4, Armacost Phillips, where we pushed the spacing even tighter, we've been very pleased with those results. Likewise the current developed section, the eastern core infill, our partner has a number of sections were they again are testing tighter spacing.", "Those results, as well as perhaps even some other things we want to test, might lead to even more wells per section within that development, which even makes it more appealing to us. So there's a lot of discussions with our partner about that, and we fully anticipate, certainly in the second half of next year, that we will be deploying rigs on that development project in the Cana area.", "Jason Smith - Bank of America", "Thanks, guys. Appreciate the answers.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess one more follow-up on the 2017 outlook. Certainly sounds, like you've said, your current view is preliminary and the bias is towards more activity. I am just curious on what sort of timing is required, in terms of how quickly you need to lean into that budget to really impact 2017 growth?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, Michael, that's a great question. Certainly these projects have fairly significant legs to executing and before you see production. I will tell you that our bias is sooner rather than later. I think that one of the lessons we've learned is these projects that are second-half projects that roll into the following year, it just adds noise to our reporting that is artificial. It has nothing to do with the quality of our assets, the quality of the program, but it's just noise. And so if we had a choice between getting something done early in the year or later in the year, I think you know where we're going to land there is earlier in the year. So between now and our next quarter we're going to be hard at work trying to line some things out. We would like to get it done so that we are not having these fourth-quarter discussions.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "Makes a lot of sense. And then I guess a follow up on my end, you've talked a bit about exploration in the prepared remarks, just curious kind of how you think about the exploration announcement that we all got regarding the area to the south of you in Culberson County, and potentially missing that opportunity? And then second question within that, is there a Woodford or Barnett possibility underlying your Culberson block?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I'll just say that we studied that play for a while, we've been watching the activity. As far as missing an opportunity, we could probably have a museum full of plays we've missed; that's just part of our business. We have a lot of respect for Apache and we root for them. I think it's an interesting concept, obviously they have some challenges between now and commerciality, but they've talked about that and they know how to do that. As far as other opportunities, I will let John handle that.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "We \u2013 internally we have quite a number of step-out exploration ideas that we're churning, and some quite \u2013 in fact, one that we're drilling on right now. These are \u2013 this is what we do as a company. We have tasked our regions and our groups to come up with new ideas, new exploration opportunities where quite frankly we could get ahead of the crowd and get reasonable leasing opportunities at reasonable cost and then take the risk on the drilling side. And we are doing that. And we have a number of those that we will be doing over the coming year. As typical for us, you won't hear a peep out of us about it until we ourselves have convinced ourself that we have something that is material to the company, and then only then will we talk about it.", "But rest assured, we are pursuing a number of exploration ideas, and we will always be doing that because, quite frankly, that's where we find we get the biggest bang for our buck from a value creation standpoint for this company.", "Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "Very good. Make sense. Appreciate it, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Allman of FBR. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Thank you. Hi, everybody.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Sorry if I missed this, but what is your preliminary guidance on other spending besides the $600 million for D&C? So in 2016 you're spending about $175 million on infrastructure and leasehold and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A and other. So what's the guidance for that for the same items for 2017?", "Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hi Joe, it's Mark. We'll give out guidance to the other components in the February call, but you're on the point as far as what we're incurring for other capital for this year. So it's \u2013 we still have to make some assumptions on, some leasehold assumptions as far as what leasehold acquisitions we want to build into our budget and so those components and production capital will have to be settled out as well. But we'll make those guidance figures when we give our February guidance.", "And also to make a point on the runway to $600 million, which we did give guidance for was drilling and completion capital only, and actually, as Arun actually asked earlier, that $175 million is total capital, which is not comparable to the $600 million of drilling and completion capital. We actually incurred $125 million of drilling and completion capital in the third quarter. That's the comparable number to the $600 million. So the run rate is for drilling and completion only of $600 million, and that's on a nine rig program.", "Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful, Mark. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning. Not to put a damper on wanting to spend more, but I actually thought 9% to 13% 2017 growth on a flat spend was rather impressive. Can you characterize what portion of the growth is completion carryover from 2016? Maybe improved year-over-year well performance, or other factors like more efficient D&C?", "Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "That's a hard number to dissect, which is the component of carryover completion capital. We will be having a nice ramp into the fourth quarter from the wells we're completing by December, as Joe mentioned; by exit rate would be over a Bcf a day, so we're going to have a nice ramp going into next year, but dissect what component of next year is volume contributions from carryover activity versus improved performance, it's hard to dissect that.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I mean, there are some. Clearly we borrowed a little from 2016 into 2017 in our capital spending level, but it's not a bunch. We just haven't calculated that.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is Joe. What I would say there is that Q3 of 947 Mmcfe, and I mentioned December at over 1 Bcfe, so there's 50 million cfe a day of brand-new production just entering 2017, and there's still a climb (61:24) into the first quarter with the other carryover that I mentioned of the ten wells coming into 2017. So I wouldn't be surprised, if we dissect it, that there's a fair percentage that it is carryover.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Maybe another way to think of it, this may be getting out over our skis too early, but based on what you are thinking about now, if you did do a nine-rig program, if that's what it ultimately ended up being, could you create similar growth in 2018?", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "On a nine-rig program, a similar type growth into 2018 I think would be difficult.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "But again, that's \u2013 we haven't really gone into detail there. The thing that we like where we sit right now, as we look at our assets, at current conditions, we're in an environment where spending within cash flow, we can generate growth and great profitability. And that's something that a couple of years ago, if you had said, in a $50 oil environment, was that a possibility, we'd have been pretty challenged to say yes. But it's really a testament to the quality of our assets and what our organization's done in innovation on our stimulations, but also getting our cost structure down, that LOE decrease is significant to us in what it does to our margins. So just leading into your opening question, we are pretty pleased with what the landscape looks to us as we model out-years.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "It sounds like you've got great flexibility and we'll look forward to see how it \u2013 how the next couple of months unwind. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Just on the 2017, to hit one last item, on the non-op spend, some of your partners have talked about what could be a pretty material ramp in 2017 in a rig count. How do you guys think about that, and how much of that has been factored into that $600 million?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. First off, I'll just simply say in the Permian we don't have a lot of non-op that necessarily drives our program. We're basically 100% operators on most of our acreage besides the Culberson JDA with Chevron, but in Culberson we are the operator since we dictate the budget there. The bigger issue clearly is in Anadarko. First off, of course, we have an AMI partnership with Devon, and we work hand in hand; we are constantly feeding each other exactly our plans. And so we are able to easily put that into our budget forecasting.", "The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec is, yes, there's a lot of \u2013 all of a sudden we are getting hit with a lot of outside-operated wells scattered throughout that play. A lot of activity. That has caused probably little bit more capital what we originally planned, but it's not a huge component. But we'll certainly \u2013 we will be accounting for that going into next year, as well. I will point out again, just like I said early in the Permian, what you will see shake out in Anadarko is once everybody gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps, or trying to block up, and then that gives you big greater control again over your capital plans.", "So in the short, we do account for it. We recognize it, but I don't see it as being a major component, or something that's going to completely lead to a large outspend for us.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, no, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the Permian side. You guys make a note in the presentation that you're revaluating 28,000 acres in Ward County. Could you provide some more color about what the revaluation process is?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, this is Tom. We've talked about that. We do have some new ideas, and Ward \u2013 Ward again is looking very interesting to us. And all I can say there is, stay tuned.", "We had said in past years that Ward was challenged for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is some of the prior development, and that it would take a new idea in order for Ward to again be at the front of our plate, front burner, and right now it's front burner.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "And is that driven by new completion techniques, or is it more on drilling or something else?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well it's kind of all of the above. And we're having to tests some things. So we will be commenting on that in future calls.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just on the 2017, I know we will get more color in February, but there is $700 million of cash on the balance sheet, so we think about your potential desire \u2013 assuming we do see some stability \u2013 to lean in, is all that on the table, or how should we think about the magnitude of potential outspend?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, It's all on the table. We raise that capital to bring our net asset value forward, and that's still what it's sitting there waiting to do. Now we'll probably deploy that over a couple of years; I don't think you see us say, hey, Katy bar the doors we're going to run through that money in one year. But I think that is certainly there, poised for meaningful acceleration, and that's our bias. I mean, that's what we want to do. We have no interest in keeping cash on our balance sheet.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great, very clear. Thanks guys. Take care.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Hanson of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hanson - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just inking about the mix there of long versus \"short\" laterals as we head into 2017, I guess all else equal your preference is for long laterals, I think you said that in the past. But as we think about the 2017 plan, one versus 1.5 versus two-mile laterals, if you could comment on that, that would be great?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. This is John. It's very simple; if the acreage is there and allows us to, we always plan to go two miles. It's just that simple. We are that convinced that our best rate of returns that we can achieve is by drilling a two-mile lateral.", "Quite frankly, some of the drilling want to go longer than 2 miles, and we talk about doing even that, and we may eventually test a longer than a two-mile lateral. But the simple answer is, if the acreage allows us \u2013 and fortunately the majority, the vast majority of our acreage allows us \u2013 then it is our preference to go long. The only time you're going to us consciously choose not to drill a long lateral is like some of these spacing pilot tests, where we're trying to get vital information on how tight to put the wells next to each other. And quite frankly, the length of the lateral doesn't really dictate that result. And so in that regard, we kind of see that as an efficient way to spend our capital, is just to do it is a 5,000 and get the result, and then leverage that quickly to 10,000-foot laterals in development.", "So I guess the simplest answer is yes, our bias in any opportunity or any chance is to go long with our wells. And almost \u2013 the vast majority of all the wells that we'll drill in 2017 will be extended laterals, in both basins.", "Mark Hanson - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Karen Acierno for any closing remarks.", "Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, Nan, and thanks everybody for joining us. Tom, I don't know if you had anything that you wanted to close with as well?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, Karen. I just want to thank you for your interest. We're pretty excited about the landscape ahead of us, and we really do look forward to our next call. We're going to be hard at work between now and then. Given I know there's been a lot of questions about 2017, we kind of opened a can of worms with what we have said today, and hopefully you've gotten a flavor of just the quality of our program, and we'll come back with a lot more detail here on our next call.

Please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno", "Good morning. And welcome to the Cimarex\u2019s second quarter 2017 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our Web site yesterday; we will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements; a number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2017 later today.", "So today, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions. So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Jorden", "Thank you, Karen. Thank you to all of you here on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our operation and outlook as well as answering your questions. Cimarex had another very good quarter production for the second quarter averaged 1,156 million cubic feet per day or 193,000 Boe per day. This was above the high end of our guidance range driven by continued improvement in our well results, un-drawing excellence in our field execution and timing of our well completions. As a result, we are modestly increasing our full year production guidance to 1,120 to 1,140 million cubic feet per day or 187,000 to 190,000 Boe per day. Our full year exploration and development capital remains unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.", "I\u2019d like to take a minute to comment on two topics which have particular interest during this earnings season, infill development well performance and gas ore ratio or GORs. First, a few comments on infill well spacing. As the Delaware Basin and stack place have developed most of the headline grabbing well results have been parent wells. These parent wells standalone and although representative of the reservoir deliverability and completion efficiency, they may not be good indicators of expected well response in infill development. Parent wells are unbounded by nearby wells and therefore do not compete for reserves with nearby wells. As infill development wells are drilled, they may exhibit interference with one another and consequently reduce performance compared to the unbounded parent well. In each area, we seek to find that ideal infill well spacing that optimizes resource capture, rate of return and net present value. The ideal infill well spacing is a function of reservoir properties, completion techniques and commodity pricing. It is a non-unique solution.", "At Cimarex, we've put tremendous effort into optimizing our infill development well recoveries and economics. Most of this effort has been focused on understanding the down-hole physics of our stimulations. Our goal is to generate highly efficient near wellbore stimulations and maximize the value for developed sections. You'll hear about some of these results during this call.", "We want to focus on results, actual well production and actual cost. The asset test of the success or failure of any infill development pilot lies in how we use the learnings in the planning and execution of the next spacing pilot. Are we putting our next batch of development wells closer together or farther apart? We are very pleased with the progress of our teams in this regard. Across our asset base, our next generation of infill development pilots is testing tighter well spacing and additional development zones.", "We are pushing the envelope based upon our growing understanding. Jon will discuss our results as well as upcoming pilots. Each infill development pilot tests something new. As I said, the goal is to maximize resource recovery, minimize well to well interference and increase the economic value of our projects. Furthermore, by pushing well spacing tighter and tighter, we further expand our deep inventory of top tier drilling locations. As always, results are what count.", "Secondly, I'd like to say a few words regarding the ongoing discussion of GOR. We've been at this a long time and detailed reservoir of our management, engineering and forecasting are in our DNA. Our current drilling and completion activity spans two prolific basins with deferring in situ hydrocarbon types, reservoir properties, pressure regimes and depths. GOR is not a one size fits all issue and can exhibit tremendous variability depending among the fluid phase and the reservoir among other factors.", "The phenomenon of decreasing yield or increasing GOR is different for each area for each pressure regime, for each reservoir and for each completion style. All of our type curves all of our forecasts and all of our economics account for either decreasing yield overtime or an increasing GOR overtime. And we performed look-backs our historical production to make sure that we are properly modeling these effects. We have intentionally studied this issue for many, many years and are confident that we are properly accounting for these phenomena in our reserve bookings and in our type curves.", "Finally, let me make a few comments about capital investment as we look ahead into 2018. This has been a subject of much discussion during the past few months with some voices issuing a siren-call for the industry to exercise capital discipline in response to the macro oil environment. Capital discipline is one of those catch phrases that mean something different to everyone who utters it. Although, we\u2019re not prepared to give a specific outlook for 2018 capital, I can offer some thoughts on how we approach the problem.", "In 2016 and 2017, year-to-date, we have achieved excellent returns in our capital investments even by historical standards. As we look back on the past five years, our 2016 and 2017 returns exceed the returns we achieve during the halcyon days of 2013 and early 2014. This is due to significantly increased well productivity, lower cost and the growing capital efficiency of our infill development projects. We stress test every investment down to $40 and $30 flat NYMEX oil and $250 and $2 flat NYMEX gas to ensure our return on capital, if prices were to fall further.", "Cimarex is moving forward with a great investment portfolio, a deep inventory and a commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. The macro environment will do what it may, we will navigate through it. It makes no sense for us to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better macro environment. If each company responds individually to the quality of their investment opportunities and manages their balance sheet as they individually see fit, free markets will sort out the macro; some will succeed and some will fail; Cimarex is moving ahead. We are committed to be clear and transparent on these and other topics in our investment communications. We look forward to entertaining any follow-up questions you may have on development infill spacing, GOR or any other topics.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John for operational detail.", "John Lambuth", "Thanks, Tom. I\u2019ll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results and plans for remainder of 2017. During the second quarter, Cimarex invested $296 million on exploration and development activities. About 54% of our second quarter capital was invested in the Permian region with the rest going for activities in the Mid-Continent region.", "We invested $216 million of the $296 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Companywide, we brought 51 gross, 18 net wells on production during the second quarter of 2017. Our 2017 exploration and development budget is unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion with $850 million to $950 million still earmarked for drilling and completing wells. For the full year, we plan to invest 62% of our capital in the Permian region with remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent. We currently operate 14 gross rigs, eight in the Permian region and six in Mid-Continent.", "Now on to some specific well results. I\u2019ll start in the Permian region where we have exciting results to share with you, regarding another successful down-spacing project in the Upper Wolfcamp. This pilot took place on the Pagoda state lease and Reeves County, Texas. We drilled four 10,000 foot laterals testing the equivalent of 16 wells per section spacing. As mentioned in our press release, these wells had an average 30 day peak initial production of 1,922 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 956 barrels per day was oil or 50%.", "Slide 20 shows the performance of these wells since coming online in late April. As you can see after 60 days, this pilot is performing as well as the Wood State development, which tested 12 wells per section. Based on the Pagoda results, we now plan to test the equivalent of 18 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp in the nearby Snowshoe section. This spacing pilot will consist of eight 10,000 foot laterals stacked/staggered in three different ventures within the Upper Wolfcamp. This pilot will spud in the fourth quarter of 2017 with first production expected in third quarter of 2018.", "In Culberson County, we continue to delineate our Upper Wolfcamp acreage with two 10,000 foot laterals coming on line in the second quarter. These two wells achieved an impressive average 30 day peak IP rate of 2,950 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 51% was oil. Staying on the Culberson County area, the Lower Wolfcamp, Tim Tam pilot, has been on production for a little over six months. As shown, on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 17 of the presentation, these infill wells are performing as well as nearby parent wells with similar landing zones.", "Our learnings from the Tim Tam pilot have helped us design our next Lower Wolfcamp pilot. Called Animal Kingdom, this eight well 10,000 foot lateral pilot will be testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing between wells and a bench plus adding an additional landing zone in the top port of the Lower Wolfcamp, a zone that we used to refer to as Wolfcamp C. A wine rack display for this pilot can be seen on page 17 of our presentation. We plan to spud this pilot in the fourth quarter of 2017 with first production expected in the second quarter of 2018.", "In Lea County, New Mexico between now and year-end, we plan to drill two 10,000 foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp in our Red Hills acreage block. The results of these wells will go a long ways to helping us finalize a plant Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot on this acreage with our preliminary design calling for testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section and one landing zone. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be spudding an avalanche spacing pilot that will be testing to equivalent of 20 wells per section, and a stacked/staggered pattern within one zone.", "Now on to the Mid-Continent. We continue to grow Meramec wells that both delineate, while holding our Meramec term lease position. We completed seven Meramec wells in the second quarter of which four were 10,000 foot laterals. These four wells achieved an average 30 day IP rate of 2,073 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 52% was oil. We continue to be on frac to HBP all of our Meramec for makers by the end of this year.", "And then finally, wells in our Woodford eight well increased density pilot that is testing both 16 and 20 Woodford wells per section are now online. Results from this pilot, along with a nearby two well Meramec Woodford stack test, will help determine our plans for future developments, including our operative sections adjacent to the upcoming Leota\u2010Jacobs drill. We will be participating in the three non-operative sections with an estimated spud date in December of 2017.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joe Albi", "Well, thank you John. And thank you all for joining our call today. I\u2019ll recap the usual items; our second quarter production; our updated 2017 production outlook; and then I\u2019ll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As Tom mentioned, we had a great quarter here in the second quarter. Our net equivalent production came in at 1.156 Bcfe per day that\u2019s beat our upper end of our guidance by 26 million a day and it\u2019s setting new records for total company production.", "With our focus on Permian and high liquids Mid-Continent projects, we saw a solid 11% sequential quarter increase in our oil production with oil volumes up in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Our total Company oil volumes had a record of 57,871 barrels per day. With the strong contribution from the Reeves County Pagoda state infill project, which John mentioned, our Q2 17 Permian net equivalent volume came in at 645 million a day, up 12% from Q1 17 and 27% from Q2 16. We brought on a total of 11 gross and 10 net Permian wells during the quarter, and we had 27 gross and 13 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.", "We also saw a nice gain in our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes with continued production adds from our East Cana infill project and our Meramec program. Our second quarter Mid-Continent net equivalent production came in at 509 million a day, up 5% from Q1 17. In total, we brought on 40 gross and eight net Mid-Continent wells during the quarter with 71 gross and 16 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.", "Looking forward into 2017, we've updated our model to incorporate Q2 results and our projected drilling and completion schedule for the remainder of the year. With that, we've increased our full year guidance to 1.12 Bcfe to 1.15 Bcfe per day, that's up from the 1.09 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf per day reported in our last call and it reflects the 16% to 18% increase over the 963 million a day that we reported in 2016.", "With our 2017 capital focused on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects, we continue to project significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent for the remainder of the year, forecasting total company year-over-year oil production growth in the range of 24% to 29%. Our projected 2017 capital allocation remained skewed with 62% to the Permian and 37% to the Mid-Continent. We anticipate bringing 61 net Permian wells and 34 net Mid-Continent wells online during 2017.", "As we mentioned in last call, we're forecasting Permian and Mid-Continent continent completion activity to ramp up here in late Q3 and into Q4. And as a result, we're modeling Q3 volumes to be relatively flat with Q2, followed by a very nice ramp in Q4. Third quarter volumes are projected to range between 1.1 Bcfe to 1.14 Bcfe per day with forecasted Q4 volumes to be in the neighborhood of 1.16 Bcfe to 1.20 Bcfe per day, a strong 21% to 25% increase over Q4 16. With 44 net wells projected to be either drilling or waiting on completion at the end of the year, we anticipate having a great bit of momentum going into 2018.", "Jumping over to OpEx. Our second quarter lifting cost came in at $0.59 per Mcfe, that's just below the lower end of our guidance of $0.60 Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe and down from our first quarter average of $0.65. Although, we are seen some recent cost pressures in items such as water hauling, well servicing and equipment and maintenance, we kept our lifting cost in check during the quarter and we\u2019ll continue our focus to maintain the reduced operating cost structure we've worked so hard at obtaining and have been able to achieve.", "The remaining year guidance, we've kept our previous lifting cost range of $0.60 Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe, which takes into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses and our 2017 focus on high-liquid projects. And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. As compared to Q1, most drilling cost components remained relatively flat with the exception of tubulars, which are up 10% to 12% and wire line services, which have increased around 15% to 20% during the quarter. To help offset any growing cost increases, we\u2019re keeping our focus on drilling efficiencies. As an example, in our Wolfcamp program, we\u2019ve reduced the medium days from spud to rig release from 29 days in 2016 to 25 days in 2017.", "With completion cost, representing 60% to 70% of our total well cost, we continue to refine our completion designs to offset the recent cost pressures we\u2019ve seen. All the while, we remain focused on improving well productivity. We\u2019ve been able to offset a good portion of the service and prop cost increases by utilizing fewer stages and pumping zipper fracs where we can, and continue to focus on long lead time planning to ensure adequate prop sourcing and availability.", "That said, as compared to Q4 \u201916, market increases have increased our average per well frac cost by approximately 300,000 to 500,000 per well, which again is dependent on so many variables, such as lateral length, number of stages, pounds pumped, chemical, et cetera. After incorporating market and completion design changes, as well as our continued efficiency gains, we\u2019ve made some slide modifications to our total well cost estimates. In the Permian, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $10.5 million to $12 million with a slightly raising the upper end of the range from last call for market, while keeping the low end the same for efficiencies gained for zipper fracs, water recycling and multiple well facilities.", "With the design change to much larger fracs in our Bone Spring program, we\u2019ve raised our current 1-mile lateral AFEs to a range of $5.5 million to $6.7 million. In Cana, with efficiencies and completion design changes, we\u2019ve dropped the low end of our Woodford 1-mile lateral AFE to $7.3 million while keeping the upper end at $8 million. And with design changes and efficiency gains in the Meramec, we\u2019re keeping the low end of our over 2-mile lateral AFE at $10 million, while lowering the upper end to $11.5 million.", "In closing, we had a great second quarter. We\u2019re seeing results of our oil focused development program, which generated another production beat for us in Q2 and is targeted to provide us with a nice production ramp here into Q4. With a forecasted strong second half year production, as a springboard, we\u2019re projecting year-over-year production growth of 16% to 18% and a very strong start to 2018. We will stay vigilant for our cost and maximize the returns from our program, despite the changes we are seeing day-to-day in the market. We stay excited and confident about our program and our 2017 results.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call open to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now being the question-and-answer session. Please remember to limit yourself to one question and one follow up [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Arun Jayaram", "Tom, my first question is in the Mid-Continent. I want to get your thoughts on the Leota Jacobs pad. I think Devon had talked about 40 to 50 gross wells would have been theirs and then maybe four to five drilling units. How are you thinking about your participation in that project? And if you don\u2019t, where would you think about allocating that capital relative to this year with to be 62% in the Permian and 37% in the Mid-Continent?", "Tom Jorden", "I\u2019ll just gear key it for John. We really like that project, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re just looking at as we go into 2018. And it's really going to have more impact on 2018, at this point, almost minimal impact on \u201917. We haven\u2019t made a decision as to what we\u2019re going to do with those two operated sections. But I\u2019ll let John comment on that.", "John Lambuth", "First and foremost, I want to again emphasize when we look at that project, we like very much the rate of return that that project generates. From a long lateral perspective, a more liquid rich area of Woodford, it looks very attractive for us. But we have a lot of moving parts. We have our latest spacing pilot that I mentioned that\u2019s testing much tighter spacing in the Woodford. It is flowing back right now in the coming months, I think we\u2019ll start to get a strong understand of what that impact would have on future spacing in the Woodford. And quite frankly, if it shows, we can go a lot tighter than that almost leads to how many specs as we could do.", "And then secondly, we have what I would mention, which is a stack Woodford Meramec little tests that where we\u2019re continually looking at the frac and the frac order and understanding if we\u2019re going to co-develop. Because we still think for maybe Meramec potential there is well, so there is a lot of moving parts there. And then the last part we look at is just the overall capital that we would invest in such a large project and the cycle times to it. We\u2019re very, very comfortable again with participating with Devon on the initial free sections. We\u2019re just now asking ourselves how much more do we want to then operate.", "And as Tom mentioned, we really, quite frankly, don\u2019t need to make that decision to later this year for if whether we do one or two additional operative sections, we will not be deploying rigs on that until at the earliest second quarter \u201818. So we have a little time here before we have to make an ultimate decision of how we\u2019re going move forward with that project.", "Arun Jayaram", "And my follow up. Tom, in the Permian we\u2019ve learned the importance of the execution really this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about some of -- it sounds as you\u2019re saying in terms -- you talked about cost in terms of OSS availability and how that could impact the industries cycle times. And also I was wondering if you could maybe just elaborate on your management of water in the Permian, and what\u2019s the unique about your water strategy?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, those are couple of good questions. I\u2019ll give a overview and then John, Joe I am sure want to comment. The managing of the oil field services, we manage through good relationships. We use major service providers and we give them plenty of advance notice on the resources we\u2019ll need. We have constant interactive conversation, and really if managed through good relationship management. We have not to-date chosen to unbundle our services. So we still look at major service providers that give us soup to nut service. And although we\u2019re constantly evaluating that, right now, that\u2019s our approach and we think it\u2019s working for us.", "On the water side, we put lot of energy into water management, both the sourcing and disposal side. I think we\u2019ve got some very creative environmentally responsible solutions that we\u2019re implementing. And it\u2019s a challenge. As we go into these big development projects, it's one thing to say how much water each project requires, it's another logistical challenge to deliver that water at the pace we needed, particularly when you\u2019re on pad drilling with zipper fracs. And with that, I'll let Joe comment on either one of those issues.", "Joe Albi", "Tom, I think hit it right on the head. What we started to do is keep ongoing solid business relationships with service providers that we've known over the years and trust. On the frac side, I think we talked about this in prior calls. We\u2019re not want to jump from two crews to three to four to five to six, and then back to three. We\u2019re currently running four crews right now and have a very consistent operation going where we\u2019re moving the crews between the two different areas, we know the crews they know our operations that it becomes and efficient operation. By doing that, we\u2019re not constantly out in the market trying to find fleets.", "In particular, like on the completion side, if we were to go out and trying out of a fleet, I'm guessing we\u2019d be looking at three to four weeks before we could line one up and have it on a well location. If we do that add it and then drop it, it's not really doing us much good. And this why we\u2019re able to work our completion schedule no different than we would our rigs schedule, shuffling wells around optimizing fleets that we have. That relationship that we have with our serviced provider for the fracs and stimulation, we've been able to ensure adequate prop sourcing and availability by long lead times planning and let them use their size and scale to procure the supplies that we need, and that\u2019s worked out just fine.", "It's pretty much the same on the drilling side, the providers that we\u2019re using are all established providers that we have solid business relationships and have had over the years. They know we\u2019re going to have an active drilling program year-over-year after year and that just pays off in stage as far as been able to obtain rigs and keep them working. So I don\u2019t know if that help answer your question, but that should be the thoughts that I would add.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Neal Dingmann", "Tom, my first question for you or Jon, I was just looking at I think it was on slide 10 where you just talked about the change or actually not much change really in profit over the years I guess. Just one slight change I did see was in the Woodford where you took the prop down a little bit. Could you just talk about that? It seems like nothing all, but others are starting to do back away a little bit on profit and still seen equally as good wells, if you could just, Jon, if you and Tom could just comment on the completion technique around there?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. I guess as I've always say when this question comes up, stand pounds for the lateral foot is an interesting statistic, but it's not one honestly when we talk about our completion designs we focus on. We really focus all our attention on the cluster, the amount of sand per cluster, how many per stage in order to get the most effective stimulation to achieve, like Tom mentioned, that near bore-hole conductivity and then high productivity an offshoot of that design then is our -- then you then get sand for lot of foot.", "We don\u2019t really design for that. And again, we look at it just in terms of what sand per cluster what achieves at best. I guess you could -- by the numbers, it looks were flattening out. If I felt like then we can get a better approve well by adding sand and we would do that. Right now, most of our changes are along like I said the number of clusters, how many can we treat within the stage, just become a very important thing we look at because again that helps on the cost side of it. But in the end, it's still the result of the well, so that's kind of we're at today.", "Neal Dingmann", "And then just looking at slide 13, where you talked about just the Lower Wolfcamp, the Tim Tam infill and again, certainly performed very well. Could you talk about in that area and Tom, I think you were talking about potentially further infill projects. I don't know number one, what's the plan for further infill projects around that area? And if so, will most of those continue to be in the Lower Wolfcamp?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, John will give you little more color that. But that Animal Kingdom he mentioned that's a Lower Wolfcamp project it's just south of Tim Tam. The volume rack for that is on slight 17, page 17. That's a significant test for us, because it tests three landing zones in that Lower Wolfcamp. That Lower Wolfcamp is prolific over just about all this acreage. It yield or oil content will change over the acreage but we see it as a very strong economically viable target throughout this asset, particularly with 10,000 foot laterals. So we're pretty excited about this Animal Kingdom test. John do you want to\u2026", "John Lambuth", "The only other comment I'd make is I just can't tell you how excited we are about the Tim Tam. As you can see on the display on page 17, in my remarks, I talked about how the infill wells are matching the parents. Quite frankly they're exceeding the parents now. So I think this just speaks to -- this is really all with our frac design and we've really homed in with this interval in terms of the appropriate frac design to lead to achieve that type of result. And give us the confidence to go even tighter, both between wells and to add that third bench as we're about to do in Animal Kingdom.", "So yes, we're very excited about the opportunities that here in the Lower Wolfcamp as we are with the Upper Wolfcamp of course in Culberson. And as I keep reminding folks, the nice thing is they are completely independent, the upper and the lower from a development standpoint, meaning we can develop one and come back at a much later date and develop the other and have no intention upon the production stream from the other interval. So it's a great position.", "Neal Dingmann", "So would that mean you would have one, I mean you did infill on each, you\u2019d have one still a separate parent on each of those then?", "John Lambuth", "Well, in terms of parents, we probably in each area have one parent as an earning well to hold our acreage, early-on on this acreage in order to ensure that we held our entire Wolfcamp rights a lot of lease called for the, essentially you got to the deepest depth that's why a lot our early wells weren\u2019t Lower Wolfcamp. We're at a point now where we have great optionality to choose where we want to go with those bore holes in that acreage. And like I said, we may choose to go develop an Upper Wolfcamp interval first and then come back many years later and develop lower. We're in a very good position to have that optionality there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew Venker", "I want to just chop on the questions around inflation and service providers. You obviously sound like you're very happy with having an integrated service offering as that helps you in a lot of ways. But you also alluded to self sourcing some of those elements. So just curious if you think self sourcing would actually lead to cost savings, keeping in mind that it might lead to other issues. Or is it really minimal potential amount of savings and the execution benefit is really why you stick with integrating providers?", "Joe Albi", "When you look at the frac, you\u2019ve got the water, the sand and then for the most part, the service cost. The water we are self sourcing and we\u2019re doing everything we can to be as efficient with not only the source of the water but been able to recycle the water and optimize and reduce our cost there. I mentioned that we\u2019re procuring our sand basically through business relationships that we have. If we were to breakout the components of the frac into service cost and sand and look at the average cost per well, the real driver in the same are service costs.", "And what we\u2019ve seen is that we saw a rapid increase in the dollars per stage to pump our frac from Q4 into the tail end of the first quarter. And that same has seem to have flat toed, and we believe that it has a very good chance of staying that way for the remainder of the year. What we\u2019re doing to offset that is kind of and everything John said as a result of our completion design changes, not necessarily because the cost but because of the design changes, we\u2019re pumping less sand, so that cost the well has gone down.", "We\u2019re pumping fewer stages so we\u2019ve been able to reduce the overall impact of those cost and the bottom line is that when you look at our average cost to pump a frac job per well even though we\u2019ve seen way over 20%, 30%, 40% increases in some of these cost items, we kept our completion cost in check. And so that\u2019s the angle that we\u2019re taking and we believe it\u2019s working well for us.", "Tom Jorden", "This is an ongoing discussion, and our answer is certainly not ideological. If we felt like it was a real add to our rate of returns to unbundle and source these individually, we would do that and we look at that on ongoing basis. But I\u2019ll just make -- I will make one philosophical comment. Our organization is effective because of its focused and we\u2019re lean and that makes us a better company than if we had laid out parts of the organization far and wide. We manage by eye contact and we are a discipline focus company.", "So if you tell me we\u2019ll have a group of people that are going to be distracted by worrying about what truck fleet will bring sand from one mine to our location, I really have those people worry about efficiency of our completions, efficiency of our production and gaining our well performance the absolute top tier that it did. So there is a little bit of a philosophical bias towards focusing here. And if we have good vendors, I can do that and if the close call on cost, we\u2019re probably going to maintain our focus on things that really count.", "Drew Venker", "And then on the Culberson County Upper Wolfcamp, you talked about a nice couple of well results this quarter. Can you talk about how that zone currently stacks up within your opportunity set? And are there any meaningful design change with those two wells that drove the stronger performance?", "John Lambuth", "I mean we really like the outcome. And what I really like is I think people have noted we continue to get even better those wells. And so yes we continue to tanker with both the completion design but also the landing zone within that Upper Wolfcamp interval. We\u2019re a little bit -- later in our understanding a bit like we are in the lower, so we\u2019re still coming up the learning curve. With each change we make, it\u2019s just keeps getting better and better. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with -- the latest results in that interval and the fact that it seems to now be an interval that seems very perspective over all of our acreage throughout that Culberson JDA, which I don\u2019t know that we could have said that a year-ago. So it's really turned into a top tier opportunity for us throughout that asset there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann with Scotia Howard Weill. Please go ahead.", "Jeb Bachmann", "Tom, just to close it up I guess on the service side, talk about mitigating cost. Just wondering, are you guys looking at maybe using some of the localized sand products that are going to be available on larger quantities in 2018 doing san that kind of stuff to help lower completion cost?", "Tom Jorden", "Yes, we've looked at that. We haven\u2019t used that local sand yet. I think others have talked about it. We've looked at crushing strength of that sand, and it\u2019s couple of thousand PSI less than what we\u2019re currently sourcing. We will -- that maybe okay and we may experiment with it, but we haven\u2019t done that just yet. Joe, do you want to add to that?", "Joe Albi", "The only thing I would add is I think most all of those deals, if you will, are going to require some kind of commitment or certain poundage over some period of time. We don\u2019t make that many commitments and when we make them, we fulfill them. And we want to be able to have flexibility to start-stop, do whatever we need to without having some overhead. So to the extent that we\u2019d require committing to large volumes of sand on a frequent consistent basis, it's something where you look hard and long before we even think about doing.", "Jeb Bachmann", "And I guess my follow-up and I'll try to get an answer for this one. But the Northern New Mexico play that you guys have built an acreage position in that I guess you talked about you participating in a well going forward, or doing that well. Can you give any details on that at this point?", "John Lambuth", "I would just simply say we have a lot of different opportunities in the Mexico. I mean I can also tell you that we have quite a few wells coming up in the Mexico. But in particular, I think the well you\u2019re talking about is one that we have drilled and we\u2019re evaluating. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ll really say about it right down.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Michael Hall", "First, I wanted to ask on the -- in the context of all the development pilots you have ongoing with, the Animal Kingdom pilot, in particular, adding that Wolfcamp C inerrable. Is that -- I'm just trying to understand little bit I guess the thought process behind that. Is it something where you feel like you potentially need to develop that concurrently with D and therefore, you are seeing how they could develop pattern would look and perform? Or is it just something where you think you potentially can enhance the fractured network by layering those intervals on top of one another? Just trying to understand a little better the thought process on that.", "John Lambuth", "And in some ways in doing this pilot, we\u2019re going to try to answer all those questions. First, let me just take it real quick. We, in the past, have had excellent results in the lower Wolfcamp, especially and what we would call the lower D or D4 member. And up until recently, we have struggled some in the C member, the upper part of lower. But now we have some newer well results that\u2019s given us a lot of encouragement that that particular bench looks as perspective economically as the rest of the lower Wolfcamp, which is why we want to go after and do this test, to add that additional bench there. And as you alluded to convince ourselves exactly how best do we have to develop, but do we have to do it all at once or can we do it independently. Our suspicions is that at that particular lower Wolfcamp is one continuous hydrocarbon system, so it they may be most effective if we co-develop it altogether. But that\u2019s what we want to test, that\u2019s what the Animal Kingdom is designed to tell us.", "Tom Jorden", "The way I think about this is, in my opening remarks I talked about parent wells always being the best indicators, but they\u2019re meaningful indicator. And the fact that our well responses on these infill projects are coming in so strong compared to those unbounded wells, is really something that there\u2019s some attention. It's speaking to our capital efficiency and the returns of this deep inventory. So when I look at the Animal Kingdom pilot, we look at that entire lower Wolfcamp system and being able to get 14 or more wells out of that. These wells individually stand in their own they\u2019re great returns. And so it\u2019s just efficient resource capture. We\u2019re really interested in that experiment, and it\u2019s a direct benefit to the science work we\u2019ve been going through the last couple of years.", "Michael Hall", "And then I also just wanted to hit on the GOR topic, and appreciate the new context provided in the opening remarks. I guess, there\u2019s been some commentary, some within the industry and investor group that condensate reservoirs could have somewhat different characteristics, and that\u2019s straight oil reservoirs that you\u2019ve see in the Midland Basin. And in that context, Culberson County has been brought up. Any commentary you can provide, specific to Culberson County, as it relates to oil yield over time and what give you confidence that retrograding will not be an issue overtime, and has not been in the past?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, let me just take a stab at and then John or Joe may want to jump in here. Our lens is rate to return. I mean this issue is interesting, but we properly model our response. I think many of you who have followed us know we do a very exhaustive annual look back, we go back 15 years and we update the production on every well we\u2019ve ever drilled. We update the cost, we update the commodity price file and produced into and we update our returns. And that\u2019s a really important exercise for us, because it levels and grounds our future decision.", "And we\u2019ve got a very confident analysis of our production history, including Culberson County. Culberson County does go from oil into reservoir to gas into reservoir. So there are varying issues around that play. But as long as we\u2019re properly modeling that stream, that hydrocarbon stream, rate of return is that lens that means something to us. And these are lights out outstanding rates of return. But specific to reservoir issues, I am going to let John or Joe either comment\u2026", "John Lambuth", "I\u2019ll just say real quick is, as Tom alluded, we have a large acreage position and a multi-variable hydrocarbon system there that any one well or project we looked at has its own design GOR or yield profile. We don\u2019t try to slab the same yield profile over life of the well across all that acreage, we would never do that; it\u2019s variable across the acreage depending upon both the pressure, we know that the reservoir to be at and the initial yield; and then from there, our expectation of what that yield will do overtime. And I\u2019m very proud to say because of like Tom said the look backs we do, the checks we do, I feel very confident, and the economics presented to me is a true representation of what that well and how well will perform, both on its gas and its oil.", "Joseph R. Albi", "I guess how I would answer that is, the phase behavior is different for all different types of hydrocarbon composition, as you know. Alluding to what Tom said if that phase behavior it's characteristics will ultimately show up in how wells produced. And so for using older wells and how they produce it's given us a DNA print of that phase behavior. Those are wells those forecasts are what we\u2019re using to predict our new wells. So in our mines, we are truly modeling in the phase behavior of the reservoir.", "The type curves that we put together are oil; the in place calculations that we make when we perform biometrics are oil; the recovery calculations that we come up with are based on oil; we\u2019re forecasting an oil curve; the gas relationships to that curve, the gas becomes a secondary hydrocarbon by-product. To the extent that GOR goes up, the well makes more gas for the same barrels of oil that we\u2019re forecasting. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. And the bottom line is what is those forecasts for oil and for gas ultimately, from a rate on return on our capital investment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Robertson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Robertson", "Tom, just the question is how you\u2019re thinking about the business now. It sounds like you\u2019re moving more towards bigger pilots where you will drill a number of wells that may have six to nine month type lead times. Can you just talk about how you balance the answers you\u2019re trying to get from those pilots and the capital that\u2019s required to implement them until production? And how that tracks in with sources and uses and things like that?", "Tom Jorden", "Well, that\u2019s a harder the matter, Jeff. It\u2019s frustrating, because these projects have long lead times. And so to the extent that you\u2019re trying to turnaround, one turnaround your investment, you make the investment you want to get cash flow as soon as possible. That lead time is hard to swallow. And then to the extent that you\u2019re testing a concept, we go crazy waiting for the results. And so we\u2019re trying to kind of parse them up in the byte size pieces. You\u2019ll see in the lot of our pilot, they maybe three, four, rather small experiments. That\u2019s a challenge in and of it-self because a meaningful infill pilot needs to have meaningful number of bounded wells. But there is no right answer there. But the good news is our returns, as I said at the outset, are moving up. I mean we really are in an era of very good returns on historical basis.", "So I\u2019m willing to live with that lumpiness as long as it\u2019s modeled-in in our return profile and the time value to money that\u2019s deployed in that infill project, it's properly accounted for then the lumpiness is with the lumpiness say. And we\u2019ve always tailored and spoken to that long-term investor then our stands at and isn\u2019t going to get nervous quarter-by-quarter. You\u2019re going to see a little bit of lumpiness. But we will generate consistent long-term returns. And then finally you asked about how we\u2019re viewing the business.", "We're probably in the new normal. We don\u2019t wake up every day and wait for that rescue ships. At the beginning of this downturn, 2014, I say at the time that we told our organization that the rescue ship is not coming we need to figure out how to make a living in this environment in these conditions, and not wait for the ship over the horizon. And that's kind of where we are. We can make a good living in this environment. Our assets can support it and we're moving ahead. I mean this is the new normal.", "Jeff Robertson", "Tom, do you show in terms of capital efficiency. Is there a sweet spot as far as what the size of these pilots needs to be for capital efficiency? Or is it more just getting you know what questions you\u2019re trying to get the answers to and figure out the right spacing to try to see if that provides the answers?", "Tom Jorden", "I am going to let John handle that one.", "John Lambuth", "Again, that's an excellent question, something that we looked at a lot in terms of -- and I wouldn\u2019t even use the word pilot, I would call development. I mean the reality is we're getting pretty close, saying Culberson and upper Wolfcamp to where we\u2019re thinking about development. And the things we look at is; how much at a time, a half section, a full section, two sections; the cycle time for that, the amount of capital it tied up; and then the optionality of it is, that even in our best interest to do it that way or is it better to do in multiple sections. And that's something we're putting a lot of effort into.", "And I'll tell you some of the things that govern that, doesn\u2019t even matter of capital, it's like someone mentioned before, can you source all the water you need to get that done, can you get enough frac crews, is it enough sand. So that's something we\u2019re putting a lot of attention to right now, because we see ourselves moving, making that progression to where it isn\u2019t pilots anymore, it's development. And I really, I think you could argue like in some areas we\u2019re already there. And so we're asking ourselves how much do we want to do at each time, and it is that optimal, both capital but also effected this at wells in terms of when you come later and drill next of them.", "I feel very good about where we\u2019re getting to, especially in Reeves and Culberson. And again, I think what you\u2019re going to see here us slowly talk about more about what development really likes on this large acreage position that we\u2019re fortunate to have.", "Tom Jorden", "Jeff, another thing I\u2019ll add is things go wrong and much as we hated, things go wrong. And so one of the challenges is, if you\u2019re going to march off on a 100 well project and first flow back is, by the time you\u2019re already committed to the full project and something wobbles off, it's not very pleasant. So you do like to get some feedback along the way, particularly if we\u2019re testing something new.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.", "Mat Portillo", "Just a quick question in regards to the Northern Delaware basin, I was hoping that we might be able to revisit a bit your delineation plans in the second half of the year. And specifically, it appears the industry having a bit of a renaissance in the central and northern part of Lea County. And I'm just curious as to your thoughts on some of the resource potential that might emerge in both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring horizons?", "John Lambuth", "We love it. We love the opportunity. We love our acreage position there. I can tell you that, for the remainder of the year, we will be drilling three Avalon, two Bone Springs and three Wolfcamp, upper Wolfcamp wells in New Mexico for the rest of the year. So we are moving up into there. And we\u2019re very, very excited about our acreage position and the returns. Likewise, as I mentioned, we have several pilots that we\u2019re envisioning up there. In fact, already committed to the Avalon pilot and we\u2019re still working on our Wolfcamp pilot. So we\u2019re getting there. But it\u2019s also nice, because as we keep saying, a lot of that acreage is HBP, so it is not bad to have others drill around you and pick their learnings so that when we get there, we\u2019re getting the maximum value out of our acreage. But we are moving in that direction with the rigs later this year.", "Tom Jorden", "Our Permian team has some pretty interesting wish list for Lea County as we enter 2018. We\u2019re looking at their proposals and we have an allocated capital. But it\u2019s pretty exciting when you look at what they want to do with some of these pilots. And again, as I said, the proofs in the pudding is to what the companies do on the follow ups, and they\u2019ve got some aggressive follow ups that they\u2019d like done up there. So that\u2019s we love it.", "Mat Portillo", "And then just a quick follow up question regards springs area, obviously an impressive early result there. And you mentioned an 18 well down spacing test in the Wolfcamp. Does that include any sand targets to the XY horizon, or is that just in the upper section of that Wolfcamp development?", "John Lambuth", "I think, again, we tend to think that as one contiguous hydrocarbon system. We tend to roll then those XY sands and our overall resource in place and feel pretty confident that based on our landing zone, especially in the upper part of the Wolfcamp that we\u2019re more than likely accessing those sands. I don\u2019t know that we necessarily have to put the lateral on the sand to assume that we\u2019re not accessing them. So in some ways what we\u2019re going to try next with the Snowshoe and adding that extra bench of wells, we are in some ways implying that we\u2019re intending to grow up in to that. And again, we see it as a phenomenal resource there. We really, really like what we see out of Pagoda\u2019s, which is why now we want to go ahead and move this quickly as we can test that even tighter spacing with the Snowshoe.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Tom Jorden", "I just want to thank everybody for your questions, a lot of good questions out there today. And look forward to updating you with future results. And thank you very much for your attention and support at Cimarex.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded.

Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the Cimarex Energy Third Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cimarex's third quarter 2017 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today.", "And as a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings, news releases, for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-Q for the three months ended September 30 later today.", "So as usual, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Mark Burford, our CFO is also present to help answer any questions.", "And just one reminder, so that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. You can always feel free to get back in the queue if you like.", "So with that I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all of you who are on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our operations and outlook as well as answering your questions.", "Cimarex had another very good quarter. Production for the third quarter averaged 1,143 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 190.5 MBoe per day. This was slightly above the high-end of our guidance range.", "Consequently, we are modestly increasing our full year production guidance to 1,134 MMcfe per day to 1,147 MMcfe per day, or 189 MBoe per day to 191 MBoe per day. 2017 production guidance has increased 5% at the midpoint since we first provided guidance in February. And our exploration and development capital is now expected to come in at $1.2 billion, the upper end of our original guidance given in February. This is a testament to the strong operating performance of our 2017 program.", "We are achieving excellent returns on our capital investments. Our current returns on both the well level and total program are better than those we achieved during the halcyon days of 2013 and 2014, which were of course in a much higher commodity price environment. These increased returns are due to significantly increased well productivity, lower costs, and the growing capital efficiency of our infill development projects.", "I'd like to refer you to a couple of new slides in our investor presentation to illustrate this point. I'll start with slide 9, which shows the improvement in productivity of our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp wells from 2013 to early 2017. Well productivity, when adjusted for lateral length, has increased 20% in that timeframe. We chose to show the average daily production per well for 180 days, instead of the usual 30 days, to give you a more complete picture of well performance.", "On the next slide, we've taken a look back to the third quarter of 2014 at what our forward looking returns were at that time for a 10,000-foot Wolfcamp well in Culberson County. We've compared those to our current estimated returns for that same well type today.", "We've used the same price forecast for both cases, $50 oil [per barrel], $2.50 gas [per mcf], and $17.50 (sic) [$16.67] per NGL barrel, all held flat for the life of the well. But we've kept everything else, well costs, production, LOE, drilling time, as it was or is in each appropriate timeframe.", "For example, our well cost peaked in the third quarter of 2014 at $13.5 million for a 10,000-foot Wolfcamp well, versus the $11.2 million today. As you can see, the well level returns have increased dramatically for both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp, again a testament to the productivity improvements we've achieved.", "We've recently been on the road, speaking with existing and prospective owners and have been impressed with the shift in investor sentiment in the past few months. There is a consistent theme around fundamental questions about the E&P business model, the philosophy around value creation, living within cash flow, managing through the commodity cycles, and making sure that companies have executive team incentives that are aligned with shareholder interest.", "At Cimarex, we welcome these conversations and the scrutiny they invite. It is entirely fair to challenge us to articulate our value proposition. Our mission is simple, to increase net asset value per share. We believe that the best way to accomplish this is to consistently invest capital at high rates of return. We account for unknown future commodity prices by stress testing our investments at draconian downside cases. Profitable investment of capital is our mission. Growth is a consequence of good investment decisions, not a primary goal.", "Our corporate culture is based upon results. There are two primary ingredients to superior results, great assets and an organization that is capable of executing on complex projects. Cimarex has both. We define results by achieved rates of return measured by objective, transparent analysis of fully burdened return on invested capital. Half cycle or drilling only returns are interesting, but they do not reflect the actual return on the capital invested. Fully burdened returns account for all investments, land, geoscience, infrastructure, salt water disposal systems, and overhead.", "Our shareholders do not see the difference between a 2,500 barrel of oil per day horizontal well and a company operated gathering system. It all boils down to a simple equation, capital in and cash flow out. Any analysis that fails to account for every single investment misrepresents actual returns.", "Companies that consistently achieve good fully burdened, full cycle returns will have a higher return on capital employed, higher debt adjusted per share of production growth, higher debt adjusted per share reserve growth, and higher debt adjusted per share cash flow growth. Furthermore, companies that generate good results with these metrics should be able to achieve them while living within cash flow.", "At Cimarex in a $50 flat oil and $3 flat gas future, we have the assets and organizational capability to generate double-digit growth and generate free cash flow as far as the eye can see. Results are what matter to us and results are what matter to you.", "Let me make a few comments about capital investment as we end 2017 and look ahead into 2018. Although we're not prepared to give a specific outlook for 2018 capital, I can offer some thoughts on how we approach the opportunities ahead.", "Looking ahead into 2018, more and more of our capital will be devoted to pilot development projects in the Permian and Anadarko Basins. We expect the Permian to get the lion's share of 2018 capital, perhaps even a greater share than 2017. John will walk you through some of the projects on our plate in both the Permian and Anadarko. We very much like both basins, but the Permian is currently more shovel ready for development than the Anadarko.", "Cimarex is moving forward in our premier investment portfolio, our deep inventory, and with a commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. We anticipate an active year in 2018. And as we have in 2017, we will manage our portfolio for continued strength in well productivity and fully burdened returns.", "With that I'll turn the call over to John.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results and plans for the remainder of 2017.", "During the third quarter, Cimarex invested $335 million on exploration and development activities. 60% of our third quarter capital was invested in the Permian region with 39% going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. We invested $280 million of the $335 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Company-wide we brought 77 gross, 30 net wells on production during the third quarter of 2017, bringing our total net wells year to date to 74.", "Our 2017 exploration and development budget is now $1.2 billion from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion originally estimated with $900 million to $925 million allocated for drilling and completing wells. Driving us to the upper end of our original guidance was an increase in salt water disposal wells and higher working interest in our Meramec drilling than originally planned.", "For the full year 2017, we plan to invest 61% of our capital in the Permian region with the remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent. We currently operate 14 gross rigs, 9 in the Permian region and 5 in the Mid-Continent. We currently plan to exit the year with 10 rigs in the Permian and 4 in Mid-Continent.", "Now on to some specific well results. I'll start in the Permian region, where we have exciting results to share with you regarding a successful well in the Lower Wolfcamp in our White City acreage position located in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico. While we have drilled many Lower Wolfcamp wells in White City, this is the first 10,000-foot lateral completed using our latest generation completion design. This well, the Marquardt 12-13 Fed Com 4H (sic) [11H], had an average 30-day peak IP of 2,766 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 47% was gas, 19% oil, and 34% NGL.", "This well's strong early time performance is helping us gain greater confidence and an ability to drill high rate of return Wolfcamp wells in multiple benches across the breadth of our White City acreage position.", "Drilling has also begun on the Animal Kingdom infill development, which consist of eight 10,000-foot laterals being drilled from two pads, testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing in between wells and the bench, plus adding an additional landing zone in the top part of the Lower Wolfcamp, which is a zone we used to refer to as the Wolfcamp C. A wine rack display for this pilot can be seen on Page 15 of our presentation. First production from this pilot is expected in the second quarter of 2018.", "We now have early production results on our Wolf \u2013 Upper Wolfcamp Seattle Slew spacing pilot, which consisted of six gross wells of 7,500-foot in length from two pads, which are testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section.", "As can be seen on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 16 of our presentation, the Seattle Slew wells after a cumulative production after 60 days is tracking with the 60-day average of the Gato del Sol and Sunny Halo's (sic) [Sunny's Halo] wells, which respectively tested six and eight wells per section. These early results are certainly encouraging. And we look forward to providing further updates for this pilot over time.", "Finally, I want to talk about the increased activity we have planned in Lea County, New Mexico, for the remainder of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.", "Within our Red Hills acreage block located in Southern Lea County, we will be drilling two 10,000-foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp and three 10,000-foot wells in the Avalon interval in order to further test completion design.", "Additionally, we will soon begin drilling a spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp that will be comprised of six wells from two pads that will test the equivalent of 12 wells per section within one bench. We will also be spudding an Avalon spacing pilot, which will consist of six wells from two pads that will be testing the equivalent of 20 wells per section in a stacked/staggered pattern within one zone. All these wells are expected to have first production by mid-year 2018.", "Now onto the Mid-Continent, where we have some meaningful results to talk about. I will start with the results of our increased density infill in the Woodford Shale. The Clyde Copeland tested both 16- and 20-well spacing with 8 wells drilled from two pads. As you can see on the cumulative production versus time plot on page 23 of the presentation, early well results show production as virtually the same under both spacing scenarios and also compares favorably to the nearby parent wells. These early results are a nice confirmation that our completion design is achieving our predictive result.", "Furthermore, what we are learning from this pilot will have a meaningful impact in the design for our upcoming long lateral development in the Leota Jacobs area, of which the exact timing is still being worked out, as well as future infill development across the rest of our Woodford acreage.", "Finally, page 24 of the presentation highlights an emerging area we call Lone Rock, which is a Woodford play where we have over 16,000 net contiguous acres. After many years of testing different landing zones as well as frac designs, we have now honed into a well design that is creating some of the best after tax rate return drilling opportunities within the company.", "The cumulative production versus base plot on page 24 demonstrates the dramatic improvement in production with the implementation of each new completion design. The three lines represent different vintage completions, with the blue line showing our most recent.", "As was mentioned in our press release, the recently completed Hines Federal 1H-0235X well achieved an initial 30-day average peak production of 15.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 40% was oil. This well is a further confirmation that our landing zone and frac design recipe for this area is working very well.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll cover the usual items, our third quarter production, our updated 2017 production outlook, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost.", "As Tom mentioned, we had a very good quarter for production in Q3. Our net equivalent volume came in at 1.143 Bcfe per day. That slightly beat our upper end of our guidance range, which was 1.1 Bcfe per day to 1.14 Bcfe per day.", "Gas volumes really drove our guidance beat, with our predominantly gas Mid-Continent Clyde Copeland project, which John just talked about, coming on stronger and a bit sooner than we had projected. On the oil side, we are right on top of where we forecasted the quarter to be.", "With strong activity levels in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, we've seen nice production gains in both of the areas. Our Q3 2017 Permian posting of 628 million [cubic feet equivalent] a day is up 21% from Q3 2016, while our Mid-Continent volume of 513 million [cubic feet equivalent] a day is up 20%.", "Looking forward, our current model has little departure from last call, with our late Q3 and Q4 completions in both regions projected to ramp our Q4 volumes. With the activity, we're forecasting our Q4 net equivalent production to range from 1.175 Bcfe per day to 1.225 Bcfe per day. And which would be an increase of 3% to 7% over Q3 2017 and up 22% to 28% from Q4 2016 and really providing us with a great springboard as we enter 2018.", "Driven by Permian, the Upper Wolfcamp, and Mid-Continent/Meramec completion activity, our fourth quarter oil volumes are projected to grow 32% to 37% versus fourth quarter 2016.", "Incorporating our Q4 guidance, our full year 2017 production is now estimated to average 1.134 Bcfe to 1.147 Bcfe per day, up from last call's guidance of 1.12 Bcfe to 1.14 Bcfe per day and an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year production growth over 2016.", "With strong well performance during the year, we've increased our 2017 guidance each quarter. And as Tom mentioned, since giving our initial 2017 guidance in February, we've increased the midpoint of our 2017 equivalent projection by 5%. With this year's focus on oil and liquid rich projects, the midpoint of our current projection for total company 2017 oil production equates to 26% growth over 2016.", "Shifting gears to OpEx. Our Q3 lifting cost came in at $0.62 cents per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf.", "With that our year-to-date lifting cost also computes to $0.62 per Mcfe, that's down 6% from our 2016 average and 25% from our 2015 posting. Our production team is focused to maintain the reduced operating cost structure we worked so hard to achieve with a goal of keeping our overall lifting cost in check. As such, remaining year guidance, we've kept our previous lifting cost range of $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcfe.", "And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. In general, we continue to see stability in most all drilling cost components, including tubular and wireline cost, which increased earlier in the year. We did see some cost pressures in quoted rig day rates during the quarter, as well as some pressures on cementing ops in the Mid-Continent.", "To fight any of the drilling cost pressures we've seen, we continue to keep our focus on efficiencies. As an example, our current median for days from spud to rig release for our 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp wells is running at 25 days, as compared to 29 days in 2016. And likewise, we've seen similar gains at our Meramec program with our normalized 2-mile Meramec drill time currently at 32 days, down from 40 days last year.", "On the completion side, the per unit cost pressures in service and prop costs that we'd seen earlier in the year seem to be flattening somewhat. That said, we stay focused on refining our completion designs to offset the cost pressures we've seen to date, all the while concentrating on improving well productivity.", "Completion and efficiency has become the name of the game to control our total well cost. We continue to experiment with fewer stages. We're varying the volumes of fluid and sand that we pump. We're actively exploring regional sand sourcing alternatives. And we're executing zipper fracs where we can to control our cost.", "To ensure crew efficiency and adequate prop sourcing, we maintain a consistent number of frac fleets and plan our resource needs well in advance. As such we have not had any significant issues procuring the resources that we need, when and where we need them.", "With our continued focus on efficiencies and some stability in per unit completion cost, we've made no changes to the well cost estimates we provided you last call. In the Permian, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million. While still pumping larger fracs in our Bone Spring program, we've kept our current 1-mile lateral AFE in the range of $5.5 million to $6.7 million. In Cana, our 1-mile lateral Woodford AFEs are running $7.3 million to $8 million. And with our completion design changes and efficiency gains in the Meramec now taking root, we're maintaining our 2-mile lateral AFE range of $10 million to $11.5 million.", "In closing, with Q3 coming in better than expected and Q4 projected to provide a nice ramp in production, we're forecasting solid 18% to 19% year-over-year production growth for 2017. Our focus on oil during the year is paving the way, with the midpoint of our total company oil projection equating to 26% growth over 2016.", "The projected record production in Q4, with an anticipated 43 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion at year end, which will provide us with great momentum going into 2018. With production \u2013 with our production up, our constant check, and great returns from our drilling projects, we remain very confident about our program. And we're excited about our 2017 results.", "So with that I'll turn the call open \u2013 over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, everyone. Tom, you talked in your prepared remarks about the capacity to generate free cash flow, while delivering strong growth. And just hoping you could speak to how you guys think about balancing shareholder preferences for overall more free cash flow generation? With the really strong asset base you have and the really high rates of returns that you can generate. Because it sounds like just those may be a little bit at odds or at least there's different pressures from different sides.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, thank you, Drew. The conversations have been fascinating to us. And I think there is certainly different viewpoints, depending on which shareholders you speak with.", "I think our long term owners would like to see us invest our cash flow, make sure that we protect ourselves on draconian downside. We've talked in the past, we stress test at $40 oil, $30 oil. We stress test at $2.50 flat gas and $2 flat gas. And these are all NYMEX prices. And as long as we can achieve outstanding returns and we have protection well above our cost of capital, at a draconian downside, our bias is going to be to invest our cash flow.", "Now we do pay a dividend. We cut our dividend last year, and we weren't very happy about that. We did it as a matter of necessity in a declining cash flow environment. In February, we'll reopen a discussion about dividend. And I think our bias is going to be to get that dividend back on a growth profile.", "But we're not actively looking at any share buyback program. We're in the business to make good investments, as long as we're getting the kind of historically outstanding returns that we are in this environment. That's our business.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color, Tom. Just one follow up on the 2018 outlook. You guys talked about conducting additional spacing pilots. And I was really hoping that by this quarter you guys would have, I guess to use your term, broken the spacing across the whole portfolio. It seems like you just can't make that happen quite yet.", "So as you think about trying to find the optimal design and development spacing and configuration, where are you going to be testing those limits? If there's any specific area? Maybe it's just across the board for next year?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Drew, this is John. I guess I'm kind of glad I don't have to use the word broken yet. But I think in some ways it's a testament that we're getting very good at being able to understand the overall resource in place we're trying to develop and understand what our frac design is doing. As I said, with the Clyde Copeland, the outcome we're seeing from Clyde Copeland kind of fit what our preconceived model said it should do. It's performing very well.", "So in some ways I think we're very \u2013 we're getting pretty good for each distinct interval of understanding what that resource in place and what its full potential is.", "Now still we're going to push the boundary. I could argue right now the pilot I'd mentioned \u2013 the two pilots in Lea County, where we're going to be testing much tighter spacing, both in the Avalon and in the Upper Wolfcamp in Lea County, that's probably tighter than anybody else has done so far up there.", "I feel confident we wouldn't go out there with that design if we didn't feel like we had a chance of achieving it. But there is some risk that maybe we do break it up there. But I think it's also again, as I said, a testament that we're just getting much better at understanding what we're doing with these pilots. And how our frac is interacting or working in terms of the ultimate production we get.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Let me just add to that. There seems to be a bit of a nomenclature shift between \u2013 with the word pilot and the word development. As long as we're drilling pad projects, multiple wells off each pad, it's really development. And the fact that we're testing some things and learning along the way is a side benefit.", "We're already achieving the capital efficiencies and the savings from multi-pad development. And by continuing to test spacing, continuing to optimize our frac design, we are extracting more value for each acre we own. And we're going to continue to push that envelope for as long as we're in business. I mean there's \u2013 so if you're looking for us to come up with a stamp that we can just replicate and put our curiosity aside, you're talking to the wrong management team.", "Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, Tom, and thanks, John.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Hi, Jeanine.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. So my questions, they fall into the Mid-Con area. So in the Meramec, well, at times it looks like the [Leota] Jacobs development is probably deferred at this point. What size program could the Meramec footprint handle at this point in time? Or what size do you think would be prudent, given what you know or what you don't know about the rocks?", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "This is John. I will tell you, we're still working up our 2018 plans for Anadarko. And you're right, we still need to work with Devon regarding the bigger long lateral development, although I think there's strong sentiment that that Leota Jacobs will probably get pushed into late 2018, early 2019.", "Right now we have quite a bit on our plate to still achieve in the Meramec. One of the big issues still is understanding what the ultimate spacing looks like in the Meramec. We \u2013 as we talked about a lot, there are a lot of pilots ongoing that we have an interest in, that we keep watching carefully. And then we our self are looking at several additional pilots that we'll probably be funding next year to again better understand what our potential is in the Meramec. That's kind of what our thought process is right now for the Meramec.", "We're certainly \u2013 of all the plays we have, and Tom kind of mentioned this, the Meramec is probably the one \u2013 the least one where we're ready to go to any form of development, where we still have a lot of questions in both how many zones can we land in? How many wells per each zone? And even more importantly, what is the appropriate frac design? So those are some of the things that we'll be trying to address in 2018 within the Meramec program.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then my follow-up is on capital allocation. And maybe I'm just bringing the pendulum too far to the right here on this one. But how far do you think you would ever tilt the capital program towards the Permian, given however you frame operational risk from a company-wide level? Or your framework for just capital allocation in general? I think from an investor standpoint it oftentimes seems that the more Permian, the better for you guys. But I know that might not be how you're thinking about the program?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, Jeanine, we think about the program purely in terms of rate of return. And as John said in his remarks, this Lone Rock area has rates of return that compete every bit, heads up with our Permian. And some of the Meramec competes every bit, heads up with Permian.", "So when it comes to capital allocation, we're kind of agnostic on basin. I know that there seems to be a real preference out there for Permian. But we don't really see the difference between cash flow from one basin to another, as long as the returns are there.", "I think certainly, as I said in 2018, I think we'll have probably a capital allocation that's equal to or greater towards the Permian than we did this year. But that's \u2013 some of that's just about the evolution of the projects more than the returns. We like both basins. And we're not interested in being a one basin player. We think that the flexibility of the two basins really helps us manage the cycles of our business more effectively.", "Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Irene Haas with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.", "Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC", "Yeah. Hi, everybody. A question on Anadarko Basin, the Lone Rock project that's really exciting. Just wondering, in addition to the Woodford, how is the Mississippian looking for that specific area?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Boy, that is a great question. We are looking at that very carefully. In fact, we recently took a whole core through the Mississippian as well as the Woodford. We're aware of some outside operated wells nearby that look rather interesting. And so we our self will be testing the \u2013 what we call the equivalent Mississippian or Meramec interval sometime and early 2018 as well, and then we'll see what that potential is.", "Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Morning, everybody.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Wanted to ask you about the Pagoda pad, looks like you've got quite a bit of data there now. Are you comfortable with that data to kind of declare victory and use that as your \u2013 I know you want to push the limits. But is 16 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp Pagoda, is that going to be the standard or minimum I guess for that area going forward?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. Yes, we're very, very pleased with the Pagoda results. As you can see, we're almost 180 days into it, and they're holding up very well.", "The only other comment I'd make though is that certainly that well design of 16 is very appropriate for the equivalent thickness or resource in place. So I can't necessarily rubber stamp over all of our Wolfcamp acreage in Reeves County. But there's a good part of it where 16 looks pretty good.", "We are going to be testing actually even tighter coming up here soon. We're going to add a third bench and go a little bit tighter still based on the Pagoda results. So as Tom said, we're not going to rest on our laurels. We're going to keep pushing that boundary in terms of how many wells can we get in to that very prolific Upper Wolfcamp section there in Reeves.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "But I just want to add to that, that tighter spacing is adding another bench.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. Right.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "It's not necessarily tighter well in well spacing. And then I really want to underscore something John said. It's not a one size fits all, and this is particularly true in the Anadarko Basin, where our spacing tests are applicable everywhere however we look at thickness, we look at resource in place. And a particular spacing derived in one section of that play may not be appropriate for another, because the rocks may thicken and thin.", "Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Thanks. And you mentioned, John, the results from the 10,000-foot laterals over in Culberson look pretty solid. Is 10,000 feet going to be the goal there now? And I understand it's going to depend on acreage configuration. But also think you guys were talking about trying some laterals even longer than 10,000 feet. Is that something that's still in the works?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. Well, first comment is if the acreage allows us, then we are always a minimum at 10,000 feet in the Wolfcamp as well as any of our other intervals. That's our going standard length of lateral.", "That said, we do have a lateral, because the acreage allows us to do this, down south of Culberson. We have some acreage that we're doing 2.5 miles on.", "And, yes, there's still a lot of debate about whether we should go even further. I know our drilling department is very anxious to talk about doing that.", "And again it's going to be a question of, will the acreage allow us to do that? There are places within the JDA. But we've talked about it. We're right now, because of the way the sections line up, we've been doing 7,500 \u2013 opposing 7,500-foot laterals. There are still areas there where we could instead go 3 miles with that section.", "So we are internally talking about it. Like I said right now the longest I'm aware of is we're doing a 2.5-mile right now down south of the JDA.", "Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Morning, all.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Maybe question for you, John. Just wondering on \u2013 the spacing that you showed on the Clyde Copeland, and I see kind of where that is. Do you anticipate sort of continuing to push that even further north? I'm just trying to get an idea of that greatest \u2013 that tight of spacing and how phenomenal that looks in that particular area. Could we see this as it moves over either to the eastern core or up to the Leota Jacobs? I'm just trying to get a sense of how \u2013 what the potential is for this type of spacing?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we ourselves are looking very carefully at the Clyde Copeland results. We still have some more work to do with that pilot. We have what we call individual well strut-ins (37:29) we want to do. That really helps us calibrate our model in terms of the overall drainage area each well is touching.", "And then from there, yeah, we will then sit down and look at the Leota Jacobs area, look at the resource in place, and then ask our self, okay, what is appropriate then for that acreage and that thickness, as Tom said. It's not a one-size-fits-all as much as it's going to be more what is the total age? What do we think we ultimately can drain from that? And then that would lead to the final design.", "I think it's fair to say that it would definitely be more than the standard 9 or 10 wells per section that we've done in the past. I can just tell you right now we haven't honed in on the final number. But that's something we'll be working on quite a bit here in the coming months with our AMI partner, as we line up what that actual development looks like.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "And then, John, I know you don't have a full 2018 plan out yet. But with these details and the success you've seen both in the Del now and in the Midland now with the down spacing, does this make you more inclined to do much more, I guess, batch drilling next year? Versus just maybe two or three? I'm just trying to get a sense of how large sort of the average development will be next year?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, that is a very excellent question. It's something that we our self are asking all the time in terms of what is the best capital efficiency from a development standpoint? Is it a half section? A full section? Three sections? What works best for us? And that's something we're spending a lot of effort on.", "One thing I need to make clear, no matter whether it's a half or full or whatever, all of them are from multi \u2013 are from multiple wells from a pad. There is a clear efficiency gain by putting a certain number of wells per pad.", "Now we also struggle with, you may hit a point where you have too many wells on a pad. That's something we're looking at. But it's fair to say just about everything we do now is in mind where you're going to have multiple wells off of a single pad, regardless of whether it's a half, full, or is multiple section development.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. This is a complex problem. In fact, John and I were discussing this earlier this morning, because there's a \u2013 we get a lot of questions about, all right, when are you going to go into full development?", "And that question suggests that full development is many, many wells manufacturing, let's say 50, 60 wells in a project. And that sounds good from a top line, because you can have efficiencies, you can have cost savings, you can have infrastructure savings. But the capital required for a project like that and the time delay between first investment and first production is also a significant consideration.", "It may be that there is some optimum that's much smaller than that. I don't know if it's 8, 12 [wells]. I mean, we'll figure it out as we go. But again we view this problem through a lens of fully burdened rate of return, and that that includes first investment to first production. It includes parent-child interference. It includes infrastructure investment required. It includes production bottlenecks. If you have too many wells flowing into a system, you have to overbuild it to accommodate peak production.", "And so there's a very, very complex set of criteria. We will view this problem in order to manage and maximize our full cycle rates of return. And so our engineers are hard at work on this. There's some good creative thinking going on. I had some discussions with our Permian team on this this morning. They're asking all the right questions. And I can't tell you today whether our optimum answer will be dozens of wells per project or something a dozen or fewer. It may be different depending on the area. John, you want to add to that?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "No. I think in fact I could argue based on what I see \u2013 Tom hit on it very well. Probably the bigger governing factor is not our ability to go out there and drill 20 or 30 wells and complete them, it's infrastructure, especially in the Permian. Your SWB needs, your compression needs, just all of that has to come into play. And you're absolutely right. On a full cycle basis, it does us no good to go out there and overbuild just to handle that peak production of 30 wells and then have that facility sitting there.", "So we're giving a lot of thought to what is optimal, especially from a return on capital invested standpoint.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "And this is Joe. What I'd add there is, just from the simple example of the battery itself. If you had a nine well battery, and we drilled all the nine wells at once and turned them all on at once, that size of that battery is going to obviously need to be bigger than if you drilled three, come back later drill another three, drill another three. And that can have a significant impacts on economics.", "So it's just all this balancing of everything Tom mentioned, John mentioned. And even on the facility side, the production facility side, it's a complex animal.", "Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.", "It's already happened in Reeves too, where we've said, okay, we want to \u2013 we've had a couple of small developments based on spacing that we've tested and where facilities are available and acreage is available. So we go in and drill with the pad. It may be a couple wells or three wells or whatever. But they're being drilled based on our results on these spacing pilots. So we're already applying it.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Very good. And thanks for all those details, very helpful.", "Operator", "Okay. The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. First of all, I just want to kind of get some background color on this Lone Rock thing. I mean was this legacy acreage that you took another look at? Or was this a dedicated organic acquisition? And can you tell us how Lone Rock attracted your attention? And how long it took you to build your position?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "This is John. Lone Rock has been with us for quite a while. It was a position that we originally acquired in our early entry into the play. But early on the wells were very, very disappointing.", "And so over time we keep going back to Lone Rock and we keep doing the hard work of trying to understand, why is this area different than other areas? And I will tell you perseverance really paid off in the case of Lone Rock. We saw the potential in terms of the resource in place.", "But let me just say there's something else very unique about Lone Rock. It's an area where we have much higher pore pressure than adjoining fault blocks or areas next to it. And that in turn we believe is leading to much better yield potential. And quite frankly with our latest frac design and the lateral length we're drilling, much lower decline rates on these wells. So that's what's leading to some of these superior returns we're seeing.", "But it was not been an easy a nut to crack. It's taken many, many iterations of both frac design \u2013 but I will tell you without a doubt landing zone has been probably the most critical issue in Lone Rock, because there's a lot of variability in the Woodford Shale vertically in this interval here. And our team has done a phenomenal job of understanding that and really honing in on where exactly we need to place these laterals.", "Now that we've gotten to where we are, we're very, very excited. So much so that we've been doing our best to enhance our position. And that's something we've been working on over the last year or two years. Such that for the most part now at Lone Rock we pretty much operate the majority of that position. That's really where we wanted to get to, which is why we for the longest time have held back wanting to talk about it, as we go and did a number of trades to get us to this position.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. That was really great color. And then another quick question I'll ask is just looking at the slide on the Leon Gundy, it said that the next phase of work there was to work on the completion sequence tests. And just wondered if you could give a little bit of color on what exactly are we talking about here?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Sure. We recognize now that over a good part of our undeveloped acreage, especially in what we call Township 14 North Range 10 West, that we have the opportunity to co-develop the Woodford and the Meramec.", "And what we are still working on is exactly how that sequence should take place. Can we do, for instance, Meramec only, and then follow with Woodford? Or vice versa? Or if we find that we cannot do it independently that because of a lack of let's say, frac-ed area, we have to do them all together, even in that scenario, what is the right order in terms of when you frac or stimulate? Do you do Meramec first and then do Woodford right afterwards? Or vice versa?", "And those are the things that we're trying to answer. We're trying to be very deliberate about it, because as I said, we have a large, large amount of acreage that appears to have that potential to be co-developed Meramec/Woodford.", "So right now we have a number of two- and three-well tests that we've done that are just now flowing back that are testing that frac order. And we'll be watching those carefully to help better formulate our go-forward plans for that acreage block there.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And if I can follow that up and not get Tom mad at me at the same time. Because I wouldn't want to argue about development versus testing. These tests that you have here, when do you think that you're going to start to get an update? Or that you can maybe at least pick some sweet spots and really try to experiment with these developments you're talking about? Maybe pick an area and say, okay, we're going to do the Meramec or the Woodford in this order based on these tests. I mean when do you think it'll happen?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I think there is a lot of work being done right now to do just that as part of 2018 in terms of picking off a section or two and getting it out there and testing these things at a bigger scale. So I would just say just hold tight and wait to when we talk about 2018. And then I think you'll get a better feel for what our plans are for that.", "Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Morning, Tom, Joe, and John. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, I just wanted to clarify your remarks. In your prepared remarks you said that the Permian could see a greater share of capital next year, because it's more shovel ready for development. Is that a comment around being more logistically ready for some more full field development or larger pads? Or is it more of a comment around geological understanding and spacing?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, I think it's a little of both. But I'll just follow on what John said. I mean the Leon Gundy and the sequencing is a perfect example. We do think that it may matter which order you complete the Meramec and Woodford. And so we're just hesitant to march off and drill 12, 16, whatever the number of wells are on a particular pad project and get that wrong. We have some early indications that this may be a significant problem.", "And so we're \u2013 you know, we don't have those complications. We're a little further along in the Delaware Basin. It's all to the good. I think the Anadarko is hard at work, getting these things ready. And I think you'll see us move into development there in short order.", "But as we sit here today looking at 2018 capital plans, we think we've got a little further understanding of some of these issues in the Delaware.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I appreciate that, Tom. And I guess on the Lone Rock area, I understand some of the differences here with the sensitivity of the landing zone and higher pore pressures that you're seeing. I guess how would you contrast it I guess at a high level to the rest of your Cana play I guess on how you're viewing mix? I know it's very early on the spacing side. But I guess how do you think about this area generally? Or you just see it as a more productive or more saturated interval?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "I think that the way we look at it is, as I said earlier, it is an area of much higher pore pressure, relative to the depth you drill to. It's much better yield content. And because of a certain makeup of the rock, we see these much lower decline rates. And that just leads to very good IPs, but lower decline and very excellent well performance.", "It doesn't carry itself across all the Woodford acreage that we see. But there are other areas that have similar characteristics. I could argue again part of Leota Jacobs I think has similar opportunities in terms of the yield content and the opportunity there. That's also an area of a little bit higher pore pressure, pretty good yield.", "So in some ways I do see some of the things we're doing in Clyde Copeland translating well to Lone Rock. I will point out though that at Lone Rock, we don't have quite the amount of thickness as we do say at Clyde Copeland.", "So as Tom said, I cannot directly take those excellent results from Clyde Copeland of 16 and 20 wells and easily translate it to Lone Rock. That would be foolish, because I don't have near the resource in place from a thickness standpoint. I'm probably more likely in to 10- to 12-well range, which is something we will be testing in that area here very soon.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Do you think that that area benefits at all from having less prior development around it relative to some of the areas further north?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "No. No, I don't, because basically we still have to drill individual wells per section just to get it to an HBP status. So it's not unlike anywhere else that we have developed Woodford. We always have typically an existing parent well on that section. So we're very familiar with having a parent well and understanding its potential relationship to future development. That's something we've been doing a long time here.", "So, no, there is no drainage issue at the Woodford from a parent well. I can assure you of that, just given the tightness of the rock and the low permeability of it. I don't foresee that to be an issue at Lone Rock. It is again more \u2013 Lone Rock is very unique in its structural set up from a pressure yield standpoint that it's leading to the kind of returns we're seeing there.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious, what is the appetite for maybe paring some of your longer dated inventory? I ask because you keep seem to having success in getting more wells on the same level of acreage. I'm just trying to see if there is a \u2013 if it's being considered as a \u2013 asset sales are being considered as a way to maybe improve returns and unlock shareholder value?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, John, we're always looking at things that are potential divestment candidates. And we do have some things that currently are on our list to divest. They're more things that I would call non-core and probably not in the arena that we've discussed on this call. They're good quality assets, but for whatever reason they're just not currently a focus. So from a valuation standpoint, they're probably more valuable in somebody else's hands right now.", "But in our core Cana play, in our core Delaware play, we're probably not going to be looking at divesting any time soon.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "So I guess that sounds like more kind of normal course portfolio rationalization, as opposed to seeing the inventory as so deep that you'd potentially want to pull some of it forward by monetizing it?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, we're \u2013 this is not theology with us. In fact, one of the things that John has a new ventures group that's always working on new things. And one of the things I tell them repeatedly is success would be we find a new area that's so much better than what we've got that we end up shedding some of what we've got in order to let it be supplanted by new stuff.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "So, yeah, we're constantly looking at a refresh. And I appreciate the \u2013 just the observation that decades and decades of inventory is wonderful to talk about, but from a net present value standpoint, anything out more than 5 years or 10 years is not terribly high on net present value. So we constantly look at this. It's an open conversation here at Cimarex.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Oh, I'm sorry.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. I was just going to add one quick comment. I mean behind the scenes there are always lots of smaller deals going on, acreage trades where we're constantly enhancing our positions. So there are like smaller acreage blocks from time to time we will divest, nothing that's newsworthy. But it's always in an effort to get us to that nice contiguous block of operated acreage that gets us in a much better position from a standpoint of future development.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "That's fair. And then, Tom, I appreciate the very thoughtful prepared remarks at the outset on the E&P business model. As we think about maximizing returns, is there a level at which you would say the company is under-levered?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, many people would say we're there. But the experience that we've had the last few years has told us that under-levered is in the eye of the beholder.", "And I will tell you that having lived through $26 oil, we were faced with many difficult decisions. We were faced with some tough days. But we were never faced with an existential threat of Cimarex. We always were able to focus on the right things, how to get our cost structure where it needed to be, how to make sure our assets could perform in a lower cost environment.", "We came into this party with a lean organization and low debt. And our learnings from that are, both of those are good. So I don't think \u2013 I know from time to time we get criticism from people that perhaps are more financially sophisticated than I am on the proper use of leverage. But we're going to be in business for many decades to come. And staying low levered is a pretty good insurance against commodity fluctuations. Mark, do you want to comment on that?", "G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, John. I guess I'd comment that right now our debt to EBITDA ratio, the ending \u2013 trailing 12-month third quarter is 1.4 times. We've talked openly in the past that 1.5 times or less is probably an objective that we want to maintain. And we're there now.", "But I just \u2013 as Tom mentioned, the volatility in the cash flows were \u2013 kind of keep approaching our target rate or a little less, and that's we want to see that 1.5 times debt to EBITDA or less. And as we go into the future years, we see that decreasing further as our EBITDA is growing. But it is the conversation that we have in the future is that as our EBITDA grows, and whether or not we'd want to use more leverage or not?", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Well, yes. It's the debt metrics we look at.", "G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Right.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Not the actually \u2013 the debt level.", "G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "That's right.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "But, John, let me say this. And we get asked this a lot. We've looked at a number of opportunities to purchase assets over the last few years. And we haven't found anything that we've pulled the trigger on. But we're always looking.", "If we found something that we thought had long term strategic value and that we could get really good full cycle fully burdened returns through that transaction, and it involved a higher degree of leverage than we've historically operated at, we would consider that seriously.", "So if we temporarily went into a period where we had higher leverage, we'd probably look at a much more aggressive hedging program to protect ourselves. But this \u2013 our balance sheet is a tool. And we recognize that. And we'd be prepared to use it.", "John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Very thoughtful. I appreciate that again. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats on the quarter, guys.", "G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. The final question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Morning.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "John, just a quick question. Noticing some Bone Spring wells starting to pop up on your map in the Northern Delaware Basin. And just curious...", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "...how you guys are looking at that delineation program, as your results and also peers seem to be having some success? And then heading into 2018, could this become a larger development for you at this point?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yes. We are continuing as we always are to drill the occasional Bone Spring well. And we have quite a number we're doing. In fact \u2013 well, just in general, I will tell you just in the fourth quarter alone, the combination of Bone Spring, Avalon, and Wolfcamp, we'll drill 13 wells in Lea County, gross wells in the fourth quarter. And quite a few of those will be Bone Spring wells, both Second and Third Bone Spring. And you'll see us occasionally drilling more of those during the course of next year.", "It's just \u2013 it's a very nice complement to our overall program. I don't know. You could maybe envision a half to a full rig's worth of drilling across the entire breadth of the year that we will scatter in.", "And yes, what we \u2013 one other comment I'll make is, based on other operators' results, it is kind of redefining now what we see as perspective. Whereas before we maybe \u2013 we may have high graded to a point. We said there wasn't much left to do on our existing position. I cannot say that anymore. And that we definitely see more potential in our acreage. And you'll be seeing us drill more of those wells in the coming year.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then as my second follow-up. You drilled two wells this year in Ward County, targeting the Wolfcamp. Just any updated thoughts on the results so far? And how you guys are thinking about that part of your portfolio going forward?", "John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah. We have drilled two. We have another one coming up. And we're still monitoring results.", "Ward is one \u2013 I kind of \u2013 I'm not \u2013 sometimes I think of Ward like what I talked about with Lone Rock and that \u2013 what I mean by that is, we see great resource potential there. We just haven't fully cracked the nut so to speak in terms of perfecting returns there. I see the potential.", "The overhang we have is of course the existing Third Bone [Spring] production and drilling we did many, many years back. And what its interaction or interplay is to the current drilling we're doing now.", "That said, I still see a lot of resource potential there, even when I account for those existing wells. We're just trying to figure out \u2013 again kind of like Lone Rock \u2013 where is the best place to land those wells and frac them to bring them to a level or rate of return profile that they will start \u2013 compete with the other programs for capital. So that's where we are right now with that program.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Jorden for any closing remarks.", "Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.", "Yeah, I just want to thank everybody that we've had some great questions here this morning. And we're going to continue to work hard to post results like we have in this quarter. We're very excited about the progress we're making and really appreciate the thoughtful questions that you brought before us. So we look forward to next quarter.

All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Karen Acierno", "Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Cimarex Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. An updated presentation was posted to our Web-site yesterday afternoon and we will be referring to this presentation during the call today.", "Our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-K for the end of the year next week.", "We will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities from John Lambuth, our SVP of Exploration. And then, Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Mark Burford is also present to help answer any questions.", "Again, so that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then feel free to get back in the queue if you like.", "So, just one last thing before I turn the call over to Tom, you may have noticed our new and improved Web-site, which we went live with last weekend. In addition to the updated Investor Relations page, we have added quite a lot of information under the Corporate Responsibility tab, especially with regards to the environment. There are new sections on Seismicity, Hydraulic Fracturing, and Spill Prevention, as well as expanded disclosure on Water Management and Air Quality. So we hope you find it useful and appreciate any feedback you might have.", "So, with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you, Karen, and thank you for everyone for joining our call. Cimarex had an outstanding year in 2017. We invested $1.28 billion and achieved excellent investment returns in both the Anadarko and Permian basins. Our overall program returns were excellent by historical standards. Our operating group delivered seamless execution in 2017 as we avoided operational hiccups that plagued many of our peers.", "Our investment and operational performance led Cimarex to achieve top line annual production growth of 19%, including 27% growth in our oil production. More importantly, we achieved a 15% growth in debt/adjusted production per share and 13% growth in debt/adjusted reserves per share. We accomplished this while living within cash flow and cash on hand. All in all, it was an excellent year and we [exclude] [ph] our organization for accomplishing these results.", "Our challenge now is to do it again. Our 2018 plans call for us to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, 70% of which will be in the Delaware Basin. The remaining 30% will be directed to highly profitable Woodford and Meramec projects in the Anadarko Basin. Our top-tier assets near Anadarko and Delaware basins and contiguous land positions provides for greater capital efficiency as our programs further move into development projects.", "We expect to deliver 11% to 16% total production growth and 21% to 26% oil growth in 2018. Once again, as in 2017, we plan to achieve these results within cash flow and cash on hand. In 2018, oil sales will account for 62% of our revenue, NGL sales for 19% of our revenue, and residue gas sales will account for 18% of our revenue. Our ongoing emphasis on the Delaware Basin and the liquids rich portions of the Woodford and Meramec plays will continue to balance our exposure to swings in commodity prices.", "In developing capital plans, we also look hard at the percentage of total capital that goes into drilling and completion. Setting production capital aside, these drilling and completion dollars are the engine of our profitability. All other costs, which include land, midstream, saltwater disposal, and G&A, must be carried by the profitability of our drilling program.", "Thus, we look carefully at the percent of our total E&D capital that is drilling and completion dollars, and the percent of our total expenditures that are drilling and completion dollars. Our 2018 program has a good mix year, well above the average for the past 13 years. Our experience guides us to view this as a key metric to sustaining long-term profitable growth.", "One attribute of Cimarex is that we measure ourselves relentlessly. We take apart each of our programs and study them to calibrate our actual results compared to our pre-drill expectations. We look at actual to expected costs, actual to expected production, and actual to expected reserve bookings.", "Our goal in studying these metrics is to calibrate our decision-making, understand what is and what is not working, and seek to make better decisions going forward. We cannot always control the outcome but we can control the decision. We strive to have actual to expected results that are in close agreement. This gives us greater confidence in making future investment decisions.", "Our 2017 overall program exhibited strong repeatability, as measured by actual to expected results. In laying out our 2018 capital plans, this consistency of results gives us confidence to increase our pace of activity. Furthermore, we will direct a higher proportion of our total capital to Delaware Basin in 2018. This decision is driven by the outstanding returns and programmer feasibility. Simply put, these are great investments.", "We learned a lot in 2017 as we experimented with numerous downspacing projects in both the Anadarko and Delaware basins. Having a footprint in each basin makes us stronger in both. Our organization is adept at bringing learnings from one basin to the other and we expect our geosciences and operations staff to stay curious.", "During 2017, our understanding of well spacing, optimum completion design, landing zone selection, and optimum facility design, increased dramatically because of the pilot projects we completed. We are ready for the challenge to repeat that operational excellence in 2018.", "Finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our value creation thesis. Cimarex has long held to the thesis that our goal is to increase net asset value per share and that the best way to do this is to reinvest our cash flow in the most profitable projects we can find. There is an ongoing conversation among energy analysts and investors that this is an indictment of the industry for destroying value through the commodity cycles. We are highly sympathetic to the spirit of this to date, although we do not think this was a one-size-fits-all approach and that we do not think that's the appropriate response.", "Each company needs to respond in a manner that fits their assets, their investment performance, and their balance sheet. If our sector is guilty of destroying capital through the cycles, we do not necessarily think the solution is to do less of it. We think the solution is to fix the core problem.", "How can we invest through the cycles and create real value over time, this is Cimarex's focus. We perform an annual look-back on every year, every program, and every well we have drilled since the inception of Cimarex in 2003. There are over 4,000 wells in our look-back. We take each well and bring it current with actual production over time, actual revenue received, and actual expenditures incurred since it was drilled. This look-back is a critical part of calibrating ourselves and making sure that we understand our real value creation over time.", "There is a treasure trove of data within our annual look-back and we mine it thoroughly. We look at the impact of commodity prices, actual to expected production, actual to expected reserves, and actual to expected expenditures. This analysis helps us understand the relative influence of each factor in our value creation. We are in the business of investing and this analysis identifies where we are doing well and where we need to do better. We are fully committed to value creation and we understand that it is not measured by growth.", "We are confident that our 2018 capital program is the right solution for Cimarex. We are achieving top-tier returns on invested capital and the 2018 program will continue that momentum. Service cost inflation is a factor as we look into 2018 and we have factored this into our plans. And as I said, we are in the process of incorporating lessons from our look-back in order to protect our investment returns.", "Our commodity downside stress test on each investment we make is a critical discipline point for us. We will be discussing lessons from our look-back more fully as the year goes on. Nonetheless, we are confident that our 2018 capital program will deliver robust full cycle returns and is the right answer for Cimarex.", "Enough of the preamble, we have some exciting results to update you on today. We had a great year in 2017 and look to repeat it. Our strong 2017 results calibrate our acceleration into 2019. We are seeing the benefits of our emphasis on science, our organizational capability, and the focus on fully burdened investment returns that permeate our culture.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John Lambuth", "Thanks Tom. During the fourth quarter, Cimarex invested $344 million in exploration and development activities, bringing the total for 2017 to $1.28 billion. $980 million was invested into drilling and completion of new wells. These investments yielded excellent results for Cimarex, including growth in both reserves and production. We drilled or participated in 319 gross, 98 net wells in 2017, with 59% of our capital spent in the Permian region and 39% in Mid-Continent.", "As you've heard, our 2018 plans estimate total exploration and development capital at $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, with $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion going towards the drilling and completion of wells. This amount of drilling and completion capital represents 82% of our total exploration and development investment, up from 77% in 2017.", "We currently operate 14 gross rigs, with 10 in the Permian region and four in Mid-Continent. We plan to spend nearly 70% of our drill and complete capital in the Permian, with the rest going to Mid-Continent region. Mainly due to increases in working interest, in particular higher working interest in Permian than Mid-Continent, these 14 operated rigs will be drilling 28% more lateral feel than the 13.25 average gross operated rigs drilled last year.", "Now I'll turn to some specifics of each region. I will start with the Permian region. We completed and brought online several Permian spacing pilots in 2017. The Tim Tam pilot, which consisted of five 10,000 foot laterals at equivalent of six well spacing in the Lower Wolfcamp came on production early last year and has yielded a great result with a calculated after-tax internal rate of return of 67% for this project.", "Drilling is underway on the Animal Kingdom infill development in Culberson County, which consist of eight 10,000 foot laterals, testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the space between wells in a bench plus adding an additional landing zone in the top part of the Lower Wolfcamp. These wells are expected to be on production around midyear.", "Another important test, the Seattle Slew pilot, has now been on production for 120 days. These six 7,500 foot wells tested equivalent of 12 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp. The learnings from this project along with the results of the other two Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilots of Gato and Sunny's Halo which tested six and eight wells per section, have enabled us to gain greater confidence on how best to design the ultimate development spacing for the vast majority of our Culberson County Upper Wolfcamp position. We have five development projects planned for the Upper Wolfcamp across our acreage position in 2019, with two of them located in Culberson County.", "Lastly, I want to talk about the increased activity we have planned in Lea County, New Mexico. In the fourth quarter 2017, we started drilling on our Red Hills acreage block two 10,000 foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp and three 10,000 foot wells in the Avalon interval. These wells will assist us in the confirmation of the appropriate frac design for this area.", "We have also begun drilling a spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp that will test the equivalent of 12 wells per section within one bench and we have spud an Avalon spacing pilot that will be testing the equivalent of 20 wells per section in a stack/stagger pattern within one zone. All of these wells are expected to have first production around midyear 2018. This is an exciting area where due to our high percentage of contiguous acreage, we have the opportunity to develop with 10,000 foot laterals.", "Now, onto the Mid-Continent. We had a very productive year at Mid-Continent region during 2017. We completed the obligation drilling associated with our Meramec position and now hold all of our 115,000 Meramec acreage by production. I will refer you to Slide 24 of our presentation as I discuss some of the recent highlights in the region.", "First, we completed a three well stacked Woodford/Meramec test in the 14-10 township in Canadian County, Oklahoma. This test called the Woolfolk/NIB confirmed results of our Leon Gundy spacing pilot and it included two [landings] [ph] in the Meramec and one in the Woodford. Further, this test shows that changes in cadence of the well completion has had a positive impact on overall results.", "Another Cimarex-operated Meramec test nearby, the Mike Com 1H-1720X had a very encouraging result with an average 30-day peak IP of 4,353 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 10% was oil, 29% NGL, and 61% gas. Cimarex operates nearly all of the 24,000 gross acres within the 14-10 township area with an average working interest of 62%.", "For 2018, we intend to operate four Meramec development projects across our acreage position. Based on math variations within the Meramec interval as well as ours and other operators' recent pilot results, these development projects are being custom designed for each section in order to maximize both returns and present value. Thus, the range of spacing that we will be drilling is from 3 to 10 wells per section, again based on the thickness of measured hydrocarbon in place for each section that we will develop.", "Drilling activity continues in the high return Lone Rock area where Cimarex has six long lateral Woodford wells on production with average 30-day peak initial production of 1,806 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 35% of which is oil, 36% gas, and 29% NGL. The Company is currently drilling the Shelly spacing pilot in Lone Rock with first production expected mid-summer and has plans for a second spacing test with JD Hoppinscotch later this year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll update you on the usual items of our fourth quarter and our full-year 2017 production, our outlook for 2018 production, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and services costs.", "As Tom mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter from a production standpoint. With reported equivalent volume of 1.204 BCF per day, we came in above the midpoint of our guidance and set Company records for all products in both the Permian and Mid-Continent regions as well as at the total Company level.", "With mark, our equivalent production was up 5% over Q3 2017 and 25% over Q4 2016. Oil volumes drove the growth with a fourth-quarter net oil production of 61,771 barrels a day, up 36% over the fourth quarter of 2016, a direct result of our 2017 capital allocation focus on high rate of return liquids projects in both the Permian and Mid-Continent.", "With Q4 in the books, our 2017 average net equivalent production came in at 1.142 Bcfe per day. That's up 18.6% over 2016. Strong activity levels in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent generated the growth, resulting in nice year-over-year net equivalent production gains in both regions, with our 2017 Permian posting of 631 million a day, up 25% over 2016, and our Mid-Continent volume of 509 million a day, up 11%.", "Moving on to our 2018 production outlook, with more than 55% of our production now comprised of liquids and the deep inventory of high liquid growing projects in our portfolio, we're now providing production guidance and other metrics in oil equivalent rather than gas.", "With our continued focus on Permian and Mid-Continent high liquids project, our current model projects our 2018 production to average 211,000 to 221,000 BOE per day, an increase of 11% to 16% over 2017. Similar to 2017, we're projecting another strong year for oil growth, with forecasted 2018 oil volumes up 21% to 26% over 2017. We also built into the model a very small property sale which we closed in January, which reduced our volumes by approximately 1,100 BOE per day.", "Our 2018 program includes a significant number of multi-well infill projects in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Significant production contributions from our Animal Kingdom, Hallertau, Snowshoe, and Triste Draw projects in the Permian as well as our [indiscernible], Shelly and Steve O projects in the Mid-Continent are forecasted to occur during the second half of the year.", "As a result, with approximately 45 net wells anticipated to come online in the first half of the year and 82 net wells forecasted in the second half of the year, we're projecting fairly flat production levels through Q2 with a strong ramp in production during Q3 and Q4. With the ramp, we are forecasting fourth quarter oil volumes to be up 29%c to 34% over Q4 2017, mirroring what we did this last year.", "After incorporating our property sale and additional January Permian production downtime of about 4,000 to 5,000 BOE per day associated with weather, compression maintenance, repair, and construction related type set-ins, we're forecasting our Q1 2018 output to average 198,000 to 207,000 BOE per day, relatively flat to slightly up from our last quarter Q4 2017 and up 12% to 17% from first quarter a year ago.", "Shifting gears to OpEx, our Q4 lifting cost came in at $3.89 per BOE, right at the midpoint of our guidance of $3.60 to $4.20. Our resulting full-year 2017 OpEx averaged $3.77 per BOE. That's down 5% and 25% from our 2016 and 2015 postings respectively.", "To date, our production team has been able to fight off cost pressures and maintaining operating cost structure we've worked so hard to achieve, ultimately keeping our overall lifting cost somewhat in check. Looking into 2018, with the fluctuating nature of workover expenses and our liquids-rich drilling focus, we're projecting our full year lifting cost to be in the range of $3.75 to $4.35 per BOE.", "And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. On the drilling side, although rig day rates seem to be somewhat in check, we are seeing some cost pressures on ancillary services such as surface rentals and labor, and as a result, and again depending on area, we've seen slight increases in the drilling portion of our AFEs. As always, we continue to fight off these cost pressures through drilling efficiencies.", "On the completion side, we've seen additional upward pressure in the cost per frac operations, in particular the cost for services and for proppant. As an example and on a total Company average basis, we've seen our service cost per stage pumped increase approximately 20% and our cost per proppant increase approximately 10% since the third quarter of 2017. As such, we stay focused on refining our completion designs to offset the cost increases, all the while concentrating on improved well productivity.", "To reduce associated costs, we're executing zipper fracs and recycling water where we can and we continue to explore sand-sourcing potential in the Permian. To ensure crew efficiency and adequate prop sourcing as in all quarters past, we maintain a consistent number of frac leads and plan our resource needs well in advance, and as a result we've had no significant issues procuring the resources when and where we need them.", "The drilling and completion cost increases has made their way into our current AFEs. In the Permian, depending on area, the interval, facility design, and logistics for frac efficiencies, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $11 million to $13 million. With our New Mexico Bone Spring development now extending from the shallower areas of Southern Eddy County into the deeper areas of Northern Eddy and Lea counties, our 1-mile Bone Spring AFEs are now running $7 million to $8.5 million.", "And in Cana, with the revised completion design to help offset cost increases, our 1-mile lateral Woodford AFEs are running $7.5 million to $8 million. And finally, with our current frac design, our 2-mile Meramec AFEs are running $11.8 million to $12.8 million, up from the levels we quoted last call of $10 million to $11.5 million.", "So, in closing, 2017 worked according to plan. With a solid Q4, we closed the year with record production and year-over-year production growth of about 19%. Our 2017 liquids-rich focus generated sizable production gains in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent and we demonstrated 36% oil growth from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017.", "With similar projects slated for 2018, our strong Q4 2017 exit rate is forecasted to hold flat until the middle of the year when our Permian and Mid-Continent multi-well infill projects are forecasted to generate another sizable production ramp, a ramp projected to result 11% to 16% year-over-year production growth and a Q4 of 2018 oil volume in 29% to 34% above our record Q4 2017 level.", "We're working hard to fight off cost pressures on all fronts. Despite the pressures we've seen, we continue to generate great returns from our drilling program. The stage is set for another successful year here in 2018 and we're excited to execute our plan.", "So with that, I'll turn the call open to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Drew Venker", "Tom, I want to start on your prepared remarks addressing costs and specifically costs other than D&C, it sounds like you think there's potentially some evidence to reduce those in the future. Maybe you could speak to what you've looked at and reviewed recently that could potentially impact the 2018 spend and if you see ways to improve on that going forward?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "As you know, we compile a lot of data and we look at that ratio carefully. As I said in my remarks, the percentage of our total capital, our drilling and completion cost is a really important metric. Not only have we seen our program be stronger if that ratio is high, but we've also seen some of our peers from time to time that have gotten into trouble, and carry it back to seeing that ratio get out of balance.", "You have to make some of these other investments. Land investments are critical part of our projects. Certainly the midstream investments we're making, although we attempt to minimize them where we can, they do contribute to the profitability of our production base. And then we have to make saltwater disposal investments in order to also facilitate our production.", "Now, would I love to see our drilling and completion dollars be 100% of our total capital? Yes, absolutely, because those are our most profitable investments and the other investments service those. But that's not feasible.", "Now, we are looking at some things that we can explore to try to minimize that. We don't have anything specific we can talk about, but I will say this. We look at those ratios and our ratios for 2018 are really, really healthy. And I quoted a 13-year average. That's only because that's as far back as I have good accounting data to really compare that, that's going back to 2006, but we're in very good shape with our 2018 capital program as to how those profitable drilling and completion dollars are balanced against total capital.", "Drew Venker", "Excellent color, Tom. And then just on the spending philosophy and the capital plan, you guys raised money back in 2016 and you guys are still working on spending that in addition to cash flow. I'm thinking, beyond when you spend that cash balance, what do you think is the right spending philosophy relative to cash flow or otherwise longer-term, does it make sense to return cash to shareholders at some point as you kind of bear the fruit of all these investments, whether buybacks or dividends, or maybe is that too long a term to think about at this point?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "No, it's not too long-term at all. We've always said that we would like to maintain the balance sheet where our debt to cash flow is 1.5x or less, and we haven't changed our strives there. Now as we look ahead, I think in this commodity environment what we've been in the last few years, we will probably have a strong reluctance to not borrow. That's not a promise but I will say that we work very hard looking at our future and our bias is to live within cash flow or minimize our borrowings.", "As far as returning cash to shareholders, we do pay dividend. I've talked at length that we cut that dividend in 2016. None of us felt particularly good about that, although that was the right decision at the time. And our Board, I will tell you I think is going to be looking at that and our bias is to recommend restoring that dividend to its high watermark as much as prudently possible. That will be a decision for the full Board but we'd like to see that dividend get back to its high watermark and then on a good growth trajectory.", "I don't know that you can expect share buyback out of us. We are really achieving great returns on invested capital. I will tell you, as an owner of Cimarex, I'd rather have Cimarex invest the returns that we are achieving rather than give the cash back, and I think many of our long-term owners feel the same, that not that share buybacks are off the table but we're going to have a bias to increase our dividend and just make sure that we're making good profitable investments with our remaining cash. Mark, you want to comment on that?", "Mark Burford", "No, I think you said it well, Tom.", "Drew Venker", "Thanks for the color, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neil Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.", "Neil Dingmann", "Tom or John, or even Joe, my question really addresses your production timing. Recognizing that you have the 2018 guidance out, nothing beyond, could you all talk about the type of impact on total production these large pads like the Animal Kingdom or Snowshoe will have? Really guys what I'm trying to get a sense of, if essentially the benefit of these large A+ type well pads will essentially be more in 2019 than 2018, obviously recognizing you don't have any sort of 2019 guidance out?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. By virtue of me just saying that we're going to be flat from basically Q4 through Q2, and then all of a sudden we talk about the fourth quarter oil growth and the year-over-year production growth, there is a strong ramp. This is going to give us a real nice accelerate into 2019. Surely no different than years past where we've had these program ramps. Other than from my standpoint, we have like seven of them now, and all of them are coming on at the same time.", "So, as you really look to us getting more into development mode, I think this is going to kind of be the norm. We're going to have a number of projects where you got six to eight or god knows how many wells all coming on at once, and I think we're gone from the days where you've got this steady single well growth to program platform growth like we're seeing.", "So, I'm kind of dancing around your question at 2019 because we really haven't modelled that in tremendous detail, but what I will tell you is that it's a very strong ramp going into the fourth quarter and it's not beginning in the fourth quarter or it's beginning in the third quarter. So, from a timing standpoint if it were to get delayed, it's not going to, the ones I hate are the ones that all come on around November/December, and if you have any hiccup, it's pushing to the next year.", "But you know what, this production thing, maybe to philosophize it a little bit like Tom just did, we're measured quarter to quarter and you're looking at quarter to quarter production. What we're looking at is net asset value growth and the returns that are being generated by those production ramps are what are key to us. And if they move out a month or move forward a month, it's not what we are focused on. We're focused on a return on invested capital.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "John, you comment, because I know you study this hard as far as the impact of these big projects and what should we do when we [split them up] [ph].", "John Lambuth", "No, I think as we look at our per unit drilling cost, absolutely the big projects make sense from our standpoint. I do want to add a little bit color and I want to be clear, it's not like we plan for these projects all to come home in the second half. There are some in this particular case mitigating circumstance. One is our Avalon pilot. Basically we ran into, we could start the completions and then we have to become very inefficient because we run into what we call the prairie chicken season and we'd have to then shut down there a period of time. Thus, we decided it's best to delay it after that. That pushed it back later in the year.", "And then secondly, our Shelly pilot, we're doing a lot of science with that including surface micro-seismic, and so we've imposed a single frac crew on that particular pilot. Again, in normal operations we'd expect to have two frackers out there. That further delays it.", "So there are some operational things that are also pushing it. I would expect that as we get more and more to these individual developments, I think you'll see it line out more than always being in backend loaded. It's just this particular year a couple of our more \u2013 we had a little bit longer delay than what they normally would.", "Neil Dingmann", "Great answer, guys, and I absolutely agree. Given the cost basis, this seems to make a lot of sense. Just one quick follow-up, John or Joe, any indication or just thoughts about, I know it's early, but around the Lone Rock area as far as indications or thoughts around spacing there?", "John Lambuth", "That's why we've drilled both the Shelly pilot and why we've gone ahead and moved to the next pilot I mentioned. We want to get that one in the ground too. We feel very good about eight wells. That's what we're testing. The additional pilot that we're going to start drilling here very soon is on the more eastern side, so it's the more liquid-rich side, so now we'll have nice book in pilots on either end of our Lone Rock position. I think with both of those outcomes in hand, we'll be in very good shape to move forward pretty confidently in terms of how we would build that acreage.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Yes, our team is confident to bet on the 10,000 foot long development projects that are just waiting to be [numbered] [ph].", "John Lambuth", "Yes, they are.", "Neil Dingmann", "Very good, guys. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Arun Jayaram", "This is Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Couple of questions. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your Lea County program. It looks like 225 million of capital. Could you just highlight some of the projects in the Triste Draw and the Red Hills area in 2018?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. If you go to Slide 21 in our presentation, we highlight both where the Triste Draw is as well as the Hallertau. Really both of those are again spacing pilots to really get us further along in terms of what we think ultimately spacing will be both in the Upper Wolfcamp as well as in the Avalon.", "Furthermore, in the Red Hills area itself, we were looking at that slide. Off to the east, you see the large acreage position, kind of what we call the Main Red Hills Park. That is where we have several long laterals that we are drilling, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, where we're just reconfirming our expectation of results with the frac design.", "There are some outstanding wells that are drilled in close proximity to that acreage position. This is an area that we've been wanting to get to. It's an area that we've often said is HBP. So it's not something we need to drill the hole. But now we've decided to move quite a bit of capital in there because the returns look fantastic.", "And so, we're very excited about getting back up in the Lea County. I think the one thing I want to point out is we're also expanding or delineating. We have a number of wells trying to push the boundaries of in terms of what we think is profitable Wolfcamp and Avalon drilling. I think that's going to again put us in a much better position going forward in the 2019 for further development in that area. But it's without a doubt, when I look at our overall drilling program, this area in particular generates some of the most top tier returns we have.", "Arun Jayaram", "Great. And just my follow-up gentlemen, your outlook highlights a lot of completions in the third quarter, I think over 50. Could you talk about kind of the organization's ability, Tom, to meet that number? And just wanted to follow up also, what are your key LFS supplies? Halliburton had highlighted this morning some delays on the sand side. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about that, is that perhaps impacting your 1Q completion schedule. I think you did say, you're self-sourcing some sand, but wondered if you could highlight or talk about these two points.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I'll just speak to that and then turn it over to Joe. We are very confident in our ability to execute those completions. We do sit and talk to our service suppliers and line out our program. We've had very good success working at these problems. I'm very, very confident that we're going to be able to handle these logistics. Joe, you want to talk about sand bottlenecks?", "Joseph R. Albi", "As far as the logistics, I mentioned that we plan well in advance with crews and what have you and we've probably increased our crews from three to five here in the next few months and we've already got the crews lined up with our providers. So I don't see any issues there. Our batteries are constructed in quick fashion along with the fracs and so forth to getting the wells online. Unless of course we have any issues fracking the wells or what have you, we see no delays there.", "From what I understand about the sand build issue, the Permian right now is directly related to rail, which is directly related to weather. And we're seeing, from our guys' standpoint, it's kind of being a relative hiccup and the sand that we've already procured in advance of our upcoming operations should not be affected at all by that. If it were to continue, then we'd probably see a slight problem.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Yes, as you said, we haven't heard what remarks Halliburton made this morning, but we've had a lot of conversations with them about the short-term hiccup and it's not giving us any material concern. But go ahead.", "Arun Jayaram", "I was just going to say, did that have any impact on your 1Q completion count? Sounds like the answer is no.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "No.", "Arun Jayaram", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "Good morning and congratulations on the quarter and all these multicenter projects coming up. I wanted to ask you with regard to Slide 13, are you at liberty to say how many new locations have been created by the successful Western Culberson Upper Wolfcamp results, of if you prefer, can you talk about how many acres this might open up for further exploration?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. First off, we're very, very pleased with those drilling results on the western side of Culberson County. The deliverability from those wells is just incredible. And furthermore, the yield content has been quite frankly a little bit higher than even we anticipated. So, they are generating outstanding rate of return results. I think what that's done, that drilling has kind of given us greater confidence now that the vast majority of that Culberson position looks extremely profitable from a development go-forward basis for the Upper Wolfcamp.", "Now, in terms of what this development look like across the breadth of all of that acreage, we recognize there's variations there, so no one-size-fits-all, but I can at least say with confidence that the minimum average number of wells in Upper Wolfcamp will be at least eight, if not more than that, across the breadth of all that acreage. Now in some places it will be even more and some maybe a little less, but certainly over the vast majority of that acreage, there will be at least eight wells per section on average developed there. That's kind of what the pilots are leading us to now.", "I will point out, what will change that for us is we are currently testing additional shallower landing zones in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson. We have a number of wells now that we have landed, and what's called the X and Y sands which sit right above the very rich shale part of the Upper Wolfcamp. Up until recently, we've put all our wells in the shale itself, but now we've moved even higher, and as we continue to watch those results, if we get strong encouragement, then that alone may increase the number of wells we can do just in terms of adding another bench. That is something that we'll be monitoring through the year and certainly adjusting our plans if those results are encouraging.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "So, we didn't answer your question. We don't publish well counts but that whole area between the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp is just amazingly prolific. John talked about spacing the Upper Wolfcamp, our Animal Kingdom test 14 wells in the Lower Wolfcamp. Those are independent zones. We can develop one and come in years later and develop the other, and there's not a concern about [fairness] [ph]. So, it's just an absolutely wonderful arena and we can drill 2-mile laterals at will. There's discussion about even testing a 3-mile lateral there. So, we'll be working out here for decades to come.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "Actually I appreciate your answer a lot. I thought there was plenty of good color there. I just want to make sure I understood the last part that John was talking about. Are you saying that you're testing the XY in Culberson?", "John Lambuth", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "A lot of the XY testing that I've seen has been further the east.", "John Lambuth", "Yes, it has. And we have, per experience of our other drilling in other parts of the basin as well as other operators, we are very intrigued with that section. Thus, we have moved up into it with a number of tests and hopefully in the coming releases I'll be able to talk about those wells. So, we'll see.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "Yes, we'll look forward to those results. If I could just as a follow-up ask a broader question, when I look at a slide like Slide 28 for the Shelly spacing test and you've talked about that in response to an earlier question, I'm just trying to understand, are these and of course other tests elsewhere, are these sort of iterative exercises in highly similar geology or does an eight-well test in one place and a 12-well test in another already illustrate a view that some of the acreage is more likely to support additional wells versus other acreage?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. First off, obviously we've done a lot of drilling development in the Woodford Shale, and so I think we have a pretty good understanding in terms of, for instance like our latest Clyde Copeland results, we learned a lot from that in terms of what ultimate spacing might be. But the reason you might look at a Shelly and ask yourself, why they are doing 8 and 12, testing both in one pilot, it's simply as we move to the south, we are dealing with a little bit different thickness, a little bit different in terms of pressure regime, and even a little bit different in terms of hydrocarbon content.", "So, as much as we're confident in what that spacing will look like, we still need to test kind of some of the [in-member] [ph] balance of it, then we have greater confidence when we do go full development on the acreage. So that's why you go out with a Shelly type pilot, just to kind of reconfirm our expectation for the rest of that Lone Rock acreage.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We had a lot of debate on this. We wanted to try a little tighter spacing because of our really interesting results in our Clyde Copeland test. Our Clyde Copeland test was testing 16 and 20 wells per section, little thicker part of the Woodford, and we also discovered in our Clyde Copeland test a really meaningful result when we stack/staggered for the low Chevron pattern in our wells.", "So, it was really based on that result that we wanted to just go a little bit tighter in Shelly, but it's not thick enough there to do the stack/stagger, so we kind of just said, we'll just try a little tighter, we'll do 8 and 12. We call these things pilots. They are really development projects. We're just going to try some things along the way and continue to learn.", "John Lambuth", "If I could real quick, if you look at Slide 27 in fact, we show the updated Clyde Copeland results and you will now see that indeed the 20 well spacing wells are even starting to separate themselves over time, and again, that's that learning of staggering within that thick Woodford Shale. That was a very important learning for us and something we're going to incorporate in future development projects in the Woodford where we have sufficient thickness to do that.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "Right. This is really great color. I guess what I'm getting from this is, this project really is unique and that goes in line with what you just said that these are really development projects. And also, if I can just add as a follow-up, you mentioned that you're doing some science in Shelly and it sounds like the reason for doing that is because there is actually several different variables that you're trying to test. Is that the way to think of it?", "John Lambuth", "Yes, you can think of it that way. One of the biggest outcomes that also came from Clyde Copeland is, we did deploy what we call surface micro-seismic, and we learned a lot from that in terms of our efficacy of our frac design, the interaction between individual wells and a development like that, and we felt it was crucial that we deploy the same type of science with that first pilot down at Lone Rock.", "We really think that getting that done now early, we're going to learn a lot about how best to for example the cadence of which wells to complete first within a major developed section, we are zipper-fracking but then there's things we look at in terms of the staggering of where we are in the bore hole. There's a lot we've learned by having that science out there, and as I mentioned, we've decided to get the best benefit out of that pilot, we'll do that which is one frac crew.", "Jeffrey Campbell", "Okay, great. Thanks. I appreciate. Always learn something on these calls, that's why I look forward to them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Portillo from TPH. Please go ahead with your question.", "Matthew Portillo", "Just a quick follow-up question in regards to service cost inflation. Are you currently baking in benefit from the acceleration of use on zipper fracs and then sourcing of regional sand, or does that potentially help mitigate some of the cost inflation as you move into 2018?", "Joseph R. Albi", "This is Joe. I'll take a stab at that. To the extent, and John can jump in to the greater percentages that we'll come at on wells, in particular in the Wolfcamp we'll grow our first well and build a battery that is not only going to accommodate the first well but plan for up to seven additional wells on that battery.", "So when I quote a Wolfcamp cost range, you could assume that the first well is probably going to be on the upper end of that range and the additional add-on wells would be on the lower end of that range. The economies of scale that you see there are reduced battery cost and then those add-on wells you are usually growing multiple number of wells, so that's where you can see some cost gains or cost benefits, excuse me, associated with zipper fracking and water sourcing. So, yes, to the extent that the inventory of wells that we have in our budget are add-on wells, they are going to reflect those costs, and if it's a first well, it's going to reflect the other cost.", "The sand sourcing part of your question, no, the benefits from sand sourcing are not in the equation yet. We think we're right around the corner from having some in place there that could have sizable cost benefits to us.", "John Lambuth", "I'll follow-up with Joe. The only thing I would add is, what we're representing new, as Joe said, our go forward expectation for this possibility today. I mean we crude up [indiscernible] as best we can to represent what we think we'll be spending per well. But I will tell you, in terms of some of these plays, Meramec in particular, we are looking long and hard at our current frac design and looking at in fact some of our offset operators and asking ourselves could we perhaps get similar results with maybe a change, a systematic change in design, it may actually save a little bit on the cost side.", "I think we're at that part in the Meramec where, and let me be clear, we're extremely pleased with our Meramec program over the course of the latter half of 2017, now we're at that point we're saying, okay, are there some tweaks we can make to the design that may pull back the cost a little and still get still superior returns, and that's something that we're discussing right now internally.", "Joseph R. Albi", "Are increased costs baked into our capital budget plan? The answer is, yes. And it's reflected, you can do simple math and just look at the cost increases that I quoted for the Meramec program as well as the Wolfcamp program and do some back of the envelope calculations to see that those represent a fair portion of the capital budget this year. With sand sourcing, through the efficiencies John is talking about, it's our intention to get those costs down and keep our productivity where it is.", "Matthew Portillo", "Great. And then as my follow-up just a quick two-part question I think for John. One, we noticed that you guys are adding some incremental activity to Ward County in 2018 and I was wondering if you could provide any color on results from last year and how you're thinking about that asset moving forward? And then two, just a quick follow-up on the XY, obviously a new target that you're testing, do you already have results in hand and do you have any thoughts around just the liquids yields on that asset in Culberson?", "John Lambuth", "In regards your second question, I'm not going to really comment on that because it's still early on the flowback of the wells, so we'll just have to wait and see. As to the first part in Ward, we do have two wells on production now and we are learning a lot from that. There are a couple of comments I'll make.", "There is always a concern on our part that with that existing layer of Third Bone wells, how would new wells interact with that. I think we're getting more confident now that we can land in that upper part of the Wolfcamp and achieve pretty good results and not have a detrimental effect on those Third Bone Spring wells, that's been a good outcome.", "We're getting better at understanding one of the things in Ward is \u2013 one of the things I look at is just water cut that's a huge component to the returns. I think we're getting a better handle on our expectation there. And then quite frankly the thing that's helping us there are a lot of competitor wells that have come on recently, some outstanding wells that are quite frankly very close to our existing position.", "So we're very excited to go out there and test some of those Upper Wolfcamp landing zones nearby some recent competitor wells that look pretty attractive to us. So we have a number of, I think it's around four or five wells that I think we'll be drilling this year in Ward, scattered throughout the year as we continue to test across our acreage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Deckelbaum", "Tom, I wanted to ask because you highlighted the progress you made in 2017, how you think about creating value for shareholders as you look into 2018 with more of these larger projects? You highlighted in the release I think a lot of, you've talked about in the past, retaining efficiency gains. With the move to larger pads and a greater contribution in the Permian, do you still see the efficiency gains holding on sort of a per well basis or cycle time as relative to 2017, are you factoring in perhaps some expanded cycle times on a sort of per well basis as you kind of go to more of these large projects?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "There's a lot in your question, David. When it comes to efficiency, a course \u2013 we quickly want to bring that conversation to rate of return. These large pads we think generate superior rates of return. We think long laterals and our pad development gives us some efficiencies or facilities to generate outstanding returns. But there is the timing delay and we study that hard as to do we want to do these big projects or do we want to split it up into smaller projects and get the production on faster.", "There are a lot of elements to that problem, one of which is well-to-well interference. So, you really have to understand what happens to the boundaries of that project if you split it up into smaller pieces. But we're fairly confident that our program as crafted is generating great returns. That's our lands. I mean I'm a broken record here, but production is interesting but full-cycle returns, modeling in production delays, modeling in the capital lag between first investment and first production, that's all baked in when we look at our returns and we're very confident that the program as designed is generating our optimum returns. You want to comment on that, John?", "John Lambuth", "No, I absolutely agree. I think we have put a lot of effort, as Tom alluded, to making sure that some of these developments aren't too big. I mean that is one lesson we learned from our Woodford development where we get out there and do six contiguous sections of development. The time lag is not something we like, and it exposes you in a way over the course of a year plus. So, we've worked hard.", "For instance, most of these developments in the Upper Wolfcamp that we're talking about, in Culberson and Reeves, typically are half section size is what we're doing. You're thinking six to eight wells each of them. And so, we've made that adjustment.", "Again, I would like to think especially \u2013 I'm not making any comment on 2019 here, but as we get to more and more of those types of developments and that becomes a regular part of our routine, I don't think you're going to see this type of lumpiness or end of the year. I think there are some other mitigating factors, as I alluded to earlier, that has pushed more of the production to later in this year because of some of the things I talked about. I think on a go forward basis, I think the cadence would be you'll see more of a normal production increase off of these individual projects we do as we do more and more of them.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "But you know, David, I really salute your question because we debate this constantly internally, and let me give you a very quick example. Where we know we're going to have larger development on the section, particularly in the Delaware basin, we'll go ahead and pre-build the facility, the flowback facility, to accommodate more wells. We may initially have one or two wells coming in but we'll go ahead and build the facility to be ready to accommodate additional six or so additional wells.", "And we're asking ourselves, is that the prudent thing? I mean our first pass on that was, so yes, that's a smart thing because you know you're going to come back in. But I will tell you, our operating group, rightly because I said at the outset, our rate of return discussion permeates our culture, and they are asking that question as maybe that's not the right approach, maybe smaller facilities that we build will be needed as a better investment of capital. So, these are great questions and I think any good operator ought to constantly be debating this internally, as we do.", "David Deckelbaum", "Sorry to throw in such a loaded one towards the end of the call.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We didn't even bring in the midstream. You don't want to give us an opportunity to talk there.", "David Deckelbaum", "My only follow-up, I guess something lighter, on the Woolfolk/NIB, you commented I think in your prepared remarks, John, that you're changing your cadence of completion as enhanced results. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you were describing there?", "John Lambuth", "Sure. I think the biggest difference there is we recognize \u2013 there is a big difference, and when you talk about a Woodford Shale relative to a Meramec which is more of a silty interval and how they frac, and what we've learned is when you're in that type of development where you have both Woodford and Meramec opportunity, in particular you want to frac the Woodford well first. It needs to go first, it needs the chance to have every chance to break that rock. And then you can follow-up with the Meramec, and that was really one of the things we were testing, as we have with a couple of other tests, and that seems to be leading to very good results for both the Woodford and the Meramec wells. So we're very pleased with that outcome. That really is shining a light on that 14-10 area where we're looking at it as a major future development area for us in the coming years, and as well there are just some really outstanding results for us.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "And also we're plugging here for our science, because we had a lot of history out here and our conventional wisdom and our experience led us to exactly the opposite conclusion. And it was because of some science we were collecting on micro-seismic data and some really heads-up curious behavior on a couple of our geo-scientists that they noticed the phenomenon that at first we looked at and we thought, could that be right, because it was absolutely not what we expected, it led us to do some further testing and it is a lifetime success in understanding of the right way to develop these reservoirs.", "John Lambuth", "And it's absolutely critical for us, I want to emphasize this that the 14-10 area in particular is unique in that you have wonderful thickness in the Meramec that we are absolutely convinced at a minimum you get two benches to develop, but you also still have sufficient thickness in Woodford to generate superior, very good return. So, it's one of the few areas across that whole STACK play where you have thickness in both that leads to that co-development and we're very excited about that for future drilling opportunity for us.", "David Deckelbaum", "Thanks for the comments, guys, and your responses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Nelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Nelson", "Congrats on the quarter and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just more couple of housekeeping type questions. There were I guess a bit more cryptic comments on oilfield service cost inflation and kind of how we can back into it. I guess if I look at the well costs that you guys have up year-on-year, it's in that kind of 10% range. So is that kind of what you're saying is baked into, just flat from here is kind of what's baked into the 2018 guidance or can we get a little bit more color on that?", "John Lambuth", "This is John. From a simple standpoint, if we've bumped up our midpoints for the Meramec program and the Wolfcamp program by 10%, if you just take the number of wells that we're quoting for each of those programs, you'll get to a number. We really didn't kind of look at the budget and say, okay, what do we want to bake in for inflation and then put a top level adjustment in there. We looked at what we thought the actual cost ranges were based on the frac designs for each one of these type wells and we're kind of brushing over the complexities of the total well cost associated with frac design, build for one, plan for four, build for one, plan for eight, and all the other implications that Mark and I looked at the back of the envelope calculations yesterday and thought maybe it's somewhere around $75 million to $80 million, if you look at what it represented as compared to what we would have done three or four months ago.", "Joseph R. Albi", "The only other comment I'll add to that is I will tell you in particular for Anadarko where a pretty large portion of our budget is outside operated wells. We took a really hard look at 2017 in terms of the wells we participated in and they are very good return wells. We felt like we made good decisions but we also felt like that we needed to adjust that capital higher relative to what we were represented as being the expected costs. Clearly, those wells were coming at much higher, so we have adjusted in 2018 an expectation of higher capital for those individual outside operated wells.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "So, John, we took our best guess at it and certainly we're not perfect at anticipating, and Joe mentioned this local sand sourcing in Delaware, when it comes online will I think be a big help here. And then our range, I will say the high end of our range kind of anticipates a little bit of inflation. So, if we didn't see any inflation, we'd probably be at the lower end of that, just checking from here on out. So, we took our best guess.", "John Lambuth", "One other comment I'd like to make too is if you look at the midpoint for the 1-mile Woodford AFE that I quoted in the call, it's barely up at all, and even with the same inflationary pressures on service cost and proppant and basically every cost category associated with completions, while we changed our frac design. And so, especially in Meramec, I think there's tremendous potential to keep experimenting there and we can see cost reductions there. The sand sourcing can have a significant impact in the Delaware. And so, obviously our goal is to get those numbers down, but those are where current AFEs are and that's what's in our current capital plan.", "John Nelson", "That's really helpful. So, just to be clear, it's expectations of kind of flat from here is probably around the midpoint of your range and then a cushion for insulation is kind of the high end of the range?", "Mark Burford", "Correct, John, yes, so kind of the low end of the range is kind of expectation that we currently see some inflation already built in and the upper end of the range could allow for some additional inflation if we experience it, which we hope to offset with some of the operational changes we'll make with local sourcing and other maybe frac design changes. But that's right, just amongst the uncertainty of what that range could be into the future, but we have some room in our range.", "John Nelson", "Great. And then I just wondered if you can comment kind of ballpark the amount that was spent in Lea County in 2017? Seems like a pretty significant pickup and you had some of the best rock there as we've seen.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We don't have that in front of us. Mark is searching for it. It is a huge pickup because as we've said in past calls, our Delaware Basin [indiscernible] a bit on Lea County and we wanted them to understand some of the multi-pay development. They have made tremendous progress on [indiscernible] this year.", "John Lambuth", "Yes, there was a lot of drilling activity in the latter half of 2017.", "Joseph R. Albi", "About 70 million.", "John Lambuth", "Yes, but we haven't really \u2013 now we're getting to where we're completing those wells. So, we'll bear that fruit this year from the drilling activity that we embarked on at the end of 2017 in Lea County.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Did you hear that, John, it was about 70 million for basically [indiscernible] our effort this year.", "John Nelson", "That's great. All right, thanks again. Congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. This question comes from Joe Allman from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.", "Joseph Allman", "Tom, a question on free cash flow, so how much is being free cash flow positive a factor in the capital decision-making or do you really see it as an output? So, in other words, if you have the right assets and you do the right things and you have reasonable commodity prices, over time you're naturally going to spend that cash flow, partly because you build upper base at relatively low decline in production. So what I'm getting at, I'm just trying to figure out what kind of iterations you ran when you thought about 2018 spending and what are the governors, balance sheet, production growth, I mean what are some of the governors you consider?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "Thank you for that question, Joe. We do treat free cash flow as an outplay. We think that a company that has good investments, high rate of return, good operational execution, ought to be living within cash flow and generating certainly some growth. I mean it will depend on company to company. But our greatest concern is in our balance sheet metrics. You know, free cash flow, that's certainly become kind of the mantra. I will tell you, at Cimarex we look at our debt, we look at our debt-to-EBITDA, we look at our coverage statistics, and we want to be growing those over time, and we want to be over time growing our financial health.", "When we look to 2018, we had such a strong year in 2017, we looked at that cash on the balance sheet and said, why would we have that cash sitting there, and all the choices were available to us. I want to be totally clear and transparent here. We could have embarked on some modest share buyback, we could have returned that cash to the shareholders, or we could have invested it.", "That's why I said at the outset that when we looked at that, we said, look, this is a very challenging commodity environment, so we better make sure that our actual to expected results are really well calibrated, and we tore our 2017 results apart and we saw that we had tremendous repeatability, in fact we went back to 2016 and 2017 and we saw that we had great repeatability that gave us a high degree of confidence that we could hit what we aim for. And so, we said we're going to invest that cash.", "When we reported our capital plan, we reported with a plan that we would invest that cash over a couple of years, 2018 being one, and that was what went into it. Our bias is to invest that cash. We raise that money with that promise and that promise is still something we want to honor. So, that's kind of how we look at the world, Joe.", "Joseph Allman", "I appreciate, Tom. And just a quick follow-up, so you've always been about executing and focusing on rates of return and NPV and growing shareholder value. Your stock is not necessarily reflecting your successful execution. So, are you thinking about doing any different, sort of close any gap that exists between what is your Company's worth and where the stock is trading?", "Thomas E. Jorden", "We try not to pay too much attention on an hourly basis toward share price, but you can't ignore it either. I think there's some confusion out there about Cimarex. We have assets second to none, we have an organization second to none, but we are trapped in an environment where people are really questioning the basic value of the energy space and people are looking for things to worry about, and Cimarex has a foot in a couple of the camps people are looking to worry about.", "We didn't get asked today about gas price differentials. We certainly are exposed to that. But we model all of that in, and as I said at the outset, gas is only 18% of our revenue right now. So, we think we are in a pretty good shape there and we see some light at the end of the tunnel.", "I can't sit here and talk to the investment community about what they should value. I'm obviously extremely high on Cimarex and I think our track record speaks for itself. I'll tell you what we value. How we approach, how we think we can invest and add value over time, we've got a good track record, and I welcome that conversation.", "So, from time to time there will be disconnects. Right now there's this mantra around free cash flow, and I think in some sense anybody that deviates from the herd is going to be punished in the short run, but if we have a strategy that's well-crafted and we execute it well, it will get figured out in the long run.", "Joseph Allman", "Got it, great, very helpful. Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Tom Jorden, President and CEO of Cimarex, for any closing remarks.", "Thomas E. Jorden", "I want to thank everybody for your participation and I know these are challenging times. We are looking forward to a strong 2018, and I'll just say in closing that we're a very result-oriented company, we focus completely on results, and we expect you to measure us based on our results. We appreciate our fans and we appreciate our critics, and I mean that most sincerely.", "This whole conversation about value creation is a great one. We debate these things at Cimarex. I look forward as the year goes on to discuss some of the learnings from our look-back more thoroughly. We are debating changing our approach and some of the ways we measure ourselves. So, I just really want to tell you, we love this business, we love getting up every day and being challenged to be better at it, and that's our mission at Cimarex. So, thank you very much for everything you bring to us.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation.
